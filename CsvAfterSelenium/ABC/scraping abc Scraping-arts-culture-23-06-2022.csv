0,These Asian Australian women theatre makers are changing what theatre looks like and who it's for,arts-culture,"  Sydney Theatre Company and Griffin Theatre Company reshape Australian theatre with works by Asian Australian women When Merlynn Tong was growing up in Singapore she was fascinated by Australia. She recalls the images she saw in advertisements – of the ocean, kangaroos and Sydney Opera House. ""I thought everyone surfed when I moved here,"" she says. ""I lived in Perth, and all my housemates were from the country, so everyone was a farmer. No one knew how to surf and I was really surprised by that."" It's a preoccupation that she shares with the protagonist of her latest play, Golden Blood, which opens at Griffin Theatre Company at the end of June. Golden Blood's main character, named simply Girl and played by Tong, carries a toy koala under her arm and dreams of moving to Australia to study veterinary science. Tong came to Australia at the age of 21 to study theatre, after she worked in advertising for a few years in Singapore. ""I was born as an artist in Australia … Getting my whole education, my inspiration, my mentors, my collaborators – everything has been born here."" Girl gives up her dream of moving to Australia to stay in Singapore with her gangster brother – who moves in with her after their mother dies by suicide when she is 14 and he is 21. But Girl remains attached to a romantic ideal of Australia. ""It feels free there you know / Like everyone respects each other / No lies / No dark history / No oppression / Everyone gets a fair go,"" Girl tells her brother, known only as Boy (played by Charles Wu). Tong laughs: ""I think Girl maybe has done a little bit more research than the real Merlynn has. I don't think I knew the term 'a fair go' [growing up in Singapore]. I think I learned that here actually."" Golden Blood is directed by Griffin associate artistic director Tessa Leong (Wherever She Wanders) — and is one of two plays written and directed by Chinese Australian women to premiere in Sydney this month. The second is Michelle Law's Top Coat, directed by Courtney Stewart (who is incoming artistic director of Brisbane's La Boite). Their works are part of a wave of Asian Australian theatre making by women in 2022 – alongside two upcoming adaptations: Melina Marchetta's Looking for Alibrandi by Vidya Rajan (Malthouse/Belvoir), and Alice Pung's Laurinda by Diana Nguyen (Melbourne Theatre Company). ""[It feels] bloody phenomenal … We're all going up at the same time,"" says Tong. Michelle Law's Top Coat is a body-swap comedy – in the tradition of movies like Freaky Friday and the homegrown Dating the Enemy (which starred a young Claudia Karvan and Guy Pearce). In the play, Chinese Australian manicurist Winnie (Kimie Tsukakoshi) swaps bodies with one of her clients, the white TV executive Kate (Amber McMahon), after a mysterious electrical event. ""It is a story about representation, privilege and what it means to fully embody someone else's life experience,"" explains Law. ""I really wanted people from very different worlds to swap and become aware of their own unconscious biases, and their own assumptions about each other's lives."" Director Courtney Stewart stresses that the play is especially poignant after the lockdowns and enforced isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""I think having an experience where you literally have to walk in someone else's shoes provides us a way back to each other,"" she says. That call to empathy feels timely, if not urgent, at a time of ongoing anti-Asian sentiment in the wake of the pandemic – exemplified in Australia by inflammatory comments from government ministers about China. Some pundits believe that such negative rhetoric led to swings against the Coalition in electorates with large Chinese Australian communities at the election in May. Law makes the point that racism against Asian people has been part of Australian society since Asian people migrated to Australia during the Gold Rush – with a resurgence in the 90s with the rise of One Nation. ""I feel like the last couple of years has really unearthed all of the resentment that people felt towards Asian people in Australia,"" she says. Asian-born Australians make up 10.4 per cent of the overall population, according to the 2016 census. Despite this, Law says, ""you see very little Asian representation in narrative stories – you see it a lot on reality TV, but that reinforces the idea that we're good for cooking and in service roles, as opposed to being a protagonist in a life story"". ""And for me, this [Top Coat] is like a small antidote to that [narrative]."" Golden Blood director Tessa Leong has long admired the work of playwright and actor Merlynn Tong. ""[I feel] a deep love and connection with Merlynn as an artist and what she brings to the stage in her writing and in her performance,"" says Leong. Leong remembers seeing Tong pitch her one-woman play Blue Bones at an arts market in Karratha, Western Australia, after which she rushed to introduce herself to the playwright. Blue Bones went on to premiere in Brisbane in 2017, starring Tong, and won six independent theatre awards, including Best Female Actor, Best New Australian Work and Best Mainstage Production. Golden Blood is the first time that Tong has worked with an Asian Australian woman as director on one of her shows – and their similar cultural backgrounds mean that they have a kind of ""shorthand"" in the rehearsal room. ""Things to do with being a woman, and things to do with being Asian, we just have that in common already, so I don't have to explain too much,"" Tong says. In Golden Blood, Boy hatches a hare-brained plan to make money by encouraging people to invest in bars of gold. ""[Tessa and I] both had the experience of, when you're born, people give you little gold bars and things like that, and how gold and the Chinese culture sometimes is almost hand-in-hand,"" says Tong. That shorthand extends to their audience as well, who may have a richer experience in the theatre if they share Tong's background. She includes jokes in her plays that are geared to people from Singapore and Malaysia. ""As I'm performing, you can hear them laugh and it's so satisfying,"" she says. It's important to her to open up the theatre to neglected audiences – the kinds of people who don't think that theatre is for them. ""People come up to you and tell you that it's one of the first shows they've seen,"" she says. ""It's just wonderful to share that love I have obviously for people similar to me and for the craft that I love so much."" Tessa Leong is also excited to see stories about being Asian Australian – as well as stories told by Asian Australians – in theatres across the country. ""I never thought this would happen within my career, to be perfectly honest,"" she says. ""I have been very used to being the only Asian person in the room everywhere I go."" But she gives credit for this rise – or rather wave of recognition – to Contemporary Asian Australian Performance (CAAP), run by writer, broadcaster, producer and theatre maker Annette Shun Wah. ""[She] has been championing us for decades in all different ways,"" says Leong. ""I think it's easy to forget that in the 80s and the 90s, people like Annette and William [Yang, theatre maker and photographer] were making work and being renowned for that, and it's their efforts that have made this happen."" The Lotus Playwriting Project – an initiative from CAAP and the now-defunct Playwriting Australia designed to address the under-representation of Asian Australian writers in theatre – was a starting point for both Merlynn Tong's Blue Bones and Michelle Law's first play, Single Asian Female. Single Asian Female, which premiered in Brisbane in 2017 – the same year as Blue Bones – before touring Australia, was the first Australian mainstage production with three Asian leads. Law acknowledges the influence of Shun Wah and CAAP, and is pleased that young people have this wave of work by Asian Australians to draw from – and build upon. ""It's really exciting to be part of that wave that's creating opportunities for other people and creating a platform for those voices. Because I never really saw that growing up,"" she says. Top Coat director Courtney Stewart, who also gained experience through CAAP's Directors Initiative, adds: ""[That wave] is why you see so much growth, because when you see it, you can believe it. If you don't see it, you don't know that you can go and do that."" Stewart has assembled a team of Asian Australian creatives to work on Top Coat – including two people from STC's Design Associate Program for First Nations and culturally and linguistically diverse designers: Kate Baldwin as lighting designer, and James Lew as designer. They're joined by assistant director Tiffany Wong and sound designer Michael Toisuta. ""It felt really, really important that we were very considerate about who we were bringing on board to tell the story,"" Stewart says. ""We're not all the same; we all come from different Asian diasporas. I think that point of diversity is really important – the diversity within diversity."" Courtney Stewart's priority when she takes on the role of artistic director at La Boite will be centring and engaging First Nations voices and models of collaboration and creativity. ""We can only understand how we can engage with storytelling in this country if we centre the people who were here first and have been carrying on that tradition for over 60,000 years. To me, I feel like that has to be the way forward,"" she says. She intends to start by listening to First Nations creatives about their history with the company and addressing any issues. ""I want to make that a priority of engaging with that community at every step of the way as I work out what kind of AD the company needs me to be,"" she says. Tessa Leong too is one of many working towards structural change in Australian theatre. She was involved in developing advocacy body Theatre Network Australia's Equity Action Plan – an effort to embed inclusion and diversity in all areas of the industry, including in programming and leadership roles. She is also working on Griffin's Equity Action Plan. For her, the aim of structural change is to embed inclusiveness in organisations, and in artists' practices. ""I feel there's a long way to go … I think we need to work really hard to make sure that we are including everyone from the word go, and that goes across class and income and geography and background,"" she says. The first wave of Asian Australian stories on Australian stages in the 80s and 90s often explored migrant or refugee experiences, overt racism and feelings of 'otherness', says Leong. ""[Those plays were] important for making space for non-white stories being on stage and telling impressive stories of human triumph,"" she says. But now she says there's room for a wider range of stories about Asian Australian experiences. ""It feels to me that we're at a new stage of what Asian Australian art and theatre can be. ""What I'm really excited [about] now is that we're taking another step into a much more nuanced and rich conversation about what it's like to live in a contemporary world that acknowledges many different experiences of culture, heritage and ancestry."" Merlynn Tong almost didn't apply for the Lotus Playwriting Project because she didn't know if she was ""Australian"" enough. But she was encouraged by a colleague to put herself forward – a decision that kickstarted her career. Now, thinking about being programmed by Griffin, whose focus is new Australian work, she feels emotional. ""It's actually really moving for me … It's the acknowledgement that I am a part of this society too, [and] that my work matters,"" says Tong. ""It just feels like it validates my very existence.""

1,"Tom has become 'good at drawing really, really badly' and he urges everyone to try it",arts-culture,"  Tasmanian visual artist Tom O'Hern on how he became 'good at drawing really badly' Artist Tom O'Hern says he'd probably make more money heading out into Tasmania's wild areas with some oils than the art path he has chosen. Instead of mastering landscape, he said he's become good at drawing badly. ""I'd love to be out in the wilderness somewhere with a huge canvas slapping around oil paints,"" O'Hern told ABC Radio Hobart. ""But I keep trying and it just doesn't really work."" The Hobart artist is a painter, drawer, muralist and even animator — think Mambo meets Where the Wild Things Are combined with some good old-fashioned doodling. Over the past 15 years, the 37-year-old's work has become prolific around Hobart, with his quirky murals featuring at schools, in cafes, on boats, inside nightclubs, down alleys and of course — toilets. ""I reckon I've painted 30 toilets around Hobart, probably more. So many toilets,"" he said. ""I would like to paint museums but I'll take what I can get."" O'Hern believes the world is too caught up with everything having to be perfect. ""Everyone is looking at perfect things all the time,"" he said. ""Everything is printed by computers, everything is on a screen and flat."" It's the mistakes and imperfections, he says, that make life interesting. ""Everyone has forgotten that drawing has been around forever and everyone should be able to do it. ""But at some point we got self conscious about it. We get upset if something doesn't look like a photo. ""I guess I'm getting good at drawing badly."" For O'Hern drawing often feels like he is writing. ""Like when I draw a bird or something it's not like I'm trying to draw a realistic bird and get every feather right, it feels like a short hand,"" he said. ""It feels like the beginnings of new hieroglyphics and I'm discovering some sort of written language that doesn't exist yet."" Last weekend O'Hern ran a workshop titled How to draw really, really badly. But, the participants were all good drawers. ""For the ones who were starting out, I said to stop being precious about it,"" he said. ""For the more experienced ones, it's all about the paradox of becoming experienced and you get all this experience and knowledge and that can block creativity because you're coming at it from already knowing what the answer is. ""But it's better to be open and not know what the answer is."" A lot of his work is public murals, and he approaches each one differently. ""I seem to attack them in totally different ways which I'm sure freaks out clients,"" he said. O'Hern went to school at Geilston Bay High on Hobart's eastern shore and then Rosny College before art school. He's been making art since then. ""Everyone starts out really into art, it's just that most people stop being into art at some point,"" he said. He said ""compulsion and an unhealthy addiction to drawing"" has kept him going. ""I thought I'd just keep plugging away, it's a pretty good way to spend time,"" he said. Early in his career he moved to Melbourne and learnt to live very cheaply and worked out of cold, leaky warehouses. His first exhibition was in 2005 in Hobart with some other artists and was based around graffiti and street art using stencils and spray paint. ""It was a totally different thing I was trying to do then,"" he said. ""I now work much more immediately with drawing and seeing what comes out. I try not to slave over stuff as much."" He said people seemed to value how long something took to make. ""The very first thing people ask when I show some art is how long something took, and I really feel like it doesn't make it better if it took ages,"" he said. ""I'm trying to push back on that, sometimes things take me ages and sometimes they don't and often it's the things made quickly I think actually are better."" He said that can be hard to justify, but it's taken him 20 years to work out the craft. O'Hern's current solo exhibition Bum Steer at the Bett Gallery features works he produced on a ""secret island"" over a month. ""I did a drawing a day, sometimes two,"" he said. ""It was a really nice way of working. No sketches, no fixing anything up, just see what happens. ""Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't."" More than half have sold, an achievement not lost on an artist who has done the hard yards. ""I've spent so much time in really cold studios flogging myself, when I could also just be on a beach taking it easy and going for a swim,"" he said. His other major project at the moment is a commissioned public art piece for the Hobart City Council. He believes younger children make the best drawing students. ""You don't really need to tell them anything, they already know what to do,"" he said. ""I don't know when the self consciousness settles in. ""Real little kids will just let rip and it's awesome,"" he said. He takes great pleasure in seeing his daughter draw. ""I was just looking at a picture of an owl my daughter has drawn, and it's exactly what I'm trying to do,"" he said. ""It's just a big free owl that I'll spend all day working myself into something like that. ""It's perfect.""

2,The king of rock ‘n’ roll is brought to life in Baz Luhrmann's luscious biopic Elvis,arts-culture,"  Elvis review: Baz Luhrmann brings The King to life in his signature pop style, with star turns from Austin Butler and Tom Hanks On July 31, 1969, Elvis Presley took to the stage of the International Hotel in Vegas for the first time, still riding the high of his electric 1968 TV special, which had revived his flagging career. What was originally conceived of as a four-week residency at the hotel – a brand new, $60 million development, then the biggest in the world – would spin out into a seven-year stint, bracketing off the final chapter of Presley's tragically curtailed career, the theatre a witness to his descent into a state of narcotised, rhinestone-encrusted stupor. But it had started off so well: the huge theatre and a blue-sky production budget had inspired Elvis to put together a show that achieved new heights of kitschy extravagance. It's surely this Vegas-era Elvis – the jumpsuit-clad crooner, caped and spangled and accompanied by backup singers, a band, and a 40-strong orchestra – that called out to to Baz Luhrmann, himself an incorrigible showman with a bowerbird's eye for things that glitter and shine, and particularly those that are liable to break. Taken collectively, his films advance a thesis that the greatest heartbreak is reserved for the most beautiful people – and who was more beautiful than the strange, pompadoured boy from Tupelo, Mississippi, with a voice like melting butter and those impossibly lascivious hips? With Elvis, Luhrmann – whose last film took as its source material one of the signature works of American literature (The Great Gatsby, from 2016), and the film before that, the mythos of this entire nation (Australia, 2012) – gives the old bazzle-dazzle to what is perhaps his most iconic subject yet. For the story of Elvis Presley is no less than the story of rock 'n' roll, from the backwater shacks and steamy late night clubs of the American south to prime-time national television. And Luhrmann bravely takes it all in his kaleidoscopic sweep: with its often-hyperactive camerawork, the film plays as a 159-minute musical roller-coaster ride through Elvis's 42 years. You're liable to get all shook up, if not from tenderness of feeling then possibly from motion sickness. Stepping into the King's blue suede shoes (well, two-tone) is Austin Butler, a blue-eyed Californian whose previous credits are mostly limited to teeny-bopper TV. A relative unknown, he's able to disappear into the role in a way that a bigger player (like Michael Shannon, playing a paranoid, lonely King in 2016's Elvis & Nixon, for instance) couldn't – if not to the same degree as the enigmatic Michael St. Gerard, whose uncanny resemblance to Presley saw him cast in the role several times in the late 80s and early 90s. Much like Kurt Russell, the one-time Disney teen idol who bagged the lead in John Carpenter's 1979 made-for-TV movie Elvis, Butler gives a performance that should grant him entrée to the pantheon of hot young silver screen stars, as the sweet, soulful centre of this Wonka-esque confection. And it's only fitting that Elvis maketh the star and not the other way around. Even if his name doesn't hold the charge it once did, it's still undeniable that he exerted an influence that would be unimaginable in today's atomised pop-cultural landscape. There can be no bigger name on the poster than ""Elvis"". Less camouflaged, despite being packed in prosthetics, is Tom Hanks, hamming it up in a rare villainous role: the shady former carnie who went by the name Colonel Tom Parker is, as he crows in his voice over narration, ""the man who gave the world Elvis Presley"". He might just be the man who killed him, too – not directly, but via the escalating demands he would place on his client, and then by way of ensuring his access to the pharmacopoeia that, for a time at least, would make it possible for Elvis to fulfil those demands. Back in his sideshow days, before he moved into managing musical talent, the Colonel (as he tells us) specialised in the kind of attractions that elicited feelings the punters ""weren't sure they should enjoy"". The squeals that issue involuntarily from all the girls when the young Elvis shakes his hips on stage – ""Well, that's alright, mama,"" he drawls – tell Tom Parker that this kid has an act he can do something with; here was ""the greatest carnival attraction"" he'd ever seen. The story unfolds – in a prismatic fashion, zipping giddily back and forward in time – nominally from the Colonel's perspective: his wheedling narration is a bid for absolution, though scene after scene works to condemn him. The film's sidelong look at its subject evokes Citizen Kane, perhaps cinema's definitive depiction of the process by which wild success transmutes into loneliness and narcissism. Like Kane, whose dying utterance of ""rosebud"" baffled even those who were once closest to him, Butler's Elvis – Luhrmann's Elvis – ultimately remains elusive; a larger-than-life figure able to be known only through so many layers of mediation – through his gold sunglasses and the camera lens. ""This ain't a nostalgia show,"" Butler's Elvis tells the musicians assembled on the International stage during rehearsal, and they launch into a beefed-up, flourish-laden version of That's All Right, the Arthur Crudup song that had been his debut single 16 years prior. (Crudup appears in the film played by Gary Clark Jr., his sultry blues an illicit thrill for the adolescent Elvis, played by Chaydon Jay.) Tops Arts & Culture headlines. No one will be surprised to hear that Luhrmann's Elvis isn't a nostalgia show either – after all, the film is stamped with the golden insignia of the man who dressed Romeo in an aloha shirt and had a fin de siècle French courtesan sing Elton John. The musical anachronism that felt egregious in The Great Gatsby, a story that is on some level about taste, plays better here – and I say this as someone who felt a pang of dread on seeing the words ""Edge of Reality (Tame Impala Remix)"" on the soundtrack listing. It works in part because there's a discernible logic to the more outré numbers: Doja Cat's Vegas, woven into a scene of Black nightlife on Memphis' Beale Street, gives Hound Dog back to Big Mama Thornton, the first artist to record the track (played on-screen by Shonka Dukureh); Eminem's The King and I, though confined to the credits, draws a line between two white artists raised in a Black milieu, who drew on a Black idiom. But it's also because Elvis himself, once just a boy with ""greasy hair"" and ""girly make-up"" who dreamed of buying a hot pink Cadillac, always defied good taste. In his landmark 1968 TV special, he sandwiched a musical number set in a brothel between a gospel medley and a ""kung fu spectacular"". The King didn't discriminate – and it's precisely for that reason that he would come to define rock 'n' roll. Luhrmann is no Elvis Presley, but you gotta love a spirited impersonation.

3,From opium dens to artist hub: How a regional Queensland city is evolving,arts-culture,"  Maryborough warehouse transformed to house Gatakers Creative Space for booming arts scene Once known for its many watering holes, opium dens and brothels, this Queensland town is being transformed into a working space for artists. Observant visitors can still notice the signs of the wild and vibrant times when Maryborough's port provided an entry point into the state during the gold rush of the 1800s. There are a lot of pubs in Maryborough — not just one on every corner, but several on every block. Local artists have created street art that tips the hat to some of the more interesting characters from the city's golden era, including the Inspector of Nuisances and a Polish beer baron. But it's the incredible historic buildings that really hint at the money that once flowed through the streets. After years of being overlooked, Maryborough's built environment is getting a new lease on life as the Fraser Coast Regional Council (FCRC) transforms them into public spaces. ""People want to really get in touch with being creative in one shape or form,"" said FCRC senior arts coordinator Trevor Spohr. The most recent project converted the former Netterfield and Palmer warehouse into a space designed to inspire and encourage local artists, now named Gatakers Creative Space. With a clay space, print room, digital installation abilities, workshops and artisan shop, the building's renovation was practical while celebrating a time when pioneers and sailors would purchase and load supplies at the site. ""We had some architects up from Brisbane and they told us it is one of the most intact warehouses of its type in the country,"" Mr Spohr said. ""Everyone wants to move in here now."" Monumental canvases are sprawled across the timber floor in the warehouse loft and a woman is hunched over one, splashing paint in large colourful spirals. Maryborough artist Sue Mclean was the first to take advantage of Gatakers Creative Space, working on her Earth Beneath Our Feet series which celebrates microbes. Ms Mclean was overwhelmed to have access to a large contemporary space in which to paint. ""This is truly paradise,"" she said. ""I've done residencies before and they have been in small confined spaces. ""With this, you walk in and you feel like you are on the streets of Paris or New York."" Cast iron Roman columns, an ornate cedar staircase and a vaulted hoop pine ceiling — most likely sourced when timber was still cut from the World Heritage-listed K'gari Fraser Island — have all been preserved and highlighted in the space. But the biggest benefit of the makeover, according to Mr Spohr, was that local artists now had place in which to work and meet. ""That is what this space is about,"" he said. ""If you are a beginner, or an advanced artist, a professional, this space is open to anybody that wants to use it."" For Ms Mclean, having access to the space motivated her to focus on her artwork and she pointed to a broader impact on regional Queensland artists. ""High ceilings, huge walls to paint on, it's a sense of place that stimulates you to want to paint better,"" she said. ""So often art is focused on the major cities, but to have an example of support in the community, for the importance of creativity, is really powerful. ""I think this space has many opportunities for everyone."" Mr Spohr hoped the space would become a second home for the local community. But he also wanted its use to be led by residents, allowing them to decide what happened inside the building. ""People will be able to be a part of a bigger picture,"" Mr Spohr said. ""We are open to suggestions on what this space can be used for."" ABC Wide Bay will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

4,"Art gallery donor Bob Sredersas was a member of Nazi intelligence, report finds ",arts-culture,"  Wollongong Art Gallery benefactor Bob Sredersas was Nazi collaborator, report concludes A report on a major art donor to the Wollongong Art Gallery has found he was a member of Nazi intelligence during the German occupation of Lithuania in World War II. Bronius ""Bob"" Sredersas, who died in 1982 and donated around 100 art works by revered Australian artists including Grace Cossington-Smith and Arthur Streeton, has a room named after him at the gallery. After being alerted to his past by a former Wollongong councillor, an investigation was launched by the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies and the Sydney Jewish Museum. The Board of Deputies said a media report confirming Mr Sredersas was an intelligence officer with the Nazi security service was true. But a spokesperson said the organisation would not comment further until after meeting with Wollongong City Council and the investigator from the Sydney Jewish Museum later this week. Wollongong's lord mayor Gordon Bradbery also said he was aware the investigation was now complete, but could not comment on its findings until after the meeting. ""I have been briefed but I can't comment,"" he said. ""An agreement [was reached] between the Jewish museum and the council at this stage to meet, look at the content, and discuss how we represent the collection therein after. ""Just out of respect for the Jewish community, and more specifically Jewish Museum researchers, we are just waiting for that meeting. ""We have got to have that get together and then it will it be an ongoing effort on the part of both to represent that collection in a way that's respectful."" Mr Bradbery said ultimately the collection and its history would have to be narrated in a way that presents its history to the community and to the rest of the world.

5,'I dedicate her to the mothers that serve': Portrait of breastfeeding servicewoman wins Defence art prize,arts-culture,"  Portrait of breastfeeding servicewoman wins Napier Waller Art Prize for 2022 A portrait portraying the conflict between being a mother and an Army service member has won a prestigious art prize, run by the Australian War Memorial. Retired major Anneke Jamieson won the 2022 Napier Waller Art Prize for her portrait titled The Promotion. The Napier Waller Art Prize is open to all current and former service personnel in the Australian Defence Force, and is intended to encourage artistic excellence, promote the transformative power of creativity, and raise awareness of the experiences and talent of service personnel. This year's winning artwork of a servicewoman in uniform breastfeeding her child is now set to join the War Memorial's national collection. In her artist's statement, Mrs Jamieson said The Promotion was an expression of her conflict between being a mother and being a service member in the Army. ""The mother in me could never make peace with the officer I wanted to be,""  she said. ""While pregnant with our first child I planned my return from maternity leave, blind to the person I would become when promoted to mother."" ""I've always admired the leaders I've served with – they give so much of themselves for their people. When our second and third children arrived, it was evident I couldn't be both the officer I wanted to be and the mother I needed to be."" Mrs Jamieson said the servicewoman in the portrait was not meant to be her, but the work had been inspired by her own experiences and the experiences of others around her. She dedicated the portrait to all service members who are also mothers, and to their families. ""I had incredible support from my husband and Army but it didn't change my capacity to give of myself. Nor did watching friends manage the conflict with grace and determination. My choice was difficult but obvious and, in the end, empowering,"" she said. ""But she is not me. She is the woman whose career came first. She has dedicated herself to her soldiers and her service and achieved so much. Yet now, as a new mother, she has returned from maternity leave changed in ways she never imagined; this promotion might be her greatest challenge yet. ""I dedicate her to the mothers that serve; to their sacrifices and conflicted hearts and to the families who support them."" Glen Braithwaite's submission, titled Falling Flying Driving Drowning, is ink and bleach painted on a canvas made from recycled Commando comics and a shredded slouch hat, and was one of the 14 highly commended works this year. He said the piece, which is mounted on a 360-degree rotating bracket that allows any part of the painting to be the top, was an exploration of him ""unlearning unconscious biases"" surrounding post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and military service. ""I've got some unconscious biases – now conscious biases – around PTSD and trauma because I've been on operations, I've seen things, and my perspective of those things I've seen was 'okay, yeah, that was terrible', but I didn't take away any trauma from it, and yet a person standing next to me has trauma,"" he said. ""I couldn't understand why people had trauma, and it wasn't until I went: 'You know what? I need to look at it from their perspective'. ""Their perspective, their history, what they've grown up with, the cumulative effects of their upbringing, are all things that contribute to how they look at the world."" Mr Braithwaite said shredding and incorporating both his first slouch hat and Commando comics he read as a child represented his life experiences being the foundation on which he saw the world. ""I suddenly realised that I needed to incorporate my history into the canvas. I am who I am because of how I grew up and my experiences, and so that ended up being shredded and incorporated,"" he said. ""That's my acknowledgement that a person has their own experience that aren't mine, and I needed to understand that their shredded canvas is probably quite different to my shredded canvas."" He said he hoped anyone who saw Falling Flying Diving Drowning could see it as an invitation to consider other perspectives and begin examining unconscious biases they might have. ""However they do that, whatever the subject is, by looking at something from a different perspective it's going to give you a better understanding, or at least an appreciation or some empathy for what it is you're looking at,"" he said.

6,'I dedicate her to the mothers that serve': Portrait of breastfeeding servicewoman wins Defence art prize,arts-culture,"  Portrait of breastfeeding servicewoman wins Napier Waller Art Prize for 2022 A portrait portraying the conflict between being a mother and an Army service member has won a prestigious art prize, run by the Australian War Memorial. Retired major Anneke Jamieson won the 2022 Napier Waller Art Prize for her portrait titled The Promotion. The Napier Waller Art Prize is open to all current and former service personnel in the Australian Defence Force, and is intended to encourage artistic excellence, promote the transformative power of creativity, and raise awareness of the experiences and talent of service personnel. This year's winning artwork of a servicewoman in uniform breastfeeding her child is now set to join the War Memorial's national collection. In her artist's statement, Mrs Jamieson said The Promotion was an expression of her conflict between being a mother and being a service member in the Army. ""The mother in me could never make peace with the officer I wanted to be,""  she said. ""While pregnant with our first child I planned my return from maternity leave, blind to the person I would become when promoted to mother."" ""I've always admired the leaders I've served with – they give so much of themselves for their people. When our second and third children arrived, it was evident I couldn't be both the officer I wanted to be and the mother I needed to be."" Mrs Jamieson said the servicewoman in the portrait was not meant to be her, but the work had been inspired by her own experiences and the experiences of others around her. She dedicated the portrait to all service members who are also mothers, and to their families. ""I had incredible support from my husband and Army but it didn't change my capacity to give of myself. Nor did watching friends manage the conflict with grace and determination. My choice was difficult but obvious and, in the end, empowering,"" she said. ""But she is not me. She is the woman whose career came first. She has dedicated herself to her soldiers and her service and achieved so much. Yet now, as a new mother, she has returned from maternity leave changed in ways she never imagined; this promotion might be her greatest challenge yet. ""I dedicate her to the mothers that serve; to their sacrifices and conflicted hearts and to the families who support them."" Glen Braithwaite's submission, titled Falling Flying Driving Drowning, is ink and bleach painted on a canvas made from recycled Commando comics and a shredded slouch hat, and was one of the 14 highly commended works this year.

7,She brought the bikini to Australia and put the Gold Coast on the map. Paula Stafford dies aged 102,arts-culture,"  Paula Stafford, the iconic Gold Coast designer who brought the bikini to Australia, dies aged 102 Iconic Gold Coast fashion designer Paula Stafford, who introduced the bikini to Australia, has died at the age of 102. Stafford's fashion empire included swimwear, day and evening wear, and men's wear, and by 1964 it was the second largest industry on the Gold Coast behind sand mining. But when she cut her first one-piece swimsuit in half, Stafford said she had not even ""heard the name 'bikini'"". ""I called mine a two-piece,"" she said in a 2014 interview with the ABC. ""Eventually I learned to call them bikinis. It seemed to be a good marketing idea."" While the bikini was invented in 1946 by Frenchman Louis Réard, Stafford popularised the then-controversial swimwear design and put the Gold Coast on the map in the process. While she made her first two-piece for personal use, Stafford said ""people kept wanting what I was wearing"". ""So I decided it might be a good idea to have an extra income,"" she said. ""I just thought I was doing something normal that I enjoyed doing, and I was so fortunate that all the family came into the business with me."" The bikini surged to prominence in 1952 when a women wearing a Stafford design was ordered to leave a beach for being immodest. Stafford responded by sending five women wearing her bikinis to the beach in what became an infamous PR stunt. ""I never paid for publicity, the media came to me,"" she said. ""It was quite incredible."" Stafford said swimwear became ""an industry"" for her, with her business exporting bikinis to London and New York employing at least 50 women and her family members. ""It grew so rapidly that we had to build a special factory in which to put the machines,"" Stafford said. While her business started with just four machines, it ended with more than 40. The Stafford bikini became synonymous with the Gold Coast at a time the city was considered more of a beachside town. ""It was a lot of work, and time involved in it, but I was happy to do it,"" she said. ""I knew it was going to be a city. I knew it needed promotion. And Australia needed to know about the Gold Coast."" Lydia Pearson from famed Queensland fashion label Easton Pearson told the ABC in 2020 that Stafford was a pioneer in the Australia industry. ""Australia's always been cutting edge for beachwear because our lives revolve around the beach, and so there she was — making the perfect product in the perfect place at the perfect time,"" she said. Stafford was born in 1920 and studied maths, chemistry, and physics at Melbourne Girls Grammar. While she wanted to become an architect, Stafford said the headmistress advised her to pursue a ""more feminine"" career. ""Hence dress design came into the picture,"" she said. Stafford said she gave up the business in the 1990s before it eventually diminished. ""By then I was a bit laissez-faire,"" she said. ""It's no good looking back and saying 'I should have done this, I should have done that'. I did what I did and that was it. ""You can't have regrets, can you.""

8,Only Tornado GR4 on display outside the UK arrives in Perth,arts-culture,"  Tornado GR4 flown in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria goes on permanent display in Perth Perth's Aviation Heritage Museum is celebrating the arrival of a Tornado GR4 to its collection of historic aircraft after a long campaign. Royal Australian Air Force Association (RAAFA) WA head Ian Craig says the organisation began applying to get the aircraft, which the public can see from next month at the Bull Creek museum, from the United Kingdom three years ago. ""We started this campaign in June 2019 so it's been exactly three years,"" Mr Craig told Christine Layton on ABC Radio Perth. ""It's the only Tornado in the world, the GR4, [on display] outside of the UK. ""If anybody likes Top Gun, then this is the jet to come and see."" Wing Commander Erica Ferguson, head of heritage and stories for the Royal Air Force (RAF), said it was an easy decision to choose the RAAFA museum from the 63 applications she received for the decommissioned aircraft. ""When I saw how great the stories already being told out at Bull Creek were and how amazingly skilled and dedicated the volunteers and staff were there, it was quite an easy choice to make,"" she said. ""My job is to ensure the important stories of the men and women of the Royal Air Force can be told to a broad audience, and what broader audience could we get than out here in Western Australia? ""It's a real honour to bring the jet here."" Wing Commander Ferguson started her career as an air traffic controller, largely controlling the Tornadoes that were the backbone of RAF operations for more than 30 years. ""It's a multi-role combat aircraft. We had fighter variants, bomber variants, and photo-reconnaissance aircraft,"" she said. ""This one [brought to Perth] was one of the ground attack aircraft. ""They played a really important role in both Gulf wars, in operations in Afghanistan, in Iraq. ""Most recently, back in 2019, just before this aircraft was retired from service, she was participating in the operations over Syria against ISIS."" Not all decommissioned military aircraft go into museums, but Wing Commander Ferguson said it was considered essential that some did. ""It's important because it's a tool for telling the important stories of those who've flown and operated the aircraft over time."" Despite being a high-powered machine, the Tornado was not flown to Perth from the UK but disassembled and shipped over. ""In order to fly here, it would have been such an enormous cost and logistic issue with refuelling and staging through different places. It was far more efficient to bring her by ship,"" Wing Commander Ferguson said. ""She was dismantled into parts very carefully by the same skilled team who came out with me to put it back together. ""It took about six weeks on the ship, we all became ship spotters. ""Then I brought a team out of six Royal Air Force technicians who have put her back together. She's a complicated aircraft because she has swing wings, wings that can go backwards to increase the speed."" Mr Craig said the arrival of the Tornado had aroused huge excitement among the community, particularly veterans. ""We have a whole Tornado community in Australia, so many exchange pilots who actually flew our aircraft. There are a lot of technicians who worked on them in the UK,"" he said. He said it also brought the collection into a new era of reflecting on more recent wars and conflicts. ""We have one of only 17 Lancasters left in the world, we have a Spitfire, we have a Dakota, we have a Catalina,"" he said. ""Our collection is world-renowned and it's sitting here in little old Perth in Bull Creek, it's just amazing that we've got this collection here. ""What the Tornado really means is that we're moving now into a new era of more modern aircraft. ""This is the start and we've got some more aircraft coming."" The public's first chance to see the Tornado will be at a community open weekend on July 2 and 3.

10,'Calm and tranquil' Bundaleer Forest continues to inspire artists during winter solstice,arts-culture,"  Belalie Arts Society celebrates winter solstice picnic in ode to South Australia's Bundaleer Forest For 20 years, a group of artists and arts enthusiasts have met in the Bundaleer Forest, 220 kilometres north of Adelaide, to pay homage to the winter solstice. The shortest day of the year is celebrated across the world by different cultures, with rituals varying from nude beach swimming to lantern festivals and bonfires. For the Belalie Arts Society members, it was not just about the winter solstice but a chance to seek creativity in the shadows of the grand trees that marked the birthplace of Australian forestry, dating back to 1875. The group ran a three-day Bundaleer arts festival among ancient towering trees just south of Jamestown, where art and music intertwined with nature. They held an annual picnic on the Sunday closest to the winter solstice to be inspired with new ideas for the next festival, and while the festival last took place in 2013, the members still gathered in friendship. The ageing membership meant this year's gathering was indoors at the Belalie Arts Society Gallery. John Voumard said the picnics were family occasions. ""It was very much an Aussie-style interpretation — getting together over a country chop barbecue with some good wine and company,"" Mr Voumard said. ""We set up the tradition of having a fire and sitting around by the sculptures and just enjoying the Bundaleer Forest, with a glass of mulled wine, in the mist, in a Drizabone. ""The kids would wander through the forest walks after lunch, and the parents would tend to sit around the fire dreaming up big ideas about what we could do at the next Bundaleer Festival event. ""It's very calm and tranquil, and in the middle of winter with the mist and the grey clouds, it just has its own special atmosphere."" Artist Helen Pammenter, 94, spent about 25 years trying to capture the beauty of the forest. ""I would often get down there 7am or 7.30 in the morning,"" she said. ""The light in the forest changed so quickly that in one spot, you would have so many different variations of that same view. ""The colours were just beautiful first thing in the morning with the light shimmering through this huge canopy of trees, and then you have the contrast of the rich umbre of pine trees, standing near a magnificent huge white gum tree."" Mrs Pammenter said she enjoyed the stillness of the forest. ""It's the unexpectedness of it, the quietness of it,"" she said. ""The fact that I was there by myself and could really absorb the forest, and I found, as I progressed, that I needed to be outside to absorb it, and I just loved being down there. ""It's hard to get the beauty of it unless you're there. ""I wanted other people to realise what a beautiful place it was."" For 40 years, artist Cherry Wehrmann has driven through the forest to reach her home, living in the shadow of the exotic and native trees. She has also painted many scenes from the forest. ""I'm inspired by the light at certain times of the day. There's shadows and light — it's sort of mystical, I guess,"" Ms Wehrmann said. ""My grandparents used to live in Jamestown, and we used to come here for a drive when I was a child. ""I just feel really privileged to live amongst the trees. I just love it."" Jenni Frost, who helped coordinate the Bundaleer Festivals, said the winter solstice picnic was a really good wind down and debrief for the Arts Society members in the forest environment. ""Even though it was mid-winter and the shortest day and could be very cold and damp, it was just a beautiful environment in nature to do all that rethink and re-imagine what we're doing,"" Ms Frost said. ""The festival was in the forest. It blended in with that environment. ""It's a special place."" The winter solstice meetings were popular. ""I guess everyone hunkers down a little bit in the middle of winter, and when everyone else was at home, we would dare to go out and sit in the forest and warm our hands around a hot cup of tea around a thermos and talk,"" Ms Frost said. ""It made it quite unique, and it was nurturing.""

11,"This museum houses a one-of-a-kind piece of equipment, but a funding cut could force its closure",arts-culture,"  SA Water funding cuts to community-led steam museum at Cobdlogla may result in closure Funding for a volunteer-led community museum that preserves a one-of-a-kind piece of irrigation technology could be slashed in a state government budget cut. The Cobdogla Irrigation and Steam Museum in South Australia's Riverland houses a range of machinery and artefacts relating to the early days of irrigation in the region. It includes the heritage-listed Humphrey Pump, which the area's irrigators used to draw water from the Murray River from the late 1920s until 1965. It is the only one of its kind in the world that is operational, although has not been fired up in years. The museum and the pump are maintained by volunteers, with the help of about $70,000 a year in funding from state-owned SA Water. It has been 36 years since the group first came together. However, they have been advised that their funding will not be renewed. Cobdogla Steam Friends Society president Robin Bawden said the volunteers were ""really upset"" with the news. ""Over the past 30-odd years members have put in over 6,000 hours a year of voluntary work,"" he said. ""They've always tried to cut back on our funding but we didn't know they'd cut it off. ""Without continuity of funding a museum can't work. Some of our projects, like the big steam traction engine. It took us 15 years to do it and an awful lot of work."" What's your Australian Story?  The ABC has been uncovering ordinary Australians with extraordinary stories from all corners of the country for the past 90 years. Submit your Australian Story now. In a statement, SA Water said the current sponsorship agreement for the museum was clear that alternative funding would need to be sought after June 30 this year. ""We are committed to working together with the Cobdogla Steam Friends Society to explore alternate options for the future of the local irrigation and steam museum site,"" the statement said. ""We have confirmed to the society that we will provide continued financial support for the next six months while we work together to find and assess potential funding and operating models for the future."" Some of the museums attractions are heritage listed and would need to still be maintained, even if the museum were to close. Mr Bawden said finding new funding sources had been difficult. ""Times are pretty tough now, especially in the Riverland. We've looked for local sponsors but with the price of grapes right down there's not a lot of spare money floating around,"" he said. ""Without ongoing funding there is no future and it would be terribly sad if a living part of the Riverland's past was just abandoned. ""We can't even pay the insurance with the gate takings. It's a museum that cannot operate without further support."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Riverland's weekly email newsletter.

12,Ukrainian dance students find refuge in Australia's circus community,arts-culture,"  On a cold winter's day, three Ukrainian performers rush down to Sydney's Dee Why beach to take selfies, darting from the waves crashing on the shoreline. Maria, Liza and Vlada had never been to Australia before Russia invaded Ukraine. This particular day, they are celebrating singer Liza's arrival to Sydney – also her 25th birthday. ""I wake up in Australia with the ocean,"" Liza says, ""It's the best gift."" Her best friend Vlada agrees: ""It's like a film, it's like a dream."" The three dancers are among nearly 300 students from the Kyiv Municipal Academy of Performing and Circus Arts who fled the war and are now training in schools abroad. Former circus performer Jasmine Straga has been a crucial part of connecting the Ukrainian students – like Maria, Liza and Vlada – with schools across the globe. Ms Straga, from Sydney's Northern Beaches, is a board member of the World Circus Federation and part of the Global Alliance of Circus Schools. When she saw the call for help from the Kyiv academy, she knew she needed to help. ""To lose the arts in the Ukraine would be to lose hundreds of years of culture,"" Ms Straga says. Actors, illusionists, circus performers and dancing students have been billeted in schools across Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Italy and France. Ms Straga has helped to get about 200 adult circus artists out of Ukraine, and tried to keep teachers with as many students as possible so they could continue their curriculum. The Kyiv Academy's deputy director, Nina Araya, said she was amazed by Ms Straga's generosity. ""She started to connect all the schools, and after that I started to have dozens and dozens offering help,"" Ms Araya says from Prague, where she is now coordinating the students. ""This war shows that those people who we thought would be our friends do horrible things to us, and people who we never saw before personally, we never met, offer so much help."" While the academy has secured help for nearly 300 students, just as many remain in Ukraine. For some it is their choice. When Vlada heard she could come to Australia two months ago, it was bittersweet to leave her family behind. ""The day they called me and said you can come here and dance, and live here in a safe place, I was so shocked,"" she told The Drum. It has been two months since Vlada came to Australia, and her father is now a soldier fighting for Ukraine, so she doesn't hear from him as much as she would like. ""I just need to know he's alive now and everything is OK,"" Vlada said. She worries too about her mother, who lives in Zaporizhzhia, which is near Mariupol, the port city now under Russian control. ""They haven't got food in this town,"" she explains. ""Some days I am just crying and crying because it is so hard when your mum says: 'Vlada there are explosions, now it is bombing'."" Maria's mother and sister are in Poland, which they thought would only be temporary, and they are planning to return to be with her father and grandparents in Ternopil in western Ukraine. Her father has a heart condition and is unable to fight, but according to law he cannot leave the country — and he wouldn't anyway. In recent days, rocket attacks have begun near where her family lives. Each student needs extra support to deal with the trauma of what they experienced, their school leader Nina Araya said. She has heard stories of students ""walking on the street with the dead bodies"" as they left their country. ""It's not normal. We try to support them to make a family here."" That's why Ms Straga feels like a mum to the three young women in Australia, aged 19, 21 and 25. ""I was kind of on autopilot, and then when the girls came to Australia I spent a week crying because I bottled everything up for so long,"" Ms Straga told The Drum. The girls are now getting their training for free from the Lee Academy in Tuggerah. Ms Straga's crowdsourcing has raised more than $22,000 for the dancers in Australia and abroad. On top of that, she has coordinated families to pay for flights and accommodation and arrange clothing donations. The hardest part now, as food prices increase, is keeping them fed. The student performers have applied for bridging visas and will apply for the three-year Temporary Humanitarian Concern Visa, also known as the 786 visa, so they can access medical treatment. The Home Affairs Department told The Drum that 1,100 Ukrainian nationals have been granted 786 visas. Since the conflict began in February, the Department has granted 8,000 mostly temporary visas, but only 3,200 Ukrainians have arrived in the country. Vlada and Maria have been meeting new friends, exploring their new home, and learning new dance styles. ""My family is so happy that I am in a safe place and I can continue to do my dancing,"" Maria said. Maria always knew she wanted to dance and follow in her choreographer mother's footsteps. ""Even if the war ended now, dance is the last thing that Ukraine needs, but of course I come back to Ukraine and I want to teach and I want to show all my experience with Ukrainians,"" Maria said. Returning to the Kyiv Academy could be some time away. They can no longer train where they had before the war, because it has now become a makeshift hospital. But the students hope that sometime in the near future they will be able to dance together again.

14,"'We're still called natives on plaques': Colonial heritage bid needs First Nations support, but it's a long road ahead",arts-culture,"  Aboriginal voices to inform World Heritage bid for South Australia's systematic colonisation A council in South Australia's mid north is looking to enact an Aboriginal reconciliation plan as it prepares to launch a joint bid for UNESCO World Heritage listing to celebrate the state's colonial past. The Clare and Gilbert Valleys Council sits within the Ngadjuri nation, and chief executive Helen Macdonald said the bid was an opportunity to tell the whole story of colonisation with perspectives from both sides. ""The expectation is once there is a World Heritage listing, it puts you into prominence globally, it's the opportunity to be listed as a tourist attraction, particularly for those who are interested in British colonial history,"" Dr Macdonald said. ""The other major aspect that has to be dealt with is how our First Nations people are going to be incorporated into the process because the area covers the Kaurna, Ngadjuri and Peramangk nations. ""They have to be engaged and included and recognised in the process as well and they need to give permission to say that they want to participate in the process so that work has to be undertaken as well."" Quenten Agius is a Ngadjuri traditional owner who teaches local Aboriginal history and sits on the council's reconciliation advisory group, established last year. He said the bid showed there was still a long way to go towards reconciliation. ""At the end of the day, you have to be truthful about how the state was set up,"" Mr Agius said. ""It was set up as a free state but it didn't eventuate like that from the beginning. ""The issue is Aboriginal people today haven't got a voice."" Mr Agius compared the heritage bid with his efforts to protect centuries-old scar trees from being chopped down for firewood. ""They want the tokenism stuff but they don't make any commitments. None of those councils in any of those areas want to commit anything for the Indigenous people,"" he said. ""They talk about value-adding to existing infrastructure and existing businesses, and they want to be fair and equitable. Why is there no Indigenous business set up in their main streets?"" Mr Aguis said the character of the towns was judged from first impressions but there was little beyond memorials to European explorers. ""You can acknowledge the white history, but not our history, when you come into this township,"" he said. ""We're still called 'natives' on the plaques. It's the 21st century and you can't find that person's name, you can't even acknowledge that person. ""When are we going to walk side by side and acknowledge each other when we come into the towns?"" Traditional owners in Queensland are working with councils to forge a path towards reconciliation. Dr Macdonald said the council was working to improve its level of input from Aboriginal people through its advisory group. ""Quenten is right. Clare Council, indeed probably any council on Ngadjuri country, has not made substantive steps with respect to reconciliation,"" she said. ""We will have a reconciliation plan put to council in the next few months, so that is the start of taking those steps. ""Once the reconciliation committee is put in place we can move forward with having discussions about what is their perspective with respect to this World Heritage bid."" The multi-council World Heritage proposal is a consolidation of two separate attempts to have South Australia's colonial planning model acknowledged on the world stage. It began in 2013 with the Mount Lofty Ranges proposal, backed by regional councils to demonstrate a successful model of systematic colonisation often known as the Wakefield system, which relied on settlement fees and no convict labour. In 2018, the Adelaide City Council initiated its own colonial heritage potential bid centred on the city's grid and parkland encircled design. The two projects are now joined under the working title of Adelaide and its Rural Settlement Landscapes, with its core narrative stating it to be ""the most complete realisation of British colonial settlement planning in the world.""

16,'We're not all country': The new generation of boot scooting line dancers,arts-culture,"  Line dancing is gaining popularity in Darwin with a new generation of dancers It's a dance commonly associated with cowboy boots and country towns, but the age-old pastime is starting to find its way into the hearts of even the most hardened city slickers. In Darwin, the Top End Mustangs have been line dancing around the Northern Territory for more than 20 years, and the group's secretary Carol Penglase said it was growing in popularity. ""There are around three to four clubs here and the dancers mix between clubs,"" she said. ""We have members as young as eight to as old as 80, so there's quite a span there of people who line dance here."" This month, they partnered with best friends Claire Harris and Kate Strong, who've quit their jobs to line dance across the country and raise money for rural and regional charities. ""We've got one different charity for each state that we're going through and they're all rural focused or help rural people, but they're all a little bit different,"" Ms Harris said. The pair have travelled around Queensland and through parts of South Australia, before zipping up the Stuart Highway from Alice Springs to Darwin, stopping in at iconic Territory landmarks along the way. ""It's just so much fun and we're getting to meet incredible people,"" Ms Strong said. Line dancing consists of basic moves that can be mixed and matched to create different dance routines. ""You have grapevines and rocking chairs and your toe heel stomps and those sort of things,"" Ms Strong said. ""You have all of your basic moves and you can put them all in a different sequence or in a different speed, there's so much variety in all of them."" Ms Strong said the flexibility of line dancing makes it accessible for dancers of all abilities. ""It can be as easy or as hard as you would like it to be,"" she said. ""You don't have to have any previous training or dancing experience because it's one that's easy to get involved in and you can take it as far as you want."" Ms Strong and Ms Harris want to break the demographic stereotypes associated with line dancing and get more young people involved. Ms Strong said she hoped their road trip would help get more young people onto the dance floor. ""Most of the line dancing groups that are currently around are older ladies that are typically retired,"" she said. ""We're really wanting to break that and share the love of line dancing for all, because everyone can get involved and have absolutely the best time with it."" Carol Penglase from the Top End Mustangs said the benefits of line dancing were endless. ""[It's good] for your physical fitness, for your health and wellbeing, for that socialising and community aspect,"" she said. For older dancers who may be experiencing dementia, she said line dancing could help them exercise their memories. ""We have quite a few dancers who've been dancing for 20 years,"" she said. ""It has a lot of benefits, but really it's all about fun and community and making friends."" Ms Harris and Ms Strong were drawn to line dancing because of its versatility, surprised by how perfectly the routines fit to a wide genre of music. ""There are 128,000 types of line dances,"" Ms Strong said. ""And every dance varies so much."" Ms Penglase from the Top End Mustangs said people might associate line dancing with just country music, but the routines can be performed to pop and even rock and roll. ""We dance to a lot of new songs that are out on the radio, like Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits, Shivers,"" she said. ""We're not all country, the genres are mixed right across and it draws different people in because they go 'ooh I like that song'."" She said the pair's road trip was great way to raise the profile of line dancing across the country and to young people. ""We're very humbled to Claire and Kate for asking us to be part of it.""

18,The biggest moments from the 2022 Logie Awards,arts-culture,"  A win for representation and a 'cheating' skit were among the memorable 2022 Logie Awards moments After a three-year break, the Logie Awards came back in 2022 — and with a bang. These were the biggest moments of the night: Australian of the year Dylan Alcott and ABC presenter Tony Armstrong presented the award for Most Outstanding Sports Coverage. Both Armstrong and Alcott spoke about what it meant for them to be up on that stage. Alcott spoke about this year's event being a win for representation. “To be honest, having an Indigenous man and a guy in a wheelchair up here, on commercial TV …"" ""We’ve got a long way to go to get representation, but it’s massive,” Alcott said. Legendary sports broadcaster Bruce McAvaney received a standing ovation from the audience at the Gold Coast Convention Centre when he was inducted into the TV Week Logie Hall of Fame. ""It is undeniable that so many of Australia's most iconic sporting moments have been made much more memorable by the words of Bruce McAvaney,"" said former AFL player and coach Leigh Matthews, who presented the lifetime achievement award. Accepting the industry-voted award on stage, McAvaney said: ""I am emotional but my voice is not as strong as it should be tonight. ""I wondered how I'd feel tonight when I walked up here. I feel a lot of love actually and a lot of warmth."" In 2017, McAvaney revealed he was diagnosed with leukaemia two years previously after an abnormal blood test. Last year the 69-year-old stepped back from AFL commentary ahead of the 2021 season but said he wasn't reconsidering retirement. Ms Wilkinson's interview with Brittany Higgins won the Logie for Most Outstanding News Coverage or Public Affairs Report. She said that, after 40 years in journalism, it was ""by far"" the most important work she had ever done. ""I knew it from the very first phone call I had early last year with a young woman whose name she told me was Brittany Higgins,"" she said. ""Four incredibly intense, sleepless weeks later, when our story went to air, the entire country knew the name Brittany Higgins."" ""This honour belongs to Brittany."" While presenting the award for Most Popular Reality Program, Australian comedy duo Hamish Blake and Andy Lee spoke of how voting in the Logies ""cannot be rigged"" as Australians can only vote once. The duo then launched into a skit that blamed Karl Stefanovic for cheating in the Gold Logie race. Blake and Lee brought out a young boy Oliver who claimed he had been kept in a room for hours, forced to vote repeatedly for one of the nominees. ""Oliver, who is the person who made you do this?"" Blake and Lee asked. ""It was Karl Stefanovic,"" Oliver responded. Blake and Lee asked how many votes he was forced to send in, to which the boy replied ""thousands"". This category opened with a tribute to Neighbours, production of which will come to an end later this year. Natalie Bassingthwaighte said many people who have won this Logie have come from the show. However, this year's award went to ABC Breakfast's Armstrong, who took the opportunity to thank his mum. ""There's a lot of people I need to thank,"" he said. ""The old cheese, my mum, she is a superstar. [She] has done everything for me and has been a superstar and I would not be up here without her, so a big thanks to her. ""Please give her a clap, she will love it back home."" Here is the full list of winners for the Logie Awards 2022 In his true style, Blake brought his funny antics into his speech. ""This counts for three. Oh my God. That is — I've won one two years ago. To win four of these is … that's too much."" Earlier in the evening, Blake also won the inaugural Bert Newton award. The late Bert Newton's wife, Patti Newton, announced the winner for this award.

19,"Queer drama about teen male friendship wins $60,000 Sydney Film Festival prize",arts-culture,"  Belgian film Close, about teen male friendship, wins Sydney Film Festival's top prize Belgian director Lukas Dhont has won Sydney Film Festival's $60,000 Sydney Film Prize for ""audacious, cutting-edge and courageous"" film for his queer teen tragedy Close, about a powerful friendship between two 13-year-old boys that is ruptured by their transition to high school — with tragic results. The film, which screened in Sydney off the back of winning the Grand Prix (second prize) at Cannes, was praised by the Sydney Film Festival jury as ""a tender, moving, powerful film. A mature film about innocence"". Dhont's film won against a field of 11 other films that included Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner Utama, Berlinale Golden Bear winner Alcarràs, three films straight from Cannes' Un Certain Regard line-up, and two Australian films: Archibald Prize-winning artist Del Kathryn Barton's feature debut Blaze, and Goran Stolevski's witch fable You Won't Be Alone. It was a line-up notable for stories with teen protagonists: a boy searching for his father, in Mexican drama The Box; a 12-year-old girl whose imagination becomes a tool for surviving trauma, in Blaze; an under-loved nine-year-old who blossoms over summer with relatives, in Irish-language film The Quiet Girl; and the gaggle of children and teens enjoying one last summer on their family's land, in Catalonian drama Alcarràs. Presenting the award at Sydney Film Festival's closing ceremony on Sunday evening at the State Theatre, the jury, led by actor/director David Wenham, said Close ""displayed a mastery of restraint, subtle handling of story, astute observations and delicate attention to finer details"". Close is highly personal to Dhont, who found inspiration when he returned to his primary school and re-examined his early male friendships and sexuality: ""The memories came flooding back of going to school at that time, when it was really tough to be my true, unfiltered self,"" he said in press notes for the film. In Close, we meet 13-year-olds Léo (Eden Dambrine) and Rémi (Gustav De Waele) on the cusp of secondary school, and experience their powerful, intimate but uncomplicated friendship — then watch as this bond is strained, and ultimately ruptured, under the scrutiny of their peers. Accepting the award via a video message, Dhont said: ""We wanted to make a film about friendship and connection after a moment in time where we all understood its necessity and power."" The film will be released in Australia by Madman Entertainment. This year's Documentary Australia Award was awarded to Luke Cornish for Keep Stepping, which takes viewers into the street dance subculture, through the prism of Australia's flagship annual competition, Destructive Steps. In their statement, the jury, led by Documentary Australia CEO Mitzi Goldman, said: ""The community showcased in the film have much to tell us about family, identity, belonging, hard work, testing our limits, love and acceptance. The film is sensitively crafted, beautifully shot and edited and its characters mesmerising. This is a generation that have something to say and are asking us to listen. It is far more than a film about the dynamic subculture of street dance."" 2022 represented a 'return to normal' for Sydney Film Festival, which was online-only in 2020, and postponed twice in 2021 due to COVID-19, before opening in November — initially with a reduced audience capacity of 75 per cent. This year, the festival opened in June as normal, with full capacity audiences. While masks were worn by all venue staff, they were not mandatory for audience members. While last year's festival was a hybrid of in-cinema and digital screenings, this year was in-cinema only. Artistic director Nashen Moodley told ABC RN's The Screen Show: ""The turnaround from November to June is extremely tight for us; usually we have a year between festivals."" But he said the festival is considering bringing back an 'at home' component for future editions: ""We know what the technology can do; we appreciate it a great deal. And I think looking forward, we'll see where we can best employ it for the festival to connect with audiences. ""At the same time, we know very clearly from our audience research, from our own experience, that the fundamental thing about the Sydney Film Festival — and I think all film festivals — is that in-cinema experience; that is best not just for the audience, and for the filmmakers and for the festival, it's [also] in terms of how the business works. ""And whereas [previously] you had an eagerness for people (rights holders, filmmakers, sales agents, distributors) to explore this technology, as cinemas reopen there's greater reluctance to put films online.""

22,Pilbara stalwart remembers famous furry friend Red Dog,arts-culture,"  Pilbara stalwart remembers famous furry friend Red Dog WA's Pilbara region is known for its blue sky, red dirt — and Red Dog. The iconic stray roamed the state in the 1970s, hitching rides and travelling throughout the region and even as far south as Perth. And although he died more than four decades ago, Red Dog is still alive in the hearts of locals, including Pilbara stalwart Ian Waterstrom — who has lived in the mostly transient region for almost 50 years. It's believed Red Dog was born in Paraburdoo in about 1971 and touched so many lives he became the subject of a book and globally renowned film. One of the rides he hitched was the workers' shuttle bus that Mr Waterstrom would use to travel from Karratha to his job in the burgeoning resources industry. For Mr Waterstrom, his strongest memory of the loveable dog was his pungent smell and fierce defence of his seat on the bus. ""He smelt terrible. I don't think anyone ever washed him … you couldn't get near him,"" he said. ""You could not sit next to him. He'd bite you. He was a really angry bit of gear."" Ultimately the workers' affections for Red Dog shone through, and he would be allowed to sleep in the workshop, where he had memorised all the best cool spots to sleep away from the Pilbara heat. ""He knew where all the air-conditioned areas were,"" Mr Waterstrom said. ""He'd just curl up on the floor and sleep. We'd bust open a bag of rags, and he'd make a nest, and he'd sleep for a couple of hours."" Mr Waterstrom's connection with Red Dog continued later in life when he had a role in the 2011 movie as an extra. ""They used to rub you down with this red dust … [made of] ochre or something, and they'd paint you with all this stuff to make you look like you've been working all day,"" he said. Mr Waterstom first arrived in the Pilbara 49 years ago. He was attracted to the red dirt for work and drove more than 4,100 kilometres from Melbourne to Paraburdoo. He later relocated to Karratha. The Ashburton Shire, which includes Paraburdoo, celebrated its 50th birthday this month and Mr Waterstrom said the region had undergone vast changes since he arrived. ""We lobbed there in summer, so that was a bit scary,"" he said. ""Some houses had no fence at all and no lawn, just dirt. You look at it now, and you've got amenities we never ever had.""

23,Acclaim and international exposure for Townsville's thriving street art scene,arts-culture,"  Thriving Townsville street art scene 'on par' with world's best, says public art researcher It may seem unlikely to some but this North Queensland city is fast emerging as a hot spot on the international street art map. Buildings in Townsville's CBD are adorned with eye-catching art that has transformed the city into a head-turning public gallery. The colourful works form the basis of a Griffith University investigation into how public art is used to drive urban regeneration and boost social capital. Researcher Dr Tony Matthews assessed 26 artworks that form part of a public art walking tour. ""They were right on par with anything you would see internationally in terms of quality of art, quality of delivery, quality of materials, choice of location,"" he said. ""Townsville is way out in front."" The city was one of three regional Queensland locations picked for the investigation, which involved researchers interviewing key producers of public art, elected officials, urban planners and public art specialists. The findings have been published in the international journal Cities, which Dr Matthews believes will thrust Townsville onto the international stage. ""The major importance of this research is not that it looks at public art, but also that it looks at regional cities in Australia that are doing really well and are coming up and should be of attention internationally,"" he said. ""We were very happy to give Townsville the nod as a place that has been quietly impressing me in a number of ways for a number of years."" But it hasn't happened overnight. When Townsville artist Garth Jankovic arrived in the city in 1992 the scene didn't exist. ""I was pretty much the OG [original gangster],"" he said. ""I just started painting street art graffiti in probably illegal spots in the early days. ""The council came on board in the late '90s and started actively participating and nurturing the scene."" Working alongside friend Nicky Prior, Jankovic pioneered combining First Nations scenes and Euro street styles to create the mural Girroogul and the soap tree, which forms part of the street art walking trail. ""If you go to Melbourne, it's very European graffiti style,""Jankovic says. ""Townsville's a bit more, you know, you have a bit more understanding of the demographic [and] if you combine street art and graffiti with traditional stuff, you win over a lot more people."" The 48-year-old has been so instrumental to the scene, his portrait features on the art trail, painted by mentee and good friend Lee Harnden. ""I don't go there often because it spins me out,"" Jankovic said. The Griffith University study identified a variety of figurative and abstract styles and vivid colours. Dr Matthews said, considering the quality of the works, more could be done to promote the trail as a tourism drawcard. ""I know the city has a walking guide for the public art trail and it's quite popular with tourists and has brought tourists in,"" he said. ""But I think it could market itself more aggressively as a regional cultural hub, attracting those kinds of short-stay visits using public art in part as one of the attractors."" Townsville City Councillor Liam Mooney said it was an ongoing project. ""We are always looking for diverse street artists to work with and for property owners within our CBD and beyond to have a canvas for these artists to work on as well,"" he said. Councillor Mooney welcomed the Griffith University study findings. ""It legitimises what I believe — that we should be spending our time, our effort, our resources on art spaces,"" he said. Jankovic said the Townsville street art scene reflected the character of north Queensland. ""It really makes people that come there think that it's not just an outback town, or a sea town or a tropical town,"" he said. ""It's a bit of a melting pot of all those things put together and I think the street art really captures that.""

25,Many in this group didn't think they could write. Now their work is part of a newly published book,arts-culture,"  Clunes Writers' Group celebrates first-time authors with Unmasked: An Anthology When Robert Sidler joined the Clunes Writers' Group, it was with a degree of trepidation. Now he is a published author whose works feature in an anthology from Australia's famed book town. Each autumn, the tiny town, 36 kilometres north of Ballarat, is the destination for writers and readers to share their stories during the annual Clunes Booktown Festival. It seems appropriate then that there is a book that shares the stories of Clunes' own writing collective. The Clunes Writers' Group officially launched Unmasked: An Anthology at the Clunes Neighbourhood House in May. It is a collection of the group's short stories, poetry, prose and haikus from the past two years. For many of the 18 contributors, including Sidler, it was their first time as a published writer. Clunes Writers' Group convenor Patsy Skinner said people who joined the group were often surprised, not just that they had a story to tell, but also by how interested others were in those stories. ""Often, the first comment is, 'I can't really write. I'm not a writer. The wonderful thing is to see them gaining confidence,"" Ms Skinner said. When Robert [Sidler] first came to us from Ballarat, he didn't know anyone here. ""In the early days when he was coming, there weren't a lot of men either."" What actually happens to the slush pile of unsolicited manuscripts that are sent to publishers by wannabe writers? Rhonda Christian's works had appeared in an earlier Clunes Writers' Group booklet titled Write Along. However, she said, seeing her words appear in a professionally bound book that had the potential to appear in a bookshop or library gave her a real sense of satisfaction. ""It gives you a sense of validation,"" Christian said. ""I think [seeing your work in a published form] validates those thoughts and ideas because they are able to be appreciated by other people. ""As a writer, you want people to get to know who you are, and this does that."" Unmasked, as an idea, was born two and a half years ago. Members from the group were locked down like just about everyone else in Victoria, with little to no opportunity for face-to-face contact. Over the next two years, Unmasked grew into a collection of 150 individual pieces. Some are stories of 1,000 words or more. Others are poems with fewer than 20. ""We began by feeling like some of our writing [during that time] should be shared,"" Ms Skinner said. ""We wanted the opportunity to put it down in black and white, so we felt like we were really authors of our own work. ""It was also to recognise so many people's experiences [during that time] … their stories are interesting to other people."" The Clunes Writers' Group includes well-known Melbourne poet Ken Smeaton and Castlemaine Poetry Readings prize winner Gail Oliver. Others had not even attempted creative writing before joining the group. ""This bunch come from so many different backgrounds and from so many different places,"" Ms Skinner said. ""We have people who have moved [to] Clunes in the past few years from the big cities, from other states, but we also have people who have lived in Clunes all their lives and like to write about the great environment we live in. ""There are writers like Ken Smeaton who has been in the Melbourne poetry scene for many years, but there are also writers who have come along to the group with no experience and who are very unsure about it."" Sidler read his piece Once Again at the Unmasked book launch: For a moment I thought I couldn't write anymore Or was it I didn't want to anymore Either way, Words were somehow too hard to find Or put into pictures Then I looked in a dictionary Stuck my head in a thesaurus Listened to some songs Found something to write about A touch of motivation A taste for creation And once again the joy, The pleasure and the pain of writing Was upon me ""He is a writer who can put his words and thoughts down very quickly. Quite often, he will compose a poem in a matter of minutes,"" Ms Skinner said. ""His ideas and thoughts just seem to resonate with other people."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Ballarat's weekly email newsletter. Judi Palmer moved to Clunes in 1998 and joined the writers' group in 2018. She said joining a group helped get things going, but it was not the only way to start writing. ""You have to just sit down and write,"" Palmer said. ""A lot of people [in the group] write because they had a traumatic experience. Others write anecdotes from their day-to-day life. ""Take an idea from anywhere and just start writing. You don't have to be good at it, to begin with.""

26,'We wouldn't honour asbestos': Push to rename Churchill's Big Cigar,arts-culture,"  Community group says it's time for Churchill's Big Cigar to get a new name It's known locally as the Big Cigar, but locals in the Victorian town of Churchill are taking action to ensure their town monument no longer appears on lists of Australia's big things. The 32-metre-tall spire in Churchill, south-east of Melbourne, has carried the unofficial name for decades and there are varying stories surrounding its origin. According to local urban legend, the monument was built as a tribute to the town's namesake, World War II British prime minister Winston Churchill, because he loved cigars. But Churchill and District Community Association president Margaret Guthrie said that was ""actually incorrect"". The spire was commissioned in 1967 by Victoria's Housing Commission when it was planned the town would house 40,000 residences to service an expected 20 or more power stations to be built in the Latrobe Valley. The association successfully applied to Latrobe City Council to register the name ""Churchill Town Symbol"" on the Victorian Register of Geographic Names, in a bid to recognise the artistic value and origin of the monument. ""It was designed to be a beacon … It's about having information recorded for posterity if you like,"" Ms Guthrie said. Ms Guthrie said she hoped more awareness of the monument would lift its profile and the association hoped the spire's lights would also be restored. In modern times, cigars and cigarettes are not objects paid tribute to. Across the mountain ranges, the Big Cigarette, formerly a chimney in a tobacco plant, was removed in Myrtleford. Quit Victoria director Dr Sarah White welcomed the community push and said making sure people knew Churchill's town symbol was called just that – and not the Big Cigar – was important. ""I think it is a good move, we wouldn't honour asbestos in any way or tolerate anything that could be seen to be in adoration of asbestos and cigarettes have killed more people,"" Dr White said.

27,"Meet Justin Beaker, Quacky Chan and the Duck Knight, the racing ducks of north Queensland ",arts-culture,"  Meet Justin Beaker, Quacky Chan and the Duck Knight, the racing ducks of north Queensland According to Craig Melville, you haven't seen it all until you've seen his racing ducks. What started as a bet between with his wife, Ruth, quickly turned into a business for the North Queensland couple, who attracted solid crowds to the Mackay Show this week. Ducks named Justin Beaker, Quacky Chan, the Duck Knight and Kim Karquackian jostled at the starting line, each distinguished by different coloured bandanas. Craig Melville said the creative names were the result of brainstorming sessions. ""It involves red wine and Great Northern [beer] and usually, by the end of it, we have to put a pencil through a few of the names that we can't say in front of the children,"" he said. As the sound of trumpets blast through the speakers, a crowd draws around the gates. A countdown begins and the race is off, with the Indian runner ducks racing up a ramp, down the slide, through traffic cones and tunnels. ""Our friend has pig racing and we bet my wife that she couldn't get the ducks to run like pigs do,"" Mr Melville said. ""Within three days we were ready for a race. ""You never met my wife. She will do anything to prove you're wrong."" It only took Mrs Melville a couple of days to teach a duck, named Madonna, to race. ""She's been with us seven years … she's starting to get a bit slow and Ruth is getting a bit teary,"" Mr Melville said. ""Ruth talks to her and she looks up with one eye and looks into her eyes."" Mrs Melville said her husband bet her a new car, which she has enjoyed driving these past couple of years. ""My husband is always challenging me. ""Some things [that] he thinks animals can't do, I think they can."" She said by working with the ducks' strengths and making them feel comfortable, it was not hard. ""We treat them like royalty, and they have a lovely life on the farm."" The couple run an educational property outside of Townsville, which school students attend. They have also operated an animal nursery for more than 25 years. The idea of travelling with the animals grew from a friend pleading with Mr Melville to bring some of his farm animals to a struggling shopping centre. Mr Melville acknowledged that some people in the show circuit did not care for their animals properly. ""There's people that are a little bit, 'How you going?', but that's why we're not cheap,"" he said. ""We charge a fair whack of money so we can put that back into the animals. ""We've got four llamas … a Mediterranean miniature donkey … when you add animals of that quality, you have to really look after them."" Verity Hatfield, 17, travels with Mr and Mrs Melville to work in the animal nursery. ""I've always wanted to work with animals,"" she said. ""We start in Townsville and we go about eight hours to Emerald and then we work our way back up the coast towards Cairns. ""I sell the feed cups and make sure the animals are not being harmed, and are treated nicely by people."" Mr Melville said Indian runner ducks were very clever. ""They've got a thought process for problem solving,"" he said. ""We've got other ducks at home that can pull a string and open a gate … all sorts of stuff. ""We know all the different habits of all the different animals. He said racing was stimulating for the ducks and was working on improvements to the racecourse. Mr Melville said all you have to do is work with an animal's strength, make the wrong things hard and the right thing easy. ""As soon as an animal learns to learn, they switch on and want more of it. ""If you want to train an animal, take them out of their own environment, because when you're on the road, you are the only thing they know. ""You're their safety blanket.""

28,'First time I've actually felt seen': Viewers praise new emotional Bluey episodes,arts-culture,"  Bluey praised for representation of Auslan community and fertility in episodes Turtleboy and Onesies Australia's internationally celebrated children's show Bluey is making grown adults cry (again) for its representation of three new characters. Bluey, which is made by Brisbane-based Ludo Studio, is renowned for its unexpected hard-hitting moments on issues including friendship, parenting, pregnancy, even death. Two new episodes from the latest season, Turtleboy and Onesies, are no exception. In Turtleboy, Bingo finds a toy turtle at the playground and wants to take him home, but her dad Bandit says ""it's not the done thing"". Fans have described their delight at watching the moment the episode introduces newcomer Dougie and his mum, voiced by actress Miranda Tapsell. Dougie, based on a cavoodle, is profoundly deaf and uses Auslan to communicate with his hearing mum, who signs and speaks. The Bluey official Facebook page is full of praise from viewers to the creators for including signing characters in the show but not making it the focus of the episode. ""Thank you for turtle boy. My 5 year old suffered unknown hearing loss last year and now wears hearing aids. My favourite part about this episode is that you didn't even make it a thing. Bluey at it's best. Also I'm not crying you're crying (yes dear, happy tears),"" Elspeth Singe wrote. ""So loved this episode for our hearing impaired son. It was great for our whole family to watch. Love to see more of this character,"" Nic Ky wrote. ""Thank you so much for including signing characters and AUSLAN interpreting. Representation truly matters. And just when you think Bluey can't get any better… you all had me in tears,"" Megan Louise wrote. Ludo Studio worked with consultants from not-for-profit service provider Deaf Connect to authentically create the Auslan interaction between Dougie and his mum, which includes 62 Auslan handshapes and signs. Alex Fisher from Deaf Connect told ABC Kids Early Education there were challenges in helping create the animated Auslan. ""The characters in Bluey have four fingers on each hand which meant we were limited in some of the signs we could use, particularly if they required fingerspelling (if there is no Auslan sign for a word, the word is spelled using letters made on fingers/hands),"" Ms Fisher said. ""In addition to handshape considerations, it's important to use correct orientation, location, movement, and non-manual features. ""There were a few changes made along the way to correctly reflect this after the scenes started to come together."" You can watch Turtleboy on ABC view in usual format and with full Auslan translation. Hot off the heels of releasing Turtleboy, Bluey hit its viewers right in the feels with Onesies. The episode was highly anticipated by fans of the show because it brings in mum Chilli's sister Brandy, voiced by Australian actress Rose Byrne, for the first time. There had been fan theories as to why Brandy and Chilli hadn't spoken in years, but no-one saw this coming. After coming over for a visit and giving her nieces Bluey and Bingo onesies as a present, it's evident Brandy feels awkward around the kids and her sister, and tries to leave. Later, Bluey asks her mum why Brandy is sad and why they've only seen her once in their lives. Over a montage of Brandy playing with Bingo, Chilli alludes that her sister can't have children: ""There's something aunty Brandy wants more than anything as well but she can't have it, and there's not really anything anyone can do."" Viewers have shared their struggles with fertility on the Bluey Facebook page, and thanked the show for addressing the issue with empathy. ""Woah, that hit this IVF mumma HARD. This is the first time I've actually felt 'seen', and I'm just sad that it's taken a childrens' cartoon to make me feel this way. Thank you to the writers for addressing such an intensely emotional subject, for so many, with such kindness, empathy and consideration,"" Allana Handley wrote. ""I was not ready for this episode. Such a sensitive topic handled by the Bluey team with the kindness and grace they are known for. Beautifully done. I'm sure there are many viewers out there this morning having some big feels,"" Rhiannon Connon wrote. Director of the Fertility Society of Australia and New Zealand, Manuela Toledo, said the episode was a good way to start a conversation with children about fertility. ""Every prep classroom has at least one or two children who are there as a result of fertility treatment, so it's an incredibly common thing,"" Dr Toledo said. ""There's lots of different causes of fertility, that program's not appropriate to go into why Brandy didn't have a baby or wants to have a baby and can't have a baby at the moment. ""It's really important to understand it's not just medical infertility, where people try and they can't have a baby. ""There's also lots of social factors that might come into it. ""Maybe she's a single woman and hasn't been able to find a sperm donor, or maybe she's in a same-sex relationship and they haven't been able to utilise sperm or they haven't been successful with a sperm donor. ""There's lots of other things that could be going on in the background, but I think the important thing is that it actually opens that conversation."" Bluey is an inexhaustible six year-old Blue Heeler dog, who loves to play and turns everyday family life into extraordinary adventures, developing her imagination as well as her mental, physical and emotional resilience. Onesies is not the first episode of Bluey to address fertility. In the season two episode The Show, Bingo is pretending to be her mum during an impromptu Mother's Day performance and has a balloon tucked under her shirt like ""a baby in her belly"". When the accidentally balloon pops, Bandit reaches out and touches his wife's hand. While the show doesn't explicitly say so, viewers commented it was a subtle and sensitive way of representing pregnancy loss. Bluey is available in Australia on ABC kids and iview.

29,"Guy Sebastian had 'barrow to push' against former manager, court told",arts-culture,"  Guy Sebastian had 'barrow to push' against former manager accused of embezzling $800,000, court told Musician Guy Sebastian had a ""barrow to push"" and was ""evasive"" when he gave evidence against his ex-manager Titus Day in an embezzlement trial, a Sydney jury has been told. Mr Day, 49, pleaded not guilty in the NSW District Court to 50 charges over the alleged embezzlement of nearly $900,000 from Sebastian, who he managed for a decade. After a lengthy trial that began in early May, Mr Day's barrister Dominic Toomey SC today began his closing address by reminding jurors they cannot find Mr Day guilty unless they are satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that he used the money dishonestly. Sebastian has previously told the court that Mr Day controlled almost every aspect of his professional affairs, including the execution of contracts, and he didn't read through every document presented to him to sign. ""We submit to you that Mr Sebastian presented as a person who had a barrow to push,"" Mr Toomey told jurors. ""He had an agenda. In his answers to questions that I put to him, you might think that he was evasive. ""Indeed, I would like to suggest to you that if I had put to Mr Sebastian the proposition that the sun rises in the east, he might have asked me what I was insinuating."" Mr Toomey said this was in ""stark contrast"" to when Sebastian answered questions from the Crown, when he was cooperative and gave short answers. At the centre of the case are funds allegedly owed to Sebastian, including through royalties and performance fees, which Mr Day is accused of embezzling. The court heard the singer was introduced to Mr Day in 2007 and signed a contract with his then-employer 22 Management, but in 2009 Mr Day poached Sebastian for his own breakaway management company, 6 Degrees. Mr Toomey today said Sebastian would often ""go off on a narrative of his own"" in response to questions while being cross-examined. ""He twisted himself in knots in his evidence in an attempt not to acknowledge the existence of an agreement between him and Mr Day,"" he said. ""He could not bring himself to use the word contract in reference to his arrangement with Mr Day."" Mr Toomey suggested this was because Sebastian believed doing so may be against his interests. Last week, Judge Timothy Gartelmann directed jurors to find Mr Day not guilty of three embezzlement counts, however, 47 remained. The remaining counts relate to just over $882,600. Mr Day elected not to give evidence during the trial and Judge Gartelmann today gave the jury 10 extensive directions about the submissions made by the Crown during its closing address. The judge emphasised that the Crown has the onus of proof. ""[Mr Day] has a right to silence,"" Judge Gartelmann said. ""He exercised that right to silence in not giving or calling any evidence. ""It does not amount to any admission of guilt. No inference can be drawn against him because of it.""

31,Lightyear pairs the Toy Story space ranger with a cute robot cat but fails to live up to buzz,arts-culture,"  Disney’s Lightyear reimagines Toy Story’s Buzz as a human but fails to evoke the joy of the beloved original The release of the first trailer for Lightyear, the Toy Story spin-off centred on the franchise's beloved Space Ranger, occasioned a tweet from its leading man that was received as the ramblings of a sphinx. ""This isn't Buzz Lightyear the toy,"" wrote Chris Evans. ""This is the origin story of the human Buzz Lightyear that the toy is based on."" Evans's words do actually make sense – Lightyear the film, he wanted his followers to know, is about the character himself, and not the action figure voiced by Tim Allen in Toy Storys 1 through 4. If the tweet reads as nonsensical, I'd say it has a lot more to do with the convoluted, creatively bankrupt concept than the actual syntax. (A film based on a fictional toy might strike as less flimsy, less immediately objectionable, than one based on Pop-Tarts or Flamin' Hot Cheetos, but not by much.) In Hollywood's quest to turn everything it touches into IP, audiences are becoming ever more entangled in a Gordian knot's worth of not just sequels and prequels, but spin-offs, reboots, and 'requels' too – and now this. Just as well writers Jason Headley and Angus MacLane, who also directs, seem to have found a cleaner hook since Evans's December, 2020 tweet. An opening intertitle announces Lightyear as the film that begat the action figure – that is, the film that led Andy, the owner beloved by the original Toy Story's rag-tag toy gang, to ditch Tom Hanks's Woody and the associated cowboy memorabilia in favour of flashier spaceman merch. Tops Arts & Culture headlines. With apologies for being a buzzkill (ahem), I gotta say that I can't imagine Lightyear inspiring any such fervour in the kiddies of today. Not least because Headley and MacLane – after making a point of nailing down exactly where this film is supposed to sit in the Toy Story universe – utterly fail to deliver on the premise. Though it borrows candidly from classics of interstellar travel (Star Wars; 2001: A Space Odyssey), Lightyear offers little of the goofily heroic charm that made the animated action figure so endearing. Allen's character's lofty proclamations about reaching Star Command and his mission logs were funny because they were being issued by a small plastic man, oblivious to the true nature of his existence. ""You are a TOOOY!"" an exasperated Woody bellows at an undeterred Buzz in one of the 1995 film's most memorable moments. But there is no such irony in the self-serious dedication of the new – or should that be old? – Buzz. (In that sense, Captain America is probably a good choice for the role.) When he finds himself marooned – together with his commanding officer and pal Alisha Hawthorne (Orange is the New Black's Uzo Aduba) and a giant spaceship's-worth of fellow rangers – on a hostile planet with their fuel source, a ""hyperspeed crystal"", destroyed, Buzz throws himself into the task of getting them all home again. This means launching himself on a series of round trip missions in order to test out his jerry-rigged crystals (the process looks like making a multi-flavour Slurpee, why not?). Unfortunately, the vagaries of time dilation mean that each time Buzz returns, everyone else is years older, and more and more settled on the planet he wants to escape: fleeting glimpses of Alisha's wedding, the birth of her daughter, and her 40th anniversary whiz by in a montage. (The film's lesson about the dangers of workaholism will surely resonate with kids everywhere.) When the scary, Transformer-esque Zurg (voiced by James Brolin) makes his entrance and begins wreaking havoc (for reasons unknown), Buzz pivots to combating him – the hero assisted by an obligatory cutesy sidekick, the robotic cat Sox (Peter Sohn), and a gaggle of cadets helmed by Alisha's granddaughter Izzy (Keke Palmer, Hustlers). (It's left to this crew, rounded out by Taika Waititi and Dale Soules, another Orange is the New Black alum, to handle much of what passes for laugh lines in this film.) This conflict fizzles almost as gracelessly as it was introduced: the revelation of Zurg's nefarious motivations fails to make sense of the arch-rivalry that characterised the relationship between the toy versions of him and Buzz. Which brings us back to the fact that this film ultimately fails to embody the mythology it claims for itself. In Toy Story 2, Woody discovers that he's the product of an old TV show called Woody's Round-Up, snippets of which suggest a riff on Howdy Doody, with a puppet Woody happily issuing his rootin'-tootin' one-liners. By contrast, nothing about Lightyear suggests that it could have been made and watched by Andy in 1995, except maybe the irksome animatronic cat. (His catchphrase: ""beep boop beep boop"".) Nothing about Lightyear suggests that, should the boy have seen it, he would've become enamoured with space travel. Even though the landscapes are handsomely rendered and Michael Giacchino's score is often stirring, there's none of the silly flash promised by the character's neon green and purple iconography. Perhaps there's no better distillation of the gap between toy Buzz and 'human' Buzz than the way in which ""To infinity, and beyond!"", a loving parody of a high camp hero's bombast, here becomes an earnest affirmation shared by him and Alisha, signed off with a gentle touching of index fingers. The line should soar – it's rousing and meaningless! – but Headley and MacLane insist on making it weighty. They pull it right back down to Earth, or whatever the heck planet they're on. Part of Woody's task in the original Toy Story is coaxing Buzz through the existential crisis that comes with the eventual revelation of his PVC identity. ""Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger!"" blurts Woody. You said it, pal. Lightyear is in cinemas now.

32,Kardashian cafe claim revealed as fake news but Davidson shows fans he's the real deal,arts-culture,"  SNL star Pete Davidson thrills fans in FNQ but Kim Kardashian cafe claim is fake news False claims that reality TV star Kim Kardashian was holidaying in far north Queensland have been revealed as a promotional stunt. The ABC reported the fabricated story by a Cairns café owner after he posted a comment on social media claiming Ms Kardashian and her actor and comedian boyfriend Pete Davidson had dined in his establishment. Café owner Matt Black was interviewed by ABC radio but later admitted the story was untrue. Comedian and Saturday Night Live star Davidson is in far north Queensland ahead of filming for comedy film Wizards! expected to start next week. Photos of Davidson posing with fans have been posted on social media. In the recorded interview run on ABC radio, Mr Black claimed he'd initially been approached by the couple's security. Then, he said, ""Sure enough, in walked bloody Kimmy K and Pete Davidson"". After the ABC aired the interview and published an online story, doubts about the claims emerged. A spokesperson for the Wizards! film production team later confirmed Ms Kardashian was not in Cairns. Mr Black told the ABC he'd made the comments as a joke and thought it would be ""a small, unharmful piece of promo"" for his café. ""The small, little story was to get people having a little excitement about celebs being around town,"" he said. Pictures of the couple holidaying in a tropical destination, published by the ABC, were reportedly taken in Tahiti, while Ms Kardashian was photographed in Los Angeles earlier this week. Editor's note (17/6/2022): The ABC has updated this story from an earlier version which stated that Kim Kardashian had visited a Cairns cafe and been photographed on a Queensland beach.

33,A young widow is harassed by a monstrous parade of men in Alex Garland’s creepy horror film Men,arts-culture,"  New horror movie Men attempts to join class of elevated horror flicks Midsommar and Hereditary but falls short In England, no one can hear you scream. That seems to be the premise of Alex Garland's Men, whose grief-stricken protagonist (Jessie Buckley) lets out feral, earth-quaking bellows in all manner of places: the bathtub, a church, the claustrophobic hallways of a country manor. Each time, her roars go unheard by those around her, even as they risk shattering an errant wine glass in the cinema. Buckley is Harper Marlowe, a recent widow whose husband James (Paapa Essiedu), in a fit of rage, tripped – or jumped – off a high-rise balcony, a tragedy rendered in syrupy slow motion in Men's opening shot. Harper can only gaze on in abject horror as James falls past her, limned in an impressionistic sunset glow – a sight that returns to haunt us again and again. In the aftermath, Harper retreats to an off-grid estate for the weekend, ostensibly hoping to shed her grief with a salve as old as time: crisp country air and nature, hours away from any signs of life – or so she thinks. No sooner has she arrived than unsettling sights start sprouting from the walls of the manor, which are painted blood-red (a too-obvious sign, perhaps, of what's to come). It begins with the appearance of Geoffrey (Rory Kinnear), her mealy-mouthed landlord, whose bumbling mannerisms and slightly off-colour jokes might conceal menacing intentions. Then, on a video call with her friend Riley (Glow's Gayle Rankin, who is under-utilised here), Harper's phone screen glitches in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it jump scare, distorting into a Lovecraftian morass of flesh and blood – a grisly, misshapen pair of lips locked in an eternal screech. That glitch teases a connection to Garland's earlier films – thinky sci-fi parables that deal with the dystopian implications of technological advancement. In the British director's Oscar-nominated Ex Machina (2014), a moneyed, macho Silicon Valley type develops the perfect fembot prototype. His follow-up, an atmospheric adaptation of acclaimed sci-fi saga Annihilation (2018), stars Natalie Portman as a biologist leading an all-women troupe of commandos into a mysterious zone called 'the Shimmer', where their military weapons are defenceless against an inexplicable force that invades their bodies. Garland's latest, though, is somewhat a left turn. Like Ex Machina and Annihilation, it is a chamber piece – isolating its characters in a bucolic sanctuary that turns nightmarish, and leaving them to unravel the knotty despairs plaguing them. But Men dials down the sci-fi tropes in favour of something more sinister. It slots neatly into the recent wave of so-called elevated horror movies, which use the slice-and-dice gore of their predecessors as metaphors for some greater existential anxiety. Ari Aster's Hereditary and Midsommar are linchpins of this genre, offering grand ruminations on family dysfunction and relationship woes. Closer to home, Australian films Relic and cult favourite The Babadook have also told twisty tales of intergenerational trauma and motherhood in spooky, skin-crawling fashion. And with a title like that, Men could only be a horror film. Unfortunately, its title is also where it seems to reside. Follow @abc_arts on Instagram, where life and culture collide. Compared to its peers, Men's attempt at elevated horror feels paper-thin. Film need not possess a political manifesto – it can, of course, remain purely sensory – but Garland clubs us over the head with a bleedingly obvious one: all men are the same, and all men are bad. Like an intoxicated heart-to-heart in a nightclub bathroom, you can almost hear Garland raving ""men are trash!"" while smirking to himself. As if this is a new idea to anyone born in the last century. He sledgehammers his point home by enlisting Kinnear to play – alongside Geoffrey – an assortment of male tormentors. There is a naked man who stalks Harper in the background of shots like a satanic Where's Wally. There is an inept policeman who arrests, then releases said stalker. There is a young boy – a digitally de-aged Kinnear, equal parts creepy and cherubic – who spars with Harper outside a local church, calling her, out of the blue, a ""stupid bitch"". To his credit, Kinnear's performance approaches the virtuosic, as he shapeshifts with little more than a tweak in costume or accent into a cornucopia of villains. Buckley, too, is in typically good form, fresh off a rabidly acclaimed turn in last year's thorny drama The Lost Daughter. As Harper, she is indignant and undaunted, though her eyes often betray a quiet desperation as the horrors around her close in. And she is, of course, great at screaming. But Garland misuses both his leads to grasp at #MeToo relevance while providing merely a surface-level screed against misogyny. It is a shame, because Men contains the kernels of many intriguing ideas. In an early scene, familiar to anyone who has watched the trailer, Harper calls into an endless tunnel, her voice reverberating off its mossy edges to form a strangely symphonic melody. When she returns to the tunnel minutes later, she finds it boarded up, in a state of disrepair. Has there been a wrinkle in time? Are we witnessing the breakdown of Harper's grip on reality? Garland opts to ignore these narrative threads entirely. There is also a plethora of visually stunning images: James' death, replaying like an intrusive memory; a stone engraving of the Green Man, a leafy folk figure and mythical symbol of rebirth who Garland recasts as a malicious presence. Each time it appears, it is accompanied by a ghostly trick of the light and a wailing, discordant score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow. Tops Arts & Culture headlines. Without sufficient grounding, however, these images feel too abstracted, resembling a gimmicky showreel more than a film. Indeed, Men teeters precariously on the edge of self-parody. As it crescendos to a sanguinary finale complete with mutilated limbs and a murderous game of hide-and-seek, the only appropriate response is a bout of stifled laughter at the sheer, meaningless absurdity of it all. We might view it as a satire of elevated horror, a genre that has permeated the market to such an extent that its latest imitators, by virtue of their ubiquity, blend into one bloody mass. But that would probably be too generous. Men is in cinemas now.

34,Authentic south-east Australian Aboriginal art a festival highlight of Vivid as part of Barangaroo walk,arts-culture,"  Aboriginal artist Warwick Keen featured in Sydney Vivid festival as part of Banrangaroo Reserve walk Warwick Keen says his installation of 150 colour-changing light pillars in Barangaroo Reserve ""looks fabulous during the day"", but goes to another level at nightfall. His is one of the many art installations that launch into life at 6pm each evening during Sydney's Vivid festival. For Mr Keen, participating in the festival is a chance for the TAFE NSW teacher to showcase a style that he has been perfecting for decades. ""I've come up with 150 designs, and the designs I've used are sourced from once traditionally practised art forms of south-eastern Aboriginal people,"" he says. His exhibition is called Nura, which means 'place' or 'country' in Gadigal language. It is part of a broad display along the waterfront at Crown Sydney called The Gallery. Mr Keen's artworks draw inspiration from traditional tree carvings, with each pillar highlighting a First Nations memory in fine detail. ""I have a ferry floating around on Darling Harbour [featuring my artwork] with similar iconography on it,"" he says. ""I've been doing this stuff all my life and I get a lot of good feedback and support, so people notice it and some people are inspired by that. ""It's a good, positive thing to be doing and what it does is it helps keep culture alive."" Warwick Keen says he encourages Aboriginal artists to draw and paint using the iconography of where they come from, rather than copying practices from other areas in Australia like the central desert or Top End. ""[Being involved in Vivid] is a good opportunity to amplify traditional Aboriginal art iconography that belongs to south-eastern Australia,"" Mr Keen says. ""I went up there early last week and saw them [artworks] and spent a couple of nights walking back and forth."" The NSW Minister for Tourism and Sport, Stuart Ayres, says the exhibition of Indigenous artworks is a festival highlight. ""Vivid Sydney shines a bright spotlight on the artistic talent we have in NSW and it is so exciting to see Indigenous artists at the forefront, telling their stories and featured in such an iconic location,"" he says. ""The Barangaroo redevelopment is crucial in creating jobs, attracting investment, driving the visitor economy, and giving Sydney a world-class new waterfront development. ""This area has been given a new lease on life and is a must-see for visitors and those attending Vivid Sydney."" Mr Keen was commissioned to create the designs on paper before they were printed onto a polypropylene surface. The designs were then moulded onto cylinders with lights inside them. ""The importance of connecting with and celebrating Aboriginal heritage is the driving force behind our 2022 Vivid Sydney installation,"" Crown Sydney spokesperson Simon McGrath says. ""Honouring the heritage of Barangaroo was vital to us, so this partnership made complete sense. ""We are delighted that Crown Sydney can provide a platform for First Nations students to showcase their talent not only to Sydney but the world.""

35,Working like a dog: School's in for kelpies and their handlers as demand for muster dogs rises,arts-culture,"  Muster Dogs sees demand for kelpie, handler training on the rise It's Monday morning on the June long weekend. School children are enjoying a sleep-in and a break from the books. But not every classroom has closed its doors. At the Boonaroo sheep yards, nestled in the rolling hills near Casterton in western Victoria, school is in and the classroom is packed with eager eyes and wagging tails. Catch up on Season One of the hit show Muster Dogs on ABC iview. It's working dog school where farmers, handlers, and muster dog lovers unite to learn the finer arts of building a bond with their kelpie companions. Kathy Brown travelled six hours with her three ""kelpie kids"" to attend the class, led by multi-award-winning trainer and studmaster of GoGetta Kelpies, Joe Spicer. ""We downsized about 10 years ago to a hobby farm, but I've had working dogs forever and just love the breed. I've done everything from agility to ANKC herding and trialling … but there's always more to learn,"" she says. Ms Brown says she brought all three of her kelpie and koolie dogs to the working dog school to learn ""how to get the best connections with them"". ""I brought Kim, an 11-year-old koolie bitch — and Blake, an eight-year-old male koolie who's been my inspiration to learn more because Kim was easy to train and he was really hard,"" she says. ""Blake learns differently; you've got to be in exactly the right spot, you've got to be on the ball and know exactly what you're doing … and if it all gets too much for him, he just signs off."" ""And I also brought my six-month-old kelpie pup, Sache."" It's not the first working dog school Ms Brown has attended, and it ""won't be the last"", she laughs. ""You learn something new every time."" ""It's about the trainer really … and about how we interact with the dog, not about what the dog is or isn't doing."" With a set of undercover sheep yards for a classroom courtesy of local Casterton farmers Shane and Jodie Foster at Boonaroo, a dozen handlers, and their eager-eyed pupils are put through their paces on mobs of quiet but willing sheep. Black-and-tan, red, brown-and-tan, and every colour kelpie in between await their turn on centre stage, tied quietly to the side. Mr Spicer doesn't like barking dogs — ""noisy classmates"" — during class. Rakes line the rails. ""Arm extensions to help the handler get their position right and send the correct signal to the dog,"" Mr Spicer explains. Notebooks are marked with ""position, position, position""… ""pressure and relief""… ""go in with a plan"" and ""HAVE FUN!"" One by one, handlers and their working dogs take to the round yard to work their dog on tailored exercises designed to build the basics of real-world mustering work on small mobs of quiet sheep. It's a formula that has seen thousands of successful graduates improve their handling skills, learn to be skilled stockmen and women and, perhaps most importantly, understand the psychology of working dogs. The working dog schools travel around the country courtesy of Daniel Ball and his aptly-named Ewe, Me and The Dog training business. Over the past eight years, he's run hundreds of schools but, since the ABC television runaway hit series Muster Dogs, demand is on the up. ""We've probably run double the amount of working dog schools since Muster Dogs,"" Mr Ball says. ""We're also finding we're getting a greater mix of attendees including people from suburbia who want to get their kelpie or kelpie-cross out and see what they can do … as well as farmers wanting to improve their handling skills and understand their dogs better."" He says while most attendees come along ""just to see what their dogs can do"", some are hopeful of finding the ""Frank and Annie"" connection. ""At our schools, every dog will improve. But if we all thought we could turn our dogs into Annies we'd probably be kidding ourselves,"" he laughs. Mr Ball says the popularity of kelpies is also on the rise – but he cautioned prospective owners on the complex needs of the breed. ""What we don't want to see happen is another 'Red Dog phenomenon', which saw people rush out and buy red kelpies after the popularity of the film of the same name,"" he says. ""They are a breed that is highly intelligent, and they need a lot of mental stimulation — not just physical activity."" But for those still undecided about enrolling in a working dog school, Mr Ball issues the challenge. ""You can't get any better if you stay at home dreaming about it,"" he says. ""For all the hours that go into training, even on shows like Muster Dogs, you see that it doesn't always go to plan, but it sure is a lot of fun anyway."" Joe Spicer cuts a well-known figure in the working dog world. He's an award-winning trainer who has claimed top gongs at national level working dog trials, and runs a leading stud — GoGetta Kelpies — at Glenthompson, Victoria, where the waitlists for his kelpie pups are longer than the lines at the Boxing Day Test Match. But he's quietly humbled by the success of Muster Dogs, on which he was recruited as the expert breeder-trainer. ""Probably the biggest thing that came across was actually the connection that we saw between landowners and their stock and of course their dogs,"" Mr Spicer says. ""We're all here to be guardians of our land and we want our stock to be happy and healthy. ""I also thought it brought a lot of different types of people together — from poodle owners to 'townies' to those on the land — it seemed to strike a chord in the hearts of so many Australians. When you're looking for a dog, Australian kelpie puppies can prove irresistible. Just make sure you know what's involved before you bring one home. ""I think the basic obedience and dog psychology elements really resonated with people, no matter what breed of dog they have."" Mr Spicer says the demand for knowledge has never been greater in the working dog industry. ""People are seeing the results of how much more they're getting out of their dogs and how much easier it's making stock work, but also how much better their stock are when their dogs are working well,"" he says. He says he never tires of seeing kelpie owners and their pups building a bond over stock work. ""Probably the biggest lesson for people after a dog school is the understanding they gain about their dogs,"" he says. ""A lot of people say they didn't realise how oblivious they were to what their dogs were saying to them, how their dogs interact with each other, and how they communicate."" Mr Spicer says the schools teach the importance of handler positioning, and help owners understand the working dog's instincts around livestock. ""Obedience doesn't come just from training; it comes from gaining respect from your dog and that comes down to showing your dog that you make good decisions,"" he says. And for the dozen handlers gathered around the campfire at the end of class, conversations land upon a point to which all agree: it's really not about teaching the dogs, it's about teaching the humans.

36,"'Nervous, shy, proud': How a desert photo shoot gave these young Anangu confidence",arts-culture,"  'Desert diamonds' shine in the outback's answer to Vogue magazine It started with a few boxes of donated clothes — formal dresses, two-piece suits, tiaras, and jewellery. In the remote desert communities of the Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands, straddling the borders between the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and South Australia, young people have been dressing up, striking a pose, and showing their power in a new magazine. Rikina, the Pitjanjatjara word for ""cool, stylish"", has been produced by the NPY Women's Council (NPYWC), with youth workers becoming fashion photographers in the desert's answer to Vogue. And they say it has given young Anangu a confidence boost. ""We had big plans for the [NPYWC's 40th anniversary] AGM last year to do a fashion parade, and we were really excited about it,"" the council's boarding school education officer Tamika McMasters said. ""But we couldn't go ahead because of COVID."" The boxes of clothes though, donated from social enterprise Thread Together, were not about to go to waste. Photo shoots took place across communities including Kaltukatjara (Docker River) and Mutitjulu in the NT, Papulankutja (Blackstone), Mantamaru (Jameson) and Irrunyntju (Wingellina) in WA, and Putkatja in SA. ""We got the clothes out and got all the makeup ready for the girls and they just went at it. Went for the clothes and what they knew what they wanted to wear,"" Ms McMasters said. ""They were very happy to wear the older dresses and get dressed up and have a laugh with all their friends, they really enjoyed that."" With taglines like ""Desert diamonds — strong and beautiful"", ""Wiyantja wiya — never give up"", ""Desert Kings and Queens"", and ""Kungkas [Pitjanjatjara for girls/women] on country"", the magazine shows teenagers at home, backed by sprawling mountain ranges and posing with rusty wrecked cars that match the red dirt. Some assumed fierce expressions and sassy poses, some thoughtful, others beaming or on the verge of giggles alongside their friends. Three friends from Docker River, Anne-Marie, Cynthia, and Delicia, were excited to see themselves and their friends and relatives in print with the release of Rikina's debut issue. Anne-Marie, who has begun working with youth in her community, said she helped persuade the other two to join the photo shoot. Delicia said she felt ""nervous and shy"" at first, but all three agreed the experience made them feel ""proud"". Tamika McMasters said the project instilled the young Anangu with confidence. Young Aboriginal people are often heavily disadvantaged in terms of health, housing, services, and job opportunities in remote communities, compared to their non-Aboriginal and city peers. So part of Ms McMasters' work with the NPYWC involves helping them gain skills to help them find work and inspire them into possible careers. Pointing to a ""powerful"" portrait of one of the Rikina models, Ms McMasters explained that before the shoot, one young girl ""never came to the youth shed"" in her community because of bullying and teasing. ""But one of the youth workers said to her they were doing a photo shoot and they got donated clothes, and she was at the photo shoot that day. They were taking these photos,"" Ms McMasters said. ""After that photo shoot she is now going to the rec shed every day. ""It got some of these young people out of their shells and being more confident."" ""You can see she's very confident in this photo. She [now] feels more comfortable to be at the youth shed because she might have been with all the kids and enjoyed taking the photos."" Ms McMasters said the June 2022 issue of Rikina was being distributed across Central Australia and the photos were already proving popular on social media, with the NPY Women's Council hoping to release another edition of the magazine in 2023. The NPYWC was started in 1980 as an advocacy body for Aboriginal women and children, and today remains governed and directed by Aboriginal women, providing a range of social, art, and health services across the region.

37,'Full circle moment': Hip hop artist returns home to mentor teens,arts-culture,"  Tasman Keith returns to regional NSW to teach teens importance of literacy and music Hip hop artist Tasman Keith says returning to the NSW Mid North Coast to mentor disadvantaged teens is a ""full circle moment"". The Gumbaynggir man and award-winning musician is making waves in the Australian music scene but recently his focus has been at a small Kempsey learning centre where he has been mentoring young adults who have fallen out of the mainstream education system. Keith said he had been teaching them the importance of creativity in music and how to get their story across. The workshops are part of an Australia Literacy and Numeracy Foundation intensive project called Subtext: Art for Literacy which connects talented mentors with young people. Keith said he spent his days brainstorming, workshopping and guiding the students' song ideas at the Macleay Valley Vocational College in Kempsey. ""Bringing out their emotion in a way that they see as the cool thing to do,"" Mr Keith said. His mentoring has empowered the students to express themselves, according to the foundation's project lead, Pavitra Kurup. ""The initial reluctance to participate in a group activity kind of melted away,"" Ms Kurup said. ""It's important for the young people to be able to see themselves reflected in the mentor standing in front of them."" The Australia Literacy and Numeracy Foundation aims to raise literacy levels in the country's most marginalised communities. Ms Kurup said 40 to 50 per cent of adults in Australia had literacy levels below the international standard. ""Children from disadvantaged backgrounds, remote areas, and Indigenous Australians are up to two times more likely to start school developmentally behind than the national average,"" she said. The program has allowed Keith to slow down and reflect on his own achievements. ""It's kind of a full circle moment because I see how fulfilled these kids feel after they have a song,"" he said. Keith grew up between the bright lights of Sydney and a small country town on the NSW Mid North Coast. With a population of just over 1,100 people, Mr Keith said Bowraville was where he discovered his desire to create music. ""I really saw the value in speaking my truth,"" he said. He said a small, local creative hub had inspired him. ""If it wasn't for that space and my ability to be able to just sit down and write music and have a safe place to do so and people to guide me through it, I don't think I'd be doing what I am today,"" he said. Mr Keith's father, Aboriginal hip-hop pioneer Wire MC, was another powerful influence in his life. ""Being an artist is what I gravitated towards,"" he said. ""I remember being 14 or 15 and hearing my voice recorded for the first time. Being able to be a mentor for these kids is something I don't take lightly."" Keith has recorded a song with Jessica Mauboy as he rises through the hip-hop scene. It'll be released in his debut album A Colour Undone — a major milestone in his career. “To have that moment with somebody that I feel was the representation for Indigenous people, when there wasn’t much representation, was a massive moment for me,"" he said. Keith said visiting his family on the Mid North Coast and mentoring young adults kept him grounded. ""It's something that I want to continue doing,"" he said. “What's the point of doing (music) if I can't share my experience?” We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

38,'You have to be patient': Meet the twitcher who will bush-bash for five straight days for the perfect bird photo,arts-culture,"  Tasmania's ultimate twitcher goes to great lengths for perfect bird photo Pradeep Pandiyan could be Tasmania's ultimate twitcher, taking up to 55 hours to capture one shot of the state's more elusive bird species. From commando crawling over saltmarshes to 11-hour days bush-bashing, Mr Pandiyan admits he's a bit obsessed. ""Once I got into it, it became very, very addictive,"" he told Jane Longhurst on ABC Radio Hobart. While balancing a full-time engineering career, he says not a single day goes by that he's not ""thinking about the birds"". Mr Pandiyan's main influence is National Geographic photographer Tim Laman. ""His obsession was to photograph all the birds of paradise species from Papua New Guinea on various different islands,"" he said. ""That passion drove me into bird photography and I started doing the same."" Mr Pandiyan was inspired to set out and photograph the 'Tassie 12', which is all of Tasmania's endemic bird species. ""I'd just gotten into the phase of exploring the digital camera and the breathtaking pictures it can take and then I started paying attention to detail and got into birds,"" he said. Mr Pandiyan is a very patient man, and he has to be. ""The birding and the twitching aren't just about seeing the bird through binoculars and ticking it off the list,"" he said. ""You have to wait behind your camera, waiting for that perfect moment for that bird to come and sit on that perch and click that photo without any obstructions. ""You have to be very, very patient."" The elusive ground parrot has been his hardest quest. ""I had to wait for five straight days for 11 hours a day, bush-bashing to photograph that species,"" he said. He says he enjoys the adventure and remoteness bird photography requires, like spending time at Melaleuca in Tasmania's wild south west taking photos of the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. ""You go and explore the place and get to know the birds in that habitat,"" he said. It's taken Mr Pandiyan two and a half years to capture all 12 of the state's endemic species. ""You can't find those 12 endemic birds anywhere else in the world,"" he said. The one endemic species that kept him on his toes was the scrubtit. ""It's a tiny bird, which has a beautiful yellow wash underneath its throat,"" he said. ""That bird alone took me close to a year to finish off my list."" He still has a few more species he'd like to capture properly, like the wedge-tailed eagle. ""I've seen so many of them flying about but I've never got a fantastic portrait shot of them,"" he said. ""It's high on my radar."" Mr Pandiyan says shore birds are among the most challenging to capture due to their speed and cautious nature. Dotterels and plovers do not like people, and will quickly move away. He says he needs to army crawl to get a good photo. ""That's the only approach,"" he said. ""The minute they start seeing a threat or movement they move away. ""The best way to approach them is using your binoculars and on your belly flat to the ground to do an army crawl. ""They can be very tricky."" Not all amazing bird moments are caught on camera. Mr Pandiyan recalls a magical moment observing the ""brood parasite"" behaviour of cuckoos. ""All the cuckoo birds, like fantail cuckoos, come to Tasmania to lay eggs and rear the chicks,"" he said. ""Brood parasitism means they don't know how to build a nest. They lay their eggs in other birds' nests and the other birds will treat the chicks as their own. ""Once they realise that it's not their own they will kick them out and, at that point, the chick is able to fend for themselves."" In Ida Bay in Tasmania's far south, he witnessed a shiny bronze cuckoo, a large bird, being fed by a tiny thornbill. ""The tiny bird is feeding a bird six times bigger than it that isn't its chick,"" he said. ""It wasn't in a clear position for me to photograph. ""But I got a good look at that behaviour.""

39,Streaming dreams dashed: Agency criticised for charging young actors to appear on screen,arts-culture,"  Parents flag 'concerning' conduct of talent agency that demands payment for child acting roles Perth woman Hannah Moore says her nine-year-old daughter Matilda was excited when she walked into a mass audition for aspiring child actors on the weekend. When she left, holding a piece of paper explaining it would cost at least $4,000 for Matilda to get an acting role, Ms Moore was already thinking about how to break the bad news to her daughter. ""All [Matilda] knew was that 'Oh my God, Mum. This could be my big break. I could be famous',"" Ms Moore said. ""My nine-year-old daughter was incredibly heartbroken, so she was in tears. She couldn't understand why we were not going to pay the money."" The touring audition was held by Premiere, a company that produces TV shows and movies for its own streaming services and markets itself to parents of children who ""dream of being a YouTuber or on Disney+?"" Concerns about the company's approach, which requires payment for young actors who pass an audition to appear in one of Premiere's own films, have been raised by parents and a Perth agent who runs auditions for Disney and Nickelodeon. Consumer Protection WA said the program did not appear to be a scam, but the ""conduct is concerning"". Premiere did not respond to requests for comment. ""They're preying on kids' dreams, parents' aspirations for their children,"" said agent Ali Roberts, of Ali Roberts Studio in Perth. ""They're setting it up like you are going to be auditioning for a major network in the US. And they're not, they're going along for what we call like a cattle call."" Ms Roberts said taking payment from actors or their families was not part of the normal audition process. She said the Perth audition was not the first of its kind held in Australia. ""They're just using industry words and descriptions to try and lure people into the buy,"" said Roberts. Ms Moore said her daughter was told she had performed well on the first day of the Perth audition, where she was invited to read a couple of lines. She said the company representative told her Matilda should come back for a final audition the next day, but she was taken aback by the information they gave her. If Matilda passed the final audition, a Premiere flyer said her parents would need to pay between about $4,000 and $21,000 Australian dollars to appear in Premiere's next movie. A fee of about $4,000 would pay for Matilda to get a ""featured role"" with about 10 lines in the Go Iguanas! movie, while the $21,000 fee would pay for a leading role with at least 50 lines. Ms Moore said she and her husband decided, after discussing the flyer at home, they would not proceed. ""He looked at me went, 'No, they pay us, we don't pay them',"" she said. The WA Consumer Protection Division said it had not received any complaints about Premiere but encouraged consumers to contact the department if they had paid for services. ""Our WA ScamNet team has also reviewed the website and concluded that it appears to be legitimate."" One Perth woman said her experience with Premiere was ""amazing."" Amy Rumpf said her family paid for her to participate in a Premiere program after passing a Perth audition in 2016. Ms Rumpf, who was a teenager at the time, flew to Orlando, Florida, to participate in workshops and a showcase in front of talent scouts and agents. She said she also met Disney stars and got to practice lines with them. “It was a really positive experience,” she said. “Every two weeks I had a mentor call me, I would rehearse my lines with her and she would give me feedback … so I really got my money's worth.” But Ms Rumpf said she was disappointed the company was now taking payment for acting roles. She said she would not have signed up if that had been the program at the time. “[At the time] you were paying for an agency and to get noticed, not paying to get straight on TV, and then for however many lines you can afford. “Which I think sends the wrong message because that's just showing that money can buy whatever you need, or it's showing that kids with families who are much richer can afford to get better experiences and better opportunities.” We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

40,'A real and genuine ally': Lizzo changes 'ableist' lyric in Grrrls after social media outcry,arts-culture,"  Lizzo changes 'ableist' Grrrls lyric after Australian fan calls her out on social media American pop star Lizzo changed a lyric to her song Grrrls after an Australian fan complained that a word used in it was an ableist slur. Hannah Diviney, who lives with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, contacted Lizzo on Twitter to say that the word used in the song made her feel ""pretty angry [and] sad"". ""It's an ableist slur,"" she wrote. ""It's 2022. Do better."" Lizzo did.

""As a fat black woman in America … I can understand the power words can have (whether intentionally or in my case, unintentionally),"" she wrote. ""This is the result of me listening and taking action. ""As an influential artist, I'm dedicated to being part of the change I've been waiting to see in the world."" Diviney said she was ""blown away"" by Lizzo's swift response. ""I couldn't have imagined that she would react that positively,"" Ms Diviney told Sammy J on ABC Radio Melbourne. ""I was expecting that if we got a response at all it would be one of defensiveness or doubling down, not because I think that's how Lizzo operates, just because that's the norm for public figures. ""Most people aren't open to learning and correcting their mistakes."" Ms Diviney said when she initially heard the song she was ""confused"" but said she has since learned that the term is not considered a slur in the United States. People who easily name racism and sexism do not seem to see the human rights issues that underscore ableism. That silence is problematic, Ellen Fraser-Barbour writes. ""For me and for so many others, we've known for a long time that that word is not one that you use,"" Ms Diviney said. ""One thing that I've learned since calling Lizzo out for it is that it's not as commonly known as a slur in the United States, which sort of blows my mind as well."" Ms Diviney said Lizzo had proven herself to be a genuine ally by owning her mistake and quickly rectifying it. ""She listened, she didn't try to defend it, she didn't try to justify it. ""From what I can tell, she just wanted everyone to feel safe and loved by this song. ""She's shown that she's a real and genuine ally.""

42,Brush with the bush: Wynne Prize to tour regions for first time in 125-year history,arts-culture,"  New landscapes for Wynne as Australia's oldest art prize set to tour regional NSW for first time The Wynne Prize existed before the Archibald, but the ""poor cousin"" of the famous exhibition never visited regional New South Wales. Now for the first time in its 125-year history it will tour the plains, gorges, and farmlands it has long depicted. Northern Tablelands artist Angus Nivison said the tour was a long-overdue development. ""I'm totally astounded because the Wynne has always been the poor cousin to the Archibald, but I'm absolutely thrilled."" Mr Nivison won the Wynne back in 2002 and said landscapes often taught us more than portraits could. ""I think the best landscape paintings often express concerns and cares about more than just landscape. It's more about what makes us human, what defines us as a people – especially Australian landscape,"" he said. The state government promised $762,000 to make the program happen, which will fund visits to 12 regional galleries across a three-year period. The exhibition will travel to locations including Moree, Mudgee, Wagga Wagga, Orange, Bathurst and Armidale's New England Regional Art Museum (NERAM). NERAM director Rachael Parsons said it was vital regional communities experience their own landscapes reflected back to them. ""I think the focus on landscapes resonates very strongly in the regions; we have some of the most beautiful landscapes around – New England is well known for them,"" she said. ""We also have some local artists that have been featured in the Wynne Prize as well. Angus Nivison from Walcha is in this year's Wynne Prize, and Leah Bullen has been in twice before, so I think it's wonderful to have that connection,"" she said. Mr Nivison said the story behind his piece this year moved him deeply and reflected a greater story about the region moving through change. He was asked to paint a family member's favourite tree on a property near Walcha, which he thought ""was a rather beaten-up old thing just hanging in there."" But then he heard the tree's story. ""This is the tree when during the last big drought, while the bushfires were raging and the soil was blowing away, [my nephew] was feeding stock, and trying to decide which ones he'd keep and which ones he'd sell."" ""He was mostly doing it by himself, and he used to see this tree and he'd say, 'while you're hanging in there, I'll hang in there'. So it was sort of his beacon of hope,"" he said. As a ritual Mr Nivison said he now looked for the tree each time he drove up to Armidale. ""That's why I called it Beacon, it became a beacon, and for me it still is. I've gotten into the habit of looking for it."" Angus Nivison said it was poignant that the Wynne Prize would journey to the region where most of his entries over the decades had originated. ""Personally I think it's long overdue, and I've always wondered why they didn't tour the Wynne and the Archibald together, so I think it's great that it's happened."" The tour will start with next year's prize finalists, and will continue to tour the regional centres until 2025.

43,Bendigo arts community mourns death of former events chief David Lloyd in SA,arts-culture,"  David Lloyd dies suddenly aged 54, Bendigo arts community 'devastated' losing former events chief The arts community in central Victoria is in mourning after the death of David Lloyd who died suddenly last week at his home in Angas Valley, near Sanderston in South Australia, aged 54. Mr Lloyd left Bendigo last year after 16 years as the manager of the city council's Bendigo Venues and Events, where he oversaw the transformation of the region into an arts and culture hub. Former colleague and friend Anne Henshall said he was integral to some of the major arts projects in the city including the development of the Ulumburra Theatre. Mr Lloyd had also been a president of Performing Arts Connections Australia and the Victorian Association of Performing Arts Centres. ""He helped to develop the Bendigo Writers Festival, the Bendigo Exploratory Music Festival, and welcoming the Arena Theatre company to the city,"" she said. ""It was an incredible time when he was here, he was always willing to give things a go."" Ms Henshall described him as a gentle and caring man. ""Our connection with First Nations People was strengthened because he was brought up in Alice Springs, so he had a deep understanding and always wanted them to be involved."" Fellow colleague and friend Kathryn Mackenzie said Mr Lloyd left a huge legacy. ""David worked so hard to shape the diverse performing arts program that we love in this beautiful city,"" she said. ""He had a vision, he put his heart and soul into work. And he could make things happen, which is a unique ability in someone. ""He just did it. He was a relationship builder. He allowed the growth of the events he bought."" Mr Lloyd was also an avid coffee lover, with friends vowing to have a cup in his honour. ""Any of us who worked with him will know his love of coffee,"" he said. ""It was a quiet joke with us all — wherever David went was with his coffee,"" Ms Mackenzie said.

44,Estate of the art: Artist brushes Byron Bay to find home for new gallery,arts-culture,"  Artist Clive Sheridan opens Lundberg Gallery in South Murwillumbah An art gallery has popped up as an unexpected tenant in a northern NSW industrial estate. Named after the street it is in, Lundberg Gallery was opened after three challenging years for artist, curator and director Clive Sheridan. ""I didn't even walk in the door,"" Mr Sheridan said. ""I came around the corner and went 'I'm home'."" Tired of the Sydney lifestyle, he sought out a new home in the Northern Rivers region but craved somewhere different to Byron Bay. Mr Sheridan discovered Murwillumbah. His artistic eye saw potential beyond the concrete panelled walls and electric roller doors of the new industrial estate before him. ""I needed to come to somewhere that didn't have anything like this,"" he said. He knew the challenges he would face, having launched a gallery 15 years ago in an industrial estate in the West Midlands of the United Kingdom. Devastating floods in northern NSW this year stalled his progress. ""The walls were muddy and brown,"" he said. ""It was the last shed to be completed because they used this as the garage for all the machinery, all the paint, all the acid."" The gallery has since hosted its first exhibition, Unfold, featuring six artists. ""I think the title speaks for itself and all that we've been through,"" Mr Sheridan said. ""We're going to be showing conceptual art, a lot of minimal art — a lot of art that challenges people."" Even close friends were not allowed to see the gallery until Mr Sheridan was satisfied. His neighbours were surprised by the new business. ""At first they were a bit mixed,"" he said. ""They couldn't believe that I would want go open such an establishment on an industrial estate. ""A couple of them still call it a museum."" He said the picturesque Murwillumbah region, in the middle of an extinct volcanic caldera, was ready for a cultural explosion. He said when he first arrived there was local resistance to late night bars, restaurants and entertainment but that had changed. ""I've watched this town almost turn on its head and for the better,"" Mr Sheridan said. The next show in August will be a photographic print exhibition featuring artists from London and Vanuatu.

45,Court told 47 charges against Guy Sebastian's former manager still valid despite judge's not guilty direction,arts-culture,"  Charges against Guy Sebastian's former manager still valid despite judge's not guilty direction, court told A Sydney jury that was directed by a judge to find Guy Sebastian's former manager not guilty of three embezzlement charges has been told the development doesn't reflect the validity of 47 remaining charges. The jury heard the remaining counts relate to a total amount of just over $882,600 Titus Day, 49, has faced a lengthy trial in the NSW District Court after pleading not guilty to embezzling about $900,000 from the singer, who he managed for a decade, through royalties and performance fees. In 2009, he poached Sebastian for his own breakaway management company, 6 Degrees. At the end of the Crown case last week, Judge Timothy Gartelmann directed the jury to find the accused not guilty of three counts of embezzlement. During a closing address today, Crown Prosecutor David Morters SC told jurors that during the course of the trial, evidence emerged of funds related to some counts not actually being withheld from Sebastian. ""It cannot be said the laying of those charges reflects poorly on the investigator or the prosecution,"" Mr Morters said. He told the jury it was also not a matter which demonstrated ""ineptitude"" on behalf of the prosecution. ""The charges were rightly dismissed, but they do not reflect on the validity of the remaining 47 charges."" The jury heard the remaining counts relate to a total amount of just over $882,600. Mr Morters has told the jurors that in order to return guilty verdicts, they must be satisfied that Mr Day was acting as a clerk to an employer and that he embezzled property, namely funds, from that employer. He likened the charges to a shopkeeper who receives payment for goods and services and who, rather than placing the money in a till, puts it into their own pocket. Mr Morters argued it was clear, from financial records before the court, that Mr Day had ""dispersed these funds in a way which was inconsistent with the interests of Mr Sebastian and he in effect embezzled that money from Mr Sebastian"". Sebastian has previously given evidence that Mr Day took over control of almost every aspect of his professional affairs, including the execution of contracts. He said he didn't read through every document presented to him to sign because he knew Mr Day was a contract lawyer and trusted him. The court has heard a draft contract was created for Sebastian's switch to 6 Degrees, but the Crown says it was never signed. Their professional relationship continued until November 2017, when it ended with hostility. Mr Day's barrister, Dominic Toomey SC, has argued there is an answer to every one of the charges his client faces. He's also suggested jurors may wonder whether police were ""wilfully blind"" or ""seduced"" by the singer's high profile. The trial continues.

46,'Inspiring and empowering': Australian Indigenous art in the global spotlight ,arts-culture,"  Australian Indigenous art takes centre stage as Tate Modern, Sotheby's embrace First Nations creations From London to New York and Singapore to Paris, the global art world is taking notice of Australian Indigenous works. The surging interest is inspiring a new generation of First Nations artists to break into the scene, including Ilona McGuire. The contemporary artist spends her days researching and brainstorming ideas for upcoming projects. Her studio space at PICA in the heart of Perth's Northbridge neighbourhood comes with a background soundtrack of thumping beats from the bar downstairs. But McGuire says the music doesn't bother her; she's just thrilled to have the space to work in. ""I love coming in here each day and just creating space for myself to contemplate and really research and think about ideas so I've got a bit of a bank of ideas,"" she said. The proud Whadjuk, Ballardong, Yuat and Kungarakan woman is one of Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts (PICA) resident 'Hatched' artists, a program that celebrates emerging artists across Australia. Even though she's yet to complete her Fine Arts degree, she is already becoming well-known. She was thrust into the limelight last year for creating a drone light show for the Fremantle Biennale, a first of its kind in Australia. Called Moombaki, the Nyoongar word for ""where the river meets the sky"", three different shows recreated the first stories of Whadjuk Nyoongar Country. ""It's surreal, I was working on (Moombaki) last year in the lead up to my grad show exhibition, and it was really overwhelming at times, but I think I really took on the challenge and enjoyed the experience because working in the arts was something I always wanted to do,"" the 24-year-old said. The shows attracted thousands of people and were highly acclaimed. McGuire is part of a growing number of Indigenous artists coming onto the scene. On the other side of Perth at the Fremantle Arts Centre, the Revealed exhibition showcases more than 250 pieces of work from more than 100 creators at the beginning of their careers. The annual event has been running for several years and curator Glenn Iseger-Pilkington says it's becoming easier to find talent to feature. ""Revealed is a really great platform for artists who haven't had major exhibitions in commercial galleries and other major institutions and it's a really important stepping stone for artists to get their work platformed,"" he said. This year, three-quarters of the work sold on opening night, despite Perth experiencing a surge in COVID cases at the time. But it's not just on home soil where Indigenous artworks are proving popular. Sotheby's in New York recently moved its annual Australian Indigenous art sale from the winter off-season to the May marquee month, with the highest-selling work going for just over one million Australian dollars. The Tate Modern's exhibition, A Year in Art: Australia 1992, has proven so popular since it opened last June, its run has been extended until September. In Singapore, the National Gallery has recently opened a major exhibition called Ever Present: First Peoples Art of Australia, the largest show of its kind to go on tour in Asia. ""The art industry and business of art are all highly connected, so when you see major state-run organisations delivering really big exhibitions, then that has a flow-on effect to the confidence people have in buying the work,"" Iseger-Pilkington said. McGuire agrees that seeing the commercial success and global attention of indigenous art is heartening. ""I find it really inspiring and encouraging to see my mob stepping out and creating work that's beautiful and inspiring and empowering,"" she said. For McGuire, the impact of being given a platform has been huge. ""After last year and being in the public eye, it's been a really great opportunity for me to receive more opportunities to work further as an artist."" Both McGuire and Iseger-Pilkington believe the interest in Australian indigenous artworks is not a passing trend and that recognition will continue to grow, as more artists are inspired to put forward their creations.

48,"David Allen, founder of Men on Men gay art prize, awarded Queen's Birthday honour",arts-culture,"  David Allen, founder of Men on Men gay art prize, awarded Queen's Birthday honour When David Allen, from Agnes Water in central Queensland, received a letter informing him he was part of the 2022 Queen's Birthday Honours List, he assumed it was a mistake. But the letter had found the correct recipient and Mr Allen can now put OAM to his name for his service to visual arts. ""I actually thought they had made a mistake and sent it to the wrong person,"" Mr Allen said. ""It's a very humbling experience, I've got to say."" For 10 years, the award-winning artist has been involved with the 1770 Art Show, after relocating from Melbourne and travelling around Australia. The annual exhibition has become an important part of the regional Queensland arts calendar, but it is not the first time Mr Allen has been involved in helping provide an avenue for artists to display their work. In 2001, Mr Allen and his partner Ron Watkins founded a gay art prize titled Men on Men Art Exhibition and Competition when they were running The Laird Hotel in Collingwood, Melbourne. The pub is one of the longest running gay-owned and operated venues in Australia and many of Mr Allen's regulars at the time were involved in the arts, but unable to find spaces to display their work. ""Back in the early 2000s, it was very difficult to get into art galleries at any rate, let alone if you were coming from a gay perspective,"" Mr Allen said. ""We had a lot of gay customers who were artists and they were really struggling to find places where they could exhibit their artworks, so we created one."" The exhibition was immediately popular and attracted artists displaying work that reflected their lifestyle and culture. Men on Men is still running more than 20 years later. ""It was phenomenally successful from day one,"" Mr Allen said. ""All we had to do was provide a venue, marketing, prizes and things like that to get people involved. ""Once you give artists an opportunity, they take it."" In 2007, Mr Allen and Mr Watkins hit the road to travel and paint around Australia and discovered the town of Agnes Water in Queensland's Gladstone region. After 25 years of life in inner-city Melbourne, the relaxed coastal lifestyle and ""spectacular beauty"" of Agnes Water tugged at Mr Allen and the couple relocated. ""We moved up to this neck of the woods, and there is an art show up here and it was the perfect fit for me to meet new people in the community,"" Mr Allen said. ""And now it's 10 years later, 10 art shows later, the 1770 Art Show Festival is very successful. It's now established itself as a mainstream show in regional Queensland. ""But it's always been a team effort and my partner has always been along."" Mr Allen will travel to Brisbane later this year for the formal presentation of his award. His only issue is what to wear. ""There will be a function at Government House and I will have to try and find something to wear,"" Mr Allen said. ""Board shorts and thongs, which is the usual wear in Agnes, is not going to cut it."" ABC Wide Bay will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

49,"In the Hobbit House, 86 types of wallpaper tell almost two centuries of stories",arts-culture,"  Hobbit House in Oatlands tells 160 years of stories through layers of historical wallpaper A convict-built cottage in Tasmania's Southern Midlands is slowly revealing 160 years of secrets through its many layers of historical wallpaper. The Hobbit House, as it is affectionately known by its owners, is an 1860s timber cottage built in Oatlands by convict James McDermott. McDermott was transported to Van Diemen's Land in 1850 for stealing a cow but was later pardoned and worked as a farm labourer in the Oatlands area. He and his wife Mary Ann and three sons lived at the cottage for 60 years between them. Wallpaper historian Alan Townsend said the cottage got its name due to its saggy walls. ""There are so many layers of wallpaper in this tiny little house that the ceilings sag in towards you so you feel like you're underground,"" Mr Townsend told Helen Shield on ABC Radio Hobart. He said the cottage was a time capsule and had layer after layer of wallpaper added — 86 different types altogether. ""Not only do you have about 160 years of people wallpapering it every two or three years, it's never been touched."" One room alone has 30 layers of wallpaper. ""Nearly 200 years later, they've gifted us this lovely archive of what colonial taste was like in the 1860s."" Smoke from the cottage's open fires would darken the wallpaper, which led to the occupants adding more over the top, Mr Townsend said. ""The other problem is, being a timber house you get a lot of drafts, and every year or two you'd re-paper and keep the drafts out … over time you end up with 30 layers."" He thinks the McDermotts probably acquired discounted off-cuts from local shops. The cottage's current owner invited Mr Townsend to collect some wallpaper when she was removing it — he wasn't sure what to expect, but arrived with conservation volunteers Linda Clarke and Karen Stott to find ute-loads of it. ""The place was just chock-a-block full of it,"" he said. ""We spotted straight away that some of the early layers were really, really interesting. ""One layer depicted a landscape filled with classical ruins like an MC Escher painting that could never exist in reality; somehow in the 1860s they thought it would make good wallpaper."" Oatlands is known to be a cold and windy town in winter. In an 1860s cottage the occupants would also cover cracks and gaps with old dress fabric, hessian, newspapers and even children's homework, Mr Townsend said. ""We've got 100 years of textile history,"" he said. Between 1864 and 1880 the McDermotts pasted their children's homework to the wall, which Mr Townsend initially thought was for practicality rather than display. Children were given a blank copy book, with each page containing a beautifully written line at the top; some of the lines reinforced moral messages from school. ""Your job was to copy that line 20 or 30 times on the page to end up with that beautiful copperplate handwriting that the 19th century is so famous for,"" he said. ""You see a real transition; the parents are convicts and are totally illiterate."" He said the McDermotts had signed official documents with an ""X"", meaning they could not read or write, ""whereas their kids are getting quite a good education in Oatlands in the 19th century"". ""I think that's why there's so much of their homework pasted to the wall because you've got really proud parents wanting to document what their kids are doing. ""We've found so much of this stuff and there's really only one conclusion to draw: it was the trophy room."" Mr Townsend also found a portion of a letter that was properly signed by James McDermott. ""We know he was illiterate; by the time the kids were old enough to read and write, the parents were using them to write letters for them."" Mr Townsend is writing a book that will tell some of Tasmania's social history discovered through wallpaper. When people looked back at Tasmania's colonial history, it was often a drab picture, he said, ""but if you were living here in the 1850s, you had access to the most amazing shops"". ""You could get pretty much anything you could get in the shops of London or Paris in the shops of Hobart,"" Mr Townsend said. A house in Evandale has bespoke French wallpaper from the 1800s in which the entire room was one individual piece of art depicting two royal families meeting in the deserts of Arabia. ""How on Earth did this end up in Tasmania?"" Initially, decorative wallpaper was for the rich only, Mr Townsend said. ""But then jump to the 1860s and you've got convicts buying it,"" he said. ""The reason is by the middle of the 19th century, you've got machine printing coming in and what used to be a luxury item was suddenly available to everyone.""

51,Leah Purcell was part of 'the secret family on the other side of town'. Now she's putting her history on the big screen,arts-culture,"  Leah Purcell weaves her Indigenous Songlines into new film The Drover's Wife The Legend of Molly Johnson When Leah Purcell was filming the acclaimed movie Jindabyne in 2006, she would go up into the Snowy Mountains on her days off. One day, taking in the beauty of Mount Kosciuszko she suddenly yelled out: ""I love this landscape, I'm coming back, I think I'm going to do a film, I think it's going to be The Drover's Wife, and I think I am going to be in it."" Her voice echoed around the mountain range. Cut to 2019, ""and I am literally on the opposite mountain range and I'm singing out 'action' and 'cut' on my debut feature film"". She had come a long way from the small Queensland town of Murgon, adjacent to Cherbourg, which was once a government reserve where Aboriginal people were taken when they were forcibly removed from their country. A place of hardship where they were not allowed to speak language or practise culture. When Leah left Murgon she had three bags, a baby on her hip, a tank full of petrol and nothing left to lose. She was escaping a violent relationship, grieving the death of her mother. She didn't know where she would sleep that night, or where her next meal would come from. She was 18 years old. ""I just made my mind up that I was going to do it for myself and my daughter."" If she stayed, her only option would have been working in the local abattoir, her days a cycle of drinking and the domestic violence she had lived with since she was 14. ""It was normal for us young girls to be in these violent relationships."" She loaded up her yellow Datsun Sunny, shoved it down the drive, push-started it, ""and away I went."" Actor and friend Deborah Mailman remembers the young Leah as having ""long dreadlocks"" and being ""really strong"". ""I just remember thinking how stunning she was and the sort of passion and energy that she had wanting to be an actor."" Even then she had confidence that was at odds with being beaten down as a teenager. She didn't have anything new until she was 13. Her clothes had come out of plastic bags relatives would leave on the verandah. ""I think I got my confidence from having nothing to lose. ""I come from the dirt, a sole parent's pension, and I'm proud. And I would go back there and I would climb out of it again."" In early TV presenting jobs, Leah had to phone a friend at home to find out what some of the words meant. Finally, the woman on the autocue noticed she had trouble reading and helped her. Leah would go on to write books, plays and film scripts. Leah might have gotten out of Murgon, but she never left her people. A Goa-Gunggari-Wakka Wakka woman, she is the storyteller, the holder and keeper of the stories. For 30 years now she has been telling the story of her family, of her mother and grandmother. ""I'm a truth-teller. All I can share is the truth in my family's stories, because that's all I know."" Her grandmother Daisy was born on country at Mitchell but became part of the Stolen Generations when the children were herded into a cattle cart and taken away to Cherbourg. They think she was around five years old. She never saw her parents again. Leah's mother, Florence, was part of what she calls the ""lost generation"". ""They were punished if they spoke a language or spoke about culture,"" Leah says. ""She wasn't allowed to be black but she wasn't accepted in the white world."" Leah has been researching her family history since she was 14. ""I was at the crossroads of whether to be a good girl or a bad girl. And culture and my identity as a black fella pulled me back and set me on my life's path."" Her acclaimed late '90s one-woman show Box The Pony, a tour de force that played sell-out seasons at the Sydney Opera House, and went to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and the Barbican in London, was about the three generations: her grandmother, her mother and herself. ""Those two women are vitally important to me, they have shaped my Dreaming of where I wanted to go and what I stood for,"" Leah says. ""I am applying my Dreaming or my Songlines to their stories, but my grandmother's story was the foundation."" She would give them the voices they never had, shouting them as loudly as she could. ""My mother never had a voice. My grandmother never had a voice."" Now, says Deborah Mailman, ""she doesn't just open the door, she kicks it off its hinges in terms of creating opportunities."" Leah was the youngest of Florence's seven children. Born when Florence was 42 it was just her and her mother. ""I was her shoulder to cry on. I had a lot of responsibility as a child. My job was to protect her and look after her."" Her father was a white man, the local butcher and boxing trainer, who lived with his white wife and three children on the other side of town. ""We were the secret family and it was all hush, hush, but I think, you know, small country town, everyone knew."" Even though they could ""drive each other crazy"", Leah adored her mother. ""She was mighty, she was my mother, my father, my hero. She was four-foot-nothing but she was unreal. Everyone loved her. She was doing reconciliation before the word became fashionable."" When Leah was five and ""a mongrel sleeper"", Florence would recite Henry Lawson's book of short stories as a lullaby to put her to sleep. Their favourite was The Drover's Wife. ""It's about a drover's wife sitting with her children in her shack waiting for a snake to leave the hut while her husband is away,"" says Leah. It is a story that would never leave her. ""I connected to that story because it was the first time I could use my imagination and see myself in a story,"" Leah says. ""I saw myself as the little boy because I didn't have my father around. I was the protector of my mother. My mother was the drover's wife. We had a combustion stove. My mother had a wood heap at the back. She taught me to split the logs into chips. She taught me how to pack it and she would say, 'don't pack hollow otherwise a snake can get in' — just like in the story."" If Leah was a C-average student who ""hated"" school, it might have been because she was tired. Out of loneliness and hardship, Florence had turned to the bottle. ""She loved a man that she couldn't have. She was in a relationship where she couldn't express herself. She raised her seven children and two nephews, she looked after her own mother for 20 years."" Sometimes they would be early to the pub and the last ones to leave. ""I'd want to get home. I was tired,"" Leah says. ""Sometimes I'd knock my mother's drinks back. 'OK mum, you finished that drink. Let's go'."" Leah would get her mother home from the pub, get her to bed, sit with her until she was asleep and breathing properly, frightened she might stop breathing altogether. ""She said to me, 'Without you, I'd be in the gutter'."" On Sundays, they would watch black-and-white movies together. Then Leah would recreate the movie in the wardrobe mirror in her bedroom. ""I'd be singing with Liza Minnelli, Doris Day, Barbra Streisand. I'd sing with Whitney Houston, dance with Janet Jackson."" At barbecues, she would direct 20 cousins in a performance. She told Florence she wanted to be an actor. ""My mum would say, 'Well, you're black, you're a woman, you're from the bush. You've got to be real here. You're either going to be a nurse or work at the meatworks.' I never let it kill my dream. I always had it in the back of my head that I was going to do this. I didn't know how; it was just a need."" But she knew she could never leave her mother. ""I was born to look after her."" Leah was angry and bitter about her father's absence and her mother's sadness until she was an adult. When she was 32, she made her peace with her father. She sought him out and told him he had a lot of explaining to do. ""You have to confront those issues where there's anger within you. He was very open to having those conversations and he told me his truth and I told him my truth. He told me he was very proud of me. In the end, we had a great relationship. It lifted so much off my shoulders."" Leah was only 18 when her mother died of bowel cancer at the age of 60.  She spiralled into a vodka-fuelled depression. ""I had suicidal thoughts and I thought if I did that, all of this pain, all of this confusion, doesn't it just all go away? ""But I thought if I killed myself and my daughter survived, who's going to understand her? Who's going to love her like a mother? I didn't want that for her and this little voice said, 'didn't you want to be an actor?'"" Leah left Murgon for good to pursue her dreams. Now she knows that one of the greatest gifts her mother gave her when she passed away was setting her free. Leah started in community theatre in Brisbane in the early '90s. Her cousin set her up on a blind date with Bain Stewart and 30 years later they are still going strong. Bain was a champion kickboxer who ran a martial arts gym. Like Leah, his mother was Aboriginal, his father white. ""He knew I was interested in acting and he really encouraged me with my singing."" Early in their relationship, they had their first disagreement. ""He said, 'Stop. You just want me to hit you.' And that just blew my mind and I went, 'Oh my God, I'm so sorry, you are so right',"" Leah recalls. ""It actually made me check myself. Bruises heal, but it took me nearly 12 to 15 years to psychologically get that pattern out of my life. Bain is such a beautiful human being; he's stuck around and worked me through that. I truly believe he has been a gift from the ancestors because he has been such a support."" ""I don't think you can talk about Leah, her life and her work, without acknowledging Bain,"" Deb Mailman says.""They are a formidable team; they complement each other so beautifully."" Leah says she would dream up stuff, ""and he would dream it up further and believed in it and would chase money. So then he got into the producing side of things."" Bain understood Leah. ""I was listening to her dreams and aspirations, and then it all took off,"" he says. ""And all of a sudden I had a tiger by the tail."" She was in the ABC drama Police Rescue. She wrote and co-directed the documentary film Black Chicks Talking. The awards and accolades would pile up when she appeared in high-profile films Lantana, Somersault, The Proposition and Jindabyne. All the time she was watching and learning: ""I never sit in the green room. I'm an observer."" She starred in one episode and directed another of Redfern Now, the first TV series written, acted, produced and directed by First Nations Australians. She directed across both series of Indigenous drama Cleverman. ""She's somebody that's untrained,"" Bain says. ""She never went to NIDA or an AFTRS or a Conservatorium of Music, but she's directed scores of episodic TV, directed theatre on all the main stages in Australia. She's got publishing deals."" Leah was about to semi-retire from acting to concentrate on her writing when she was offered one of the three leads in Wentworth. ""And I said, 'Just let me talk to the actor in me'. And, you know, I was screaming with joy. I loved Wentworth because we women had kickass, bad-ass, boss-bitch moments."" In 2014, she was awarded the Balnaves Foundation grant to write a play about the story that had been percolating for 45 years, that was always at the back of her mind, ""it just wouldn't leave me alone"" – The Drover's Wife. ""It would start a whole Drover's Wife journey for me. That was the first time really that I actually got money and I went, you mean I can actually just sit down and write?"" She re-imagined the classic story through the prism of her own family history. Her ancestors had been drovers. The play received standing ovations at Belvoir Street Theatre. Then Bain came home with a surprise – a book deal with Random House. The book would win the 2017 Victorian and NSW Premier's Literary Award. ""My DNA is within it. And I've sung up business on it. I sung up the play, I sung up the novel, I sung up the movie. And in cultural ways you have that thread of a Songline which connects you to country, to family, to culture,"" Leah says. ""I've taken Henry Lawson's story and applied it to my Songlines to allow me to go on many journeys with his story. ""I wanted to put my Indigenous storytelling through it, my blood through the piece."" Her latest offering is the feature film The Drover's Wife The Legend of Molly Johnson. An outback western, it tells the story of Molly Johnson, a drover's wife who will do anything to protect her children – and does. Leah wrote, directed and starred as Molly in the film, in an unflinching performance. ""It's about a mother's love, it's about women, it's about family, survival, strength, determination,"" she says. Through family history, she had found that her great grandfather was Daniel Johnson, a white stockman who lived in the Aboriginal camp, and who had tried to save her grandmother from being stolen but had been unable to reach her. She named the boy in the story after him. While she was writing she had her childhood copy of Henry Lawson's book on her desk.

""What she is doing is paying homage to her grandmother and her great grandmother and her mum, what they went through to allow her to have the life she has now,"" Bain says. ""The sexism, the racism, the violence that was set upon them by the men of that time. She has taken this story and completely flipped it on its head."" Last June, Leah was awarded the Member of the Order of Australia for significant services to the performing arts, First Nations youth and culture, and to women. She went to the ""castle in the city"" – Sydney's Government House – to get the ""little thingamajig"" (as she coined the medallion). She was being honoured by the very establishment that only two generations ago had treated her family as if they were barely human. ""I think if I look too much into the history and what that building really represents and what it all means, you wouldn't get out of bed in the morning, would you?"" Bain told her she had been nominated by her Indigenous peers. ""I thought that was pretty awesome."" ""Aboriginal people have survived since time began,"" she says.

52,'It doesn't happen the way you think it will': How Sarah's brush with Melissa Caddick helped her understand cults,arts-culture,"  Nobody knowingly joins a cult, so why are so many lives ruined by them? ""Nobody joins a cult"" is not a statement you’d expect to hear from someone who has spent the last few years investigating how widespread they are. But at second glance, it goes to the heart of what Sarah Steel has repeatedly found as she traverses a secretive and bizarre world for her hit podcast Let's Talk About Sects. No-one thinks they're joining a cult, Steel says, that realisation comes later — if at all: ""People like to think that it could never be you, but the more people I've spoken to, the more apparent it becomes that anyone could end up in a cult."" That's because not all cults are made equal. While many preach religion, others prey on people's desire to make a difference in the world, whether it's presented as an organic farming commune or a platform to help people less fortunate. The type of people they attract are equally varied, according to Steel, who says the only thing members seem to have in common is they found the group at a time when their life was in flux or they were seeking change. ""You're not joining a cult, you're joining what looks to be a really great group that you can dedicate yourself to for the greater good, or self-improvement, or something as simple as a martial arts class,"" she says. ""It can happen to anyone if they come across the wrong group at the wrong time."" Many people will only ever hear about a handful of cults, often via sensationalist reporting that focuses more on kooky details than their tragic legacies. In Australia, there's The Family — a doomsday cult founded in the 1960s, covered in the first episode of the podcast. Even after the death of the organisation's leader Anne Hamilton-Byrne in 2019, few will be able to forget the photo of 13 children standing in order of ascending height, donning matching blue and pink outfits and bleach blonde bobs. Internationally, you may have heard of Heaven's Gate, responsible for the largest mass suicide in United States history, the notorious Manson Family, and Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese doomsday cult that launched a deadly sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subway in 1995. But beyond the headlines, Steel says, many dangerous organisations continue to slip under the radar. A spreadsheet she uses to keep track of such groups currently includes 146 names and that ""wouldn't even be taking a small chip out of what's out there"". ""The number of people you speak to who have had a personal experience, or have a friend or family member who has been involved, is just off the charts — it's way more than you would ever realise unless you were always having those conversations,"" she says. In her upcoming book, called Do As I Say, Steel delves deeper into the motivations of the people who join these cults. And while there are few similarities between those that become trapped, the tactics used to lure them in could come straight from a playbook. Steel has good reason to believe we can all fall victim to manipulators. On top of her extensive interviews with cult survivors and experts, the Sydney-based filmmaker has experienced firsthand how easy it can be to trust the wrong person. Melissa Caddick is now a household name, after it was alleged she swindled millions of dollars from investors — often her friends and family — while posing as a financial adviser. Her shock disappearance in 2020, and the subsequent discovery of her severed foot on the NSW South Coast months later, have spurred public interest in the case. But Steel knew Caddick as her long-term partner's cousin, to whom she had handed over her savings to invest. When details of the Caddick's ruse were revealed, she discovered she was among the victims. ""Going through something like that showed me how vulnerable we are to manipulative people,"" Steel says. ""It never occurred to me to question her at all."" Steel had been researching cults for years when the story broke, but says the realisation she had been tricked still came as a shock. ""It opened my eyes to almost the banality of it,"" she says, describing how long it took her to reconcile that she had been conned. ""It doesn't happen at all the way you think it will."" When it comes to cults, which can usurp a person's entire identity, there's a lot more to unpack: ""It might start by thinking there were just a few people who were messed up, but the leader was good; or they had good aims but it became corrupted over time; and then it starts to dawn on you that actually the whole thing is a massive manipulation, that you've essentially been conned in a way."" As part of her research, Steel set out her own criteria for what makes a cult organisation: they have a charismatic leader or leadership group that closely controls members, the leader or leaders believe they have exclusive access to the truth, and the group is highly secretive about their workings. Janja Lalich, a cult survivor and international expert on cults and coercion, has these elements in her list of common cult traits, including a group that has an ""excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader"" that regard their ""belief system, ideology, and practices as the truth, as law"". Alex's Bible study classes started taking over his life. Then, he found out who was pulling the strings. Over the years, Steel has expanded her definition to take into account behaviours used to control members that are replicated across groups, such as gaslighting and coercive control. ""I've come across groups which do have a leadership that's closely controlling, but they don't necessarily have a leader,"" Steel says. As an example, she points to the Two by Twos, one of many labels outsiders use to describe a religious sect that claims they don't have a name or a leader. Founded more than 100 years ago, the ""really secretive"" group operates throughout rural Australia preaching beliefs that stem from a literal reading of the bible. In a podcast episode dedicated to the group, former member Laura McConnell describes the sect's beliefs as ""in a nutshell, take everything you know about Christianity and make it as conservative as you possibly can and you're pretty close to what they believe in"". ""Everything we share is done through word of mouth or preaching, there is no information written down in books, for instance, which makes the group really difficult to examine and to dissect."" Even though the Two by Twos meet only two of her criteria for a cult, Steel says it's important to define the group as such, ""because if you're not saying that the group is damaging in the way that it operates, then you're not talking about the phenomenon that I'm talking about."" While the Two by Twos are, in some ways, an exception to the definition, Steel says it's striking how often the same types of structures and behaviours pop up in cults all over the globe. In the book, Steel lists some of these as an ""us and them"" mentality, exploitative labour and intense schedules, and restricting access to professional help and the media. An entire chapter is dedicated to coercive control — an insidious pattern of behaviour designed to entrap, isolate and terrify victims. Often the practice is discussed in the context of domestic and family violence, with state governments in NSW and Queensland recently committing to outlawing the behaviour. In cults, there are many ways this type of control plays out — often with the aim of getting people to do what you want. ""Love bombing"" — the act of overwhelming a new recruit with attention and adoration to inspire loyalty — is common, so too is gaslighting, referring to attempts to undermine someone's sense of reality. ""Hot and cold"" treatment by leaders, whereby members are treated with love one minute and scorn the next, is also common. This, Steel writes, can lead to trauma bonding where members adjust their behaviour to get back onto the leader's good side, and begin to blame themselves when they're mistreated. ""There are all of these ways that [leaders] undermine people's self-confidence and have them second-guessing themselves, that keeps them entrapped in the groups,"" she says. Steel would like to see coercive control laws targeted at domestic abuse expanded to include group settings, ""because they're the same tools that are used on a wider group of people, it's all the same stuff"". ""It's controlling people and having them behave in ways they otherwise wouldn't have, handing over their money, monitoring their communications, alienating them from family and friends,"" she says. ""Then people come out of these organisations and the cults won't take any responsibility for them, because they shun anyone that leaves, and they have no help from society because people look at them and say, 'Well you chose to join'."" This victim-blaming mentality once again parallels with the treatment of domestic and family violence survivors, who are time and time again asked: why didn't you just leave? From indoctrination and control, to gurus and 'love bombing' — there's a powerful psychology behind why people join cults, and why they stay. It's perhaps why many former cult members turn to psychologists experienced with domestic abuse — that, and there's a dearth of professionals with specific expertise in cults. For those that do take the leap and leave, the trauma can stay with them for decades to come. Steel says it's rare for former cult members to want to go to the police, but when they do, they're often told no crime has been committed. This lack of recourse, she says, is one of the toughest things for survivors to deal with. ""There's this concept that if you get out, then you're just suddenly free and everything is great,"" Steel says. ""But there are so many people I'm in touch with that are really struggling, and there's very little help for them."" Do As I Say, published by Pan Macmillan Australia, is out on June 28.

55,"Wendy Davis was attacked by the Claremont serial killer in 1990, but wasn't 'listened to'",arts-culture,"  Claremont serial killer survivor Wendy Davis speaks out, hoping her neglect won't be repeated Wendy Davis says she is lucky to be alive after surviving an attack in 1990 from the man who would go on to become the Claremont serial killer. The Claremont serial killings, which took place from 1996 to 1997, led to one of the longest-running and most expensive murder trials in Australia's history. On 24 September, 2020, Bradley Robert Edwards was found guilty of the wilful murder of 23-year-old Jane Rimmer and 27-year-old Ciara Glennon. There was not enough evidence to convict Edwards of the murder of 18-year-old Sarah Spiers, whose remains are yet to be found. Edwards was also charged with assaults on two teenagers in 1988 and 1995, the latter crime involving the brutal abduction and rape of a 17-year-old at Karrakatta Cemetery near Claremont. But there is another, lesser-known crime that Edwards committed at Hollywood Hospital in 1990. Had this crime been better acknowledged it might have been the warning sign that prevented the Claremont serial killings from ever taking place. Wendy Davis was the victim of this crime, and she has written a book about her story titled Don't Make a Fuss: It's Only the Claremont Serial Killer. ""I want people to understand there can be real consequences if women are not listened to when they speak up about violence,"" Ms Davis said. In May 1990, Ms Davis was a 40-year-old social worker in a senior position as a grief counsellor in the palliative care unit of the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital in Nedlands, west of Perth. ""I was in the prime of my life. The mother of three teenage daughters, happily married with two large Rottweilers and a few cats. It was just a normal life."" But that all changed when Edwards set foot in Ms Davis's office. At the time, Edwards worked for Telecom, now Telstra, and was part of a team undertaking work at the hospital. ""He asked if he could use the toilet,"" Ms Davis said. ""There was a lot of stuff going on at the hospital, I didn't think anything was amiss. I sort of grunted and nodded and got back to my work."" Ms Davis heard Edwards move behind her, flush the toilet, then go to the ward door. He then returned and asked Ms Davis's permission to retrieve a pencil from the toilet, which he said he had dropped. ""I just started to think that's a bit strange … and then I thought to myself, 'Hang on, he wasn't in the toilet long enough for the flush to happen,'"" she said. ""And the next thing a cloth came around my face and I was hoicked up on my chair and pulled back towards the toilet with such force that I have never felt anything like that in my life. ""I thought there was something on that cloth, and for those first few seconds I thought I was going to die. ""I can't even describe the feeling. I was sure that was the end of my life."" Ms Davis recalled being pulled up by her neck. ""I had to take a breath in and I realised there was nothing on the cloth and I was still alive. ""That's when I started to really fight."" A struggle ensued, during which the chair fell over and Ms Davis remembered her face being crushed against Edwards's shirt, his arms around her. ""We were very close to the toilet, he was pulling and pulling me, and I got my left leg and kicked as hard as I could — really, really hard. I got him in the shins."" Edwards abruptly let Ms Davis go and she fell back, looking directly at him. ""He was saying, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,'"" she said. ""I ran out of the office. I had one shoe on and the other shoe off, my cardigan was hanging off. I can still put myself back there and feel the absolute terror."" The attack, which lasted in total about 10 seconds, left Ms Davis with bruising on her neck and trauma that would last her whole life. Edwards was found with cable ties in his pocket which were dismissed as usual for Telecom workers. Bradley Edwards is found guilty of the murders of Jane Rimmer and Ciara Glennon in Perth, but a judge rules there is not enough evidence to prove he also killed Sarah Spiers. He was charged with common assault despite admitting to a security guard that he was trying to pull Ms Davis into the toilet. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years' probation in 1990. Ms Davis, who always felt the attack was violent and sexually motivated, discovered during Edwards's murder trial that he was ordered to attend a year-long sex offenders treatment program following the Hollywood Hospital attack. ""I'd been very much aware I was at risk of rape, or worse,"" Ms Davis said. ""I'd been told there wasn't enough evidence to confirm this. ""WA Police and Telecom had dismissed the incident as 'minor', a 'one off', 'out of character', and 'explainable' given my assailant's 'relationship problems' that were occurring at the time."" Too shaken to continue working in the office, Ms Davis left the job she loved. In the following years her marriage broke down, and she partly attributes this to the aftermath of the attack during which Ms Davis suffered from insomnia and terrible anxiety. ""I was so traumatised. My personal relationships were affected. I was less trusting of everybody and didn't feel supported after the attack,"" she said. Edwards not only kept his job after the assault but, in the coming years, would go on to be promoted twice. Ms Davis said her way of coping was to bury the memory. ""I didn't think about it, I didn't talk about it,"" she said. In December 2016, two-and-a-half decades after the attack, a call from WA Police forced Ms Davis to confront her memories. The police were investigating possible links between old crimes and had become increasingly interested in the Hollywood Hospital attack. ""Eventually, of course, in 2016, when Edwards was arrested, all of the trauma that I thought I'd buried successfully just came roaring back with a vengeance,"" Ms Davis said. Over the following two-and-a-half-year trial, Ms Davis would be regularly called on to give information to detectives and WA Police. On December 3, 2019, Ms Davis gave evidence regarding the attack in the District Court of WA. ""That was really the first time I felt properly listened to and validated to be able to face Edwards and know that everybody in that court believed what I was saying and understood how terrifying it was,"" she said. But it was the writing of her book that gave Ms Davis the true catharsis she felt she needed. Throughout its pages Ms Davis regularly reflects on the possibility that the Claremont murders could have been prevented had Edwards's attack on her in 1990 been taken seriously. ""It actually is okay for women to make a fuss, and more importantly it's very, very important that when women do speak up about sexual assault, or any type of violence, that they are listened to,"" Ms Davis said. The final sentences in her book ring true — ""I did my best at the time, but no-one would listen. My only hope is that we are listening better now.""

0,These Asian Australian women theatre makers are changing what theatre looks like and who it's for,arts-culture,"  Sydney Theatre Company and Griffin Theatre Company reshape Australian theatre with works by Asian Australian women When Merlynn Tong was growing up in Singapore she was fascinated by Australia. She recalls the images she saw in advertisements – of the ocean, kangaroos and Sydney Opera House. ""I thought everyone surfed when I moved here,"" she says. ""I lived in Perth, and all my housemates were from the country, so everyone was a farmer. No one knew how to surf and I was really surprised by that."" It's a preoccupation that she shares with the protagonist of her latest play, Golden Blood, which opens at Griffin Theatre Company at the end of June. Golden Blood's main character, named simply Girl and played by Tong, carries a toy koala under her arm and dreams of moving to Australia to study veterinary science. Tong came to Australia at the age of 21 to study theatre, after she worked in advertising for a few years in Singapore. ""I was born as an artist in Australia … Getting my whole education, my inspiration, my mentors, my collaborators – everything has been born here."" Girl gives up her dream of moving to Australia to stay in Singapore with her gangster brother – who moves in with her after their mother dies by suicide when she is 14 and he is 21. But Girl remains attached to a romantic ideal of Australia. ""It feels free there you know / Like everyone respects each other / No lies / No dark history / No oppression / Everyone gets a fair go,"" Girl tells her brother, known only as Boy (played by Charles Wu). Tong laughs: ""I think Girl maybe has done a little bit more research than the real Merlynn has. I don't think I knew the term 'a fair go' [growing up in Singapore]. I think I learned that here actually."" Golden Blood is directed by Griffin associate artistic director Tessa Leong (Wherever She Wanders) — and is one of two plays written and directed by Chinese Australian women to premiere in Sydney this month. The second is Michelle Law's Top Coat, directed by Courtney Stewart (who is incoming artistic director of Brisbane's La Boite). Their works are part of a wave of Asian Australian theatre making by women in 2022 – alongside two upcoming adaptations: Melina Marchetta's Looking for Alibrandi by Vidya Rajan (Malthouse/Belvoir), and Alice Pung's Laurinda by Diana Nguyen (Melbourne Theatre Company). ""[It feels] bloody phenomenal … We're all going up at the same time,"" says Tong. Michelle Law's Top Coat is a body-swap comedy – in the tradition of movies like Freaky Friday and the homegrown Dating the Enemy (which starred a young Claudia Karvan and Guy Pearce). In the play, Chinese Australian manicurist Winnie (Kimie Tsukakoshi) swaps bodies with one of her clients, the white TV executive Kate (Amber McMahon), after a mysterious electrical event. ""It is a story about representation, privilege and what it means to fully embody someone else's life experience,"" explains Law. ""I really wanted people from very different worlds to swap and become aware of their own unconscious biases, and their own assumptions about each other's lives."" Director Courtney Stewart stresses that the play is especially poignant after the lockdowns and enforced isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""I think having an experience where you literally have to walk in someone else's shoes provides us a way back to each other,"" she says. That call to empathy feels timely, if not urgent, at a time of ongoing anti-Asian sentiment in the wake of the pandemic – exemplified in Australia by inflammatory comments from government ministers about China. Some pundits believe that such negative rhetoric led to swings against the Coalition in electorates with large Chinese Australian communities at the election in May. Law makes the point that racism against Asian people has been part of Australian society since Asian people migrated to Australia during the Gold Rush – with a resurgence in the 90s with the rise of One Nation. ""I feel like the last couple of years has really unearthed all of the resentment that people felt towards Asian people in Australia,"" she says. Asian-born Australians make up 10.4 per cent of the overall population, according to the 2016 census. Despite this, Law says, ""you see very little Asian representation in narrative stories – you see it a lot on reality TV, but that reinforces the idea that we're good for cooking and in service roles, as opposed to being a protagonist in a life story"". ""And for me, this [Top Coat] is like a small antidote to that [narrative]."" Golden Blood director Tessa Leong has long admired the work of playwright and actor Merlynn Tong. ""[I feel] a deep love and connection with Merlynn as an artist and what she brings to the stage in her writing and in her performance,"" says Leong. Leong remembers seeing Tong pitch her one-woman play Blue Bones at an arts market in Karratha, Western Australia, after which she rushed to introduce herself to the playwright. Blue Bones went on to premiere in Brisbane in 2017, starring Tong, and won six independent theatre awards, including Best Female Actor, Best New Australian Work and Best Mainstage Production. Golden Blood is the first time that Tong has worked with an Asian Australian woman as director on one of her shows – and their similar cultural backgrounds mean that they have a kind of ""shorthand"" in the rehearsal room. ""Things to do with being a woman, and things to do with being Asian, we just have that in common already, so I don't have to explain too much,"" Tong says. In Golden Blood, Boy hatches a hare-brained plan to make money by encouraging people to invest in bars of gold. ""[Tessa and I] both had the experience of, when you're born, people give you little gold bars and things like that, and how gold and the Chinese culture sometimes is almost hand-in-hand,"" says Tong. That shorthand extends to their audience as well, who may have a richer experience in the theatre if they share Tong's background. She includes jokes in her plays that are geared to people from Singapore and Malaysia. ""As I'm performing, you can hear them laugh and it's so satisfying,"" she says. It's important to her to open up the theatre to neglected audiences – the kinds of people who don't think that theatre is for them. ""People come up to you and tell you that it's one of the first shows they've seen,"" she says. ""It's just wonderful to share that love I have obviously for people similar to me and for the craft that I love so much."" Tessa Leong is also excited to see stories about being Asian Australian – as well as stories told by Asian Australians – in theatres across the country. ""I never thought this would happen within my career, to be perfectly honest,"" she says. ""I have been very used to being the only Asian person in the room everywhere I go."" But she gives credit for this rise – or rather wave of recognition – to Contemporary Asian Australian Performance (CAAP), run by writer, broadcaster, producer and theatre maker Annette Shun Wah. ""[She] has been championing us for decades in all different ways,"" says Leong. ""I think it's easy to forget that in the 80s and the 90s, people like Annette and William [Yang, theatre maker and photographer] were making work and being renowned for that, and it's their efforts that have made this happen."" The Lotus Playwriting Project – an initiative from CAAP and the now-defunct Playwriting Australia designed to address the under-representation of Asian Australian writers in theatre – was a starting point for both Merlynn Tong's Blue Bones and Michelle Law's first play, Single Asian Female. Single Asian Female, which premiered in Brisbane in 2017 – the same year as Blue Bones – before touring Australia, was the first Australian mainstage production with three Asian leads. Law acknowledges the influence of Shun Wah and CAAP, and is pleased that young people have this wave of work by Asian Australians to draw from – and build upon. ""It's really exciting to be part of that wave that's creating opportunities for other people and creating a platform for those voices. Because I never really saw that growing up,"" she says. Top Coat director Courtney Stewart, who also gained experience through CAAP's Directors Initiative, adds: ""[That wave] is why you see so much growth, because when you see it, you can believe it. If you don't see it, you don't know that you can go and do that."" Stewart has assembled a team of Asian Australian creatives to work on Top Coat – including two people from STC's Design Associate Program for First Nations and culturally and linguistically diverse designers: Kate Baldwin as lighting designer, and James Lew as designer. They're joined by assistant director Tiffany Wong and sound designer Michael Toisuta. ""It felt really, really important that we were very considerate about who we were bringing on board to tell the story,"" Stewart says. ""We're not all the same; we all come from different Asian diasporas. I think that point of diversity is really important – the diversity within diversity."" Courtney Stewart's priority when she takes on the role of artistic director at La Boite will be centring and engaging First Nations voices and models of collaboration and creativity. ""We can only understand how we can engage with storytelling in this country if we centre the people who were here first and have been carrying on that tradition for over 60,000 years. To me, I feel like that has to be the way forward,"" she says. She intends to start by listening to First Nations creatives about their history with the company and addressing any issues. ""I want to make that a priority of engaging with that community at every step of the way as I work out what kind of AD the company needs me to be,"" she says. Tessa Leong too is one of many working towards structural change in Australian theatre. She was involved in developing advocacy body Theatre Network Australia's Equity Action Plan – an effort to embed inclusion and diversity in all areas of the industry, including in programming and leadership roles. She is also working on Griffin's Equity Action Plan. For her, the aim of structural change is to embed inclusiveness in organisations, and in artists' practices. ""I feel there's a long way to go … I think we need to work really hard to make sure that we are including everyone from the word go, and that goes across class and income and geography and background,"" she says. The first wave of Asian Australian stories on Australian stages in the 80s and 90s often explored migrant or refugee experiences, overt racism and feelings of 'otherness', says Leong. ""[Those plays were] important for making space for non-white stories being on stage and telling impressive stories of human triumph,"" she says. But now she says there's room for a wider range of stories about Asian Australian experiences. ""It feels to me that we're at a new stage of what Asian Australian art and theatre can be. ""What I'm really excited [about] now is that we're taking another step into a much more nuanced and rich conversation about what it's like to live in a contemporary world that acknowledges many different experiences of culture, heritage and ancestry."" Merlynn Tong almost didn't apply for the Lotus Playwriting Project because she didn't know if she was ""Australian"" enough. But she was encouraged by a colleague to put herself forward – a decision that kickstarted her career. Now, thinking about being programmed by Griffin, whose focus is new Australian work, she feels emotional. ""It's actually really moving for me … It's the acknowledgement that I am a part of this society too, [and] that my work matters,"" says Tong. ""It just feels like it validates my very existence.""

1,"Tom has become 'good at drawing really, really badly' and he urges everyone to try it",arts-culture,"  Tasmanian visual artist Tom O'Hern on how he became 'good at drawing really badly' Artist Tom O'Hern says he'd probably make more money heading out into Tasmania's wild areas with some oils than the art path he has chosen. Instead of mastering landscape, he said he's become good at drawing badly. ""I'd love to be out in the wilderness somewhere with a huge canvas slapping around oil paints,"" O'Hern told ABC Radio Hobart. ""But I keep trying and it just doesn't really work."" The Hobart artist is a painter, drawer, muralist and even animator — think Mambo meets Where the Wild Things Are combined with some good old-fashioned doodling. Over the past 15 years, the 37-year-old's work has become prolific around Hobart, with his quirky murals featuring at schools, in cafes, on boats, inside nightclubs, down alleys and of course — toilets. ""I reckon I've painted 30 toilets around Hobart, probably more. So many toilets,"" he said. ""I would like to paint museums but I'll take what I can get."" O'Hern believes the world is too caught up with everything having to be perfect. ""Everyone is looking at perfect things all the time,"" he said. ""Everything is printed by computers, everything is on a screen and flat."" It's the mistakes and imperfections, he says, that make life interesting. ""Everyone has forgotten that drawing has been around forever and everyone should be able to do it. ""But at some point we got self conscious about it. We get upset if something doesn't look like a photo. ""I guess I'm getting good at drawing badly."" For O'Hern drawing often feels like he is writing. ""Like when I draw a bird or something it's not like I'm trying to draw a realistic bird and get every feather right, it feels like a short hand,"" he said. ""It feels like the beginnings of new hieroglyphics and I'm discovering some sort of written language that doesn't exist yet."" Last weekend O'Hern ran a workshop titled How to draw really, really badly. But, the participants were all good drawers. ""For the ones who were starting out, I said to stop being precious about it,"" he said. ""For the more experienced ones, it's all about the paradox of becoming experienced and you get all this experience and knowledge and that can block creativity because you're coming at it from already knowing what the answer is. ""But it's better to be open and not know what the answer is."" A lot of his work is public murals, and he approaches each one differently. ""I seem to attack them in totally different ways which I'm sure freaks out clients,"" he said. O'Hern went to school at Geilston Bay High on Hobart's eastern shore and then Rosny College before art school. He's been making art since then. ""Everyone starts out really into art, it's just that most people stop being into art at some point,"" he said. He said ""compulsion and an unhealthy addiction to drawing"" has kept him going. ""I thought I'd just keep plugging away, it's a pretty good way to spend time,"" he said. Early in his career he moved to Melbourne and learnt to live very cheaply and worked out of cold, leaky warehouses. His first exhibition was in 2005 in Hobart with some other artists and was based around graffiti and street art using stencils and spray paint. ""It was a totally different thing I was trying to do then,"" he said. ""I now work much more immediately with drawing and seeing what comes out. I try not to slave over stuff as much."" He said people seemed to value how long something took to make. ""The very first thing people ask when I show some art is how long something took, and I really feel like it doesn't make it better if it took ages,"" he said. ""I'm trying to push back on that, sometimes things take me ages and sometimes they don't and often it's the things made quickly I think actually are better."" He said that can be hard to justify, but it's taken him 20 years to work out the craft. O'Hern's current solo exhibition Bum Steer at the Bett Gallery features works he produced on a ""secret island"" over a month. ""I did a drawing a day, sometimes two,"" he said. ""It was a really nice way of working. No sketches, no fixing anything up, just see what happens. ""Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't."" More than half have sold, an achievement not lost on an artist who has done the hard yards. ""I've spent so much time in really cold studios flogging myself, when I could also just be on a beach taking it easy and going for a swim,"" he said. His other major project at the moment is a commissioned public art piece for the Hobart City Council. He believes younger children make the best drawing students. ""You don't really need to tell them anything, they already know what to do,"" he said. ""I don't know when the self consciousness settles in. ""Real little kids will just let rip and it's awesome,"" he said. He takes great pleasure in seeing his daughter draw. ""I was just looking at a picture of an owl my daughter has drawn, and it's exactly what I'm trying to do,"" he said. ""It's just a big free owl that I'll spend all day working myself into something like that. ""It's perfect.""

2,The king of rock ‘n’ roll is brought to life in Baz Luhrmann's luscious biopic Elvis,arts-culture,"  Elvis review: Baz Luhrmann brings The King to life in his signature pop style, with star turns from Austin Butler and Tom Hanks On July 31, 1969, Elvis Presley took to the stage of the International Hotel in Vegas for the first time, still riding the high of his electric 1968 TV special, which had revived his flagging career. What was originally conceived of as a four-week residency at the hotel – a brand new, $60 million development, then the biggest in the world – would spin out into a seven-year stint, bracketing off the final chapter of Presley's tragically curtailed career, the theatre a witness to his descent into a state of narcotised, rhinestone-encrusted stupor. But it had started off so well: the huge theatre and a blue-sky production budget had inspired Elvis to put together a show that achieved new heights of kitschy extravagance. It's surely this Vegas-era Elvis – the jumpsuit-clad crooner, caped and spangled and accompanied by backup singers, a band, and a 40-strong orchestra – that called out to to Baz Luhrmann, himself an incorrigible showman with a bowerbird's eye for things that glitter and shine, and particularly those that are liable to break. Taken collectively, his films advance a thesis that the greatest heartbreak is reserved for the most beautiful people – and who was more beautiful than the strange, pompadoured boy from Tupelo, Mississippi, with a voice like melting butter and those impossibly lascivious hips? With Elvis, Luhrmann – whose last film took as its source material one of the signature works of American literature (The Great Gatsby, from 2016), and the film before that, the mythos of this entire nation (Australia, 2012) – gives the old bazzle-dazzle to what is perhaps his most iconic subject yet. For the story of Elvis Presley is no less than the story of rock 'n' roll, from the backwater shacks and steamy late night clubs of the American south to prime-time national television. And Luhrmann bravely takes it all in his kaleidoscopic sweep: with its often-hyperactive camerawork, the film plays as a 159-minute musical roller-coaster ride through Elvis's 42 years. You're liable to get all shook up, if not from tenderness of feeling then possibly from motion sickness. Stepping into the King's blue suede shoes (well, two-tone) is Austin Butler, a blue-eyed Californian whose previous credits are mostly limited to teeny-bopper TV. A relative unknown, he's able to disappear into the role in a way that a bigger player (like Michael Shannon, playing a paranoid, lonely King in 2016's Elvis & Nixon, for instance) couldn't – if not to the same degree as the enigmatic Michael St. Gerard, whose uncanny resemblance to Presley saw him cast in the role several times in the late 80s and early 90s. Much like Kurt Russell, the one-time Disney teen idol who bagged the lead in John Carpenter's 1979 made-for-TV movie Elvis, Butler gives a performance that should grant him entrée to the pantheon of hot young silver screen stars, as the sweet, soulful centre of this Wonka-esque confection. And it's only fitting that Elvis maketh the star and not the other way around. Even if his name doesn't hold the charge it once did, it's still undeniable that he exerted an influence that would be unimaginable in today's atomised pop-cultural landscape. There can be no bigger name on the poster than ""Elvis"". Less camouflaged, despite being packed in prosthetics, is Tom Hanks, hamming it up in a rare villainous role: the shady former carnie who went by the name Colonel Tom Parker is, as he crows in his voice over narration, ""the man who gave the world Elvis Presley"". He might just be the man who killed him, too – not directly, but via the escalating demands he would place on his client, and then by way of ensuring his access to the pharmacopoeia that, for a time at least, would make it possible for Elvis to fulfil those demands. Back in his sideshow days, before he moved into managing musical talent, the Colonel (as he tells us) specialised in the kind of attractions that elicited feelings the punters ""weren't sure they should enjoy"". The squeals that issue involuntarily from all the girls when the young Elvis shakes his hips on stage – ""Well, that's alright, mama,"" he drawls – tell Tom Parker that this kid has an act he can do something with; here was ""the greatest carnival attraction"" he'd ever seen. The story unfolds – in a prismatic fashion, zipping giddily back and forward in time – nominally from the Colonel's perspective: his wheedling narration is a bid for absolution, though scene after scene works to condemn him. The film's sidelong look at its subject evokes Citizen Kane, perhaps cinema's definitive depiction of the process by which wild success transmutes into loneliness and narcissism. Like Kane, whose dying utterance of ""rosebud"" baffled even those who were once closest to him, Butler's Elvis – Luhrmann's Elvis – ultimately remains elusive; a larger-than-life figure able to be known only through so many layers of mediation – through his gold sunglasses and the camera lens. ""This ain't a nostalgia show,"" Butler's Elvis tells the musicians assembled on the International stage during rehearsal, and they launch into a beefed-up, flourish-laden version of That's All Right, the Arthur Crudup song that had been his debut single 16 years prior. (Crudup appears in the film played by Gary Clark Jr., his sultry blues an illicit thrill for the adolescent Elvis, played by Chaydon Jay.) Tops Arts & Culture headlines. No one will be surprised to hear that Luhrmann's Elvis isn't a nostalgia show either – after all, the film is stamped with the golden insignia of the man who dressed Romeo in an aloha shirt and had a fin de siècle French courtesan sing Elton John. The musical anachronism that felt egregious in The Great Gatsby, a story that is on some level about taste, plays better here – and I say this as someone who felt a pang of dread on seeing the words ""Edge of Reality (Tame Impala Remix)"" on the soundtrack listing. It works in part because there's a discernible logic to the more outré numbers: Doja Cat's Vegas, woven into a scene of Black nightlife on Memphis' Beale Street, gives Hound Dog back to Big Mama Thornton, the first artist to record the track (played on-screen by Shonka Dukureh); Eminem's The King and I, though confined to the credits, draws a line between two white artists raised in a Black milieu, who drew on a Black idiom. But it's also because Elvis himself, once just a boy with ""greasy hair"" and ""girly make-up"" who dreamed of buying a hot pink Cadillac, always defied good taste. In his landmark 1968 TV special, he sandwiched a musical number set in a brothel between a gospel medley and a ""kung fu spectacular"". The King didn't discriminate – and it's precisely for that reason that he would come to define rock 'n' roll. Luhrmann is no Elvis Presley, but you gotta love a spirited impersonation.

3,From opium dens to artist hub: How a regional Queensland city is evolving,arts-culture,"  Maryborough warehouse transformed to house Gatakers Creative Space for booming arts scene Once known for its many watering holes, opium dens and brothels, this Queensland town is being transformed into a working space for artists. Observant visitors can still notice the signs of the wild and vibrant times when Maryborough's port provided an entry point into the state during the gold rush of the 1800s. There are a lot of pubs in Maryborough — not just one on every corner, but several on every block. Local artists have created street art that tips the hat to some of the more interesting characters from the city's golden era, including the Inspector of Nuisances and a Polish beer baron. But it's the incredible historic buildings that really hint at the money that once flowed through the streets. After years of being overlooked, Maryborough's built environment is getting a new lease on life as the Fraser Coast Regional Council (FCRC) transforms them into public spaces. ""People want to really get in touch with being creative in one shape or form,"" said FCRC senior arts coordinator Trevor Spohr. The most recent project converted the former Netterfield and Palmer warehouse into a space designed to inspire and encourage local artists, now named Gatakers Creative Space. With a clay space, print room, digital installation abilities, workshops and artisan shop, the building's renovation was practical while celebrating a time when pioneers and sailors would purchase and load supplies at the site. ""We had some architects up from Brisbane and they told us it is one of the most intact warehouses of its type in the country,"" Mr Spohr said. ""Everyone wants to move in here now."" Monumental canvases are sprawled across the timber floor in the warehouse loft and a woman is hunched over one, splashing paint in large colourful spirals. Maryborough artist Sue Mclean was the first to take advantage of Gatakers Creative Space, working on her Earth Beneath Our Feet series which celebrates microbes. Ms Mclean was overwhelmed to have access to a large contemporary space in which to paint. ""This is truly paradise,"" she said. ""I've done residencies before and they have been in small confined spaces. ""With this, you walk in and you feel like you are on the streets of Paris or New York."" Cast iron Roman columns, an ornate cedar staircase and a vaulted hoop pine ceiling — most likely sourced when timber was still cut from the World Heritage-listed K'gari Fraser Island — have all been preserved and highlighted in the space. But the biggest benefit of the makeover, according to Mr Spohr, was that local artists now had place in which to work and meet. ""That is what this space is about,"" he said. ""If you are a beginner, or an advanced artist, a professional, this space is open to anybody that wants to use it."" For Ms Mclean, having access to the space motivated her to focus on her artwork and she pointed to a broader impact on regional Queensland artists. ""High ceilings, huge walls to paint on, it's a sense of place that stimulates you to want to paint better,"" she said. ""So often art is focused on the major cities, but to have an example of support in the community, for the importance of creativity, is really powerful. ""I think this space has many opportunities for everyone."" Mr Spohr hoped the space would become a second home for the local community. But he also wanted its use to be led by residents, allowing them to decide what happened inside the building. ""People will be able to be a part of a bigger picture,"" Mr Spohr said. ""We are open to suggestions on what this space can be used for."" ABC Wide Bay will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

4,"Art gallery donor Bob Sredersas was a member of Nazi intelligence, report finds ",arts-culture,"  Wollongong Art Gallery benefactor Bob Sredersas was Nazi collaborator, report concludes A report on a major art donor to the Wollongong Art Gallery has found he was a member of Nazi intelligence during the German occupation of Lithuania in World War II. Bronius ""Bob"" Sredersas, who died in 1982 and donated around 100 art works by revered Australian artists including Grace Cossington-Smith and Arthur Streeton, has a room named after him at the gallery. After being alerted to his past by a former Wollongong councillor, an investigation was launched by the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies and the Sydney Jewish Museum. The Board of Deputies said a media report confirming Mr Sredersas was an intelligence officer with the Nazi security service was true. But a spokesperson said the organisation would not comment further until after meeting with Wollongong City Council and the investigator from the Sydney Jewish Museum later this week. Wollongong's lord mayor Gordon Bradbery also said he was aware the investigation was now complete, but could not comment on its findings until after the meeting. ""I have been briefed but I can't comment,"" he said. ""An agreement [was reached] between the Jewish museum and the council at this stage to meet, look at the content, and discuss how we represent the collection therein after. ""Just out of respect for the Jewish community, and more specifically Jewish Museum researchers, we are just waiting for that meeting. ""We have got to have that get together and then it will it be an ongoing effort on the part of both to represent that collection in a way that's respectful."" Mr Bradbery said ultimately the collection and its history would have to be narrated in a way that presents its history to the community and to the rest of the world.

5,'I dedicate her to the mothers that serve': Portrait of breastfeeding servicewoman wins Defence art prize,arts-culture,"  Portrait of breastfeeding servicewoman wins Napier Waller Art Prize for 2022 A portrait portraying the conflict between being a mother and an Army service member has won a prestigious art prize, run by the Australian War Memorial. Retired major Anneke Jamieson won the 2022 Napier Waller Art Prize for her portrait titled The Promotion. The Napier Waller Art Prize is open to all current and former service personnel in the Australian Defence Force, and is intended to encourage artistic excellence, promote the transformative power of creativity, and raise awareness of the experiences and talent of service personnel. This year's winning artwork of a servicewoman in uniform breastfeeding her child is now set to join the War Memorial's national collection. In her artist's statement, Mrs Jamieson said The Promotion was an expression of her conflict between being a mother and being a service member in the Army. ""The mother in me could never make peace with the officer I wanted to be,""  she said. ""While pregnant with our first child I planned my return from maternity leave, blind to the person I would become when promoted to mother."" ""I've always admired the leaders I've served with – they give so much of themselves for their people. When our second and third children arrived, it was evident I couldn't be both the officer I wanted to be and the mother I needed to be."" Mrs Jamieson said the servicewoman in the portrait was not meant to be her, but the work had been inspired by her own experiences and the experiences of others around her. She dedicated the portrait to all service members who are also mothers, and to their families. ""I had incredible support from my husband and Army but it didn't change my capacity to give of myself. Nor did watching friends manage the conflict with grace and determination. My choice was difficult but obvious and, in the end, empowering,"" she said. ""But she is not me. She is the woman whose career came first. She has dedicated herself to her soldiers and her service and achieved so much. Yet now, as a new mother, she has returned from maternity leave changed in ways she never imagined; this promotion might be her greatest challenge yet. ""I dedicate her to the mothers that serve; to their sacrifices and conflicted hearts and to the families who support them."" Glen Braithwaite's submission, titled Falling Flying Driving Drowning, is ink and bleach painted on a canvas made from recycled Commando comics and a shredded slouch hat, and was one of the 14 highly commended works this year. He said the piece, which is mounted on a 360-degree rotating bracket that allows any part of the painting to be the top, was an exploration of him ""unlearning unconscious biases"" surrounding post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and military service. ""I've got some unconscious biases – now conscious biases – around PTSD and trauma because I've been on operations, I've seen things, and my perspective of those things I've seen was 'okay, yeah, that was terrible', but I didn't take away any trauma from it, and yet a person standing next to me has trauma,"" he said. ""I couldn't understand why people had trauma, and it wasn't until I went: 'You know what? I need to look at it from their perspective'. ""Their perspective, their history, what they've grown up with, the cumulative effects of their upbringing, are all things that contribute to how they look at the world."" Mr Braithwaite said shredding and incorporating both his first slouch hat and Commando comics he read as a child represented his life experiences being the foundation on which he saw the world. ""I suddenly realised that I needed to incorporate my history into the canvas. I am who I am because of how I grew up and my experiences, and so that ended up being shredded and incorporated,"" he said. ""That's my acknowledgement that a person has their own experience that aren't mine, and I needed to understand that their shredded canvas is probably quite different to my shredded canvas."" He said he hoped anyone who saw Falling Flying Diving Drowning could see it as an invitation to consider other perspectives and begin examining unconscious biases they might have. ""However they do that, whatever the subject is, by looking at something from a different perspective it's going to give you a better understanding, or at least an appreciation or some empathy for what it is you're looking at,"" he said.

6,'I dedicate her to the mothers that serve': Portrait of breastfeeding servicewoman wins Defence art prize,arts-culture,"  Portrait of breastfeeding servicewoman wins Napier Waller Art Prize for 2022 A portrait portraying the conflict between being a mother and an Army service member has won a prestigious art prize, run by the Australian War Memorial. Retired major Anneke Jamieson won the 2022 Napier Waller Art Prize for her portrait titled The Promotion. The Napier Waller Art Prize is open to all current and former service personnel in the Australian Defence Force, and is intended to encourage artistic excellence, promote the transformative power of creativity, and raise awareness of the experiences and talent of service personnel. This year's winning artwork of a servicewoman in uniform breastfeeding her child is now set to join the War Memorial's national collection. In her artist's statement, Mrs Jamieson said The Promotion was an expression of her conflict between being a mother and being a service member in the Army. ""The mother in me could never make peace with the officer I wanted to be,""  she said. ""While pregnant with our first child I planned my return from maternity leave, blind to the person I would become when promoted to mother."" ""I've always admired the leaders I've served with – they give so much of themselves for their people. When our second and third children arrived, it was evident I couldn't be both the officer I wanted to be and the mother I needed to be."" Mrs Jamieson said the servicewoman in the portrait was not meant to be her, but the work had been inspired by her own experiences and the experiences of others around her. She dedicated the portrait to all service members who are also mothers, and to their families. ""I had incredible support from my husband and Army but it didn't change my capacity to give of myself. Nor did watching friends manage the conflict with grace and determination. My choice was difficult but obvious and, in the end, empowering,"" she said. ""But she is not me. She is the woman whose career came first. She has dedicated herself to her soldiers and her service and achieved so much. Yet now, as a new mother, she has returned from maternity leave changed in ways she never imagined; this promotion might be her greatest challenge yet. ""I dedicate her to the mothers that serve; to their sacrifices and conflicted hearts and to the families who support them."" Glen Braithwaite's submission, titled Falling Flying Driving Drowning, is ink and bleach painted on a canvas made from recycled Commando comics and a shredded slouch hat, and was one of the 14 highly commended works this year.

7,She brought the bikini to Australia and put the Gold Coast on the map. Paula Stafford dies aged 102,arts-culture,"  Paula Stafford, the iconic Gold Coast designer who brought the bikini to Australia, dies aged 102 Iconic Gold Coast fashion designer Paula Stafford, who introduced the bikini to Australia, has died at the age of 102. Stafford's fashion empire included swimwear, day and evening wear, and men's wear, and by 1964 it was the second largest industry on the Gold Coast behind sand mining. But when she cut her first one-piece swimsuit in half, Stafford said she had not even ""heard the name 'bikini'"". ""I called mine a two-piece,"" she said in a 2014 interview with the ABC. ""Eventually I learned to call them bikinis. It seemed to be a good marketing idea."" While the bikini was invented in 1946 by Frenchman Louis Réard, Stafford popularised the then-controversial swimwear design and put the Gold Coast on the map in the process. While she made her first two-piece for personal use, Stafford said ""people kept wanting what I was wearing"". ""So I decided it might be a good idea to have an extra income,"" she said. ""I just thought I was doing something normal that I enjoyed doing, and I was so fortunate that all the family came into the business with me."" The bikini surged to prominence in 1952 when a women wearing a Stafford design was ordered to leave a beach for being immodest. Stafford responded by sending five women wearing her bikinis to the beach in what became an infamous PR stunt. ""I never paid for publicity, the media came to me,"" she said. ""It was quite incredible."" Stafford said swimwear became ""an industry"" for her, with her business exporting bikinis to London and New York employing at least 50 women and her family members. ""It grew so rapidly that we had to build a special factory in which to put the machines,"" Stafford said. While her business started with just four machines, it ended with more than 40. The Stafford bikini became synonymous with the Gold Coast at a time the city was considered more of a beachside town. ""It was a lot of work, and time involved in it, but I was happy to do it,"" she said. ""I knew it was going to be a city. I knew it needed promotion. And Australia needed to know about the Gold Coast."" Lydia Pearson from famed Queensland fashion label Easton Pearson told the ABC in 2020 that Stafford was a pioneer in the Australia industry. ""Australia's always been cutting edge for beachwear because our lives revolve around the beach, and so there she was — making the perfect product in the perfect place at the perfect time,"" she said. Stafford was born in 1920 and studied maths, chemistry, and physics at Melbourne Girls Grammar. While she wanted to become an architect, Stafford said the headmistress advised her to pursue a ""more feminine"" career. ""Hence dress design came into the picture,"" she said. Stafford said she gave up the business in the 1990s before it eventually diminished. ""By then I was a bit laissez-faire,"" she said. ""It's no good looking back and saying 'I should have done this, I should have done that'. I did what I did and that was it. ""You can't have regrets, can you.""

8,Only Tornado GR4 on display outside the UK arrives in Perth,arts-culture,"  Tornado GR4 flown in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria goes on permanent display in Perth Perth's Aviation Heritage Museum is celebrating the arrival of a Tornado GR4 to its collection of historic aircraft after a long campaign. Royal Australian Air Force Association (RAAFA) WA head Ian Craig says the organisation began applying to get the aircraft, which the public can see from next month at the Bull Creek museum, from the United Kingdom three years ago. ""We started this campaign in June 2019 so it's been exactly three years,"" Mr Craig told Christine Layton on ABC Radio Perth. ""It's the only Tornado in the world, the GR4, [on display] outside of the UK. ""If anybody likes Top Gun, then this is the jet to come and see."" Wing Commander Erica Ferguson, head of heritage and stories for the Royal Air Force (RAF), said it was an easy decision to choose the RAAFA museum from the 63 applications she received for the decommissioned aircraft. ""When I saw how great the stories already being told out at Bull Creek were and how amazingly skilled and dedicated the volunteers and staff were there, it was quite an easy choice to make,"" she said. ""My job is to ensure the important stories of the men and women of the Royal Air Force can be told to a broad audience, and what broader audience could we get than out here in Western Australia? ""It's a real honour to bring the jet here."" Wing Commander Ferguson started her career as an air traffic controller, largely controlling the Tornadoes that were the backbone of RAF operations for more than 30 years. ""It's a multi-role combat aircraft. We had fighter variants, bomber variants, and photo-reconnaissance aircraft,"" she said. ""This one [brought to Perth] was one of the ground attack aircraft. ""They played a really important role in both Gulf wars, in operations in Afghanistan, in Iraq. ""Most recently, back in 2019, just before this aircraft was retired from service, she was participating in the operations over Syria against ISIS."" Not all decommissioned military aircraft go into museums, but Wing Commander Ferguson said it was considered essential that some did. ""It's important because it's a tool for telling the important stories of those who've flown and operated the aircraft over time."" Despite being a high-powered machine, the Tornado was not flown to Perth from the UK but disassembled and shipped over. ""In order to fly here, it would have been such an enormous cost and logistic issue with refuelling and staging through different places. It was far more efficient to bring her by ship,"" Wing Commander Ferguson said. ""She was dismantled into parts very carefully by the same skilled team who came out with me to put it back together. ""It took about six weeks on the ship, we all became ship spotters. ""Then I brought a team out of six Royal Air Force technicians who have put her back together. She's a complicated aircraft because she has swing wings, wings that can go backwards to increase the speed."" Mr Craig said the arrival of the Tornado had aroused huge excitement among the community, particularly veterans. ""We have a whole Tornado community in Australia, so many exchange pilots who actually flew our aircraft. There are a lot of technicians who worked on them in the UK,"" he said. He said it also brought the collection into a new era of reflecting on more recent wars and conflicts. ""We have one of only 17 Lancasters left in the world, we have a Spitfire, we have a Dakota, we have a Catalina,"" he said. ""Our collection is world-renowned and it's sitting here in little old Perth in Bull Creek, it's just amazing that we've got this collection here. ""What the Tornado really means is that we're moving now into a new era of more modern aircraft. ""This is the start and we've got some more aircraft coming."" The public's first chance to see the Tornado will be at a community open weekend on July 2 and 3.

10,'Calm and tranquil' Bundaleer Forest continues to inspire artists during winter solstice,arts-culture,"  Belalie Arts Society celebrates winter solstice picnic in ode to South Australia's Bundaleer Forest For 20 years, a group of artists and arts enthusiasts have met in the Bundaleer Forest, 220 kilometres north of Adelaide, to pay homage to the winter solstice. The shortest day of the year is celebrated across the world by different cultures, with rituals varying from nude beach swimming to lantern festivals and bonfires. For the Belalie Arts Society members, it was not just about the winter solstice but a chance to seek creativity in the shadows of the grand trees that marked the birthplace of Australian forestry, dating back to 1875. The group ran a three-day Bundaleer arts festival among ancient towering trees just south of Jamestown, where art and music intertwined with nature. They held an annual picnic on the Sunday closest to the winter solstice to be inspired with new ideas for the next festival, and while the festival last took place in 2013, the members still gathered in friendship. The ageing membership meant this year's gathering was indoors at the Belalie Arts Society Gallery. John Voumard said the picnics were family occasions. ""It was very much an Aussie-style interpretation — getting together over a country chop barbecue with some good wine and company,"" Mr Voumard said. ""We set up the tradition of having a fire and sitting around by the sculptures and just enjoying the Bundaleer Forest, with a glass of mulled wine, in the mist, in a Drizabone. ""The kids would wander through the forest walks after lunch, and the parents would tend to sit around the fire dreaming up big ideas about what we could do at the next Bundaleer Festival event. ""It's very calm and tranquil, and in the middle of winter with the mist and the grey clouds, it just has its own special atmosphere."" Artist Helen Pammenter, 94, spent about 25 years trying to capture the beauty of the forest. ""I would often get down there 7am or 7.30 in the morning,"" she said. ""The light in the forest changed so quickly that in one spot, you would have so many different variations of that same view. ""The colours were just beautiful first thing in the morning with the light shimmering through this huge canopy of trees, and then you have the contrast of the rich umbre of pine trees, standing near a magnificent huge white gum tree."" Mrs Pammenter said she enjoyed the stillness of the forest. ""It's the unexpectedness of it, the quietness of it,"" she said. ""The fact that I was there by myself and could really absorb the forest, and I found, as I progressed, that I needed to be outside to absorb it, and I just loved being down there. ""It's hard to get the beauty of it unless you're there. ""I wanted other people to realise what a beautiful place it was."" For 40 years, artist Cherry Wehrmann has driven through the forest to reach her home, living in the shadow of the exotic and native trees. She has also painted many scenes from the forest. ""I'm inspired by the light at certain times of the day. There's shadows and light — it's sort of mystical, I guess,"" Ms Wehrmann said. ""My grandparents used to live in Jamestown, and we used to come here for a drive when I was a child. ""I just feel really privileged to live amongst the trees. I just love it."" Jenni Frost, who helped coordinate the Bundaleer Festivals, said the winter solstice picnic was a really good wind down and debrief for the Arts Society members in the forest environment. ""Even though it was mid-winter and the shortest day and could be very cold and damp, it was just a beautiful environment in nature to do all that rethink and re-imagine what we're doing,"" Ms Frost said. ""The festival was in the forest. It blended in with that environment. ""It's a special place."" The winter solstice meetings were popular. ""I guess everyone hunkers down a little bit in the middle of winter, and when everyone else was at home, we would dare to go out and sit in the forest and warm our hands around a hot cup of tea around a thermos and talk,"" Ms Frost said. ""It made it quite unique, and it was nurturing.""

11,"This museum houses a one-of-a-kind piece of equipment, but a funding cut could force its closure",arts-culture,"  SA Water funding cuts to community-led steam museum at Cobdlogla may result in closure Funding for a volunteer-led community museum that preserves a one-of-a-kind piece of irrigation technology could be slashed in a state government budget cut. The Cobdogla Irrigation and Steam Museum in South Australia's Riverland houses a range of machinery and artefacts relating to the early days of irrigation in the region. It includes the heritage-listed Humphrey Pump, which the area's irrigators used to draw water from the Murray River from the late 1920s until 1965. It is the only one of its kind in the world that is operational, although has not been fired up in years. The museum and the pump are maintained by volunteers, with the help of about $70,000 a year in funding from state-owned SA Water. It has been 36 years since the group first came together. However, they have been advised that their funding will not be renewed. Cobdogla Steam Friends Society president Robin Bawden said the volunteers were ""really upset"" with the news. ""Over the past 30-odd years members have put in over 6,000 hours a year of voluntary work,"" he said. ""They've always tried to cut back on our funding but we didn't know they'd cut it off. ""Without continuity of funding a museum can't work. Some of our projects, like the big steam traction engine. It took us 15 years to do it and an awful lot of work."" What's your Australian Story?  The ABC has been uncovering ordinary Australians with extraordinary stories from all corners of the country for the past 90 years. Submit your Australian Story now. In a statement, SA Water said the current sponsorship agreement for the museum was clear that alternative funding would need to be sought after June 30 this year. ""We are committed to working together with the Cobdogla Steam Friends Society to explore alternate options for the future of the local irrigation and steam museum site,"" the statement said. ""We have confirmed to the society that we will provide continued financial support for the next six months while we work together to find and assess potential funding and operating models for the future."" Some of the museums attractions are heritage listed and would need to still be maintained, even if the museum were to close. Mr Bawden said finding new funding sources had been difficult. ""Times are pretty tough now, especially in the Riverland. We've looked for local sponsors but with the price of grapes right down there's not a lot of spare money floating around,"" he said. ""Without ongoing funding there is no future and it would be terribly sad if a living part of the Riverland's past was just abandoned. ""We can't even pay the insurance with the gate takings. It's a museum that cannot operate without further support."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Riverland's weekly email newsletter.

12,Ukrainian dance students find refuge in Australia's circus community,arts-culture,"  On a cold winter's day, three Ukrainian performers rush down to Sydney's Dee Why beach to take selfies, darting from the waves crashing on the shoreline. Maria, Liza and Vlada had never been to Australia before Russia invaded Ukraine. This particular day, they are celebrating singer Liza's arrival to Sydney – also her 25th birthday. ""I wake up in Australia with the ocean,"" Liza says, ""It's the best gift."" Her best friend Vlada agrees: ""It's like a film, it's like a dream."" The three dancers are among nearly 300 students from the Kyiv Municipal Academy of Performing and Circus Arts who fled the war and are now training in schools abroad. Former circus performer Jasmine Straga has been a crucial part of connecting the Ukrainian students – like Maria, Liza and Vlada – with schools across the globe. Ms Straga, from Sydney's Northern Beaches, is a board member of the World Circus Federation and part of the Global Alliance of Circus Schools. When she saw the call for help from the Kyiv academy, she knew she needed to help. ""To lose the arts in the Ukraine would be to lose hundreds of years of culture,"" Ms Straga says. Actors, illusionists, circus performers and dancing students have been billeted in schools across Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Italy and France. Ms Straga has helped to get about 200 adult circus artists out of Ukraine, and tried to keep teachers with as many students as possible so they could continue their curriculum. The Kyiv Academy's deputy director, Nina Araya, said she was amazed by Ms Straga's generosity. ""She started to connect all the schools, and after that I started to have dozens and dozens offering help,"" Ms Araya says from Prague, where she is now coordinating the students. ""This war shows that those people who we thought would be our friends do horrible things to us, and people who we never saw before personally, we never met, offer so much help."" While the academy has secured help for nearly 300 students, just as many remain in Ukraine. For some it is their choice. When Vlada heard she could come to Australia two months ago, it was bittersweet to leave her family behind. ""The day they called me and said you can come here and dance, and live here in a safe place, I was so shocked,"" she told The Drum. It has been two months since Vlada came to Australia, and her father is now a soldier fighting for Ukraine, so she doesn't hear from him as much as she would like. ""I just need to know he's alive now and everything is OK,"" Vlada said. She worries too about her mother, who lives in Zaporizhzhia, which is near Mariupol, the port city now under Russian control. ""They haven't got food in this town,"" she explains. ""Some days I am just crying and crying because it is so hard when your mum says: 'Vlada there are explosions, now it is bombing'."" Maria's mother and sister are in Poland, which they thought would only be temporary, and they are planning to return to be with her father and grandparents in Ternopil in western Ukraine. Her father has a heart condition and is unable to fight, but according to law he cannot leave the country — and he wouldn't anyway. In recent days, rocket attacks have begun near where her family lives. Each student needs extra support to deal with the trauma of what they experienced, their school leader Nina Araya said. She has heard stories of students ""walking on the street with the dead bodies"" as they left their country. ""It's not normal. We try to support them to make a family here."" That's why Ms Straga feels like a mum to the three young women in Australia, aged 19, 21 and 25. ""I was kind of on autopilot, and then when the girls came to Australia I spent a week crying because I bottled everything up for so long,"" Ms Straga told The Drum. The girls are now getting their training for free from the Lee Academy in Tuggerah. Ms Straga's crowdsourcing has raised more than $22,000 for the dancers in Australia and abroad. On top of that, she has coordinated families to pay for flights and accommodation and arrange clothing donations. The hardest part now, as food prices increase, is keeping them fed. The student performers have applied for bridging visas and will apply for the three-year Temporary Humanitarian Concern Visa, also known as the 786 visa, so they can access medical treatment. The Home Affairs Department told The Drum that 1,100 Ukrainian nationals have been granted 786 visas. Since the conflict began in February, the Department has granted 8,000 mostly temporary visas, but only 3,200 Ukrainians have arrived in the country. Vlada and Maria have been meeting new friends, exploring their new home, and learning new dance styles. ""My family is so happy that I am in a safe place and I can continue to do my dancing,"" Maria said. Maria always knew she wanted to dance and follow in her choreographer mother's footsteps. ""Even if the war ended now, dance is the last thing that Ukraine needs, but of course I come back to Ukraine and I want to teach and I want to show all my experience with Ukrainians,"" Maria said. Returning to the Kyiv Academy could be some time away. They can no longer train where they had before the war, because it has now become a makeshift hospital. But the students hope that sometime in the near future they will be able to dance together again.

14,"'We're still called natives on plaques': Colonial heritage bid needs First Nations support, but it's a long road ahead",arts-culture,"  Aboriginal voices to inform World Heritage bid for South Australia's systematic colonisation A council in South Australia's mid north is looking to enact an Aboriginal reconciliation plan as it prepares to launch a joint bid for UNESCO World Heritage listing to celebrate the state's colonial past. The Clare and Gilbert Valleys Council sits within the Ngadjuri nation, and chief executive Helen Macdonald said the bid was an opportunity to tell the whole story of colonisation with perspectives from both sides. ""The expectation is once there is a World Heritage listing, it puts you into prominence globally, it's the opportunity to be listed as a tourist attraction, particularly for those who are interested in British colonial history,"" Dr Macdonald said. ""The other major aspect that has to be dealt with is how our First Nations people are going to be incorporated into the process because the area covers the Kaurna, Ngadjuri and Peramangk nations. ""They have to be engaged and included and recognised in the process as well and they need to give permission to say that they want to participate in the process so that work has to be undertaken as well."" Quenten Agius is a Ngadjuri traditional owner who teaches local Aboriginal history and sits on the council's reconciliation advisory group, established last year. He said the bid showed there was still a long way to go towards reconciliation. ""At the end of the day, you have to be truthful about how the state was set up,"" Mr Agius said. ""It was set up as a free state but it didn't eventuate like that from the beginning. ""The issue is Aboriginal people today haven't got a voice."" Mr Agius compared the heritage bid with his efforts to protect centuries-old scar trees from being chopped down for firewood. ""They want the tokenism stuff but they don't make any commitments. None of those councils in any of those areas want to commit anything for the Indigenous people,"" he said. ""They talk about value-adding to existing infrastructure and existing businesses, and they want to be fair and equitable. Why is there no Indigenous business set up in their main streets?"" Mr Aguis said the character of the towns was judged from first impressions but there was little beyond memorials to European explorers. ""You can acknowledge the white history, but not our history, when you come into this township,"" he said. ""We're still called 'natives' on the plaques. It's the 21st century and you can't find that person's name, you can't even acknowledge that person. ""When are we going to walk side by side and acknowledge each other when we come into the towns?"" Traditional owners in Queensland are working with councils to forge a path towards reconciliation. Dr Macdonald said the council was working to improve its level of input from Aboriginal people through its advisory group. ""Quenten is right. Clare Council, indeed probably any council on Ngadjuri country, has not made substantive steps with respect to reconciliation,"" she said. ""We will have a reconciliation plan put to council in the next few months, so that is the start of taking those steps. ""Once the reconciliation committee is put in place we can move forward with having discussions about what is their perspective with respect to this World Heritage bid."" The multi-council World Heritage proposal is a consolidation of two separate attempts to have South Australia's colonial planning model acknowledged on the world stage. It began in 2013 with the Mount Lofty Ranges proposal, backed by regional councils to demonstrate a successful model of systematic colonisation often known as the Wakefield system, which relied on settlement fees and no convict labour. In 2018, the Adelaide City Council initiated its own colonial heritage potential bid centred on the city's grid and parkland encircled design. The two projects are now joined under the working title of Adelaide and its Rural Settlement Landscapes, with its core narrative stating it to be ""the most complete realisation of British colonial settlement planning in the world.""

16,'We're not all country': The new generation of boot scooting line dancers,arts-culture,"  Line dancing is gaining popularity in Darwin with a new generation of dancers It's a dance commonly associated with cowboy boots and country towns, but the age-old pastime is starting to find its way into the hearts of even the most hardened city slickers. In Darwin, the Top End Mustangs have been line dancing around the Northern Territory for more than 20 years, and the group's secretary Carol Penglase said it was growing in popularity. ""There are around three to four clubs here and the dancers mix between clubs,"" she said. ""We have members as young as eight to as old as 80, so there's quite a span there of people who line dance here."" This month, they partnered with best friends Claire Harris and Kate Strong, who've quit their jobs to line dance across the country and raise money for rural and regional charities. ""We've got one different charity for each state that we're going through and they're all rural focused or help rural people, but they're all a little bit different,"" Ms Harris said. The pair have travelled around Queensland and through parts of South Australia, before zipping up the Stuart Highway from Alice Springs to Darwin, stopping in at iconic Territory landmarks along the way. ""It's just so much fun and we're getting to meet incredible people,"" Ms Strong said. Line dancing consists of basic moves that can be mixed and matched to create different dance routines. ""You have grapevines and rocking chairs and your toe heel stomps and those sort of things,"" Ms Strong said. ""You have all of your basic moves and you can put them all in a different sequence or in a different speed, there's so much variety in all of them."" Ms Strong said the flexibility of line dancing makes it accessible for dancers of all abilities. ""It can be as easy or as hard as you would like it to be,"" she said. ""You don't have to have any previous training or dancing experience because it's one that's easy to get involved in and you can take it as far as you want."" Ms Strong and Ms Harris want to break the demographic stereotypes associated with line dancing and get more young people involved. Ms Strong said she hoped their road trip would help get more young people onto the dance floor. ""Most of the line dancing groups that are currently around are older ladies that are typically retired,"" she said. ""We're really wanting to break that and share the love of line dancing for all, because everyone can get involved and have absolutely the best time with it."" Carol Penglase from the Top End Mustangs said the benefits of line dancing were endless. ""[It's good] for your physical fitness, for your health and wellbeing, for that socialising and community aspect,"" she said. For older dancers who may be experiencing dementia, she said line dancing could help them exercise their memories. ""We have quite a few dancers who've been dancing for 20 years,"" she said. ""It has a lot of benefits, but really it's all about fun and community and making friends."" Ms Harris and Ms Strong were drawn to line dancing because of its versatility, surprised by how perfectly the routines fit to a wide genre of music. ""There are 128,000 types of line dances,"" Ms Strong said. ""And every dance varies so much."" Ms Penglase from the Top End Mustangs said people might associate line dancing with just country music, but the routines can be performed to pop and even rock and roll. ""We dance to a lot of new songs that are out on the radio, like Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits, Shivers,"" she said. ""We're not all country, the genres are mixed right across and it draws different people in because they go 'ooh I like that song'."" She said the pair's road trip was great way to raise the profile of line dancing across the country and to young people. ""We're very humbled to Claire and Kate for asking us to be part of it.""

18,The biggest moments from the 2022 Logie Awards,arts-culture,"  A win for representation and a 'cheating' skit were among the memorable 2022 Logie Awards moments After a three-year break, the Logie Awards came back in 2022 — and with a bang. These were the biggest moments of the night: Australian of the year Dylan Alcott and ABC presenter Tony Armstrong presented the award for Most Outstanding Sports Coverage. Both Armstrong and Alcott spoke about what it meant for them to be up on that stage. Alcott spoke about this year's event being a win for representation. “To be honest, having an Indigenous man and a guy in a wheelchair up here, on commercial TV …"" ""We’ve got a long way to go to get representation, but it’s massive,” Alcott said. Legendary sports broadcaster Bruce McAvaney received a standing ovation from the audience at the Gold Coast Convention Centre when he was inducted into the TV Week Logie Hall of Fame. ""It is undeniable that so many of Australia's most iconic sporting moments have been made much more memorable by the words of Bruce McAvaney,"" said former AFL player and coach Leigh Matthews, who presented the lifetime achievement award. Accepting the industry-voted award on stage, McAvaney said: ""I am emotional but my voice is not as strong as it should be tonight. ""I wondered how I'd feel tonight when I walked up here. I feel a lot of love actually and a lot of warmth."" In 2017, McAvaney revealed he was diagnosed with leukaemia two years previously after an abnormal blood test. Last year the 69-year-old stepped back from AFL commentary ahead of the 2021 season but said he wasn't reconsidering retirement. Ms Wilkinson's interview with Brittany Higgins won the Logie for Most Outstanding News Coverage or Public Affairs Report. She said that, after 40 years in journalism, it was ""by far"" the most important work she had ever done. ""I knew it from the very first phone call I had early last year with a young woman whose name she told me was Brittany Higgins,"" she said. ""Four incredibly intense, sleepless weeks later, when our story went to air, the entire country knew the name Brittany Higgins."" ""This honour belongs to Brittany."" While presenting the award for Most Popular Reality Program, Australian comedy duo Hamish Blake and Andy Lee spoke of how voting in the Logies ""cannot be rigged"" as Australians can only vote once. The duo then launched into a skit that blamed Karl Stefanovic for cheating in the Gold Logie race. Blake and Lee brought out a young boy Oliver who claimed he had been kept in a room for hours, forced to vote repeatedly for one of the nominees. ""Oliver, who is the person who made you do this?"" Blake and Lee asked. ""It was Karl Stefanovic,"" Oliver responded. Blake and Lee asked how many votes he was forced to send in, to which the boy replied ""thousands"". This category opened with a tribute to Neighbours, production of which will come to an end later this year. Natalie Bassingthwaighte said many people who have won this Logie have come from the show. However, this year's award went to ABC Breakfast's Armstrong, who took the opportunity to thank his mum. ""There's a lot of people I need to thank,"" he said. ""The old cheese, my mum, she is a superstar. [She] has done everything for me and has been a superstar and I would not be up here without her, so a big thanks to her. ""Please give her a clap, she will love it back home."" Here is the full list of winners for the Logie Awards 2022 In his true style, Blake brought his funny antics into his speech. ""This counts for three. Oh my God. That is — I've won one two years ago. To win four of these is … that's too much."" Earlier in the evening, Blake also won the inaugural Bert Newton award. The late Bert Newton's wife, Patti Newton, announced the winner for this award.

19,"Queer drama about teen male friendship wins $60,000 Sydney Film Festival prize",arts-culture,"  Belgian film Close, about teen male friendship, wins Sydney Film Festival's top prize Belgian director Lukas Dhont has won Sydney Film Festival's $60,000 Sydney Film Prize for ""audacious, cutting-edge and courageous"" film for his queer teen tragedy Close, about a powerful friendship between two 13-year-old boys that is ruptured by their transition to high school — with tragic results. The film, which screened in Sydney off the back of winning the Grand Prix (second prize) at Cannes, was praised by the Sydney Film Festival jury as ""a tender, moving, powerful film. A mature film about innocence"". Dhont's film won against a field of 11 other films that included Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner Utama, Berlinale Golden Bear winner Alcarràs, three films straight from Cannes' Un Certain Regard line-up, and two Australian films: Archibald Prize-winning artist Del Kathryn Barton's feature debut Blaze, and Goran Stolevski's witch fable You Won't Be Alone. It was a line-up notable for stories with teen protagonists: a boy searching for his father, in Mexican drama The Box; a 12-year-old girl whose imagination becomes a tool for surviving trauma, in Blaze; an under-loved nine-year-old who blossoms over summer with relatives, in Irish-language film The Quiet Girl; and the gaggle of children and teens enjoying one last summer on their family's land, in Catalonian drama Alcarràs. Presenting the award at Sydney Film Festival's closing ceremony on Sunday evening at the State Theatre, the jury, led by actor/director David Wenham, said Close ""displayed a mastery of restraint, subtle handling of story, astute observations and delicate attention to finer details"". Close is highly personal to Dhont, who found inspiration when he returned to his primary school and re-examined his early male friendships and sexuality: ""The memories came flooding back of going to school at that time, when it was really tough to be my true, unfiltered self,"" he said in press notes for the film. In Close, we meet 13-year-olds Léo (Eden Dambrine) and Rémi (Gustav De Waele) on the cusp of secondary school, and experience their powerful, intimate but uncomplicated friendship — then watch as this bond is strained, and ultimately ruptured, under the scrutiny of their peers. Accepting the award via a video message, Dhont said: ""We wanted to make a film about friendship and connection after a moment in time where we all understood its necessity and power."" The film will be released in Australia by Madman Entertainment. This year's Documentary Australia Award was awarded to Luke Cornish for Keep Stepping, which takes viewers into the street dance subculture, through the prism of Australia's flagship annual competition, Destructive Steps. In their statement, the jury, led by Documentary Australia CEO Mitzi Goldman, said: ""The community showcased in the film have much to tell us about family, identity, belonging, hard work, testing our limits, love and acceptance. The film is sensitively crafted, beautifully shot and edited and its characters mesmerising. This is a generation that have something to say and are asking us to listen. It is far more than a film about the dynamic subculture of street dance."" 2022 represented a 'return to normal' for Sydney Film Festival, which was online-only in 2020, and postponed twice in 2021 due to COVID-19, before opening in November — initially with a reduced audience capacity of 75 per cent. This year, the festival opened in June as normal, with full capacity audiences. While masks were worn by all venue staff, they were not mandatory for audience members. While last year's festival was a hybrid of in-cinema and digital screenings, this year was in-cinema only. Artistic director Nashen Moodley told ABC RN's The Screen Show: ""The turnaround from November to June is extremely tight for us; usually we have a year between festivals."" But he said the festival is considering bringing back an 'at home' component for future editions: ""We know what the technology can do; we appreciate it a great deal. And I think looking forward, we'll see where we can best employ it for the festival to connect with audiences. ""At the same time, we know very clearly from our audience research, from our own experience, that the fundamental thing about the Sydney Film Festival — and I think all film festivals — is that in-cinema experience; that is best not just for the audience, and for the filmmakers and for the festival, it's [also] in terms of how the business works. ""And whereas [previously] you had an eagerness for people (rights holders, filmmakers, sales agents, distributors) to explore this technology, as cinemas reopen there's greater reluctance to put films online.""

22,Pilbara stalwart remembers famous furry friend Red Dog,arts-culture,"  Pilbara stalwart remembers famous furry friend Red Dog WA's Pilbara region is known for its blue sky, red dirt — and Red Dog. The iconic stray roamed the state in the 1970s, hitching rides and travelling throughout the region and even as far south as Perth. And although he died more than four decades ago, Red Dog is still alive in the hearts of locals, including Pilbara stalwart Ian Waterstrom — who has lived in the mostly transient region for almost 50 years. It's believed Red Dog was born in Paraburdoo in about 1971 and touched so many lives he became the subject of a book and globally renowned film. One of the rides he hitched was the workers' shuttle bus that Mr Waterstrom would use to travel from Karratha to his job in the burgeoning resources industry. For Mr Waterstrom, his strongest memory of the loveable dog was his pungent smell and fierce defence of his seat on the bus. ""He smelt terrible. I don't think anyone ever washed him … you couldn't get near him,"" he said. ""You could not sit next to him. He'd bite you. He was a really angry bit of gear."" Ultimately the workers' affections for Red Dog shone through, and he would be allowed to sleep in the workshop, where he had memorised all the best cool spots to sleep away from the Pilbara heat. ""He knew where all the air-conditioned areas were,"" Mr Waterstrom said. ""He'd just curl up on the floor and sleep. We'd bust open a bag of rags, and he'd make a nest, and he'd sleep for a couple of hours."" Mr Waterstrom's connection with Red Dog continued later in life when he had a role in the 2011 movie as an extra. ""They used to rub you down with this red dust … [made of] ochre or something, and they'd paint you with all this stuff to make you look like you've been working all day,"" he said. Mr Waterstom first arrived in the Pilbara 49 years ago. He was attracted to the red dirt for work and drove more than 4,100 kilometres from Melbourne to Paraburdoo. He later relocated to Karratha. The Ashburton Shire, which includes Paraburdoo, celebrated its 50th birthday this month and Mr Waterstrom said the region had undergone vast changes since he arrived. ""We lobbed there in summer, so that was a bit scary,"" he said. ""Some houses had no fence at all and no lawn, just dirt. You look at it now, and you've got amenities we never ever had.""

23,Acclaim and international exposure for Townsville's thriving street art scene,arts-culture,"  Thriving Townsville street art scene 'on par' with world's best, says public art researcher It may seem unlikely to some but this North Queensland city is fast emerging as a hot spot on the international street art map. Buildings in Townsville's CBD are adorned with eye-catching art that has transformed the city into a head-turning public gallery. The colourful works form the basis of a Griffith University investigation into how public art is used to drive urban regeneration and boost social capital. Researcher Dr Tony Matthews assessed 26 artworks that form part of a public art walking tour. ""They were right on par with anything you would see internationally in terms of quality of art, quality of delivery, quality of materials, choice of location,"" he said. ""Townsville is way out in front."" The city was one of three regional Queensland locations picked for the investigation, which involved researchers interviewing key producers of public art, elected officials, urban planners and public art specialists. The findings have been published in the international journal Cities, which Dr Matthews believes will thrust Townsville onto the international stage. ""The major importance of this research is not that it looks at public art, but also that it looks at regional cities in Australia that are doing really well and are coming up and should be of attention internationally,"" he said. ""We were very happy to give Townsville the nod as a place that has been quietly impressing me in a number of ways for a number of years."" But it hasn't happened overnight. When Townsville artist Garth Jankovic arrived in the city in 1992 the scene didn't exist. ""I was pretty much the OG [original gangster],"" he said. ""I just started painting street art graffiti in probably illegal spots in the early days. ""The council came on board in the late '90s and started actively participating and nurturing the scene."" Working alongside friend Nicky Prior, Jankovic pioneered combining First Nations scenes and Euro street styles to create the mural Girroogul and the soap tree, which forms part of the street art walking trail. ""If you go to Melbourne, it's very European graffiti style,""Jankovic says. ""Townsville's a bit more, you know, you have a bit more understanding of the demographic [and] if you combine street art and graffiti with traditional stuff, you win over a lot more people."" The 48-year-old has been so instrumental to the scene, his portrait features on the art trail, painted by mentee and good friend Lee Harnden. ""I don't go there often because it spins me out,"" Jankovic said. The Griffith University study identified a variety of figurative and abstract styles and vivid colours. Dr Matthews said, considering the quality of the works, more could be done to promote the trail as a tourism drawcard. ""I know the city has a walking guide for the public art trail and it's quite popular with tourists and has brought tourists in,"" he said. ""But I think it could market itself more aggressively as a regional cultural hub, attracting those kinds of short-stay visits using public art in part as one of the attractors."" Townsville City Councillor Liam Mooney said it was an ongoing project. ""We are always looking for diverse street artists to work with and for property owners within our CBD and beyond to have a canvas for these artists to work on as well,"" he said. Councillor Mooney welcomed the Griffith University study findings. ""It legitimises what I believe — that we should be spending our time, our effort, our resources on art spaces,"" he said. Jankovic said the Townsville street art scene reflected the character of north Queensland. ""It really makes people that come there think that it's not just an outback town, or a sea town or a tropical town,"" he said. ""It's a bit of a melting pot of all those things put together and I think the street art really captures that.""

25,Many in this group didn't think they could write. Now their work is part of a newly published book,arts-culture,"  Clunes Writers' Group celebrates first-time authors with Unmasked: An Anthology When Robert Sidler joined the Clunes Writers' Group, it was with a degree of trepidation. Now he is a published author whose works feature in an anthology from Australia's famed book town. Each autumn, the tiny town, 36 kilometres north of Ballarat, is the destination for writers and readers to share their stories during the annual Clunes Booktown Festival. It seems appropriate then that there is a book that shares the stories of Clunes' own writing collective. The Clunes Writers' Group officially launched Unmasked: An Anthology at the Clunes Neighbourhood House in May. It is a collection of the group's short stories, poetry, prose and haikus from the past two years. For many of the 18 contributors, including Sidler, it was their first time as a published writer. Clunes Writers' Group convenor Patsy Skinner said people who joined the group were often surprised, not just that they had a story to tell, but also by how interested others were in those stories. ""Often, the first comment is, 'I can't really write. I'm not a writer. The wonderful thing is to see them gaining confidence,"" Ms Skinner said. When Robert [Sidler] first came to us from Ballarat, he didn't know anyone here. ""In the early days when he was coming, there weren't a lot of men either."" What actually happens to the slush pile of unsolicited manuscripts that are sent to publishers by wannabe writers? Rhonda Christian's works had appeared in an earlier Clunes Writers' Group booklet titled Write Along. However, she said, seeing her words appear in a professionally bound book that had the potential to appear in a bookshop or library gave her a real sense of satisfaction. ""It gives you a sense of validation,"" Christian said. ""I think [seeing your work in a published form] validates those thoughts and ideas because they are able to be appreciated by other people. ""As a writer, you want people to get to know who you are, and this does that."" Unmasked, as an idea, was born two and a half years ago. Members from the group were locked down like just about everyone else in Victoria, with little to no opportunity for face-to-face contact. Over the next two years, Unmasked grew into a collection of 150 individual pieces. Some are stories of 1,000 words or more. Others are poems with fewer than 20. ""We began by feeling like some of our writing [during that time] should be shared,"" Ms Skinner said. ""We wanted the opportunity to put it down in black and white, so we felt like we were really authors of our own work. ""It was also to recognise so many people's experiences [during that time] … their stories are interesting to other people."" The Clunes Writers' Group includes well-known Melbourne poet Ken Smeaton and Castlemaine Poetry Readings prize winner Gail Oliver. Others had not even attempted creative writing before joining the group. ""This bunch come from so many different backgrounds and from so many different places,"" Ms Skinner said. ""We have people who have moved [to] Clunes in the past few years from the big cities, from other states, but we also have people who have lived in Clunes all their lives and like to write about the great environment we live in. ""There are writers like Ken Smeaton who has been in the Melbourne poetry scene for many years, but there are also writers who have come along to the group with no experience and who are very unsure about it."" Sidler read his piece Once Again at the Unmasked book launch: For a moment I thought I couldn't write anymore Or was it I didn't want to anymore Either way, Words were somehow too hard to find Or put into pictures Then I looked in a dictionary Stuck my head in a thesaurus Listened to some songs Found something to write about A touch of motivation A taste for creation And once again the joy, The pleasure and the pain of writing Was upon me ""He is a writer who can put his words and thoughts down very quickly. Quite often, he will compose a poem in a matter of minutes,"" Ms Skinner said. ""His ideas and thoughts just seem to resonate with other people."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Ballarat's weekly email newsletter. Judi Palmer moved to Clunes in 1998 and joined the writers' group in 2018. She said joining a group helped get things going, but it was not the only way to start writing. ""You have to just sit down and write,"" Palmer said. ""A lot of people [in the group] write because they had a traumatic experience. Others write anecdotes from their day-to-day life. ""Take an idea from anywhere and just start writing. You don't have to be good at it, to begin with.""

26,'We wouldn't honour asbestos': Push to rename Churchill's Big Cigar,arts-culture,"  Community group says it's time for Churchill's Big Cigar to get a new name It's known locally as the Big Cigar, but locals in the Victorian town of Churchill are taking action to ensure their town monument no longer appears on lists of Australia's big things. The 32-metre-tall spire in Churchill, south-east of Melbourne, has carried the unofficial name for decades and there are varying stories surrounding its origin. According to local urban legend, the monument was built as a tribute to the town's namesake, World War II British prime minister Winston Churchill, because he loved cigars. But Churchill and District Community Association president Margaret Guthrie said that was ""actually incorrect"". The spire was commissioned in 1967 by Victoria's Housing Commission when it was planned the town would house 40,000 residences to service an expected 20 or more power stations to be built in the Latrobe Valley. The association successfully applied to Latrobe City Council to register the name ""Churchill Town Symbol"" on the Victorian Register of Geographic Names, in a bid to recognise the artistic value and origin of the monument. ""It was designed to be a beacon … It's about having information recorded for posterity if you like,"" Ms Guthrie said. Ms Guthrie said she hoped more awareness of the monument would lift its profile and the association hoped the spire's lights would also be restored. In modern times, cigars and cigarettes are not objects paid tribute to. Across the mountain ranges, the Big Cigarette, formerly a chimney in a tobacco plant, was removed in Myrtleford. Quit Victoria director Dr Sarah White welcomed the community push and said making sure people knew Churchill's town symbol was called just that – and not the Big Cigar – was important. ""I think it is a good move, we wouldn't honour asbestos in any way or tolerate anything that could be seen to be in adoration of asbestos and cigarettes have killed more people,"" Dr White said.

27,"Meet Justin Beaker, Quacky Chan and the Duck Knight, the racing ducks of north Queensland ",arts-culture,"  Meet Justin Beaker, Quacky Chan and the Duck Knight, the racing ducks of north Queensland According to Craig Melville, you haven't seen it all until you've seen his racing ducks. What started as a bet between with his wife, Ruth, quickly turned into a business for the North Queensland couple, who attracted solid crowds to the Mackay Show this week. Ducks named Justin Beaker, Quacky Chan, the Duck Knight and Kim Karquackian jostled at the starting line, each distinguished by different coloured bandanas. Craig Melville said the creative names were the result of brainstorming sessions. ""It involves red wine and Great Northern [beer] and usually, by the end of it, we have to put a pencil through a few of the names that we can't say in front of the children,"" he said. As the sound of trumpets blast through the speakers, a crowd draws around the gates. A countdown begins and the race is off, with the Indian runner ducks racing up a ramp, down the slide, through traffic cones and tunnels. ""Our friend has pig racing and we bet my wife that she couldn't get the ducks to run like pigs do,"" Mr Melville said. ""Within three days we were ready for a race. ""You never met my wife. She will do anything to prove you're wrong."" It only took Mrs Melville a couple of days to teach a duck, named Madonna, to race. ""She's been with us seven years … she's starting to get a bit slow and Ruth is getting a bit teary,"" Mr Melville said. ""Ruth talks to her and she looks up with one eye and looks into her eyes."" Mrs Melville said her husband bet her a new car, which she has enjoyed driving these past couple of years. ""My husband is always challenging me. ""Some things [that] he thinks animals can't do, I think they can."" She said by working with the ducks' strengths and making them feel comfortable, it was not hard. ""We treat them like royalty, and they have a lovely life on the farm."" The couple run an educational property outside of Townsville, which school students attend. They have also operated an animal nursery for more than 25 years. The idea of travelling with the animals grew from a friend pleading with Mr Melville to bring some of his farm animals to a struggling shopping centre. Mr Melville acknowledged that some people in the show circuit did not care for their animals properly. ""There's people that are a little bit, 'How you going?', but that's why we're not cheap,"" he said. ""We charge a fair whack of money so we can put that back into the animals. ""We've got four llamas … a Mediterranean miniature donkey … when you add animals of that quality, you have to really look after them."" Verity Hatfield, 17, travels with Mr and Mrs Melville to work in the animal nursery. ""I've always wanted to work with animals,"" she said. ""We start in Townsville and we go about eight hours to Emerald and then we work our way back up the coast towards Cairns. ""I sell the feed cups and make sure the animals are not being harmed, and are treated nicely by people."" Mr Melville said Indian runner ducks were very clever. ""They've got a thought process for problem solving,"" he said. ""We've got other ducks at home that can pull a string and open a gate … all sorts of stuff. ""We know all the different habits of all the different animals. He said racing was stimulating for the ducks and was working on improvements to the racecourse. Mr Melville said all you have to do is work with an animal's strength, make the wrong things hard and the right thing easy. ""As soon as an animal learns to learn, they switch on and want more of it. ""If you want to train an animal, take them out of their own environment, because when you're on the road, you are the only thing they know. ""You're their safety blanket.""

28,'First time I've actually felt seen': Viewers praise new emotional Bluey episodes,arts-culture,"  Bluey praised for representation of Auslan community and fertility in episodes Turtleboy and Onesies Australia's internationally celebrated children's show Bluey is making grown adults cry (again) for its representation of three new characters. Bluey, which is made by Brisbane-based Ludo Studio, is renowned for its unexpected hard-hitting moments on issues including friendship, parenting, pregnancy, even death. Two new episodes from the latest season, Turtleboy and Onesies, are no exception. In Turtleboy, Bingo finds a toy turtle at the playground and wants to take him home, but her dad Bandit says ""it's not the done thing"". Fans have described their delight at watching the moment the episode introduces newcomer Dougie and his mum, voiced by actress Miranda Tapsell. Dougie, based on a cavoodle, is profoundly deaf and uses Auslan to communicate with his hearing mum, who signs and speaks. The Bluey official Facebook page is full of praise from viewers to the creators for including signing characters in the show but not making it the focus of the episode. ""Thank you for turtle boy. My 5 year old suffered unknown hearing loss last year and now wears hearing aids. My favourite part about this episode is that you didn't even make it a thing. Bluey at it's best. Also I'm not crying you're crying (yes dear, happy tears),"" Elspeth Singe wrote. ""So loved this episode for our hearing impaired son. It was great for our whole family to watch. Love to see more of this character,"" Nic Ky wrote. ""Thank you so much for including signing characters and AUSLAN interpreting. Representation truly matters. And just when you think Bluey can't get any better… you all had me in tears,"" Megan Louise wrote. Ludo Studio worked with consultants from not-for-profit service provider Deaf Connect to authentically create the Auslan interaction between Dougie and his mum, which includes 62 Auslan handshapes and signs. Alex Fisher from Deaf Connect told ABC Kids Early Education there were challenges in helping create the animated Auslan. ""The characters in Bluey have four fingers on each hand which meant we were limited in some of the signs we could use, particularly if they required fingerspelling (if there is no Auslan sign for a word, the word is spelled using letters made on fingers/hands),"" Ms Fisher said. ""In addition to handshape considerations, it's important to use correct orientation, location, movement, and non-manual features. ""There were a few changes made along the way to correctly reflect this after the scenes started to come together."" You can watch Turtleboy on ABC view in usual format and with full Auslan translation. Hot off the heels of releasing Turtleboy, Bluey hit its viewers right in the feels with Onesies. The episode was highly anticipated by fans of the show because it brings in mum Chilli's sister Brandy, voiced by Australian actress Rose Byrne, for the first time. There had been fan theories as to why Brandy and Chilli hadn't spoken in years, but no-one saw this coming. After coming over for a visit and giving her nieces Bluey and Bingo onesies as a present, it's evident Brandy feels awkward around the kids and her sister, and tries to leave. Later, Bluey asks her mum why Brandy is sad and why they've only seen her once in their lives. Over a montage of Brandy playing with Bingo, Chilli alludes that her sister can't have children: ""There's something aunty Brandy wants more than anything as well but she can't have it, and there's not really anything anyone can do."" Viewers have shared their struggles with fertility on the Bluey Facebook page, and thanked the show for addressing the issue with empathy. ""Woah, that hit this IVF mumma HARD. This is the first time I've actually felt 'seen', and I'm just sad that it's taken a childrens' cartoon to make me feel this way. Thank you to the writers for addressing such an intensely emotional subject, for so many, with such kindness, empathy and consideration,"" Allana Handley wrote. ""I was not ready for this episode. Such a sensitive topic handled by the Bluey team with the kindness and grace they are known for. Beautifully done. I'm sure there are many viewers out there this morning having some big feels,"" Rhiannon Connon wrote. Director of the Fertility Society of Australia and New Zealand, Manuela Toledo, said the episode was a good way to start a conversation with children about fertility. ""Every prep classroom has at least one or two children who are there as a result of fertility treatment, so it's an incredibly common thing,"" Dr Toledo said. ""There's lots of different causes of fertility, that program's not appropriate to go into why Brandy didn't have a baby or wants to have a baby and can't have a baby at the moment. ""It's really important to understand it's not just medical infertility, where people try and they can't have a baby. ""There's also lots of social factors that might come into it. ""Maybe she's a single woman and hasn't been able to find a sperm donor, or maybe she's in a same-sex relationship and they haven't been able to utilise sperm or they haven't been successful with a sperm donor. ""There's lots of other things that could be going on in the background, but I think the important thing is that it actually opens that conversation."" Bluey is an inexhaustible six year-old Blue Heeler dog, who loves to play and turns everyday family life into extraordinary adventures, developing her imagination as well as her mental, physical and emotional resilience. Onesies is not the first episode of Bluey to address fertility. In the season two episode The Show, Bingo is pretending to be her mum during an impromptu Mother's Day performance and has a balloon tucked under her shirt like ""a baby in her belly"". When the accidentally balloon pops, Bandit reaches out and touches his wife's hand. While the show doesn't explicitly say so, viewers commented it was a subtle and sensitive way of representing pregnancy loss. Bluey is available in Australia on ABC kids and iview.

29,"Guy Sebastian had 'barrow to push' against former manager, court told",arts-culture,"  Guy Sebastian had 'barrow to push' against former manager accused of embezzling $800,000, court told Musician Guy Sebastian had a ""barrow to push"" and was ""evasive"" when he gave evidence against his ex-manager Titus Day in an embezzlement trial, a Sydney jury has been told. Mr Day, 49, pleaded not guilty in the NSW District Court to 50 charges over the alleged embezzlement of nearly $900,000 from Sebastian, who he managed for a decade. After a lengthy trial that began in early May, Mr Day's barrister Dominic Toomey SC today began his closing address by reminding jurors they cannot find Mr Day guilty unless they are satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that he used the money dishonestly. Sebastian has previously told the court that Mr Day controlled almost every aspect of his professional affairs, including the execution of contracts, and he didn't read through every document presented to him to sign. ""We submit to you that Mr Sebastian presented as a person who had a barrow to push,"" Mr Toomey told jurors. ""He had an agenda. In his answers to questions that I put to him, you might think that he was evasive. ""Indeed, I would like to suggest to you that if I had put to Mr Sebastian the proposition that the sun rises in the east, he might have asked me what I was insinuating."" Mr Toomey said this was in ""stark contrast"" to when Sebastian answered questions from the Crown, when he was cooperative and gave short answers. At the centre of the case are funds allegedly owed to Sebastian, including through royalties and performance fees, which Mr Day is accused of embezzling. The court heard the singer was introduced to Mr Day in 2007 and signed a contract with his then-employer 22 Management, but in 2009 Mr Day poached Sebastian for his own breakaway management company, 6 Degrees. Mr Toomey today said Sebastian would often ""go off on a narrative of his own"" in response to questions while being cross-examined. ""He twisted himself in knots in his evidence in an attempt not to acknowledge the existence of an agreement between him and Mr Day,"" he said. ""He could not bring himself to use the word contract in reference to his arrangement with Mr Day."" Mr Toomey suggested this was because Sebastian believed doing so may be against his interests. Last week, Judge Timothy Gartelmann directed jurors to find Mr Day not guilty of three embezzlement counts, however, 47 remained. The remaining counts relate to just over $882,600. Mr Day elected not to give evidence during the trial and Judge Gartelmann today gave the jury 10 extensive directions about the submissions made by the Crown during its closing address. The judge emphasised that the Crown has the onus of proof. ""[Mr Day] has a right to silence,"" Judge Gartelmann said. ""He exercised that right to silence in not giving or calling any evidence. ""It does not amount to any admission of guilt. No inference can be drawn against him because of it.""

31,Lightyear pairs the Toy Story space ranger with a cute robot cat but fails to live up to buzz,arts-culture,"  Disney’s Lightyear reimagines Toy Story’s Buzz as a human but fails to evoke the joy of the beloved original The release of the first trailer for Lightyear, the Toy Story spin-off centred on the franchise's beloved Space Ranger, occasioned a tweet from its leading man that was received as the ramblings of a sphinx. ""This isn't Buzz Lightyear the toy,"" wrote Chris Evans. ""This is the origin story of the human Buzz Lightyear that the toy is based on."" Evans's words do actually make sense – Lightyear the film, he wanted his followers to know, is about the character himself, and not the action figure voiced by Tim Allen in Toy Storys 1 through 4. If the tweet reads as nonsensical, I'd say it has a lot more to do with the convoluted, creatively bankrupt concept than the actual syntax. (A film based on a fictional toy might strike as less flimsy, less immediately objectionable, than one based on Pop-Tarts or Flamin' Hot Cheetos, but not by much.) In Hollywood's quest to turn everything it touches into IP, audiences are becoming ever more entangled in a Gordian knot's worth of not just sequels and prequels, but spin-offs, reboots, and 'requels' too – and now this. Just as well writers Jason Headley and Angus MacLane, who also directs, seem to have found a cleaner hook since Evans's December, 2020 tweet. An opening intertitle announces Lightyear as the film that begat the action figure – that is, the film that led Andy, the owner beloved by the original Toy Story's rag-tag toy gang, to ditch Tom Hanks's Woody and the associated cowboy memorabilia in favour of flashier spaceman merch. Tops Arts & Culture headlines. With apologies for being a buzzkill (ahem), I gotta say that I can't imagine Lightyear inspiring any such fervour in the kiddies of today. Not least because Headley and MacLane – after making a point of nailing down exactly where this film is supposed to sit in the Toy Story universe – utterly fail to deliver on the premise. Though it borrows candidly from classics of interstellar travel (Star Wars; 2001: A Space Odyssey), Lightyear offers little of the goofily heroic charm that made the animated action figure so endearing. Allen's character's lofty proclamations about reaching Star Command and his mission logs were funny because they were being issued by a small plastic man, oblivious to the true nature of his existence. ""You are a TOOOY!"" an exasperated Woody bellows at an undeterred Buzz in one of the 1995 film's most memorable moments. But there is no such irony in the self-serious dedication of the new – or should that be old? – Buzz. (In that sense, Captain America is probably a good choice for the role.) When he finds himself marooned – together with his commanding officer and pal Alisha Hawthorne (Orange is the New Black's Uzo Aduba) and a giant spaceship's-worth of fellow rangers – on a hostile planet with their fuel source, a ""hyperspeed crystal"", destroyed, Buzz throws himself into the task of getting them all home again. This means launching himself on a series of round trip missions in order to test out his jerry-rigged crystals (the process looks like making a multi-flavour Slurpee, why not?). Unfortunately, the vagaries of time dilation mean that each time Buzz returns, everyone else is years older, and more and more settled on the planet he wants to escape: fleeting glimpses of Alisha's wedding, the birth of her daughter, and her 40th anniversary whiz by in a montage. (The film's lesson about the dangers of workaholism will surely resonate with kids everywhere.) When the scary, Transformer-esque Zurg (voiced by James Brolin) makes his entrance and begins wreaking havoc (for reasons unknown), Buzz pivots to combating him – the hero assisted by an obligatory cutesy sidekick, the robotic cat Sox (Peter Sohn), and a gaggle of cadets helmed by Alisha's granddaughter Izzy (Keke Palmer, Hustlers). (It's left to this crew, rounded out by Taika Waititi and Dale Soules, another Orange is the New Black alum, to handle much of what passes for laugh lines in this film.) This conflict fizzles almost as gracelessly as it was introduced: the revelation of Zurg's nefarious motivations fails to make sense of the arch-rivalry that characterised the relationship between the toy versions of him and Buzz. Which brings us back to the fact that this film ultimately fails to embody the mythology it claims for itself. In Toy Story 2, Woody discovers that he's the product of an old TV show called Woody's Round-Up, snippets of which suggest a riff on Howdy Doody, with a puppet Woody happily issuing his rootin'-tootin' one-liners. By contrast, nothing about Lightyear suggests that it could have been made and watched by Andy in 1995, except maybe the irksome animatronic cat. (His catchphrase: ""beep boop beep boop"".) Nothing about Lightyear suggests that, should the boy have seen it, he would've become enamoured with space travel. Even though the landscapes are handsomely rendered and Michael Giacchino's score is often stirring, there's none of the silly flash promised by the character's neon green and purple iconography. Perhaps there's no better distillation of the gap between toy Buzz and 'human' Buzz than the way in which ""To infinity, and beyond!"", a loving parody of a high camp hero's bombast, here becomes an earnest affirmation shared by him and Alisha, signed off with a gentle touching of index fingers. The line should soar – it's rousing and meaningless! – but Headley and MacLane insist on making it weighty. They pull it right back down to Earth, or whatever the heck planet they're on. Part of Woody's task in the original Toy Story is coaxing Buzz through the existential crisis that comes with the eventual revelation of his PVC identity. ""Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger!"" blurts Woody. You said it, pal. Lightyear is in cinemas now.

32,Kardashian cafe claim revealed as fake news but Davidson shows fans he's the real deal,arts-culture,"  SNL star Pete Davidson thrills fans in FNQ but Kim Kardashian cafe claim is fake news False claims that reality TV star Kim Kardashian was holidaying in far north Queensland have been revealed as a promotional stunt. The ABC reported the fabricated story by a Cairns café owner after he posted a comment on social media claiming Ms Kardashian and her actor and comedian boyfriend Pete Davidson had dined in his establishment. Café owner Matt Black was interviewed by ABC radio but later admitted the story was untrue. Comedian and Saturday Night Live star Davidson is in far north Queensland ahead of filming for comedy film Wizards! expected to start next week. Photos of Davidson posing with fans have been posted on social media. In the recorded interview run on ABC radio, Mr Black claimed he'd initially been approached by the couple's security. Then, he said, ""Sure enough, in walked bloody Kimmy K and Pete Davidson"". After the ABC aired the interview and published an online story, doubts about the claims emerged. A spokesperson for the Wizards! film production team later confirmed Ms Kardashian was not in Cairns. Mr Black told the ABC he'd made the comments as a joke and thought it would be ""a small, unharmful piece of promo"" for his café. ""The small, little story was to get people having a little excitement about celebs being around town,"" he said. Pictures of the couple holidaying in a tropical destination, published by the ABC, were reportedly taken in Tahiti, while Ms Kardashian was photographed in Los Angeles earlier this week. Editor's note (17/6/2022): The ABC has updated this story from an earlier version which stated that Kim Kardashian had visited a Cairns cafe and been photographed on a Queensland beach.

33,A young widow is harassed by a monstrous parade of men in Alex Garland’s creepy horror film Men,arts-culture,"  New horror movie Men attempts to join class of elevated horror flicks Midsommar and Hereditary but falls short In England, no one can hear you scream. That seems to be the premise of Alex Garland's Men, whose grief-stricken protagonist (Jessie Buckley) lets out feral, earth-quaking bellows in all manner of places: the bathtub, a church, the claustrophobic hallways of a country manor. Each time, her roars go unheard by those around her, even as they risk shattering an errant wine glass in the cinema. Buckley is Harper Marlowe, a recent widow whose husband James (Paapa Essiedu), in a fit of rage, tripped – or jumped – off a high-rise balcony, a tragedy rendered in syrupy slow motion in Men's opening shot. Harper can only gaze on in abject horror as James falls past her, limned in an impressionistic sunset glow – a sight that returns to haunt us again and again. In the aftermath, Harper retreats to an off-grid estate for the weekend, ostensibly hoping to shed her grief with a salve as old as time: crisp country air and nature, hours away from any signs of life – or so she thinks. No sooner has she arrived than unsettling sights start sprouting from the walls of the manor, which are painted blood-red (a too-obvious sign, perhaps, of what's to come). It begins with the appearance of Geoffrey (Rory Kinnear), her mealy-mouthed landlord, whose bumbling mannerisms and slightly off-colour jokes might conceal menacing intentions. Then, on a video call with her friend Riley (Glow's Gayle Rankin, who is under-utilised here), Harper's phone screen glitches in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it jump scare, distorting into a Lovecraftian morass of flesh and blood – a grisly, misshapen pair of lips locked in an eternal screech. That glitch teases a connection to Garland's earlier films – thinky sci-fi parables that deal with the dystopian implications of technological advancement. In the British director's Oscar-nominated Ex Machina (2014), a moneyed, macho Silicon Valley type develops the perfect fembot prototype. His follow-up, an atmospheric adaptation of acclaimed sci-fi saga Annihilation (2018), stars Natalie Portman as a biologist leading an all-women troupe of commandos into a mysterious zone called 'the Shimmer', where their military weapons are defenceless against an inexplicable force that invades their bodies. Garland's latest, though, is somewhat a left turn. Like Ex Machina and Annihilation, it is a chamber piece – isolating its characters in a bucolic sanctuary that turns nightmarish, and leaving them to unravel the knotty despairs plaguing them. But Men dials down the sci-fi tropes in favour of something more sinister. It slots neatly into the recent wave of so-called elevated horror movies, which use the slice-and-dice gore of their predecessors as metaphors for some greater existential anxiety. Ari Aster's Hereditary and Midsommar are linchpins of this genre, offering grand ruminations on family dysfunction and relationship woes. Closer to home, Australian films Relic and cult favourite The Babadook have also told twisty tales of intergenerational trauma and motherhood in spooky, skin-crawling fashion. And with a title like that, Men could only be a horror film. Unfortunately, its title is also where it seems to reside. Follow @abc_arts on Instagram, where life and culture collide. Compared to its peers, Men's attempt at elevated horror feels paper-thin. Film need not possess a political manifesto – it can, of course, remain purely sensory – but Garland clubs us over the head with a bleedingly obvious one: all men are the same, and all men are bad. Like an intoxicated heart-to-heart in a nightclub bathroom, you can almost hear Garland raving ""men are trash!"" while smirking to himself. As if this is a new idea to anyone born in the last century. He sledgehammers his point home by enlisting Kinnear to play – alongside Geoffrey – an assortment of male tormentors. There is a naked man who stalks Harper in the background of shots like a satanic Where's Wally. There is an inept policeman who arrests, then releases said stalker. There is a young boy – a digitally de-aged Kinnear, equal parts creepy and cherubic – who spars with Harper outside a local church, calling her, out of the blue, a ""stupid bitch"". To his credit, Kinnear's performance approaches the virtuosic, as he shapeshifts with little more than a tweak in costume or accent into a cornucopia of villains. Buckley, too, is in typically good form, fresh off a rabidly acclaimed turn in last year's thorny drama The Lost Daughter. As Harper, she is indignant and undaunted, though her eyes often betray a quiet desperation as the horrors around her close in. And she is, of course, great at screaming. But Garland misuses both his leads to grasp at #MeToo relevance while providing merely a surface-level screed against misogyny. It is a shame, because Men contains the kernels of many intriguing ideas. In an early scene, familiar to anyone who has watched the trailer, Harper calls into an endless tunnel, her voice reverberating off its mossy edges to form a strangely symphonic melody. When she returns to the tunnel minutes later, she finds it boarded up, in a state of disrepair. Has there been a wrinkle in time? Are we witnessing the breakdown of Harper's grip on reality? Garland opts to ignore these narrative threads entirely. There is also a plethora of visually stunning images: James' death, replaying like an intrusive memory; a stone engraving of the Green Man, a leafy folk figure and mythical symbol of rebirth who Garland recasts as a malicious presence. Each time it appears, it is accompanied by a ghostly trick of the light and a wailing, discordant score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow. Tops Arts & Culture headlines. Without sufficient grounding, however, these images feel too abstracted, resembling a gimmicky showreel more than a film. Indeed, Men teeters precariously on the edge of self-parody. As it crescendos to a sanguinary finale complete with mutilated limbs and a murderous game of hide-and-seek, the only appropriate response is a bout of stifled laughter at the sheer, meaningless absurdity of it all. We might view it as a satire of elevated horror, a genre that has permeated the market to such an extent that its latest imitators, by virtue of their ubiquity, blend into one bloody mass. But that would probably be too generous. Men is in cinemas now.

34,Authentic south-east Australian Aboriginal art a festival highlight of Vivid as part of Barangaroo walk,arts-culture,"  Aboriginal artist Warwick Keen featured in Sydney Vivid festival as part of Banrangaroo Reserve walk Warwick Keen says his installation of 150 colour-changing light pillars in Barangaroo Reserve ""looks fabulous during the day"", but goes to another level at nightfall. His is one of the many art installations that launch into life at 6pm each evening during Sydney's Vivid festival. For Mr Keen, participating in the festival is a chance for the TAFE NSW teacher to showcase a style that he has been perfecting for decades. ""I've come up with 150 designs, and the designs I've used are sourced from once traditionally practised art forms of south-eastern Aboriginal people,"" he says. His exhibition is called Nura, which means 'place' or 'country' in Gadigal language. It is part of a broad display along the waterfront at Crown Sydney called The Gallery. Mr Keen's artworks draw inspiration from traditional tree carvings, with each pillar highlighting a First Nations memory in fine detail. ""I have a ferry floating around on Darling Harbour [featuring my artwork] with similar iconography on it,"" he says. ""I've been doing this stuff all my life and I get a lot of good feedback and support, so people notice it and some people are inspired by that. ""It's a good, positive thing to be doing and what it does is it helps keep culture alive."" Warwick Keen says he encourages Aboriginal artists to draw and paint using the iconography of where they come from, rather than copying practices from other areas in Australia like the central desert or Top End. ""[Being involved in Vivid] is a good opportunity to amplify traditional Aboriginal art iconography that belongs to south-eastern Australia,"" Mr Keen says. ""I went up there early last week and saw them [artworks] and spent a couple of nights walking back and forth."" The NSW Minister for Tourism and Sport, Stuart Ayres, says the exhibition of Indigenous artworks is a festival highlight. ""Vivid Sydney shines a bright spotlight on the artistic talent we have in NSW and it is so exciting to see Indigenous artists at the forefront, telling their stories and featured in such an iconic location,"" he says. ""The Barangaroo redevelopment is crucial in creating jobs, attracting investment, driving the visitor economy, and giving Sydney a world-class new waterfront development. ""This area has been given a new lease on life and is a must-see for visitors and those attending Vivid Sydney."" Mr Keen was commissioned to create the designs on paper before they were printed onto a polypropylene surface. The designs were then moulded onto cylinders with lights inside them. ""The importance of connecting with and celebrating Aboriginal heritage is the driving force behind our 2022 Vivid Sydney installation,"" Crown Sydney spokesperson Simon McGrath says. ""Honouring the heritage of Barangaroo was vital to us, so this partnership made complete sense. ""We are delighted that Crown Sydney can provide a platform for First Nations students to showcase their talent not only to Sydney but the world.""

35,Working like a dog: School's in for kelpies and their handlers as demand for muster dogs rises,arts-culture,"  Muster Dogs sees demand for kelpie, handler training on the rise It's Monday morning on the June long weekend. School children are enjoying a sleep-in and a break from the books. But not every classroom has closed its doors. At the Boonaroo sheep yards, nestled in the rolling hills near Casterton in western Victoria, school is in and the classroom is packed with eager eyes and wagging tails. Catch up on Season One of the hit show Muster Dogs on ABC iview. It's working dog school where farmers, handlers, and muster dog lovers unite to learn the finer arts of building a bond with their kelpie companions. Kathy Brown travelled six hours with her three ""kelpie kids"" to attend the class, led by multi-award-winning trainer and studmaster of GoGetta Kelpies, Joe Spicer. ""We downsized about 10 years ago to a hobby farm, but I've had working dogs forever and just love the breed. I've done everything from agility to ANKC herding and trialling … but there's always more to learn,"" she says. Ms Brown says she brought all three of her kelpie and koolie dogs to the working dog school to learn ""how to get the best connections with them"". ""I brought Kim, an 11-year-old koolie bitch — and Blake, an eight-year-old male koolie who's been my inspiration to learn more because Kim was easy to train and he was really hard,"" she says. ""Blake learns differently; you've got to be in exactly the right spot, you've got to be on the ball and know exactly what you're doing … and if it all gets too much for him, he just signs off."" ""And I also brought my six-month-old kelpie pup, Sache."" It's not the first working dog school Ms Brown has attended, and it ""won't be the last"", she laughs. ""You learn something new every time."" ""It's about the trainer really … and about how we interact with the dog, not about what the dog is or isn't doing."" With a set of undercover sheep yards for a classroom courtesy of local Casterton farmers Shane and Jodie Foster at Boonaroo, a dozen handlers, and their eager-eyed pupils are put through their paces on mobs of quiet but willing sheep. Black-and-tan, red, brown-and-tan, and every colour kelpie in between await their turn on centre stage, tied quietly to the side. Mr Spicer doesn't like barking dogs — ""noisy classmates"" — during class. Rakes line the rails. ""Arm extensions to help the handler get their position right and send the correct signal to the dog,"" Mr Spicer explains. Notebooks are marked with ""position, position, position""… ""pressure and relief""… ""go in with a plan"" and ""HAVE FUN!"" One by one, handlers and their working dogs take to the round yard to work their dog on tailored exercises designed to build the basics of real-world mustering work on small mobs of quiet sheep. It's a formula that has seen thousands of successful graduates improve their handling skills, learn to be skilled stockmen and women and, perhaps most importantly, understand the psychology of working dogs. The working dog schools travel around the country courtesy of Daniel Ball and his aptly-named Ewe, Me and The Dog training business. Over the past eight years, he's run hundreds of schools but, since the ABC television runaway hit series Muster Dogs, demand is on the up. ""We've probably run double the amount of working dog schools since Muster Dogs,"" Mr Ball says. ""We're also finding we're getting a greater mix of attendees including people from suburbia who want to get their kelpie or kelpie-cross out and see what they can do … as well as farmers wanting to improve their handling skills and understand their dogs better."" He says while most attendees come along ""just to see what their dogs can do"", some are hopeful of finding the ""Frank and Annie"" connection. ""At our schools, every dog will improve. But if we all thought we could turn our dogs into Annies we'd probably be kidding ourselves,"" he laughs. Mr Ball says the popularity of kelpies is also on the rise – but he cautioned prospective owners on the complex needs of the breed. ""What we don't want to see happen is another 'Red Dog phenomenon', which saw people rush out and buy red kelpies after the popularity of the film of the same name,"" he says. ""They are a breed that is highly intelligent, and they need a lot of mental stimulation — not just physical activity."" But for those still undecided about enrolling in a working dog school, Mr Ball issues the challenge. ""You can't get any better if you stay at home dreaming about it,"" he says. ""For all the hours that go into training, even on shows like Muster Dogs, you see that it doesn't always go to plan, but it sure is a lot of fun anyway."" Joe Spicer cuts a well-known figure in the working dog world. He's an award-winning trainer who has claimed top gongs at national level working dog trials, and runs a leading stud — GoGetta Kelpies — at Glenthompson, Victoria, where the waitlists for his kelpie pups are longer than the lines at the Boxing Day Test Match. But he's quietly humbled by the success of Muster Dogs, on which he was recruited as the expert breeder-trainer. ""Probably the biggest thing that came across was actually the connection that we saw between landowners and their stock and of course their dogs,"" Mr Spicer says. ""We're all here to be guardians of our land and we want our stock to be happy and healthy. ""I also thought it brought a lot of different types of people together — from poodle owners to 'townies' to those on the land — it seemed to strike a chord in the hearts of so many Australians. When you're looking for a dog, Australian kelpie puppies can prove irresistible. Just make sure you know what's involved before you bring one home. ""I think the basic obedience and dog psychology elements really resonated with people, no matter what breed of dog they have."" Mr Spicer says the demand for knowledge has never been greater in the working dog industry. ""People are seeing the results of how much more they're getting out of their dogs and how much easier it's making stock work, but also how much better their stock are when their dogs are working well,"" he says. He says he never tires of seeing kelpie owners and their pups building a bond over stock work. ""Probably the biggest lesson for people after a dog school is the understanding they gain about their dogs,"" he says. ""A lot of people say they didn't realise how oblivious they were to what their dogs were saying to them, how their dogs interact with each other, and how they communicate."" Mr Spicer says the schools teach the importance of handler positioning, and help owners understand the working dog's instincts around livestock. ""Obedience doesn't come just from training; it comes from gaining respect from your dog and that comes down to showing your dog that you make good decisions,"" he says. And for the dozen handlers gathered around the campfire at the end of class, conversations land upon a point to which all agree: it's really not about teaching the dogs, it's about teaching the humans.

36,"'Nervous, shy, proud': How a desert photo shoot gave these young Anangu confidence",arts-culture,"  'Desert diamonds' shine in the outback's answer to Vogue magazine It started with a few boxes of donated clothes — formal dresses, two-piece suits, tiaras, and jewellery. In the remote desert communities of the Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands, straddling the borders between the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and South Australia, young people have been dressing up, striking a pose, and showing their power in a new magazine. Rikina, the Pitjanjatjara word for ""cool, stylish"", has been produced by the NPY Women's Council (NPYWC), with youth workers becoming fashion photographers in the desert's answer to Vogue. And they say it has given young Anangu a confidence boost. ""We had big plans for the [NPYWC's 40th anniversary] AGM last year to do a fashion parade, and we were really excited about it,"" the council's boarding school education officer Tamika McMasters said. ""But we couldn't go ahead because of COVID."" The boxes of clothes though, donated from social enterprise Thread Together, were not about to go to waste. Photo shoots took place across communities including Kaltukatjara (Docker River) and Mutitjulu in the NT, Papulankutja (Blackstone), Mantamaru (Jameson) and Irrunyntju (Wingellina) in WA, and Putkatja in SA. ""We got the clothes out and got all the makeup ready for the girls and they just went at it. Went for the clothes and what they knew what they wanted to wear,"" Ms McMasters said. ""They were very happy to wear the older dresses and get dressed up and have a laugh with all their friends, they really enjoyed that."" With taglines like ""Desert diamonds — strong and beautiful"", ""Wiyantja wiya — never give up"", ""Desert Kings and Queens"", and ""Kungkas [Pitjanjatjara for girls/women] on country"", the magazine shows teenagers at home, backed by sprawling mountain ranges and posing with rusty wrecked cars that match the red dirt. Some assumed fierce expressions and sassy poses, some thoughtful, others beaming or on the verge of giggles alongside their friends. Three friends from Docker River, Anne-Marie, Cynthia, and Delicia, were excited to see themselves and their friends and relatives in print with the release of Rikina's debut issue. Anne-Marie, who has begun working with youth in her community, said she helped persuade the other two to join the photo shoot. Delicia said she felt ""nervous and shy"" at first, but all three agreed the experience made them feel ""proud"". Tamika McMasters said the project instilled the young Anangu with confidence. Young Aboriginal people are often heavily disadvantaged in terms of health, housing, services, and job opportunities in remote communities, compared to their non-Aboriginal and city peers. So part of Ms McMasters' work with the NPYWC involves helping them gain skills to help them find work and inspire them into possible careers. Pointing to a ""powerful"" portrait of one of the Rikina models, Ms McMasters explained that before the shoot, one young girl ""never came to the youth shed"" in her community because of bullying and teasing. ""But one of the youth workers said to her they were doing a photo shoot and they got donated clothes, and she was at the photo shoot that day. They were taking these photos,"" Ms McMasters said. ""After that photo shoot she is now going to the rec shed every day. ""It got some of these young people out of their shells and being more confident."" ""You can see she's very confident in this photo. She [now] feels more comfortable to be at the youth shed because she might have been with all the kids and enjoyed taking the photos."" Ms McMasters said the June 2022 issue of Rikina was being distributed across Central Australia and the photos were already proving popular on social media, with the NPY Women's Council hoping to release another edition of the magazine in 2023. The NPYWC was started in 1980 as an advocacy body for Aboriginal women and children, and today remains governed and directed by Aboriginal women, providing a range of social, art, and health services across the region.

37,'Full circle moment': Hip hop artist returns home to mentor teens,arts-culture,"  Tasman Keith returns to regional NSW to teach teens importance of literacy and music Hip hop artist Tasman Keith says returning to the NSW Mid North Coast to mentor disadvantaged teens is a ""full circle moment"". The Gumbaynggir man and award-winning musician is making waves in the Australian music scene but recently his focus has been at a small Kempsey learning centre where he has been mentoring young adults who have fallen out of the mainstream education system. Keith said he had been teaching them the importance of creativity in music and how to get their story across. The workshops are part of an Australia Literacy and Numeracy Foundation intensive project called Subtext: Art for Literacy which connects talented mentors with young people. Keith said he spent his days brainstorming, workshopping and guiding the students' song ideas at the Macleay Valley Vocational College in Kempsey. ""Bringing out their emotion in a way that they see as the cool thing to do,"" Mr Keith said. His mentoring has empowered the students to express themselves, according to the foundation's project lead, Pavitra Kurup. ""The initial reluctance to participate in a group activity kind of melted away,"" Ms Kurup said. ""It's important for the young people to be able to see themselves reflected in the mentor standing in front of them."" The Australia Literacy and Numeracy Foundation aims to raise literacy levels in the country's most marginalised communities. Ms Kurup said 40 to 50 per cent of adults in Australia had literacy levels below the international standard. ""Children from disadvantaged backgrounds, remote areas, and Indigenous Australians are up to two times more likely to start school developmentally behind than the national average,"" she said. The program has allowed Keith to slow down and reflect on his own achievements. ""It's kind of a full circle moment because I see how fulfilled these kids feel after they have a song,"" he said. Keith grew up between the bright lights of Sydney and a small country town on the NSW Mid North Coast. With a population of just over 1,100 people, Mr Keith said Bowraville was where he discovered his desire to create music. ""I really saw the value in speaking my truth,"" he said. He said a small, local creative hub had inspired him. ""If it wasn't for that space and my ability to be able to just sit down and write music and have a safe place to do so and people to guide me through it, I don't think I'd be doing what I am today,"" he said. Mr Keith's father, Aboriginal hip-hop pioneer Wire MC, was another powerful influence in his life. ""Being an artist is what I gravitated towards,"" he said. ""I remember being 14 or 15 and hearing my voice recorded for the first time. Being able to be a mentor for these kids is something I don't take lightly."" Keith has recorded a song with Jessica Mauboy as he rises through the hip-hop scene. It'll be released in his debut album A Colour Undone — a major milestone in his career. “To have that moment with somebody that I feel was the representation for Indigenous people, when there wasn’t much representation, was a massive moment for me,"" he said. Keith said visiting his family on the Mid North Coast and mentoring young adults kept him grounded. ""It's something that I want to continue doing,"" he said. “What's the point of doing (music) if I can't share my experience?” We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

38,'You have to be patient': Meet the twitcher who will bush-bash for five straight days for the perfect bird photo,arts-culture,"  Tasmania's ultimate twitcher goes to great lengths for perfect bird photo Pradeep Pandiyan could be Tasmania's ultimate twitcher, taking up to 55 hours to capture one shot of the state's more elusive bird species. From commando crawling over saltmarshes to 11-hour days bush-bashing, Mr Pandiyan admits he's a bit obsessed. ""Once I got into it, it became very, very addictive,"" he told Jane Longhurst on ABC Radio Hobart. While balancing a full-time engineering career, he says not a single day goes by that he's not ""thinking about the birds"". Mr Pandiyan's main influence is National Geographic photographer Tim Laman. ""His obsession was to photograph all the birds of paradise species from Papua New Guinea on various different islands,"" he said. ""That passion drove me into bird photography and I started doing the same."" Mr Pandiyan was inspired to set out and photograph the 'Tassie 12', which is all of Tasmania's endemic bird species. ""I'd just gotten into the phase of exploring the digital camera and the breathtaking pictures it can take and then I started paying attention to detail and got into birds,"" he said. Mr Pandiyan is a very patient man, and he has to be. ""The birding and the twitching aren't just about seeing the bird through binoculars and ticking it off the list,"" he said. ""You have to wait behind your camera, waiting for that perfect moment for that bird to come and sit on that perch and click that photo without any obstructions. ""You have to be very, very patient."" The elusive ground parrot has been his hardest quest. ""I had to wait for five straight days for 11 hours a day, bush-bashing to photograph that species,"" he said. He says he enjoys the adventure and remoteness bird photography requires, like spending time at Melaleuca in Tasmania's wild south west taking photos of the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. ""You go and explore the place and get to know the birds in that habitat,"" he said. It's taken Mr Pandiyan two and a half years to capture all 12 of the state's endemic species. ""You can't find those 12 endemic birds anywhere else in the world,"" he said. The one endemic species that kept him on his toes was the scrubtit. ""It's a tiny bird, which has a beautiful yellow wash underneath its throat,"" he said. ""That bird alone took me close to a year to finish off my list."" He still has a few more species he'd like to capture properly, like the wedge-tailed eagle. ""I've seen so many of them flying about but I've never got a fantastic portrait shot of them,"" he said. ""It's high on my radar."" Mr Pandiyan says shore birds are among the most challenging to capture due to their speed and cautious nature. Dotterels and plovers do not like people, and will quickly move away. He says he needs to army crawl to get a good photo. ""That's the only approach,"" he said. ""The minute they start seeing a threat or movement they move away. ""The best way to approach them is using your binoculars and on your belly flat to the ground to do an army crawl. ""They can be very tricky."" Not all amazing bird moments are caught on camera. Mr Pandiyan recalls a magical moment observing the ""brood parasite"" behaviour of cuckoos. ""All the cuckoo birds, like fantail cuckoos, come to Tasmania to lay eggs and rear the chicks,"" he said. ""Brood parasitism means they don't know how to build a nest. They lay their eggs in other birds' nests and the other birds will treat the chicks as their own. ""Once they realise that it's not their own they will kick them out and, at that point, the chick is able to fend for themselves."" In Ida Bay in Tasmania's far south, he witnessed a shiny bronze cuckoo, a large bird, being fed by a tiny thornbill. ""The tiny bird is feeding a bird six times bigger than it that isn't its chick,"" he said. ""It wasn't in a clear position for me to photograph. ""But I got a good look at that behaviour.""

39,Streaming dreams dashed: Agency criticised for charging young actors to appear on screen,arts-culture,"  Parents flag 'concerning' conduct of talent agency that demands payment for child acting roles Perth woman Hannah Moore says her nine-year-old daughter Matilda was excited when she walked into a mass audition for aspiring child actors on the weekend. When she left, holding a piece of paper explaining it would cost at least $4,000 for Matilda to get an acting role, Ms Moore was already thinking about how to break the bad news to her daughter. ""All [Matilda] knew was that 'Oh my God, Mum. This could be my big break. I could be famous',"" Ms Moore said. ""My nine-year-old daughter was incredibly heartbroken, so she was in tears. She couldn't understand why we were not going to pay the money."" The touring audition was held by Premiere, a company that produces TV shows and movies for its own streaming services and markets itself to parents of children who ""dream of being a YouTuber or on Disney+?"" Concerns about the company's approach, which requires payment for young actors who pass an audition to appear in one of Premiere's own films, have been raised by parents and a Perth agent who runs auditions for Disney and Nickelodeon. Consumer Protection WA said the program did not appear to be a scam, but the ""conduct is concerning"". Premiere did not respond to requests for comment. ""They're preying on kids' dreams, parents' aspirations for their children,"" said agent Ali Roberts, of Ali Roberts Studio in Perth. ""They're setting it up like you are going to be auditioning for a major network in the US. And they're not, they're going along for what we call like a cattle call."" Ms Roberts said taking payment from actors or their families was not part of the normal audition process. She said the Perth audition was not the first of its kind held in Australia. ""They're just using industry words and descriptions to try and lure people into the buy,"" said Roberts. Ms Moore said her daughter was told she had performed well on the first day of the Perth audition, where she was invited to read a couple of lines. She said the company representative told her Matilda should come back for a final audition the next day, but she was taken aback by the information they gave her. If Matilda passed the final audition, a Premiere flyer said her parents would need to pay between about $4,000 and $21,000 Australian dollars to appear in Premiere's next movie. A fee of about $4,000 would pay for Matilda to get a ""featured role"" with about 10 lines in the Go Iguanas! movie, while the $21,000 fee would pay for a leading role with at least 50 lines. Ms Moore said she and her husband decided, after discussing the flyer at home, they would not proceed. ""He looked at me went, 'No, they pay us, we don't pay them',"" she said. The WA Consumer Protection Division said it had not received any complaints about Premiere but encouraged consumers to contact the department if they had paid for services. ""Our WA ScamNet team has also reviewed the website and concluded that it appears to be legitimate."" One Perth woman said her experience with Premiere was ""amazing."" Amy Rumpf said her family paid for her to participate in a Premiere program after passing a Perth audition in 2016. Ms Rumpf, who was a teenager at the time, flew to Orlando, Florida, to participate in workshops and a showcase in front of talent scouts and agents. She said she also met Disney stars and got to practice lines with them. “It was a really positive experience,” she said. “Every two weeks I had a mentor call me, I would rehearse my lines with her and she would give me feedback … so I really got my money's worth.” But Ms Rumpf said she was disappointed the company was now taking payment for acting roles. She said she would not have signed up if that had been the program at the time. “[At the time] you were paying for an agency and to get noticed, not paying to get straight on TV, and then for however many lines you can afford. “Which I think sends the wrong message because that's just showing that money can buy whatever you need, or it's showing that kids with families who are much richer can afford to get better experiences and better opportunities.” We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

40,'A real and genuine ally': Lizzo changes 'ableist' lyric in Grrrls after social media outcry,arts-culture,"  Lizzo changes 'ableist' Grrrls lyric after Australian fan calls her out on social media American pop star Lizzo changed a lyric to her song Grrrls after an Australian fan complained that a word used in it was an ableist slur. Hannah Diviney, who lives with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, contacted Lizzo on Twitter to say that the word used in the song made her feel ""pretty angry [and] sad"". ""It's an ableist slur,"" she wrote. ""It's 2022. Do better."" Lizzo did.

""As a fat black woman in America … I can understand the power words can have (whether intentionally or in my case, unintentionally),"" she wrote. ""This is the result of me listening and taking action. ""As an influential artist, I'm dedicated to being part of the change I've been waiting to see in the world."" Diviney said she was ""blown away"" by Lizzo's swift response. ""I couldn't have imagined that she would react that positively,"" Ms Diviney told Sammy J on ABC Radio Melbourne. ""I was expecting that if we got a response at all it would be one of defensiveness or doubling down, not because I think that's how Lizzo operates, just because that's the norm for public figures. ""Most people aren't open to learning and correcting their mistakes."" Ms Diviney said when she initially heard the song she was ""confused"" but said she has since learned that the term is not considered a slur in the United States. People who easily name racism and sexism do not seem to see the human rights issues that underscore ableism. That silence is problematic, Ellen Fraser-Barbour writes. ""For me and for so many others, we've known for a long time that that word is not one that you use,"" Ms Diviney said. ""One thing that I've learned since calling Lizzo out for it is that it's not as commonly known as a slur in the United States, which sort of blows my mind as well."" Ms Diviney said Lizzo had proven herself to be a genuine ally by owning her mistake and quickly rectifying it. ""She listened, she didn't try to defend it, she didn't try to justify it. ""From what I can tell, she just wanted everyone to feel safe and loved by this song. ""She's shown that she's a real and genuine ally.""

42,Brush with the bush: Wynne Prize to tour regions for first time in 125-year history,arts-culture,"  New landscapes for Wynne as Australia's oldest art prize set to tour regional NSW for first time The Wynne Prize existed before the Archibald, but the ""poor cousin"" of the famous exhibition never visited regional New South Wales. Now for the first time in its 125-year history it will tour the plains, gorges, and farmlands it has long depicted. Northern Tablelands artist Angus Nivison said the tour was a long-overdue development. ""I'm totally astounded because the Wynne has always been the poor cousin to the Archibald, but I'm absolutely thrilled."" Mr Nivison won the Wynne back in 2002 and said landscapes often taught us more than portraits could. ""I think the best landscape paintings often express concerns and cares about more than just landscape. It's more about what makes us human, what defines us as a people – especially Australian landscape,"" he said. The state government promised $762,000 to make the program happen, which will fund visits to 12 regional galleries across a three-year period. The exhibition will travel to locations including Moree, Mudgee, Wagga Wagga, Orange, Bathurst and Armidale's New England Regional Art Museum (NERAM). NERAM director Rachael Parsons said it was vital regional communities experience their own landscapes reflected back to them. ""I think the focus on landscapes resonates very strongly in the regions; we have some of the most beautiful landscapes around – New England is well known for them,"" she said. ""We also have some local artists that have been featured in the Wynne Prize as well. Angus Nivison from Walcha is in this year's Wynne Prize, and Leah Bullen has been in twice before, so I think it's wonderful to have that connection,"" she said. Mr Nivison said the story behind his piece this year moved him deeply and reflected a greater story about the region moving through change. He was asked to paint a family member's favourite tree on a property near Walcha, which he thought ""was a rather beaten-up old thing just hanging in there."" But then he heard the tree's story. ""This is the tree when during the last big drought, while the bushfires were raging and the soil was blowing away, [my nephew] was feeding stock, and trying to decide which ones he'd keep and which ones he'd sell."" ""He was mostly doing it by himself, and he used to see this tree and he'd say, 'while you're hanging in there, I'll hang in there'. So it was sort of his beacon of hope,"" he said. As a ritual Mr Nivison said he now looked for the tree each time he drove up to Armidale. ""That's why I called it Beacon, it became a beacon, and for me it still is. I've gotten into the habit of looking for it."" Angus Nivison said it was poignant that the Wynne Prize would journey to the region where most of his entries over the decades had originated. ""Personally I think it's long overdue, and I've always wondered why they didn't tour the Wynne and the Archibald together, so I think it's great that it's happened."" The tour will start with next year's prize finalists, and will continue to tour the regional centres until 2025.

43,Bendigo arts community mourns death of former events chief David Lloyd in SA,arts-culture,"  David Lloyd dies suddenly aged 54, Bendigo arts community 'devastated' losing former events chief The arts community in central Victoria is in mourning after the death of David Lloyd who died suddenly last week at his home in Angas Valley, near Sanderston in South Australia, aged 54. Mr Lloyd left Bendigo last year after 16 years as the manager of the city council's Bendigo Venues and Events, where he oversaw the transformation of the region into an arts and culture hub. Former colleague and friend Anne Henshall said he was integral to some of the major arts projects in the city including the development of the Ulumburra Theatre. Mr Lloyd had also been a president of Performing Arts Connections Australia and the Victorian Association of Performing Arts Centres. ""He helped to develop the Bendigo Writers Festival, the Bendigo Exploratory Music Festival, and welcoming the Arena Theatre company to the city,"" she said. ""It was an incredible time when he was here, he was always willing to give things a go."" Ms Henshall described him as a gentle and caring man. ""Our connection with First Nations People was strengthened because he was brought up in Alice Springs, so he had a deep understanding and always wanted them to be involved."" Fellow colleague and friend Kathryn Mackenzie said Mr Lloyd left a huge legacy. ""David worked so hard to shape the diverse performing arts program that we love in this beautiful city,"" she said. ""He had a vision, he put his heart and soul into work. And he could make things happen, which is a unique ability in someone. ""He just did it. He was a relationship builder. He allowed the growth of the events he bought."" Mr Lloyd was also an avid coffee lover, with friends vowing to have a cup in his honour. ""Any of us who worked with him will know his love of coffee,"" he said. ""It was a quiet joke with us all — wherever David went was with his coffee,"" Ms Mackenzie said.

44,Estate of the art: Artist brushes Byron Bay to find home for new gallery,arts-culture,"  Artist Clive Sheridan opens Lundberg Gallery in South Murwillumbah An art gallery has popped up as an unexpected tenant in a northern NSW industrial estate. Named after the street it is in, Lundberg Gallery was opened after three challenging years for artist, curator and director Clive Sheridan. ""I didn't even walk in the door,"" Mr Sheridan said. ""I came around the corner and went 'I'm home'."" Tired of the Sydney lifestyle, he sought out a new home in the Northern Rivers region but craved somewhere different to Byron Bay. Mr Sheridan discovered Murwillumbah. His artistic eye saw potential beyond the concrete panelled walls and electric roller doors of the new industrial estate before him. ""I needed to come to somewhere that didn't have anything like this,"" he said. He knew the challenges he would face, having launched a gallery 15 years ago in an industrial estate in the West Midlands of the United Kingdom. Devastating floods in northern NSW this year stalled his progress. ""The walls were muddy and brown,"" he said. ""It was the last shed to be completed because they used this as the garage for all the machinery, all the paint, all the acid."" The gallery has since hosted its first exhibition, Unfold, featuring six artists. ""I think the title speaks for itself and all that we've been through,"" Mr Sheridan said. ""We're going to be showing conceptual art, a lot of minimal art — a lot of art that challenges people."" Even close friends were not allowed to see the gallery until Mr Sheridan was satisfied. His neighbours were surprised by the new business. ""At first they were a bit mixed,"" he said. ""They couldn't believe that I would want go open such an establishment on an industrial estate. ""A couple of them still call it a museum."" He said the picturesque Murwillumbah region, in the middle of an extinct volcanic caldera, was ready for a cultural explosion. He said when he first arrived there was local resistance to late night bars, restaurants and entertainment but that had changed. ""I've watched this town almost turn on its head and for the better,"" Mr Sheridan said. The next show in August will be a photographic print exhibition featuring artists from London and Vanuatu.

45,Court told 47 charges against Guy Sebastian's former manager still valid despite judge's not guilty direction,arts-culture,"  Charges against Guy Sebastian's former manager still valid despite judge's not guilty direction, court told A Sydney jury that was directed by a judge to find Guy Sebastian's former manager not guilty of three embezzlement charges has been told the development doesn't reflect the validity of 47 remaining charges. The jury heard the remaining counts relate to a total amount of just over $882,600 Titus Day, 49, has faced a lengthy trial in the NSW District Court after pleading not guilty to embezzling about $900,000 from the singer, who he managed for a decade, through royalties and performance fees. In 2009, he poached Sebastian for his own breakaway management company, 6 Degrees. At the end of the Crown case last week, Judge Timothy Gartelmann directed the jury to find the accused not guilty of three counts of embezzlement. During a closing address today, Crown Prosecutor David Morters SC told jurors that during the course of the trial, evidence emerged of funds related to some counts not actually being withheld from Sebastian. ""It cannot be said the laying of those charges reflects poorly on the investigator or the prosecution,"" Mr Morters said. He told the jury it was also not a matter which demonstrated ""ineptitude"" on behalf of the prosecution. ""The charges were rightly dismissed, but they do not reflect on the validity of the remaining 47 charges."" The jury heard the remaining counts relate to a total amount of just over $882,600. Mr Morters has told the jurors that in order to return guilty verdicts, they must be satisfied that Mr Day was acting as a clerk to an employer and that he embezzled property, namely funds, from that employer. He likened the charges to a shopkeeper who receives payment for goods and services and who, rather than placing the money in a till, puts it into their own pocket. Mr Morters argued it was clear, from financial records before the court, that Mr Day had ""dispersed these funds in a way which was inconsistent with the interests of Mr Sebastian and he in effect embezzled that money from Mr Sebastian"". Sebastian has previously given evidence that Mr Day took over control of almost every aspect of his professional affairs, including the execution of contracts. He said he didn't read through every document presented to him to sign because he knew Mr Day was a contract lawyer and trusted him. The court has heard a draft contract was created for Sebastian's switch to 6 Degrees, but the Crown says it was never signed. Their professional relationship continued until November 2017, when it ended with hostility. Mr Day's barrister, Dominic Toomey SC, has argued there is an answer to every one of the charges his client faces. He's also suggested jurors may wonder whether police were ""wilfully blind"" or ""seduced"" by the singer's high profile. The trial continues.

46,'Inspiring and empowering': Australian Indigenous art in the global spotlight ,arts-culture,"  Australian Indigenous art takes centre stage as Tate Modern, Sotheby's embrace First Nations creations From London to New York and Singapore to Paris, the global art world is taking notice of Australian Indigenous works. The surging interest is inspiring a new generation of First Nations artists to break into the scene, including Ilona McGuire. The contemporary artist spends her days researching and brainstorming ideas for upcoming projects. Her studio space at PICA in the heart of Perth's Northbridge neighbourhood comes with a background soundtrack of thumping beats from the bar downstairs. But McGuire says the music doesn't bother her; she's just thrilled to have the space to work in. ""I love coming in here each day and just creating space for myself to contemplate and really research and think about ideas so I've got a bit of a bank of ideas,"" she said. The proud Whadjuk, Ballardong, Yuat and Kungarakan woman is one of Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts (PICA) resident 'Hatched' artists, a program that celebrates emerging artists across Australia. Even though she's yet to complete her Fine Arts degree, she is already becoming well-known. She was thrust into the limelight last year for creating a drone light show for the Fremantle Biennale, a first of its kind in Australia. Called Moombaki, the Nyoongar word for ""where the river meets the sky"", three different shows recreated the first stories of Whadjuk Nyoongar Country. ""It's surreal, I was working on (Moombaki) last year in the lead up to my grad show exhibition, and it was really overwhelming at times, but I think I really took on the challenge and enjoyed the experience because working in the arts was something I always wanted to do,"" the 24-year-old said. The shows attracted thousands of people and were highly acclaimed. McGuire is part of a growing number of Indigenous artists coming onto the scene. On the other side of Perth at the Fremantle Arts Centre, the Revealed exhibition showcases more than 250 pieces of work from more than 100 creators at the beginning of their careers. The annual event has been running for several years and curator Glenn Iseger-Pilkington says it's becoming easier to find talent to feature. ""Revealed is a really great platform for artists who haven't had major exhibitions in commercial galleries and other major institutions and it's a really important stepping stone for artists to get their work platformed,"" he said. This year, three-quarters of the work sold on opening night, despite Perth experiencing a surge in COVID cases at the time. But it's not just on home soil where Indigenous artworks are proving popular. Sotheby's in New York recently moved its annual Australian Indigenous art sale from the winter off-season to the May marquee month, with the highest-selling work going for just over one million Australian dollars. The Tate Modern's exhibition, A Year in Art: Australia 1992, has proven so popular since it opened last June, its run has been extended until September. In Singapore, the National Gallery has recently opened a major exhibition called Ever Present: First Peoples Art of Australia, the largest show of its kind to go on tour in Asia. ""The art industry and business of art are all highly connected, so when you see major state-run organisations delivering really big exhibitions, then that has a flow-on effect to the confidence people have in buying the work,"" Iseger-Pilkington said. McGuire agrees that seeing the commercial success and global attention of indigenous art is heartening. ""I find it really inspiring and encouraging to see my mob stepping out and creating work that's beautiful and inspiring and empowering,"" she said. For McGuire, the impact of being given a platform has been huge. ""After last year and being in the public eye, it's been a really great opportunity for me to receive more opportunities to work further as an artist."" Both McGuire and Iseger-Pilkington believe the interest in Australian indigenous artworks is not a passing trend and that recognition will continue to grow, as more artists are inspired to put forward their creations.

48,"David Allen, founder of Men on Men gay art prize, awarded Queen's Birthday honour",arts-culture,"  David Allen, founder of Men on Men gay art prize, awarded Queen's Birthday honour When David Allen, from Agnes Water in central Queensland, received a letter informing him he was part of the 2022 Queen's Birthday Honours List, he assumed it was a mistake. But the letter had found the correct recipient and Mr Allen can now put OAM to his name for his service to visual arts. ""I actually thought they had made a mistake and sent it to the wrong person,"" Mr Allen said. ""It's a very humbling experience, I've got to say."" For 10 years, the award-winning artist has been involved with the 1770 Art Show, after relocating from Melbourne and travelling around Australia. The annual exhibition has become an important part of the regional Queensland arts calendar, but it is not the first time Mr Allen has been involved in helping provide an avenue for artists to display their work. In 2001, Mr Allen and his partner Ron Watkins founded a gay art prize titled Men on Men Art Exhibition and Competition when they were running The Laird Hotel in Collingwood, Melbourne. The pub is one of the longest running gay-owned and operated venues in Australia and many of Mr Allen's regulars at the time were involved in the arts, but unable to find spaces to display their work. ""Back in the early 2000s, it was very difficult to get into art galleries at any rate, let alone if you were coming from a gay perspective,"" Mr Allen said. ""We had a lot of gay customers who were artists and they were really struggling to find places where they could exhibit their artworks, so we created one."" The exhibition was immediately popular and attracted artists displaying work that reflected their lifestyle and culture. Men on Men is still running more than 20 years later. ""It was phenomenally successful from day one,"" Mr Allen said. ""All we had to do was provide a venue, marketing, prizes and things like that to get people involved. ""Once you give artists an opportunity, they take it."" In 2007, Mr Allen and Mr Watkins hit the road to travel and paint around Australia and discovered the town of Agnes Water in Queensland's Gladstone region. After 25 years of life in inner-city Melbourne, the relaxed coastal lifestyle and ""spectacular beauty"" of Agnes Water tugged at Mr Allen and the couple relocated. ""We moved up to this neck of the woods, and there is an art show up here and it was the perfect fit for me to meet new people in the community,"" Mr Allen said. ""And now it's 10 years later, 10 art shows later, the 1770 Art Show Festival is very successful. It's now established itself as a mainstream show in regional Queensland. ""But it's always been a team effort and my partner has always been along."" Mr Allen will travel to Brisbane later this year for the formal presentation of his award. His only issue is what to wear. ""There will be a function at Government House and I will have to try and find something to wear,"" Mr Allen said. ""Board shorts and thongs, which is the usual wear in Agnes, is not going to cut it."" ABC Wide Bay will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

49,"In the Hobbit House, 86 types of wallpaper tell almost two centuries of stories",arts-culture,"  Hobbit House in Oatlands tells 160 years of stories through layers of historical wallpaper A convict-built cottage in Tasmania's Southern Midlands is slowly revealing 160 years of secrets through its many layers of historical wallpaper. The Hobbit House, as it is affectionately known by its owners, is an 1860s timber cottage built in Oatlands by convict James McDermott. McDermott was transported to Van Diemen's Land in 1850 for stealing a cow but was later pardoned and worked as a farm labourer in the Oatlands area. He and his wife Mary Ann and three sons lived at the cottage for 60 years between them. Wallpaper historian Alan Townsend said the cottage got its name due to its saggy walls. ""There are so many layers of wallpaper in this tiny little house that the ceilings sag in towards you so you feel like you're underground,"" Mr Townsend told Helen Shield on ABC Radio Hobart. He said the cottage was a time capsule and had layer after layer of wallpaper added — 86 different types altogether. ""Not only do you have about 160 years of people wallpapering it every two or three years, it's never been touched."" One room alone has 30 layers of wallpaper. ""Nearly 200 years later, they've gifted us this lovely archive of what colonial taste was like in the 1860s."" Smoke from the cottage's open fires would darken the wallpaper, which led to the occupants adding more over the top, Mr Townsend said. ""The other problem is, being a timber house you get a lot of drafts, and every year or two you'd re-paper and keep the drafts out … over time you end up with 30 layers."" He thinks the McDermotts probably acquired discounted off-cuts from local shops. The cottage's current owner invited Mr Townsend to collect some wallpaper when she was removing it — he wasn't sure what to expect, but arrived with conservation volunteers Linda Clarke and Karen Stott to find ute-loads of it. ""The place was just chock-a-block full of it,"" he said. ""We spotted straight away that some of the early layers were really, really interesting. ""One layer depicted a landscape filled with classical ruins like an MC Escher painting that could never exist in reality; somehow in the 1860s they thought it would make good wallpaper."" Oatlands is known to be a cold and windy town in winter. In an 1860s cottage the occupants would also cover cracks and gaps with old dress fabric, hessian, newspapers and even children's homework, Mr Townsend said. ""We've got 100 years of textile history,"" he said. Between 1864 and 1880 the McDermotts pasted their children's homework to the wall, which Mr Townsend initially thought was for practicality rather than display. Children were given a blank copy book, with each page containing a beautifully written line at the top; some of the lines reinforced moral messages from school. ""Your job was to copy that line 20 or 30 times on the page to end up with that beautiful copperplate handwriting that the 19th century is so famous for,"" he said. ""You see a real transition; the parents are convicts and are totally illiterate."" He said the McDermotts had signed official documents with an ""X"", meaning they could not read or write, ""whereas their kids are getting quite a good education in Oatlands in the 19th century"". ""I think that's why there's so much of their homework pasted to the wall because you've got really proud parents wanting to document what their kids are doing. ""We've found so much of this stuff and there's really only one conclusion to draw: it was the trophy room."" Mr Townsend also found a portion of a letter that was properly signed by James McDermott. ""We know he was illiterate; by the time the kids were old enough to read and write, the parents were using them to write letters for them."" Mr Townsend is writing a book that will tell some of Tasmania's social history discovered through wallpaper. When people looked back at Tasmania's colonial history, it was often a drab picture, he said, ""but if you were living here in the 1850s, you had access to the most amazing shops"". ""You could get pretty much anything you could get in the shops of London or Paris in the shops of Hobart,"" Mr Townsend said. A house in Evandale has bespoke French wallpaper from the 1800s in which the entire room was one individual piece of art depicting two royal families meeting in the deserts of Arabia. ""How on Earth did this end up in Tasmania?"" Initially, decorative wallpaper was for the rich only, Mr Townsend said. ""But then jump to the 1860s and you've got convicts buying it,"" he said. ""The reason is by the middle of the 19th century, you've got machine printing coming in and what used to be a luxury item was suddenly available to everyone.""

51,Leah Purcell was part of 'the secret family on the other side of town'. Now she's putting her history on the big screen,arts-culture,"  Leah Purcell weaves her Indigenous Songlines into new film The Drover's Wife The Legend of Molly Johnson When Leah Purcell was filming the acclaimed movie Jindabyne in 2006, she would go up into the Snowy Mountains on her days off. One day, taking in the beauty of Mount Kosciuszko she suddenly yelled out: ""I love this landscape, I'm coming back, I think I'm going to do a film, I think it's going to be The Drover's Wife, and I think I am going to be in it."" Her voice echoed around the mountain range. Cut to 2019, ""and I am literally on the opposite mountain range and I'm singing out 'action' and 'cut' on my debut feature film"". She had come a long way from the small Queensland town of Murgon, adjacent to Cherbourg, which was once a government reserve where Aboriginal people were taken when they were forcibly removed from their country. A place of hardship where they were not allowed to speak language or practise culture. When Leah left Murgon she had three bags, a baby on her hip, a tank full of petrol and nothing left to lose. She was escaping a violent relationship, grieving the death of her mother. She didn't know where she would sleep that night, or where her next meal would come from. She was 18 years old. ""I just made my mind up that I was going to do it for myself and my daughter."" If she stayed, her only option would have been working in the local abattoir, her days a cycle of drinking and the domestic violence she had lived with since she was 14. ""It was normal for us young girls to be in these violent relationships."" She loaded up her yellow Datsun Sunny, shoved it down the drive, push-started it, ""and away I went."" Actor and friend Deborah Mailman remembers the young Leah as having ""long dreadlocks"" and being ""really strong"". ""I just remember thinking how stunning she was and the sort of passion and energy that she had wanting to be an actor."" Even then she had confidence that was at odds with being beaten down as a teenager. She didn't have anything new until she was 13. Her clothes had come out of plastic bags relatives would leave on the verandah. ""I think I got my confidence from having nothing to lose. ""I come from the dirt, a sole parent's pension, and I'm proud. And I would go back there and I would climb out of it again."" In early TV presenting jobs, Leah had to phone a friend at home to find out what some of the words meant. Finally, the woman on the autocue noticed she had trouble reading and helped her. Leah would go on to write books, plays and film scripts. Leah might have gotten out of Murgon, but she never left her people. A Goa-Gunggari-Wakka Wakka woman, she is the storyteller, the holder and keeper of the stories. For 30 years now she has been telling the story of her family, of her mother and grandmother. ""I'm a truth-teller. All I can share is the truth in my family's stories, because that's all I know."" Her grandmother Daisy was born on country at Mitchell but became part of the Stolen Generations when the children were herded into a cattle cart and taken away to Cherbourg. They think she was around five years old. She never saw her parents again. Leah's mother, Florence, was part of what she calls the ""lost generation"". ""They were punished if they spoke a language or spoke about culture,"" Leah says. ""She wasn't allowed to be black but she wasn't accepted in the white world."" Leah has been researching her family history since she was 14. ""I was at the crossroads of whether to be a good girl or a bad girl. And culture and my identity as a black fella pulled me back and set me on my life's path."" Her acclaimed late '90s one-woman show Box The Pony, a tour de force that played sell-out seasons at the Sydney Opera House, and went to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and the Barbican in London, was about the three generations: her grandmother, her mother and herself. ""Those two women are vitally important to me, they have shaped my Dreaming of where I wanted to go and what I stood for,"" Leah says. ""I am applying my Dreaming or my Songlines to their stories, but my grandmother's story was the foundation."" She would give them the voices they never had, shouting them as loudly as she could. ""My mother never had a voice. My grandmother never had a voice."" Now, says Deborah Mailman, ""she doesn't just open the door, she kicks it off its hinges in terms of creating opportunities."" Leah was the youngest of Florence's seven children. Born when Florence was 42 it was just her and her mother. ""I was her shoulder to cry on. I had a lot of responsibility as a child. My job was to protect her and look after her."" Her father was a white man, the local butcher and boxing trainer, who lived with his white wife and three children on the other side of town. ""We were the secret family and it was all hush, hush, but I think, you know, small country town, everyone knew."" Even though they could ""drive each other crazy"", Leah adored her mother. ""She was mighty, she was my mother, my father, my hero. She was four-foot-nothing but she was unreal. Everyone loved her. She was doing reconciliation before the word became fashionable."" When Leah was five and ""a mongrel sleeper"", Florence would recite Henry Lawson's book of short stories as a lullaby to put her to sleep. Their favourite was The Drover's Wife. ""It's about a drover's wife sitting with her children in her shack waiting for a snake to leave the hut while her husband is away,"" says Leah. It is a story that would never leave her. ""I connected to that story because it was the first time I could use my imagination and see myself in a story,"" Leah says. ""I saw myself as the little boy because I didn't have my father around. I was the protector of my mother. My mother was the drover's wife. We had a combustion stove. My mother had a wood heap at the back. She taught me to split the logs into chips. She taught me how to pack it and she would say, 'don't pack hollow otherwise a snake can get in' — just like in the story."" If Leah was a C-average student who ""hated"" school, it might have been because she was tired. Out of loneliness and hardship, Florence had turned to the bottle. ""She loved a man that she couldn't have. She was in a relationship where she couldn't express herself. She raised her seven children and two nephews, she looked after her own mother for 20 years."" Sometimes they would be early to the pub and the last ones to leave. ""I'd want to get home. I was tired,"" Leah says. ""Sometimes I'd knock my mother's drinks back. 'OK mum, you finished that drink. Let's go'."" Leah would get her mother home from the pub, get her to bed, sit with her until she was asleep and breathing properly, frightened she might stop breathing altogether. ""She said to me, 'Without you, I'd be in the gutter'."" On Sundays, they would watch black-and-white movies together. Then Leah would recreate the movie in the wardrobe mirror in her bedroom. ""I'd be singing with Liza Minnelli, Doris Day, Barbra Streisand. I'd sing with Whitney Houston, dance with Janet Jackson."" At barbecues, she would direct 20 cousins in a performance. She told Florence she wanted to be an actor. ""My mum would say, 'Well, you're black, you're a woman, you're from the bush. You've got to be real here. You're either going to be a nurse or work at the meatworks.' I never let it kill my dream. I always had it in the back of my head that I was going to do this. I didn't know how; it was just a need."" But she knew she could never leave her mother. ""I was born to look after her."" Leah was angry and bitter about her father's absence and her mother's sadness until she was an adult. When she was 32, she made her peace with her father. She sought him out and told him he had a lot of explaining to do. ""You have to confront those issues where there's anger within you. He was very open to having those conversations and he told me his truth and I told him my truth. He told me he was very proud of me. In the end, we had a great relationship. It lifted so much off my shoulders."" Leah was only 18 when her mother died of bowel cancer at the age of 60.  She spiralled into a vodka-fuelled depression. ""I had suicidal thoughts and I thought if I did that, all of this pain, all of this confusion, doesn't it just all go away? ""But I thought if I killed myself and my daughter survived, who's going to understand her? Who's going to love her like a mother? I didn't want that for her and this little voice said, 'didn't you want to be an actor?'"" Leah left Murgon for good to pursue her dreams. Now she knows that one of the greatest gifts her mother gave her when she passed away was setting her free. Leah started in community theatre in Brisbane in the early '90s. Her cousin set her up on a blind date with Bain Stewart and 30 years later they are still going strong. Bain was a champion kickboxer who ran a martial arts gym. Like Leah, his mother was Aboriginal, his father white. ""He knew I was interested in acting and he really encouraged me with my singing."" Early in their relationship, they had their first disagreement. ""He said, 'Stop. You just want me to hit you.' And that just blew my mind and I went, 'Oh my God, I'm so sorry, you are so right',"" Leah recalls. ""It actually made me check myself. Bruises heal, but it took me nearly 12 to 15 years to psychologically get that pattern out of my life. Bain is such a beautiful human being; he's stuck around and worked me through that. I truly believe he has been a gift from the ancestors because he has been such a support."" ""I don't think you can talk about Leah, her life and her work, without acknowledging Bain,"" Deb Mailman says.""They are a formidable team; they complement each other so beautifully."" Leah says she would dream up stuff, ""and he would dream it up further and believed in it and would chase money. So then he got into the producing side of things."" Bain understood Leah. ""I was listening to her dreams and aspirations, and then it all took off,"" he says. ""And all of a sudden I had a tiger by the tail."" She was in the ABC drama Police Rescue. She wrote and co-directed the documentary film Black Chicks Talking. The awards and accolades would pile up when she appeared in high-profile films Lantana, Somersault, The Proposition and Jindabyne. All the time she was watching and learning: ""I never sit in the green room. I'm an observer."" She starred in one episode and directed another of Redfern Now, the first TV series written, acted, produced and directed by First Nations Australians. She directed across both series of Indigenous drama Cleverman. ""She's somebody that's untrained,"" Bain says. ""She never went to NIDA or an AFTRS or a Conservatorium of Music, but she's directed scores of episodic TV, directed theatre on all the main stages in Australia. She's got publishing deals."" Leah was about to semi-retire from acting to concentrate on her writing when she was offered one of the three leads in Wentworth. ""And I said, 'Just let me talk to the actor in me'. And, you know, I was screaming with joy. I loved Wentworth because we women had kickass, bad-ass, boss-bitch moments."" In 2014, she was awarded the Balnaves Foundation grant to write a play about the story that had been percolating for 45 years, that was always at the back of her mind, ""it just wouldn't leave me alone"" – The Drover's Wife. ""It would start a whole Drover's Wife journey for me. That was the first time really that I actually got money and I went, you mean I can actually just sit down and write?"" She re-imagined the classic story through the prism of her own family history. Her ancestors had been drovers. The play received standing ovations at Belvoir Street Theatre. Then Bain came home with a surprise – a book deal with Random House. The book would win the 2017 Victorian and NSW Premier's Literary Award. ""My DNA is within it. And I've sung up business on it. I sung up the play, I sung up the novel, I sung up the movie. And in cultural ways you have that thread of a Songline which connects you to country, to family, to culture,"" Leah says. ""I've taken Henry Lawson's story and applied it to my Songlines to allow me to go on many journeys with his story. ""I wanted to put my Indigenous storytelling through it, my blood through the piece."" Her latest offering is the feature film The Drover's Wife The Legend of Molly Johnson. An outback western, it tells the story of Molly Johnson, a drover's wife who will do anything to protect her children – and does. Leah wrote, directed and starred as Molly in the film, in an unflinching performance. ""It's about a mother's love, it's about women, it's about family, survival, strength, determination,"" she says. Through family history, she had found that her great grandfather was Daniel Johnson, a white stockman who lived in the Aboriginal camp, and who had tried to save her grandmother from being stolen but had been unable to reach her. She named the boy in the story after him. While she was writing she had her childhood copy of Henry Lawson's book on her desk.

""What she is doing is paying homage to her grandmother and her great grandmother and her mum, what they went through to allow her to have the life she has now,"" Bain says. ""The sexism, the racism, the violence that was set upon them by the men of that time. She has taken this story and completely flipped it on its head."" Last June, Leah was awarded the Member of the Order of Australia for significant services to the performing arts, First Nations youth and culture, and to women. She went to the ""castle in the city"" – Sydney's Government House – to get the ""little thingamajig"" (as she coined the medallion). She was being honoured by the very establishment that only two generations ago had treated her family as if they were barely human. ""I think if I look too much into the history and what that building really represents and what it all means, you wouldn't get out of bed in the morning, would you?"" Bain told her she had been nominated by her Indigenous peers. ""I thought that was pretty awesome."" ""Aboriginal people have survived since time began,"" she says. ""We lived through two Ice Ages and we're going to survive again. But we have just got to empower ourselves, empower each other. ""I believe that if you call Australia home, this ancient culture is yours as well.

52,'It doesn't happen the way you think it will': How Sarah's brush with Melissa Caddick helped her understand cults,arts-culture,"  Nobody knowingly joins a cult, so why are so many lives ruined by them? ""Nobody joins a cult"" is not a statement you’d expect to hear from someone who has spent the last few years investigating how widespread they are. But at second glance, it goes to the heart of what Sarah Steel has repeatedly found as she traverses a secretive and bizarre world for her hit podcast Let's Talk About Sects. No-one thinks they're joining a cult, Steel says, that realisation comes later — if at all: ""People like to think that it could never be you, but the more people I've spoken to, the more apparent it becomes that anyone could end up in a cult."" That's because not all cults are made equal. While many preach religion, others prey on people's desire to make a difference in the world, whether it's presented as an organic farming commune or a platform to help people less fortunate. The type of people they attract are equally varied, according to Steel, who says the only thing members seem to have in common is they found the group at a time when their life was in flux or they were seeking change. ""You're not joining a cult, you're joining what looks to be a really great group that you can dedicate yourself to for the greater good, or self-improvement, or something as simple as a martial arts class,"" she says. ""It can happen to anyone if they come across the wrong group at the wrong time."" Many people will only ever hear about a handful of cults, often via sensationalist reporting that focuses more on kooky details than their tragic legacies. In Australia, there's The Family — a doomsday cult founded in the 1960s, covered in the first episode of the podcast. Even after the death of the organisation's leader Anne Hamilton-Byrne in 2019, few will be able to forget the photo of 13 children standing in order of ascending height, donning matching blue and pink outfits and bleach blonde bobs. Internationally, you may have heard of Heaven's Gate, responsible for the largest mass suicide in United States history, the notorious Manson Family, and Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese doomsday cult that launched a deadly sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subway in 1995. But beyond the headlines, Steel says, many dangerous organisations continue to slip under the radar. A spreadsheet she uses to keep track of such groups currently includes 146 names and that ""wouldn't even be taking a small chip out of what's out there"". ""The number of people you speak to who have had a personal experience, or have a friend or family member who has been involved, is just off the charts — it's way more than you would ever realise unless you were always having those conversations,"" she says. In her upcoming book, called Do As I Say, Steel delves deeper into the motivations of the people who join these cults. And while there are few similarities between those that become trapped, the tactics used to lure them in could come straight from a playbook. Steel has good reason to believe we can all fall victim to manipulators. On top of her extensive interviews with cult survivors and experts, the Sydney-based filmmaker has experienced firsthand how easy it can be to trust the wrong person. Melissa Caddick is now a household name, after it was alleged she swindled millions of dollars from investors — often her friends and family — while posing as a financial adviser. Her shock disappearance in 2020, and the subsequent discovery of her severed foot on the NSW South Coast months later, have spurred public interest in the case. But Steel knew Caddick as her long-term partner's cousin, to whom she had handed over her savings to invest. When details of the Caddick's ruse were revealed, she discovered she was among the victims. ""Going through something like that showed me how vulnerable we are to manipulative people,"" Steel says. ""It never occurred to me to question her at all."" Steel had been researching cults for years when the story broke, but says the realisation she had been tricked still came as a shock. ""It opened my eyes to almost the banality of it,"" she says, describing how long it took her to reconcile that she had been conned. ""It doesn't happen at all the way you think it will."" When it comes to cults, which can usurp a person's entire identity, there's a lot more to unpack: ""It might start by thinking there were just a few people who were messed up, but the leader was good; or they had good aims but it became corrupted over time; and then it starts to dawn on you that actually the whole thing is a massive manipulation, that you've essentially been conned in a way."" As part of her research, Steel set out her own criteria for what makes a cult organisation: they have a charismatic leader or leadership group that closely controls members, the leader or leaders believe they have exclusive access to the truth, and the group is highly secretive about their workings. Janja Lalich, a cult survivor and international expert on cults and coercion, has these elements in her list of common cult traits, including a group that has an ""excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader"" that regard their ""belief system, ideology, and practices as the truth, as law"". Alex's Bible study classes started taking over his life. Then, he found out who was pulling the strings. Over the years, Steel has expanded her definition to take into account behaviours used to control members that are replicated across groups, such as gaslighting and coercive control. ""I've come across groups which do have a leadership that's closely controlling, but they don't necessarily have a leader,"" Steel says. As an example, she points to the Two by Twos, one of many labels outsiders use to describe a religious sect that claims they don't have a name or a leader. Founded more than 100 years ago, the ""really secretive"" group operates throughout rural Australia preaching beliefs that stem from a literal reading of the bible. In a podcast episode dedicated to the group, former member Laura McConnell describes the sect's beliefs as ""in a nutshell, take everything you know about Christianity and make it as conservative as you possibly can and you're pretty close to what they believe in"". ""Everything we share is done through word of mouth or preaching, there is no information written down in books, for instance, which makes the group really difficult to examine and to dissect."" Even though the Two by Twos meet only two of her criteria for a cult, Steel says it's important to define the group as such, ""because if you're not saying that the group is damaging in the way that it operates, then you're not talking about the phenomenon that I'm talking about."" While the Two by Twos are, in some ways, an exception to the definition, Steel says it's striking how often the same types of structures and behaviours pop up in cults all over the globe. In the book, Steel lists some of these as an ""us and them"" mentality, exploitative labour and intense schedules, and restricting access to professional help and the media. An entire chapter is dedicated to coercive control — an insidious pattern of behaviour designed to entrap, isolate and terrify victims. Often the practice is discussed in the context of domestic and family violence, with state governments in NSW and Queensland recently committing to outlawing the behaviour. In cults, there are many ways this type of control plays out — often with the aim of getting people to do what you want. ""Love bombing"" — the act of overwhelming a new recruit with attention and adoration to inspire loyalty — is common, so too is gaslighting, referring to attempts to undermine someone's sense of reality. ""Hot and cold"" treatment by leaders, whereby members are treated with love one minute and scorn the next, is also common. This, Steel writes, can lead to trauma bonding where members adjust their behaviour to get back onto the leader's good side, and begin to blame themselves when they're mistreated. ""There are all of these ways that [leaders] undermine people's self-confidence and have them second-guessing themselves, that keeps them entrapped in the groups,"" she says. Steel would like to see coercive control laws targeted at domestic abuse expanded to include group settings, ""because they're the same tools that are used on a wider group of people, it's all the same stuff"". ""It's controlling people and having them behave in ways they otherwise wouldn't have, handing over their money, monitoring their communications, alienating them from family and friends,"" she says. ""Then people come out of these organisations and the cults won't take any responsibility for them, because they shun anyone that leaves, and they have no help from society because people look at them and say, 'Well you chose to join'."" This victim-blaming mentality once again parallels with the treatment of domestic and family violence survivors, who are time and time again asked: why didn't you just leave? From indoctrination and control, to gurus and 'love bombing' — there's a powerful psychology behind why people join cults, and why they stay. It's perhaps why many former cult members turn to psychologists experienced with domestic abuse — that, and there's a dearth of professionals with specific expertise in cults. For those that do take the leap and leave, the trauma can stay with them for decades to come. Steel says it's rare for former cult members to want to go to the police, but when they do, they're often told no crime has been committed. This lack of recourse, she says, is one of the toughest things for survivors to deal with. ""There's this concept that if you get out, then you're just suddenly free and everything is great,"" Steel says. ""But there are so many people I'm in touch with that are really struggling, and there's very little help for them."" Do As I Say, published by Pan Macmillan Australia, is out on June 28.

55,"Wendy Davis was attacked by the Claremont serial killer in 1990, but wasn't 'listened to'",arts-culture,"  Claremont serial killer survivor Wendy Davis speaks out, hoping her neglect won't be repeated Wendy Davis says she is lucky to be alive after surviving an attack in 1990 from the man who would go on to become the Claremont serial killer. The Claremont serial killings, which took place from 1996 to 1997, led to one of the longest-running and most expensive murder trials in Australia's history. On 24 September, 2020, Bradley Robert Edwards was found guilty of the wilful murder of 23-year-old Jane Rimmer and 27-year-old Ciara Glennon. There was not enough evidence to convict Edwards of the murder of 18-year-old Sarah Spiers, whose remains are yet to be found. Edwards was also charged with assaults on two teenagers in 1988 and 1995, the latter crime involving the brutal abduction and rape of a 17-year-old at Karrakatta Cemetery near Claremont. But there is another, lesser-known crime that Edwards committed at Hollywood Hospital in 1990. Had this crime been better acknowledged it might have been the warning sign that prevented the Claremont serial killings from ever taking place. Wendy Davis was the victim of this crime, and she has written a book about her story titled Don't Make a Fuss: It's Only the Claremont Serial Killer. ""I want people to understand there can be real consequences if women are not listened to when they speak up about violence,"" Ms Davis said. In May 1990, Ms Davis was a 40-year-old social worker in a senior position as a grief counsellor in the palliative care unit of the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital in Nedlands, west of Perth. ""I was in the prime of my life. The mother of three teenage daughters, happily married with two large Rottweilers and a few cats. It was just a normal life."" But that all changed when Edwards set foot in Ms Davis's office. At the time, Edwards worked for Telecom, now Telstra, and was part of a team undertaking work at the hospital. ""He asked if he could use the toilet,"" Ms Davis said. ""There was a lot of stuff going on at the hospital, I didn't think anything was amiss. I sort of grunted and nodded and got back to my work."" Ms Davis heard Edwards move behind her, flush the toilet, then go to the ward door. He then returned and asked Ms Davis's permission to retrieve a pencil from the toilet, which he said he had dropped. ""I just started to think that's a bit strange … and then I thought to myself, 'Hang on, he wasn't in the toilet long enough for the flush to happen,'"" she said. ""And the next thing a cloth came around my face and I was hoicked up on my chair and pulled back towards the toilet with such force that I have never felt anything like that in my life. ""I thought there was something on that cloth, and for those first few seconds I thought I was going to die. ""I can't even describe the feeling. I was sure that was the end of my life."" Ms Davis recalled being pulled up by her neck. ""I had to take a breath in and I realised there was nothing on the cloth and I was still alive. ""That's when I started to really fight."" A struggle ensued, during which the chair fell over and Ms Davis remembered her face being crushed against Edwards's shirt, his arms around her. ""We were very close to the toilet, he was pulling and pulling me, and I got my left leg and kicked as hard as I could — really, really hard. I got him in the shins."" Edwards abruptly let Ms Davis go and she fell back, looking directly at him. ""He was saying, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,'"" she said. ""I ran out of the office. I had one shoe on and the other shoe off, my cardigan was hanging off. I can still put myself back there and feel the absolute terror."" The attack, which lasted in total about 10 seconds, left Ms Davis with bruising on her neck and trauma that would last her whole life. Edwards was found with cable ties in his pocket which were dismissed as usual for Telecom workers. Bradley Edwards is found guilty of the murders of Jane Rimmer and Ciara Glennon in Perth, but a judge rules there is not enough evidence to prove he also killed Sarah Spiers. He was charged with common assault despite admitting to a security guard that he was trying to pull Ms Davis into the toilet. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years' probation in 1990. Ms Davis, who always felt the attack was violent and sexually motivated, discovered during Edwards's murder trial that he was ordered to attend a year-long sex offenders treatment program following the Hollywood Hospital attack. ""I'd been very much aware I was at risk of rape, or worse,"" Ms Davis said. ""I'd been told there wasn't enough evidence to confirm this. ""WA Police and Telecom had dismissed the incident as 'minor', a 'one off', 'out of character', and 'explainable' given my assailant's 'relationship problems' that were occurring at the time."" Too shaken to continue working in the office, Ms Davis left the job she loved. In the following years her marriage broke down, and she partly attributes this to the aftermath of the attack during which Ms Davis suffered from insomnia and terrible anxiety. ""I was so traumatised. My personal relationships were affected. I was less trusting of everybody and didn't feel supported after the attack,"" she said. Edwards not only kept his job after the assault but, in the coming years, would go on to be promoted twice. Ms Davis said her way of coping was to bury the memory. ""I didn't think about it, I didn't talk about it,"" she said. In December 2016, two-and-a-half decades after the attack, a call from WA Police forced Ms Davis to confront her memories. The police were investigating possible links between old crimes and had become increasingly interested in the Hollywood Hospital attack. ""Eventually, of course, in 2016, when Edwards was arrested, all of the trauma that I thought I'd buried successfully just came roaring back with a vengeance,"" Ms Davis said. Over the following two-and-a-half-year trial, Ms Davis would be regularly called on to give information to detectives and WA Police. On December 3, 2019, Ms Davis gave evidence regarding the attack in the District Court of WA. ""That was really the first time I felt properly listened to and validated to be able to face Edwards and know that everybody in that court believed what I was saying and understood how terrifying it was,"" she said. But it was the writing of her book that gave Ms Davis the true catharsis she felt she needed. Throughout its pages Ms Davis regularly reflects on the possibility that the Claremont murders could have been prevented had Edwards's attack on her in 1990 been taken seriously. ""It actually is okay for women to make a fuss, and more importantly it's very, very important that when women do speak up about sexual assault, or any type of violence, that they are listened to,"" Ms Davis said. The final sentences in her book ring true — ""I did my best at the time, but no-one would listen. My only hope is that we are listening better now.""

56,'How utterly brilliant!': Kate Bush reacts to explosion of success for old song,arts-culture,"  Kate Bush song Running Up That Hill tops ARIAs singles chart after Stranger Things Kate Bush is topping music charts worldwide with a song released decades ago thanks to its importance in the latest season of Stranger Things. Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) was a minor success when it debuted in 1985. But despite Bush fans holding her music close to their hearts, the song fell into obscurity in a decade defined by the pop hits of Madonna and Michael Jackson. That was until May 27 when Volume One of Stranger Things season four dropped on Netflix. As people across the globe binged the horror sci-fi drama, Bush smashed her way into the charts. The song plays in a pivotal moment that is not only one of the best scenes in the entire show, but an outstanding example of how good TV can be when everything lines up perfectly. The build-up to that moment, the acting, the set, the cinematography, the fact that the past few years have been more than a bit rough — all of that set to Bush's ethereal vocals — it just works. So while it's 37 years later than expected, Running Up That Hill is now: This is the first time Bush has topped the ARIAs singles chart. Her debut 1978 single Wuthering Heights did reach number one in Australia, but that was pre-ARIAs. Bush's song is also experiencing unprecedented success in the United Kingdom and the United States thanks to its new lease on life. Earlier this week, Bush released a statement on her website thanking everyone who had supported the song. ""How utterly brilliant! It's hard to take in the speed at which this has all been happening since the release of the first part of the Stranger Things new series. ""So many young people who love the show, discovering the song for the first time. The response to Running Up That Hill is something that has had its own energy and volition. ""A direct relationship between the shows and their audience and one that has stood completely outside of the music business. We've all been astounded to watch the track explode! ""Thanks so much to everyone who has supported the song and a really special thank you to the Duffer Brothers for creating something with such heart."" Running Up That Hill isn't the first time Kate Bush has had a second wind in her career with early songs. Her 1978 single Wuthering Heights has grown in popularity over the past decade thanks to The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever. It started in 2013 when a flash mob in the UK re-enacted the dance Bush performed in the UK version of the music video. Since then at various locations around the world, fans in red dresses have gathered to perform the dance. The event is often held on July 30 to mark Bush's birthday. Bush was only 18 when she wrote the song, which is inspired by the Emily Bronte novel of the same name.

59,Photos capture fleeting moments of beauty during Victorian lockdown,arts-culture,"  At a passing glance, they looked like scribbles on a wall. The crayon drawings had gone largely unnoticed for months until Tam Do peered closer, and realised she had stumbled across something interesting. It was a visual gem that summed up the highs and lows of lockdowns. Do said the crayon-drawn portraits — of children Olivia, Tutu, Anok, Vicky, Isaih and Jasmine — reflect what is good about Melbourne's high-rise public towers. The young kids had been a constant on her floor during the last few years, playing loudly, bouncing basketballs and charging through the hallways. Amid the challenges of COVID-19, friendships between different cultures helped overcome loneliness in periods of isolation. Between the children, there were no prejudices, Do said. ""They get together in the afternoon after school, and they hang out. They're all from refugee backgrounds, much like my own,"" she said. ""The youth of today is mostly tech-focused, but they have the ball they play around with. They have bikes and scooters that they ride in the hallways."" It was a good thing Do snapped a photo of the impromptu wall art in her building. A few weeks later, it was scrubbed off by the cleaners. Do's photograph has been featured by the Victorian Multicultural Commission as part of a new exhibition at Melbourne's Immigration Museum. The collection showcases pictures which capture the resilience and experience of Victorian multicultural communities during the pandemic. In 2021, restrictions had eased to the point where Kitman Yeung was able to visit her family home for dinner. After their meal, she noticed a touching moment between her mother and sister. ""They were watching TV and they were cold, so they were cuddling. I just picked up my camera and said 'do you guys want to stay there?',"" Yeung said. Yeung describes Chinese culture as ""conservative"", and hopes sharing an image of outward affection will help break down some barriers between older and younger generations. ""In our family, that was something that was new,"" she said. Alejandra Olavarria says her double exposure photograph of two women hugging symbolises the strength of Melbourne's artists, many of whom lost their incomes at the height of the pandemic. ""In the midst of everything, you still can't quite ever completely shut down that burning desire of creators and makers to create,"" she said. ""It felt very universal and yet at the same time, it had a story for me,"" she said. ""It's interesting and beautiful, and quite a tender moment. I think we can all relate to that after these last two years."" Doctor Prashanth Naidoo witnessed the devastation of COVID-19 when he worked in an intensive care ward in 2020, before vaccines were available. ""Seeing someone on a ventilator made it a lot more real,"" Naidoo said. The scenes playing out in Naidoo's professional life were in stark contrast to the tranquil moment he captured in Ballarat with his drone, at Lake Wendouree's T-shaped jetty. At a time when gatherings were limited to a maximum of two and Victorians were only given a few legal reasons to leave home, the calm of a waterside picnic with his partner was a moment to cherish. ""It highlighted one of the few activities that we probably took for granted. During COVID, we absolutely looked forward to any outdoor activity,"" he said. The Islamic practice of Wudu — washing the body before prayer — was the inspiration behind Samanneh Pourshafighi's portrait where the artist is the central figure. Pourshafighi is open about her mental struggles which were heightened during lockdowns. The photo was captured in 2021, when Pourshafighi was able to travel interstate to visit their mother and aunt. ""I felt really cared for. I felt that even though things weren't going to get better immediately, there was the possibility that things can get better. I didn't feel isolated, I felt really held,"" Pourshafighi said. As COVID gradually becomes less of an imposition, Pourshafighi believes the pandemic has spurred her on to make the best of life. ""Let me just get going again. Let me find my rhythm again, as an artist, as a person. Let me at it,"" Pourshafighi said. The Victorian Multicultural Commission's Capturing Culture exhibition will be on display from June 10 to June 26 at the Immigration Museum atrium in the Melbourne CBD.

60,'He'll probably never smile the same again': Australian women with Ramsay Hunt syndrome on what Justin Bieber can expect,arts-culture,"  What is Ramsay Hunt syndrome? Justin Bieber's condition is rare and often misdiagnosed A rare neurological disorder that causes facial paralysis is in the spotlight after singer Justin Bieber revealed he cannot blink or smile. The 28-year-old has postponed his world tour and told fans in an Instagram video he was being treated for Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a complication of shingles. If you've never heard of it, you're not alone. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a rare condition that is too often misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy, a condition that also causes facial paralysis. It's actually so rare that it's not known exactly how many people have it, and those who are diagnosed often lean on each other for support and information. That's something Elizabeth Robinson has worked to change since she was struck by it seven years ago. ""It devastated and changed my life completely,"" Ms Robinson told the ABC. Ramsay Hunt syndrome occurs in people who have had chickenpox because it's caused by the same virus. The varicella zoster virus remains in your body and is harmless unless it is reactivated, usually because of stress. This causes a painful rash called shingles. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a complication of shingles because the shingles travels to the inner ear, up the cranial nerves and down the facial nerves, inflaming them. This causes the facial paralysis. The shingles can also inflame or crush the auditory nerves, causing hearing loss. Ms Robinson, then a French language teacher, was going through a particularly stressful time when she was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome in January 2015. She still hasn't recovered from the severe condition, which paralysed 95 per cent of the left side of her face and made her deaf in her left ear. ""I haven't been able to work as a teacher since,"" she said. ""It affects my speech, my hearing, my balance."" Ms Robinson said her first symptom was an excruciating toothache. ""Not just one tooth, all across the teeth on the left-hand side,"" she said. ""Then I got an excruciating earache like nothing I've ever experienced before — it was like my ear was on fire."" The doctor who checked her inner ear noted it was slightly pink but her lymph nodes weren't swollen, so she was referred to the dentist for an infected tooth. That evening, Ms Robinson's sister commented her eye was starting to ""look a bit funny"". ""I said, 'No, I'm just really tired, I've got an earache,' so I went to bed. ""At 4am I woke up and went to splash my face in the bathroom and take some water because my mouth was so incredibly dry. ""[The water] just ran down my face. ""I turned on the light — my first thought was I'm having a stroke."" Ms Robinson used the FAST method of detecting a stroke (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties and Time) to assess her symptoms, but decided to wait to see the dentist, who referred her to an emergency department. ""By the time I got to the ER at nine o'clock that morning, the shingles had developed so badly that my ear was on fire and it was bright red,"" she said. Source: Facial Palsy UK Ramsay Hunt syndrome is often misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy because of the facial paralysis, and not all patients immediately present with a rash. But Ms Robinson said the biggest difference between the two was pain. Mikaela Pretorius was 35 weeks pregnant with her second child in November 2014 when she developed a really bad headache. Having had pre-eclampsia during her first pregnancy, she knew it was a possible sign of the pregnancy-related condition and went to the hospital. ""They were like, 'Oh, here you go, have some Panadeine Forte. You know it's just a headache, we've checked it out — everything's OK,'"" Ms Pretorius told the ABC. ""And I'm sitting on the bed [at hospital] and my husband's like, 'You're blinking funny.' ""We told the nurses and the midwives and they were like, 'It's just because of the headache and stress, you're OK.' ""They sent me home. The next day, still blinking funny."" Ms Pretorius said went to a medical clinic where she was told she needed an ambulance. She spent three days in hospital and was warned the steroids she was on to treat the infection could make her go into early labour. ""I've got permanent facial paralysis,"" Ms Pretorius said. ""My right side of my face has some movement, like I can blink again, but it's not the same. ""I was lucky in that sense because it wasn't in my ear, [it was in the back of my throat], so I haven't had the long-term …balance and hearing issues."" Facial Palsy UK, a charity that supports people affected by facial palsy due to any cause, says patients suspected of Ramsay Hunt syndrome should be given antivirals and steroids within 72 hours of symptoms appearing. It says if that is done, about 70 per cent of people will experience ""virtually full recovery"". If not, the chances of a full recovery reduces to 50 per cent. ""The more severe the damage, the longer it will take to recover, and the lower the chance that you will completely regain normal function,"" the organisation says. Ms Pretorius said she had not seen anyone in the support groups who had fully recovered. ""If they had it in their ear, their face might have recovered but their hearing hasn't, their balance hasn't,"" she said. ""At the six-month [mark], they're like, 'That's as good as it's going to get.'"" The mother-of-two has botox injections every three months to ""even out"" her face. ""I'll have pain, like just muscle tightness on both sides, because it throws out the other side as well,"" Ms Pretorius said. Ms Pretorius said she felt for Justin Bieber because she knew what he was going through. ""He'll probably never smile the same again,"" she said. ""I'm sure there will be so many, 'This is Justin Bieber before, this is him now,' horrible comparisons. ""It's an awful, awful disease because it's your face. ""You walk up to someone and say hello and you know they're looking at you funny. That's awful."" There is no cure for Ramsay Hunt syndrome, but the severity of shingles can be lessened by getting the shingles vaccine. Ms Robinson was given antivirals within 72 hours, but her paralysis was so severe she needed further treatment, which she did not receive. She has passionately advocated to raise awareness for Ramsay Hunt syndrome ever since. ""I do this so no-one else has to go through what I went through.""

61,Neighbours cast says goodbye as Australian soap wraps after 37 years of filming,arts-culture,"  Neighbours cast says goodbye as Australian soap wraps after 37 years of filming Australian soap Neighbours has wrapped filming after 37 years on television at home and abroad. The show's final day of filming in the fictional Ramsay Street was Friday, June 10. After nearly 9,000 episodes, 63 weddings, 20 births and 68 deaths, Neighbours has ended. Neighbours was cancelled this year after Britain's Channel 5 announced it would be dropping the Australian soap from its line-up. The show's producers Fremantle Media were unable to secure a replacement broadcaster. Despite airing on Network Ten in Australia, it is understood the British network contributed towards the majority of the show's production costs. The final episode will air in Australia and the UK on Monday, August 1. Neighbours has helped launch the careers of generations of Australian entertainers, from Kylie Minogue and Guy Pearce to Margot Robbie and Liam Hemsworth. Minogue and on-screen husband Jason Donovan, as well as Pearce, returned to appear in the final Neighbours episode. Cast members paid tribute to the long-running series on social media as they shared their moments from their last days on set. Guy Pearce shared some behind-the-scenes photos of his return to Ramsay Street earlier this month. After his stint on Neighbours, Pearce appeared on Australia's other popular soap, Home and Away, and has gone on to have a highly successful acting career. He is one of Neighbour's biggest success stories and blazed a trail for other Australian actors to move into Hollywood. Alan Fletcher and his on-screen wife Jackie Woodburne were one of the show's longest-running couples as Dr Karl Kennedy and Susan Kennedy. They went through a lot of the traditional soap tropes — infidelity, amnesia, an illegitimate child, near-death experiences — but made it through to the end. ""Yesterday was the last day of location for the Kennedy clan. Jackie Woodburne and I have stood under this arch outside 28 Ramsay Street many times over the last 28 years. ""Emotions starting to well up as we finalise filming all together on Friday. Stay tuned. The last episodes are amazing!!!"" Izzy Hoyland meant nothing but trouble in Ramsay Street. Natalie Bassingthwaighte marked ""the end of an era"" as she returned for the show's finale. ""I feel so honoured to have learnt my craft right here amongst all of you guiding me through. ""And to be asked back to celebrate it, closing this wonderful chapter of television history bringing Izzy back was such a thrill and a moment I will forever cherish. [Love] looking back through the years."" Jason Donovan shared a series of photographs from his time on the show as well as a sneak peak at the title script page of the 2022 ""Scott and Charlene scenes"". Donovan and Minogue's on-screen wedding on July 28, 1987, was one of the biggest moments in Australian television. It was watched by more than 2 million Australians and almost 20 million people in the UK. Donovan said the show ""brought a sunny slice of Australia into the homes of millions of viewers around the world."" ""Personally for me… Apart from all the friendships and memories (even that mullet :) It has provided countless opportunities for talent, across the board, in my native home Australia and for that I'm beyond grateful."" Georgie Stone has only been on Neighbours for three years but she made a huge impact as Mackenzie Hargreaves, the show's first transgender character Stone approached the show with the idea of Mackenzie's storyline after being named Young Victorian of the Year in 2017. Her time on Neighbours is coming to a close with a happy ending — this month on the show, Mackenzie married her partner Hendrix Greyson at Melbourne Zoo. Paul Robinson has brought trouble to the not-so-quiet streets of Erinsborough since 1985. Actor Stefan Dennis shared the moment he entered the studio for the last time to star as the show's long-running troublemaker. ""This is a me entering the studio to play Paul Robinson for the very last time. I thought my very special Norwegian jumper would help keep me happy during this rather melancholy day."" Melissa Bell is the third actress to play Lucy Robinson, Paul Robinson's youngest sister, since the character's debut in 1985. Bell has appeared on Neighbours on-and-off over the past 30 years. Jacinta Stapleton, who has reprised her role as Amy Greenwood across two stints on the show, has just three words for her final day of filming. Sharing a video of her last hair and make-up session, Stapleton paired the clip with NSYNC's song Bye Bye Bye.

62,'Maybe the best love story of 2022. Who knows?' Photographer pairs blindfolded models for Stranger Sessions,arts-culture,"  Sunshine Coast photographer pairs blindfolded models for intimate Stranger Sessions shoot Francesca Mazzara's heart was beating fast with excitement as she stood blindfolded in a paddock in the Glass House Mountains, about to gaze into a stranger's eyes for an intimate photo shoot. The single mother from Buderim on the Sunshine Coast had done a few professional photo shoots before, but nothing quite like this one. ""I just thought it was the most amazing idea,"" Ms Mazzara said. ""I was like, 'Oh my God, this maybe the best love story of 2022. Who knows?'."" Ms Mazzarra was about to lay eyes on single father Dale Billsborough for the first time, a match-up created by Sunshine Coast photographer Nicola Brander who wanted to capture the moment for a creative concept she called the Stranger Session. ""I thought it was really interesting to see how two people kind of connected as strangers, and to see if there's any chemistry there,"" Ms Brander said, having previously put the call out for interested models. ""When I organised it, I got a little bit of info about each of them and then I passed it on to the other person. ""So they sort of knew a bit about their lifestyle, whether they had kids, what they were interested in, that sort of thing. ""But on the day of the shoot, they had never seen each other."" She said once the blindfolds came off there were a few nerves but the pair quickly opened their eyes to a new adventure and embraced the concept. ""I think there was like quite a bit of nerves, but honestly, it went like a normal couple shoot,"" Ms Brander said. ""You wouldn't even know that they were strangers. ""I thought having two strangers in a couple's photo shoot, there's going to be a lot of awkwardness, but it was actually the opposite."" Ms Mazzara said the moment the shoot began, the couple had an instant connection. ""We talked and we laughed so much and yeah, I think it was just very natural and organic,"" she said. ""He [Dale] was really nice, genuine, the conversation was flying, he was really funny. ""And obviously Nicola, she made it so funny."" Ms Mazzara said it was great to connect with someone in person, rather than on a dating app. ""You get to know that person very deeply, so yeah, [it was] really, really cool,"" she said. ""The dating world nowadays is more like everything is online, so an idea like that I feel like it's absolutely fantastic. ""Meeting Dale, getting to know him, even if turns into a friendship, was an amazing experience."" Ms Brander said the shoot was purely about creativity, but if a match was made from it, she would not be disappointed. ""I'm always doing sort of the same shoots all the time [and] I kind of wanted to branch out and do something a bit different,"" she said. ""But I mean, if I ended up matchmaking, that's pretty cool."" Ms Brander received so much positive feedback when she shared the photos online that she has decided to do another Stranger Session. ""Everyone's kind of waiting for me to do the next one,"" she said. ""I've actually had heaps of guys interested in the next one and I've probably got about 30 females interested to do another one."" She said the next shoot will involve a waterfall location in July. ""So something a little bit more sexier, so that'll be interesting,"" Ms Brander said. She said her followers still had one question they wanted answered: was there love beyond the lens with Ms Mazzara and Mr Billsborough? ""The public is like, 'Please keep us updated on their next date, or whether they end up getting married',"" Ms Brander said. ""I think if it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. ""I think people enjoy it because it gets them out of their comfort zone, doing something different.""

63,Brisbane before and after: Amateur photographers capture early years of Queensland's capital,arts-culture,"  Treasure trove of photographs of Brisbane's early years donated to QUT by local family A treasure trove of photographs reveals just how much Brisbane has changed over the past century. The images, which are part of a new collection released by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), were donated to the university by a local family. Lyndal O'Gorman, daughter of one of the photographers, Cynthia O'Gorman, handed over her mother's and grandfather's photographs. The family's albums and slide boxes contained more than 100,000 images. They include iconic Brisbane locations, including the river, New Farm Park and Eagle Street Pier. A much flatter city skyline was captured in a snap from Mt Coot-tha in 1954, before the tall towers of today. The view towards Eagle Street Pier from the Story Bridge was very different in 1965. Instead of apartment blocks and office buildings, wharves and warehouses hugged the river. But the red-roofed building at the bottom of the frame is still there. Originally offices for shipping company Howard Smith Ltd, it is now a restaurant. Even in the 1960s, Queen Street was a major shopping hub — except then you could drive or catch a tram along the strip, until it was turned into a pedestrian mall in the 1980s. The King George Square of the 1950s is barely recognisable. Among the many changes, the statue depicting its namesake on horseback has been relocated. Anzac Square hasn't changed as much. The sandstone war memorial still stands in front of Central Station, but is now dwarfed by skyscrapers. While the porte cochère at Parliament House looks old fashioned, it wasn't finished until 1982. The sandstone is a lighter shade to the main structure and the metal roofs have developed a patina. Some places look pretty much the same as they did 50 years ago. Jacarandas and roses continue to colour New Farm Park. The pictures were taken by amateur photographer Jack Bain and his daughter Cynthia O'Gorman. So far, more than 500 have been scanned and made available for public viewing on QUT's website. Lyndal said her grandfather worked as a bank teller in Brisbane for most of his life. ""He didn't like it, he didn't enjoy it, but it was a reliable job. I think photography was an escape for him,"" she said. ""He was always interested in technology and machines and in what cameras and photography could do and he was interested in documenting buildings and architecture."" Nowadays it would take a brave person to swim in the 'Brown Snake'. But in a 1928 snap, Mr Bain looks unfazed, as he pushes a rowboat in the Brisbane River. But he was well clear of the water in 1965, when he captured the blasting of a channel at Seventeen Mile Rocks. The explosions were to allow easier passage for steamers between Brisbane and Ipswich. A crowd watched as a column of spray shot into the sky. Mr Bain captured momentous occasions, such as Brisbane's CBD decorated for Queen Elizabeth's first visit to Brisbane in 1954. The monarch marked 70 years on the throne this week. While Mr Bain and Ms O'Gorman have died, their photography will live on in the QUT's digital collections, a legacy of Queensland history for generations to enjoy.

64,'It's just not feasible': Wren family sells Silver City Cinema after owning and operating business for 40 years,arts-culture,"  Silver City Cinema sells to Broken Hill Musicians Club amid rising operating costs The future of one of the last independent movie theatres in NSW has been secured with the Broken Hill Musicians Club stepping in to purchase the Silver City Cinema. The Wren family has owned and operated the cinema for four decades but says streaming services, rising utility bills, and coronavirus lockdowns made the business no longer viable. Cinema manager Ashton Wren said it was a difficult decision to sell the business. ""Since COVID, it has just been so tough mentally, physically, emotionally,"" he said. ""We can't afford it. It's just not feasible for us."" The Silver City Cinema was granted $35,000 in federal government funding last year to help with the cost of overheads during the crux of a lockdown. However, Mr Wren said the money went towards bills and insurance and had not been enough to get the business over the line. ""We can't sustain six or seven people inside a theatre when we've got reverse cycle blasting away, chewing up profits. ""The plan is to do our last screening on July 31 and end it with Elvis."" Ashton's father, John Wren, bought Broken Hill's Bel-Air Drive-In in 1979 before taking on the Silver City Cinema in 1982. Ashton Wren said it was a ""sad time"" for his dad who was now 80 years old. ""It's been his life for all his life,"" Mr Wren said. ""When he had a tumour ... he said the only thing that kept him alive was trying to get back to the cinema again to run it."" Looking back, Mr Wren said some of his fondest memories were learning the tricks of the trade at an early age. ""I was 10 years old learning to be a projectionist,"" he said. ""Dad used to get me out of bed, to my mum's disgust, and put the movies on for him when staff didn't show up."" General manager of the Broken Hill Musicians Club Michael Boland scored his first job as a teenager at the cinema. Some 25 years later, he's taking on the business to see John Wren's vision continue. ""There will be a little bit of a refurbishment but nothing will change building-wise,"" Mr Boland said. ""We'll maybe look at a new silver screen, put curtains up on the walls so the sound is better, replace the chairs and give the foyer a spruce up. ""It's an awesome feeling to ensure that that asset for the Broken Hill community, as well as the Wren legacy, is well looked after into the future."" The cinema will be run under the club model of a not-for-profit business, meaning all profits will go back into the theatre. Mr Boland said all serving cinema staff would be offered employment at the Musicians Club. ABC Broken Hill will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Friday.

65,37km of books: How a 'character's' private collection spawned state's archive,arts-culture,"  State Library of Queensland celebrates 120 years by offering behind-the-scenes access If it wasn't for 4,000 books, 500 pounds and a bearded bloke, the State Library of Queensland may never have existed. The library is celebrating its 120th birthday this month and has flicked through the archives to tell its story of origin. SLQ executive director of public libraries and engagement, Louise Denoon, said prior to its creation, Queenslanders only had access to private collections. ""In the late 1880s, The School of Arts Library would allow people to pay to be part of their library,"" she said. ""There would be debates about having a public library, but no-one was interested."" In 1896, the then Mayor of Brisbane, a bearded gent named Robert Woods Thurlow, began a push for a free library that would be open to everyone. ""It was finally decided to create a public library of Queensland and 500 pounds was put aside to purchase a collection for people to access and use,"" Ms Denoon said. ""The collection wasn't about Queensland, they were stories that were connected to knowledge, ideas, and history from Europe and America."" The 4,000-book collection came from the extensive private library of Justice George Rogers Harding, who was apparently quite the character. ""He had many fundraising dinners where he would serve mock turtle soup, which was a fad of the day,"" Ms Denoon said. They finally opened the library in William Street in 1902, originally in the Queensland Museum's building that had been reshaped for the State Library. ""A newspaper article at the time didn't describe it with glamour, they said it was 'serviceable',"" Ms Denoon said. Queensland was the last state in Australia to form a public library and although late to the party, there were advantages, including being the first in the country to adopt the Dewey Decimal System. ""This meant we could allow access to our collection and people could find the books that they were looking for, and it opened things right up,"" Ms Denoon said. ""In the 1930s there was a movement of more and more public libraries. ""We saw the growth in libraries around the state as well as seeing the State Library grow."" The library remained on the city side of the river in Brisbane before moving to the Cultural Precinct at South Bank in 1988. ""In 2006 the Millennium Library Project saw the renovation of the library and an addition of an extra floor, which opened up our award-winning building,"" Ms Denoon said. ""We're a custodian of Queensland stories and history, anything published about Queensland or published in Queensland such as photos and archival material. ""We have 47-kilometres of materials in the library for people to research and look at that have been collected from the past through to today. ""There are so many areas of the library to see, especially the John Oxley Library which celebrates the history and culture of the state so well."" On June 18 the library will open its doors to the public to celebrate its 120th birthday giving people a behind-the-scenes look at how books are preserved, stored and how conservators will look after them for hundreds of years to come. ""We want people to enjoy the space, to come into the library, to see what we're doing and plan their own adventure,"" Ms Denoon said.

66,Is vaping just an entry product to smoking?,arts-culture,"  Is vaping a safer alternative to smoking? We just don't know yet Not so long ago, having your first cigarette was a rite of passage, like a first drink or a first kiss. Smoking a cigarette stolen from a parental pack was something kids did in secret, behind the bike shed, down at the footy oval. It was a form of play, pretending to be a grown-up. Now that first puff is more likely to come from a vape inhaler as tobacco companies pivot to survive. Hailed by some as a safer alternative to smoking, there are growing concerns vaping is creating a new generation of nicotine addicts, some of whom will end up as tobacco users. Vaping fluid, turned into an inhalable vapour by a heating element in an e-cigarette, is widely available in retail stores and online. While fluid containing nicotine is only legally available in Australia with a prescription, vapers will tell you it's not hard to get. Many vaping fluids sold over the counter labelled as non-nicotine, do in fact contain nicotine. Professor Simon Chapman, who has been at the forefront of public health efforts against tobacco smoking since the 1980s, spoke to The Context this week and said it took decades for the deadly effects of tobacco smoke to become clear, and it may be the same with vaping. ""Some of my biggest concerns are with flavourants,"" Chapman says. ""The average vaper who vapes daily takes about five to six hundred puffs and we really have no idea what the long-term consequences of that are going to be."" Professor Chapman says time is running out to prevent a repeat of the past. He and others want to see all vaping fluid made prescription-only and importation heavily restricted. ""We need to be very, very cautious. We need to err on the side of strong regulation."" Nicola Roxon, who now chairs VicHealth, Victoria's Health Promotion Foundation, is similarly dubious about the tobacco industry's motives in promoting vaping. ""I don't think the industry has earned the right to be trusted, which is kind of their argument on vaping — 'look trust us, it's not as bad as tobacco, at least it will help some people quit' — when the early signs are it's actually being used as an entry product back into smoking."" Researchers at the ANU came to a similar conclusion, stating: ""There is strong evidence that non-smokers who use e-cigarettes are three times as likely to go on to smoke combustible tobacco."" Other studies suggest around 10 per cent of 14 to 17-year-olds are now vaping, a higher proportion than regularly smoke. Currently around 12 per cent of men and 8 per cent of women smoke – around half of what it was at the turn of the century. Yet smoking rates in the Indigenous population are three times that. A quarter of adult Australians used to smoke but have quit, while more than 60 per cent of us have never smoked. Of those who do, 70 per cent say they want to quit. People experiencing problems with their mental health are much more likely to be smokers. More than 30 per cent of those with social phobias, more than half of people with general anxiety and two-thirds of people experiencing some form of psychotic disorder smoke. Where you live can also be an indicator of whether you're still likely to smoke. People living in remote areas smoke at a rate of around 20 per cent. It's 13 per cent in the regions and around 10 per cent in our cities. People in the lowest-income areas are almost four times more likely to smoke than those in the richest areas. The highest smoking rates are now among people in their fifties, followed by the forty-somethings. Fewer than 5 per cent of people aged over 70 smoke, in part simply because many older male smokers have died. People in their twenties were the biggest smokers 20 years ago — that's fallen from 31 per cent to 13 per cent today. There was a time when smoking was everywhere. Ornate ashtrays adorned every coffee table, dining table, even the bedside table. You could smoke on trains, on planes, in taxis, in pubs, clubs and the finest restaurants. On TV and in the movies, everyone seemed to smoke almost non-stop. A cigarette draped from Humphrey Bogart's lip was a sign of both toughness and nonchalance; in James Dean's hand it was rebellious, even dangerous; in Audrey Hepburn's long holder, it spoke of elegance. For a bunch of burning leaves rolled in a piece of paper, a cigarette sure had acting range. At the end of World War II in 1945, 72 per cent of Australian men and 26 per cent of women smoked. Servicemen were given free cigarettes with their rations. A smoking soldier was, by definition, at ease, relaxing between battles or after victory had been won. You couldn't see people smoke on the radio, but the ads told they were rich, mild, tasty and smooth on the throat. That was our first clue. Until smoking became commonplace in the first decades of the 20th century, lung and throat cancers were comparatively rare. Doctors started noticing more and more cases until by the 1950s it was impossible to ignore. In 1957, Humphrey Bogart died from smoking-related cancer of the oesophagus. In 1964, the US Surgeon General announced cigarette smoking was ""causally related to lung cancer"", and a few months later singer Nat King Cole died from the disease at the age of just 45. Female smoking rates peaked at 33 per cent in the mid-1970s, after tobacco companies targeted the economically empowered women's movement to make up for lost male smokers. Faced with overwhelming evidence, and a growing burden on health budgets, the 1970s saw a phased ban on tobacco advertising on Australian television and radio. It took much longer to remove cigarette ads from billboards, newspapers and magazines. Tobacco companies still bought their way onto TV screens through sporting sponsorships into the 2000s, until finally a decade ago when their brands were effectively taken from them in Australia with world-first generic packaging. That reform was championed by then-federal health minister Nicola Roxon, who told The Context it was aimed at stopping younger people from wanting to start smoking in the first place. ""The way that tobacco is appealing, the way that packets looked, making them uglier, making it embarrassing for people to have them on the table at the pub."" Smoking was no longer associated with glamour: the drab packs now linked it to phlegm and gangrene. Government-mandated increases in tobacco taxes had an impact too. Back in 1980, a pack of cigarettes cost $1.10 (adjusted for inflation, that's around $5) compared with close to $50 for a pack today. Price, along with health concerns, is the major reason people say they've quit. So, all-in-all we have come a long way, although because death from smoking-related illness often involves a time lag of many years, we are still seeing in excess of 20,000 deaths from smoking-related disease each year.

67,New evidence shows how a major supplier to an Australian gallery worked with an accused smuggler,arts-culture,"  How South-East Asian art sold in Australia passed through the hands of a suspected smuggler New evidence uncovered by the ABC has linked many Thai and Cambodian artworks sold in Australia to looted historic sites and a shady Bangkok dealer. Background Briefing is daring narrative journalism — Australian investigations with impact. Listen for free on the ABC Listen app, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, or your favourite podcast app. The Cambodian Government has seized upon the ABC's findings and is calling on Australian galleries to return suspicious cultural artefacts ""unless they can demonstrate they legally possess them"". The revelations potentially taint the supply chain of works in public and private collections in Australia and abroad. Experts have long feared many Khmer artefacts which left the country during Cambodia's decades of civil unrest may have been looted. The artworks continue to hold deep religious and spiritual significance for Cambodians who want them returned. Many of the Thai and Cambodian works that came to Australia in the 1960s and 70s were imported by the David Jones Art Gallery, a now-closed offshoot of the department store. The David Jones Art Gallery helped set the decorating style of that period. Under the leadership of Robert Haines, the gallery helped to popularise the display of South-East Asian artefacts not just to the elite but to a broader clientele in Australia. Background Briefing has traced artefacts sold by the David Jones Art Gallery to some of Australia's most significant South-East Asian art collections, including items in the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Art Gallery of South Australia and the National Gallery of Victoria. The David Jones Art Gallery's sales records give a snapshot of their clientele. They include a cross-section of prominent Australians and international figures. Among them are former World Bank president Sir James David Wolfensohn; Lady Schlink — also known as Dr Margaret Mulvey, the pioneering gynaecologist; Princess Diana's stepfather, Peter Shand Kydd; Sir Nicholas Sekers, a British-based industrialist; newspaper owner James Fairfax and others. Teachers need permission to speak to media, but whistleblowers want you to know what’s really going on in NSW schools hit by staff shortages. However, Background Briefing can reveal one major supplier to the David Jones Art Gallery was implicated in a landmark US art theft case, where evidence suggested that he falsified provenance and worked with a notorious accused art smuggler. The supplier, Chinese-Thai art dealer Peng Seng, also known as Arthorn Sirikantraporn, worked with accused art smuggler Douglas Latchford to falsify provenance details and help smuggle items, according to evidence in the case. Peng Seng's ties to Douglas Latchford are highly significant. During the 60s and 70s, Thailand was a gateway for stolen Khmer artefacts smuggled across the border. Among the many Khmer art dealers who operated out of Thailand, none are as notorious as Latchford. In 2012, the Bangkok art dealer was revealed as being at the centre of a US investigation into the sale of a looted Cambodian temple guardian by auction house Sotheby's. He was later charged with smuggling offences in 2019, when prosecutors alleged his artefacts were the product of ""looting, unauthorised excavation and illicit smuggling"", and that he had covered up their origins by creating false provenance. ""Latchford built a career out of the smuggling and illicit sale of priceless Cambodian antiquities, often straight from archaeological sites, in the international art market,"" US attorney Geoffrey Berman said at the time. Latchford died in 2020 before he could face trial. The David Jones Art Gallery supplier, Peng Seng, was referred to in the 2019 indictment against Latchford under the alias ""the Thai Dealer"". His identity can now be revealed, after the ABC obtained an unredacted 1974 letter detailing his involvement and collusion with Latchford in falsifying provenance records. The letter, which was from a prominent London-based auction house at the time, was put forward as evidence by US prosecutors in their recent case against Latchford. It describes how Peng Seng would falsify provenance paperwork: ""I have explored extensively with Peng Seng and Latchford how to get ‘legitimate' papers for the large koh ker [sculpture] and for all subsequent shipments,"" the letter reads. ""Peng Seng will send us a letter written and signed by somebody in Bangkok. He will say that he has seen the piece in Peng Seng's shop three years ago. Peng Seng would like us to give him the exact text that we want in this letter."" It goes on to describe how pieces could be labelled so as to potentially confuse customs officials: ""On all future shipments of important pieces only, both Peng Seng and Latchford will ship the pieces the way they have always done, [and] at more or less the same time will send a modern piece of about the same size and same subject described on the airway bill in such a way that nobody will know to which piece the airway bill applies."" Further evidence obtained by Background Briefing shows Peng Seng may also have illegally exported prehistoric artefacts out of Thailand and into Australia. A series of correspondence with the David Jones Art Gallery from 1972 suggests Peng Seng may have been circumventing Thai export controls to remove precious neolithic Thai pottery, known as Ban Chiang antiquities. Ban Chiang pottery is around 5,000 years old. The site of its discovery in Thailand was described by UNESCO as ""the most important prehistoric settlement so far discovered in South-East Asia"". The Prime Minister of Thailand specifically banned its export in 1972. Shortly after that Peng Seng wrote to the David Jones Art Gallery director, Robert Haines: ""We are sorry to inform you that the Thai Government has only lately put a ban on selling these pottery here … Nevertheless, it does not mean that we could not supply you again in the future. You know what we mean!"" Despite the warning, the correspondence indicates the David Jones Art Gallery continued to request and purchase the items well into 1973. The National Gallery of Australia (NGA) and the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW) bought a number of Ban Chiang vessels from the David Jones Art Gallery in 1973. However, it is unclear whether these were exported from Thailand before or after the ban. The gallery's director Robert Haines told a newspaper at the time the items were brought over prior to the ban; however, correspondence shows he continued to seek out their purchase from Thailand afterward. Close friends of Haines told Background Briefing he would never knowingly accept stolen artworks or work with art dealers who falsify provenance. Peng Seng was one of a number of dealers supplying the gallery during this period, and it's unclear which artefacts sold to major galleries were supplied by him. Phoeurng Sackona, Cambodia's Minister of Culture and Fine Arts, told Background Briefing the connection should be further investigated. ""We are aware of several dealers who have trafficked in stolen Cambodian antiquities,"" she said. ""Peng Seng is a name our investigative team is well familiar with. The provenance of items associated with his name raises substantial concerns."" Minister Sackona said that galleries who possess suspicious items without legal title should return them. ""We ask Australian galleries to return such cultural properties unless they can demonstrate they legally possess them."" IVF is big business in Australia. But in the quest to innovate, one company may have gone too far. The head of the NGA's provenance project Bronwyn Campbell told Background Briefing ""the connection [with Peng Seng] will be taken into account as part of our review of David Jones [Art Gallery] acquisitions"". ""If we're sure that something has been illegally obtained or unethically obtained, we would consider repatriating it. And when I say sure, I mean more than 50 per cent certain,"" she said. The Background Briefing investigation has also identified a number of other suspicious artworks in major collections. Some were identified as coming from areas known to be the subject of extensive looting. Others passed through the hands of Australian collectors and now feature prominently in major galleries across the world. For example, a lintel or stone wall panel from a temple was photographed on the ground in Cambodia in 1969. An identical lintel now appears at the Norton Simon Museum in California after being purchased from Latchford. An early 8th century Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara statue from western Cambodia sits in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, after originally being owned by Australian art collector Alex Biancardi. Background Briefing has obtained an early black-and-white photograph of what appears to be the same work which was found on the computer of accused smuggler Latchford. It was within a collection of records labelled 'Spinks' [a London-based auction house] on his computer. Another work — a large five-headed stone serpent — was in the collection of Australian architect and furniture designer, Douglas Snelling. A 1974 catalogue describes the artefact as originating from Preah Vihear, the temple site which sits on the Cambodian-Thai border and was the subject of extensive looting. The same item now resides at the Norton Simon Museum. Another item owned by Douglas Snelling, a sandstone head of Vishnu, was attributed to a ""temple at Phimai"". Phimai is a site of important Angkorian ruins in north-east Thailand. It was declared a protected site in 1936 by the Thai government. Douglas Snelling was among the biggest collectors of South-East Asian antiquities of his time and, at one time, the Honorary Consul-General of Cambodia. In a 1965 letter obtained by Background Briefing, he describes ""smuggling"" Cambodian items out of Thailand: ""Apart from some small bronzes given to us by the Royal Family in Cambodia, we acquired our other Angkor pieces outside the borders of Cambodia. Some of these we had to smuggle out of Thailand, even though they were originally stolen from Angkor,"" he said in the letter. He continues: ""One of the bronzes we bought for something like $US20 has been valued by a New York art dealer in excess of $100,000. This sounds crazy I know, but similar extraordinary values apply to all the pieces we have, and we now have about 20. You can imagine our excitement at acquiring these right at the source, and the excitement of ultimately getting them freighted home."" One item described in this letter was a 180-kilogram seven-headed snake known as a Naga, carved out of basalt. A similar piece was later photographed in Snelling's Sydney home in 1966, but has never been found. In the late 70s, much of Snelling's extensive collection was sold off. With the help of South-East Asian art scholar Angela Chiu, Background Briefing has visually matched pieces from his collection. The works appear to be held by prominent US galleries including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Chicago Institute of Art. The Chicago Institute of Art told Background Briefing that it continuously researches the provenance of its collection and that its records on Snelling's objects did not indicate provenance issues. A spokeswoman from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art said ""the museum actively researches claims and inquiries made about objects in its collection and appreciates any additional documentation ... [that] anyone else may be able to share to assist in those efforts."" Angela Chiu has been working with Background Briefing to track down South-East Asian artefacts with suspicious provenance. ""Museums present themselves as these temples of culture and history, of the values of their communities, these edifices of a public education,"" she said. ""They cannot be that on the one hand and, on the other hand, close off discussion or fail to be open about the origins of their collections."" Chiu said often museums set the bar too high for repatriation. ""They decide what their own standard of proof is and, unfortunately, this can be unrealistic … so you have to wonder whether some of what museums are demanding now is not actually due diligence but instead ways to avoid having to repatriate something."" Not all items investigated by Background Briefing ended up in galleries or museums or were sold at auction. An 8th century Vishnu head, once belonging to collector Alex Biancardi, was found in his relative's garage next to a stack of firewood. Egyptian-born Australian businessman Alex Biancardi was one of the world's most significant collectors from the 1960s to the 80s. Many of his items were either gifted to or purchased by the AGNSW following his death in 1998. Others can be found in London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, and in Sydney’s Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. A 1974 letter from London auction house Spink, obtained by Background Briefing, suggests Biancardi was in personal contact with accused smuggler Douglas Latchford. ""Latchford offered the [sculpture] directly to Biancardi in Paris by photograph,"" the letter reads. There is no evidence Biancardi knowingly purchased stolen goods at the time. The NGA is currently negotiating the return of a Cham Padmapani statue with the Cambodian Government, after it was linked to Douglas Latchford. Cambodia's Culture and Fine Art Minister Phoeurng Sackona said the NGA ""has thus far been cooperative and forthright"". Two women are accused of poisoning their own children at the same hospital. They say it tore their lives apart. The Cambodian Government has been contacting galleries across the world appealing for the return of items removed without proper authorisation in the 1960s and '70s. ""Cambodia has never, really, given permission for any objects to go out,"" said the Cambodian Ministry of Culture's chief legal counsel and the head of its investigative team, Bradley Gordon. ""So when we're talking to museums and private collections, we're saying to them, 'If you possess these Khmer objects, you should prove to us you have legal title', because we know the answer is going to be they don't have it. ""Australia is definitely on our radar and we know that a number of statues ended up there."" Cambodian archaeologist Sopheap Meas has been interviewing villagers to help to trace looted artefacts. She said the artefacts continue to have a deep spiritual value to many Cambodians decades after they were removed. ""It's like they lost an ancestor; they've lost their ancestral spirit,"" she said. ""When they go to the temple, they say, 'I don't want to go there because the God is … living outside of the country'."" The Cambodian Government is now working with former looters who are helping to identify and trace works overseas. In many cases, it is not seeking for items to be returned but rather for an acknowledgement that an item may have been stolen, and is in fact the legal property of the Cambodian Government. The Art Gallery of South Australia, which holds an Angkor sandstone dancing figure originally bought from the David Jones Art Gallery, told Background Briefing that it bought the piece following protocols that were widely accepted as professionally rigorous at the time. ""It has now been raised as a work for further provenance research,"" a spokesperson said. The National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) purchased a 13th century Palanquin fitting from the David Jones Art Gallery. When contacted by Background Briefing, the NGV did not respond to questions but a spokesperson said the collection is being digitised to facilitate new and ongoing research including provenance. The AGNSW's senior curator of Asian art, Melanie Eastburn, said that the gallery was examining its collection of Biancardi items as part of its provenance project. ""Although they come from the same source ... their ownership histories and provenance is completely varied, so we can't make any assumptions that because one has a particular history that any other would have the same history,"" she said. The AGNSW said it is also researching the provenance of its Ban Chiang pottery, using archives of the David Jones Art Gallery. Many healthcare workers are afraid of speaking to the media, but they are also desperate for the public to know what's been happening in our hospitals. Sydney's Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, which has two Khmer objects once owned Alex Biancardi, said it engaged an independent expert to ""authenticate and value"" the objects before purchase. The items were passed to another collector before coming into the museum’s collection. The Victoria and Albert Museum, which also holds a number of Biancardi works, told Background Briefing that the museum makes much of its provenance information public and that research into its items is continuous. A spokeswoman from New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art told Background Briefing the gallery had long been reviewing objects connected to Latchford and his associates. She said that in 2013 the gallery had returned two objects connected to Latchford. ""As we continue our research, we will continue this approach, as is appropriate,"" she said. The Norton Simon Museum declined to comment. Auction house Spink said it no longer had any connection to the company of the same name that operated in the 1960s and '70s, and that it ceased trading in ancient art and antiquities from 2002, when the business was sold to new owners.

68,Latest Jurassic film suffers from an uninspiring plot not even Chris Pratt and Sam Neill can save,arts-culture,"  Jurassic World Dominion pairs a star cast of Chris Pratt, Sam Neill and Laura Dern with free-roaming dinosaurs to disappointing effect Whatever cosmic fate befell the dinosaurs, it's hard to imagine their demise being worse than this latest — and allegedly final — chapter of the six-film Jurassic franchise. A series that has always had its humanity — and eaten it, too — the long-dormant franchise bellowed back to life with Colin Trevorrow's Jurassic World (2015), a deeply cynical film about cynical theme-park practice that nonetheless featured many people being satisfyingly chomped, pecked and swallowed — the very reasons, let's face it, that these movies can be so much fun. Its follow-up, JA Bayona's horror-tinged Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), drew out the series' underlying, giddy misanthropy — or at least its critique of human hubris — to end on a literal cliffhanger in which dinosaurs were finally let loose on the world to menace a distinctly, fittingly Spielbergian suburbia. Chaos was on the menu, and it was exciting. Jurassic World Dominion, which returns the middling Trevorrow to the director's chair, wastes no time in dashing those expectations. In a lazy opening montage, news reports inform us that yes, dinosaurs have caused a few deaths and minor traffic accidents, but on the whole they seem to be widely tolerated minor irritants — or worse, subjects for poaching, black-market dealing, and nefarious pharmaceutical interests. There's nary a Triceratops hosting an evening talk show nor a T-Rex running for local government, elements which would seem like no brainers for even the most basic screenwriter. Instead we find Chris Pratt's one-time raptor wrangler Owen Grady and his partner, Bryce Dallas Howard's park administrator Claire Dearing, hiding out in the Nevada mountains with their adopted daughter, Isabella Sermon's now-teenage Maisie Lockwood — the clone girl from Fallen Kingdom whose DNA holds some kind of secret connection between humanity and its reptilian counterparts. In an early, almost touching scene, Pratt, sporting a lumberjack shirt and riding horseback, wrangles a Parasaurolophus in a Valley of Gwangi-like moment that might have made Ray Harryhausen smile. Meanwhile, the series' latest avatar for unchecked capitalism and gene-splice-meddling, a company called BIOSYN, have unleashed a plague of genetically modified super locusts on the world's farming crops, for reasons that are so ill-conceived and ultimately irrelevant to the action that they require little explanation. Their boss, Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott), is the Hollywood villain du jour — a futuristic-grey-wearing, Zuckerberg-adjacent tech magnate who even the most uninitiated viewer knows will get his reptilian comeuppance. Tops Arts & Culture headlines. When BIOSYN goons capture Maisie, they lead Owen and Claire — together with mercenary pilot Kayla Watts, played by DeWanda Wise — on a chase that takes them to the company's facility in Italy, where the bulk of the movie's action takes place. Rather than accommodate the thrill of a worldwide dino rampage — Fallen Kingdom's promise to break the series' familiar template — Dominion shrinks, effectively repeating the same old beats by restaging Jurassic Park and Jurassic World, right down to the climactic T-Rex-versus-adversary showdown. Because this is the concluding series in a franchise inaugurated by Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park, all the way back in that relative time of wonder, 1993, Dominion must also find ways to crowbar original stars Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum into proceedings — which it does with a minimum of fanfare and a maximum of shoddy dialogue, forced plotting and contrived emotional threads. Dern's Dr Ellie Sattler, now a convenient expert in locusts, and Sam Neill's paleontologist Dr Alan Grant, are tipped off by a mole inside BIOSYN, where Goldblum's leather-clad Dr Ian Malcolm is taking a lucrative pay cheque as the resident rockstar chaotician. Their reunion has all the emotional spark of three actors who've barely met each other, let alone co-starred in one of Hollywood's most iconic blockbusters — which doesn't stop the filmmakers attempting to force an autumnal romance between Sattler and Grant, nor laying on thick snippets of John Williams's Jurassic Park theme in a transparent effort to spark the audience's emotional response. With its tangle of dull plots, under-utilised characters and ham-fisted swings at ecological metaphor, Dominion is distractingly busy but never compelling. It really is startling how poorly imagined and executed this movie is, especially considering the weight of expectations, nostalgia and the series' own cinematic precedent — who could forget the dazzling and groundbreaking thrill of the imagery in Spielberg's first film, which invited the audience to share in its genuine awe. Though they're rendered in the handsome, computer-generated late style of the franchise, the dinosaurs mostly feel secondary, inserted as low-level obstacles whenever the filmmakers run out of human intrigue — which is often — or when they stop to remember that, just maybe, the big lizards are what the audience is here to see. Sequences like a motorcycle chase though the streets of Malta feel like offcuts from a second-unit James Bond sequence, while clashes between an Allosaurus and a T-Rex — or a should-be-spectacular Quetzalcoatlus duel with a plane — are merely tossed off among rote action that has little sense of dramatic rhythm. Every dinosaur encounter feels like a shrug, de-fanged of suspense, terror or anything approaching a sense of amazement that these ancient beings are casually roaming the earth. If the film's characters aren't even in thrall to the dinosaurs, what chance does an audience have? Actors of the calibre of Dern and Neill are left to mouth perfunctory lines and hope that their cloned 1993 outfits — and sunglasses-removing gaping — might summon something resembling audience goodwill, while Goldblum, so essential to the first film's human spark and sass, is left with a succession of clunkers that curdle his charisma into tired schtick. ""Jurassic World?"" Goldblum wonders at one point. ""Not a fan."" It's one of the screenplay's many pitiful attempts at meta-humour — and one that comes off as inadvertent self-critique. If this is the best a franchise tentpole can do, bring on the meteor. Jurassic World Dominion is in cinemas now.

69,Melbourne Uni to 'dramatically' reduce reliance on casuals after underpayment scandal,arts-culture,"  Melbourne University provost Nicola Phillips has apologised for underpayment at the institution and announced the university would overhaul its employment model and ""dramatically"" reduce its reliance on casual staff in response to the scandal. ""We're dismayed that it's happened … In this case, we have not done the right thing. And we are working really hard to put it right,"" she told 7.30 in an exclusive interview. The university sector has been plagued by revelations of widespread underpayment over the past two years, with a Senate inquiry reporting half of all universities had been implicated and the Fair Work Ombudsman currently investigating at least a dozen. Professor Phillips announced Melbourne University would overhaul its employment model and scale back its heavy reliance on casual staff, which she acknowledged was partly to blame for the widespread underpayment at the institution. ""We are looking at dramatically reducing our reliance on casual contracts as a way of employing staff,"" she revealed to 7.30 ""We've identified that this kind of model is not one that serves the university well, and it's not one that serves our employees well, and we're determined that for the future, we're going to rethink this model, reduce our reliance on casual staff and make sure that we put in place something that is more sustainable for the future."" Professor Phillips said the university ""hadn't put a figure"" on how many casual roles would be reviewed or converted to permanent positions, nor the time frame during which the overhaul would take place. The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) and some experts, like ANU higher education policy professor Andrew Norton, have been calling for a reduction on the reliance of casual staff at universities, as they too believe casualisation is a major factor driving underpayment. ""Underpayment of wages is rampant across the sector,"" NTEU head Alison Barnes told 7.30. ""The problem would be resolved if employment relations in universities were secure, if people were employed in secure, ongoing and permanent jobs."" Professor Norton said, ""academics who've got a permanent contract or on a fixed-term contract for a number of years, we really haven't seen the high error of underpayment for those people"". ""The scope for error is much, much lower than it is for casuals,"" he said. ""And so that's really where we need to move to a larger percentage of the academic workforce being on one of these more general contracts that do not have detailed tasks by the hour."" Despite Melbourne University's ongoing review aiming to stamp out underpayment, 7.30 can reveal that the school of dance at the university's prestigious Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) is the latest institution to face claims of underpayment. It is in a dispute with the NTEU, which is trying to recover wages for staff. Former Melbourne University casual dance tutor Hamish McIntosh is one of those claiming underpayment. He began teaching dance at the VCA in 2019 but last year was informed his role and the classes he taught would be reclassified, which meant he would be paid less. ""To quote the letter itself, management suggested that the classes that myself and my colleagues delivered were not epistemologically based, and that we lacked the intellectual expertise for the classes to be classified as tutorials proper,"" Mr McIntosh told 7.30. 7.30 has seen letters from management detailing the reclassification, which state ""most of our practical classes do not meet the Enterprise Agreement Definition of what constitutes a Tutorial, ie a supplementary class that is related to a Lecture"". Mr McIntosh said he found the letter and characterisation of staff expertise offensive. ""I have a first-class master's in dance studies, I'm internationally published in dance pedagogy, presented research on dance pedagogy and I've been teaching in universities since 2018. ""So it's kind of like a smack in the face [to be told] you lack the intellectual expertise for this work to qualify as a regular tutorial."" 7.30 understands the university has now reversed its decision to reclassify the tutorials — however, Mr McIntosh has since left and estimates he's owed around $5,000 in wages, which he is working with the union to recover. ""Which for viewers may not sound like a lot of money,"" he told 7.30, ""but for me as a postgraduate student, that's a tremendous amount of money. I relied on that money."" Professor Phillips declined to comment on the school of dance issue specifically but promised, ""if a problem has occurred, we will put it right"". ""I want to be really clear that it's not the approach of the university to reclassify roles for that purpose,"" she told 7.30. ""There are some complexities about role classifications, but where they arise, we work them through with our staff and with the union as well."" The NTEU is calling for the federal government to introduce legislation forcing universities to employ more full-time staff. In a statement, Education Minister Jason Clare told 7.30 the new government was planning to criminalise wage theft. Watch this story on ABC TV and ABC iview.

70,Sherlock's ghosts: How a man who attended séances fathered fiction's most famous detective,arts-culture,"  Sherlock Holmes didn't go in for ghosts — but the fictional detective's creator Arthur Conan Doyle had other ideas In January 1924, London's Strand Magazine published a detective story that contained this scathing assault on the idea of the living dead: What have we to do with walking corpses who can only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts? It's pure lunacy. The world is big enough for us. No ghosts need apply. At first glance, these lines appear to have little in common with sentiments expressed in a travel log released three years earlier: Such séances have been going on now for 70 years, with innumerable witnesses of credit who will testify, as I have done here, that all fraud or mistake was out of the question. Altogether I should think that not less than 20 spirits manifested. The first example dismisses ghosts as mere figments of the mind, but the author of the second accepts their existence as indisputable fact. Such discrepancy isn't especially surprising — until it becomes clear that both these passages were penned by the same author, the Scottish doctor and novelist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. ""This is the man who created one of the most rational characters in literature — Sherlock Holmes,"" literary historian Susannah Fullerton said. ""[Doyle] became completely obsessed with spiritualism."" The spiritualist movement arose during the mid-1800s, promoting the view that the living could communicate with lost loved ones. Doyle drifted towards it during his mid-20s. ""Curiously enough, my first experiences in that direction were about the time Sherlock Holmes was being built up in my mind,"" he recalled in 1929. ""As I grow older, the psychic subject always grows in intensity."" That intensification coincided with several personal tragedies — Doyle's eldest son and only brother succumbed to Spanish flu about a year before he embarked on a voyage to Australia in 1920. ""He did have a desire to convert others — that was the whole reason behind the trip,"" said Ms Fullerton — who, while she doesn't at all share Doyle's views, has explored them in her book Brief Encounters. ""He wasn't coming to Australia to see kangaroos or look at the scenery. ""He went to séances. He even went over to New Zealand … [where] there was a medium, in Christchurch, who had a 'psychic' dog."" In his downtime down under, Doyle allowed himself more terrestrial pleasures. He held a possum at Humbug Scrub, near Adelaide, and the city earned his praise: ""I have seen few such cities, so pretty, so orderly and so self-sufficing"". At the local art gallery he was impressed by HJ Johnstone's Evening Shadows, a painting of the River Murray that includes a depiction of Aboriginal Australians — whose treatment by wider society was described by Doyle as a ""dark stain upon Australia"". He visited Perth and Brisbane, went to football and cricket matches in Melbourne, and took a Sydney Harbour cruise. ""For the first time, he saw people on surfboards, which he found intriguing,"" Ms Fullerton said. ""He was down in Melbourne at the time of the Melbourne Cup and he hated the gambling and the betting that went on."" Following its emergence in the 19th century, spiritualism enjoyed something of a second life in the early 20th, amid collective social shell shock. ""To a large extent it grew out of World War I — there was a sense that the world had just exploded, and the way of life that people were used to had been changed forever,"" Ms Fullerton said. ""Many people were missing relatives — sons, brothers, fiances and husbands. People clung to hope and thought, 'Well, maybe there is a chance we can speak to our dead son through a séance'. ""In the book he wrote after the trip, Wanderings of a Spiritualist, he admitted to some disappointment in Australians not being as receptive to the whole idea as he felt they ought to be, and he did face some very hostile crowds."" Some of that opposition was from church groups, and his movement was at times accused — including by illusionist Harry Houdini — of encouraging false hope among the bereaved. But Doyle's conviction was further consolidated by the appearance of various photographs purporting to show supernatural beings. The most notorious pictures were taken by two young cousins in a Yorkshire village. They show the girls ""in a garden with fairies"" which, Ms Fullerton said, ""were later proved to be fakes"". ""When [Doyle] came to Australia, he brought with him the photographs that were known as the pictures of the Cottingley fairies, and he claimed that this was absolute proof that fairies existed."" Spiritualist movements remain active today, but with less prominence than during Doyle's public crusade. He died in 1930, and it could be argued that the fictitious Holmes has enjoyed the more fruitful afterlife, being perpetually re-imagined in film and television productions. ""The curious thing is how many people there are in the world who are perfectly convinced he is a living human being,"" Doyle can be heard saying in a rare recording from 1929. ""I get letters addressed to him, I get letters asking for his autograph."" To his devotees, Holmes speaks not from beyond the grave, but from between the covers of the books his maker bequeathed to the world.

71,Indigenous furore after exhibition describes sacred place 'without permission',arts-culture,"  York art exhibition by Tim Burns taken down after Indigenous appropriation claims Just outside the Wheatbelt town of York lies the Cave Hill Farm — a site sacred to the Indigenous Ballardong people. A place of men's business in the past, the property was used to carry out initiation ceremonies and was formerly home to Indigenous rock art displays. But the site has now become the centre of a cultural dispute. An exhibition by well-known artist Tim Burns has been removed from York's Gallery 152 just five days into its month-long showing after it was criticised for appropriating Aboriginal culture. The exhibition featured photographs of a nearby quarry, and gave a written history of the significance of Cave Hill. The text was met with condemnation by some members of the local Kickett family, including former Curtin University professor Marion Kickett. ""It's wrong. He should not have put it up,"" she said. ""It's breaching cultural protocols – it's misappropriation. He's describing what's in the cave [which is a sacred site]."" Her nephew Rohin Kickett, a Noongar artist, also led the push for parts of the display to be taken down. ""Creating these artworks, talking about a sacred site and the significance of it, he's taken the intellectual property and used it for personal gain,"" he said. ""It's only meant for people who are initiated."" The man behind the work is award-winning artist Tim Burns, who has featured in galleries both domestically and overseas as far back as the 1970s. He has denied breaching any cultural protocols, and said he had spoken to the official custodians before going ahead with the project. ""They came and redacted all the things they didn't think were applicable, and I agreed to that,"" he said. ""My work is about examining things that are contentious. It's what I've been doing for 60 years or so."" Burns has worked with Indigenous artists for decades, and won awards for his short film, Luke's Party, made with Aboriginal director Ros Sultan. He used to own the quarry and wanted the show to explain why he had purchased the land. ""I saw it as a metaphor for white and black politics … it struck me that having a quarry next to the site was sort of like the Juukan Gorge situation,"" he said. ""I don't want to start a war, but I don't want to be accused of something I haven't done."" But Professor Kickett said the well-known artist had misled the gallery. ""I was shocked … I never, ever spoke to Tim – never gave him permission whatsoever,"" she said. A Gallery 152 spokesperson said they chose to take down the display because they ""did not want to hurt or cause pain"" to the community. The case has highlighted a range of perspectives about how appropriation is handled, and from where permission should be sought. While some have been vehement that parts of the display were rightly removed, Ballardong elder and artist Dennis Kickett said he held a different view. After changes were made to the text, he saw nothing wrong with the display. ""Some of the stuff shouldn't have been put up and I spoke to Tim about it, and Tim understands that,"" he said. ""After the redactions, I didn't think there was anything culturally inappropriate. ""What I don't agree with is Rohin [Kickett, his nephew], a young man ... going around making these statements. He does not represent our family."" But Rohin, who has worked for years advising organisations on cultural appropriation, said Burns had misrepresented his family, and had no right to share information about a sacred site. ""Our elders before us have always told us not to touch it. Even as an artist myself, I wouldn't be able to get permission to create artwork on that site,"" he said. ""For me and the next generation of Noongar artists coming through, if they want to explore these things there should be space for them to explore it. ""It shouldn't be taken up by non-Indigenous artists."" Burns said he ""thought I did what I was supposed to do"". ""The big problem here, and what we should be looking out for, is this total censorship of the interaction between Indigenous and white artists ... it's a multicultural situation.""

72,"Benediction is a moving tale of queer longing set against the backdrop of WWI, starring Jack Lowden",arts-culture,"  Benediction, from director Terence Davies, examines the life and secret affairs of queer English war poet Siegfried Sassoon Terence Davies does not attempt to re-create the putrid trenches of the Western Front in his new film about the war poet Siegfried Sassoon. Best remembered as mentor to Wilfred Owen, he was awarded the Military Cross for ""conspicuous bravery"" — shortly before he chose to boldly denounce the war as unconscionable in 1917. Despite the explosive symphonies of mud and blood that propel films like 1917 or Dunkirk – and you may recognise the latter's Jack Lowden as the youthful Sassoon here, while ex-Doctor Who Peter Capaldi plays the poet in his autumnal years – writer-director Davies is of the belief that no re-creation, however grand the budget, can purport to get close to the awful quiddity of war. In Benediction, the ninth feature from the great British director (who made his auspicious debut in 1988 with autobiographical tone poem Distant Voices, Still Lives), archival footage – of men who grip their bayonets and stare into the camera lens; of corpses slumped and left to rot – subs in for the combat through which Sassoon's poetic and moral consciousness was forged. Often used for flashbacks, these degraded black-and-white images contrast the rest of the film and its various refined interiors, which are crisply rendered by cinematographer Nicola Daley. The haunting power of such fragments comes precisely from the sense that the reality they show exists at a remove of more than a century from the viewer; rather than the simulated immersion offered by works of shrapnel-studded spectacle, there is the sense of an unbridgeable gap in experience. But in Davies's telling, Sassoon's story is as much a tragic gay romance as it is a war movie. Tops Arts & Culture headlines. The death in combat of Wilfred Owen – a mere week before Armistice Day, 1918 – would leave an indelible mark on Sassoon, who was not only a mentor to the younger poet (played by Matthew Tennyson), but a suitor. Their mutual infatuation sparked in the unlikely haven of Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh, where they would produce some of their finest work (including Owens's Anthem for Doomed Youth, the stinging accompaniment to one of the film's documentary montages), while being treated for what would soon be termed ""shell shock"". Those familiar with the filmmaker's work – his are domestic worlds of small pleasures and painful revelations – would no doubt guess him to be entirely uninterested in military strategy or the politics of any particular attack or retreat. The conflict that most concerns him in Benediction, as always, is one that plays out on the battlefield of the mind, where the self is both aggressor and casualty. But the degree to which Davies brings Sassoon's homosexuality to the fore suggests a new candour in the septuagenarian, whose struggles with his own orientation – growing up Catholic in 1950s working class Liverpool made being gay a profoundly distressing prospect – have previously found expression in the pent-up sexual urges of his different on-screen analogues, from the prepubescent Bud of 1992's The Long Day Closes through to reclusive poet Emily Dickinson, the subject of his last film, 2016's A Quiet Passion. ""Will you stay? Just for a few more moments,"" Siegfried entreats Wilfred on the gravel path outside the hospital, the latter's return to the trenches imminent. Facing each other, eyes cast down, the silence is suffused with emotions that propriety prevented from being expressed. A voice offscreen beckons Wilfred; the two men are not – will never be – alone, and in place of anything more intimate a handshake must suffice as their parting gesture. For those who are rusty on their high school history, Davies quickly snuffs out the notion of a potential reunion: Siegfried's voice over – aptly, he is the narrator of his own life – announces Wilfred's death as the car pulls away from Craiglockhart, just moments after their goodbye. There is a similar collapsing of history in the way that Davies – who has always preferred narratives that develop according to emotional logic rather than linear time – intercuts scenes of Capaldi's Siegfried, grey of hair and pinched of face, with those of Lowden's; the young man is on a track towards an intensely embittered, unhappily married middle age, this future disaffection inscribed in the traumas of his youth. Before he seeks absolution in the arms of Hester Gatty (Kate Phillips in her youth, then Gemma Jones) and finally Jesus, Siegfried tries out smooth-talking entertainer Ivor Novello (Jeremy Irvine, who wouldn't look out of place in a 90s erotic thriller), swishy socialite Stephen Tennant (Calam Lynch), and theatre actor Glen Byam Shaw (Tom Blyth) – his entanglements revealing the Wildean subset of London's cultured upper crust; the privileged few able to cruise soirees and restaurants with near impunity. These men dazzle the poet, but ultimately prove too changeable, and too quick to tire of his affections. ""Who can know the secrets of a human heart?"" asks Ivor airily, by way of dismissing his dalliances with others. ""Usually those who don't have one,"" comes Siegfried's sour reply. (What a boon that Benediction offers Davies a chance to indulge his sharp wit, obscured in his more languorous work.) Like A Quiet Passion, in which Cynthia Nixon played Dickinson, Benediction is a portrait of an artist passed over in their time, and burdened with outsider status even in their own select circles. Of the 1800-odd poems Dickinson penned in her lifetime, only a handful were published, while Sassoon's work – though it exhibited a frankness of style and subject matter that influenced the modernists – was rendered outmoded by the arrival of T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. (""Eliot got the Order of Merit – and the Nobel Prize,"" sniffs Capaldi's Siegfried. ""I've had to make do with the Queen's Award for Poetry."") And Sassoon, like Dickinson, would increasingly choose monastic retreat over life's barrage of cruelties and complexities. Benediction might be a war movie, but the devastation wrought is of a much subtler kind. Benediction is in cinemas now.

74,Dance album in endangered tongue brings bangers with 'the Paul Mac sheen',arts-culture,"  Noongar Wonderland dance music album featuring Paul Mac marks Indigenous milestone West Australian artist Clint Bracknell has combined his passion for music and his native Noongar Indigenous language to release an album that celebrates the ecological creatures of the region. It follows a multi-sensory stage performance of the same name at the Perth Festival this year. Bracknell, a professor of Indigenous languages, is also known by his affectionate nickname, Maatakitj, which translates to ""long legs like a spear"". ""It's a big sort of thing, I've been making music since I was young, working across genres doing everything from country music to hip-hop and every place in between and I've never really hit the mark and done something I'm really proud off or going to share,"" Bracknell said. ""For the past decade or more I've been really trying numerous song traditions and figuring out some sort of way to make music more meaningful than the things I've done in the past."" The album, Noongar Wonderland, arrives after more than a decade of research and immersion into Noongar language and song. ""It's been informed by research in a more formal way through Australian Research Council funding and my work at various universities and now the University of Queensland,"" he said. ""The core of the argument of the research that I do is around emphasising the importance of what music can be and can do and how that can connect us all and connect us to the country."" The album is released in an endangered language to mark the beginning of the United Nations International Decade of Indigenous Languages. Bracknell felt a sense of responsibility by releasing the music in the language. ""I didn't want to step into it too soon and I wanted to be really sure that what I was doing was going to be positive and not just self-serving,"" he said. ""That's why I've spent more than a decade trying to be part of this journey with a whole group of people including senior people and more people in my peer group. ""It is about the country too, figuring out how we can all work together and share something and keep something alive and strong."" Bracknell said it was a conscious choice to embrace dance music for the album and collaborated with ARIA Award-winning Australian musician Paul Mac. ""You can hear it, it's got the Paul Mac sheen to it,"" he said. ""Having it as dance music was something that hadn't really been done before but was going to capture the same energy as a corroboree-style performance, because corroboree is all about dance. ""If you think about people being together, dancing and being engaged in that same rhythm, then the equivalent of that is what happens when people listen to dance music."" The songs celebrate the ecological value of kworlak (bull sharks),  baamba (stingrays), dwerdawanart (dolphins), yornan (bobtail lizards), woordawoort (dragonflies), and demangka (groundwater) in the south-west of Western Australia. ""There's a lot of dancing the kangaroo and dancing the emu and dancing these other creatures but what about these other creatures that used to have a dance and don't anymore,"" he said. ""We started with the bull shark because we thought there should be something to not just raise attention of the bull shark but also increase respect so that we live more harmoniously with the bull shark.""

75,"On the longest night of every year, families gather to remember. Now they're the subject of a powerful film",arts-culture,"  Albury's Winter Solstice, a mental health event born out of tragedy, documented in powerful film A documentary created to encourage shame-free discussion about suicide and mental health will have its television premiere this month before being made available as a teaching aid in Australia and overseas. Solstice was written, directed and produced by Albury filmmaker Helen Newman, who was approached by local Annette Baker about documenting the town's annual Winter Solstice event. The event brings community members together to remember loved ones who took their own lives with the aim of bringing the topic into the public forum without shame or stigma. Ms Baker, and husband Stuart, have been holding the event since 2013 after launching the Survivors of Suicide and Friends organisation in response to the death of their daughter, Mary, who took her own life at the age of 15 in 2011. Ms Newman said the documentary featured interviews with those affected by suicide from across Australia, including the Bakers. ""It's about survivors of suicide, and central to that story is the story of Annette and Stuart,"" she said. ""When Annette asked me if I thought there was a documentary in the Winter Solstice event, I said, 'I think there is, but you will have to let me follow you around with a camera so we can get the backstory.'"" She said the film was a ""grassroots voice"" raised to unite, challenge and change how people responded to mental health issues. As well as interviews with survivors of suicide, Ms Newman said the documentary featured mental health commentators and advocates for greater investment and support for people with a mental illness. This included University of Melbourne Professor of Youth Mental Health Patrick McGorry and British psychiatrist Sir Graham Thornicroft from the Centre for Global Mental Health. Ms Baker has previously told the ABC that the Survivors of Suicide group and Winter Solstice came out of a need to support locals who had lost a loved one to suicide and to remove the stigma associated with it. ""The year after Mary died, I couldn't do anything,"" she said. ""There was nowhere for us to go to to acknowledge people who are left behind by suicide. ""I searched to see whether there was somewhere we could go for support, but there didn't appear to be anything."" Peter Tapp is the managing editor for the not-for-profit charity Australian Teachers of Media (ATOM). He was keen to have the documentary on its education website because it dealt ""with the difficult issues of suicide and mental health"". Mr Tapp said the study guide could be downloaded from ATOM's The Education Shop with access to the film via streaming available from mid-June. He said the Solstice study guide included before questions, viewing questions and reflection, as well as post-viewing activities, cast details and links for educators. ""Teachers can see how content is related to the curriculum they are mandated to teach,"" Mr Tapp said. He said the study guide would prompt students to think through the issues raised in the documentary. Ms Newman said two versions of the documentary had been produced — a half-hour version for educators that will be premiered on ABC TV, and a feature-length documentary for festivals and cinemas. Solstice has its television premiere on ABC TV Plus and ABC iview on June 19 at 7:30pm, and will be screened on the ABC's Compass on June 26 at 6:30pm. Its cinematic premiere took place in Albury on Sunday.

76,"live: NSW Now: Public sector strike to go ahead, with union officials insisting on 5.2 per cent wage increase",arts-culture,"  Sydney news: Public sector employees to join Hyde Park rally and NSW parliament march today Here's what you need to know this morning. A statewide strike of public sector workers and a march will go ahead today, despite a commitment by the NSW government to lift wages. On Monday, Premier Dominic Perrottet said that workers could expect a pay rise of 3 per cent this year, with another 0.5 per cent increase likely next year. But the Public Service Association (PSA) NSW, which is leading the march, is calling for the government to increase wages by a minimum of 5.2 per cent. The public service includes a broad range of employees across many industries including health, education, transport and customer service. PSA general secretary Stewart Little said that, unless the government was prepared to revise its offer, he expected 30,000 public servants to take to the streets today. ""This offer is pure politics: Moving half a per cent and playing silly games with one-off bonuses for certain workers,"" Mr Little said. ""It's a shameless attempt at dividing workers against each other."" A Sydney police officer will face court today after being charged with sexual assault, malicious damage, and unauthorised access to police computer systems. The 31-year-old constable was arrested yesterday following an investigation into allegations of rape, stalking, and assault by two women. The officer has been stood down from duties while his employment status is under review. He is due to appear in Downing Centre Local Court later today. Former premier Gladys Berejiklian pleaded with an MP to back a controversial koala bill so as not to ""undermine the government"", leaked texts have revealed. Liberal upper house MP Catherine Cusack posted the text messages to her twitter account last night she said to “prove” she had no knowledge of a deal brokered between then Environment Minister Matt Kean and former Nationals leader John Barilaro over koala planning policy. The texts reveal Ms Berejiklian repeatedly tried to dissuade Ms Cusack from crossing the floor of parliament to vote against the Koala State Environmental Planning Policy. ""I need your help re Koala SEPP. Pls stop sending things to the Opposition,"" Ms Berejiklian texted. ""Please do this as a personal favour to me. ""I ask you to reconsider for the sake of Government unity. ""Please know you will be jeopardising the Koala sepp Catherine."" The texts were sent on November 19, 2020, when a vote was put forward in parliament to refer the koala bill to a committee that triggers a parliamentary inquiry. Ms Cusack crossed the floor and voted with Labor, the Greens, the Animal Justice Party and Independent MP Justin Field in favour of the inquiry. Ms Cusack's vote was the decider, and the Berejiklian government made the snap decision to dump the bill altogether, rather than have it examined by an inquiry. Premier Berejiklian subsequently sacked Ms Cusack as parliamentary secretary. Koala protection rules were a major flashpoint for the Liberal-National government. In September 2020, Mr Barilaro threatened to move his entire party to the crossbench over the issue. Ms Cusack has previously announced her intention to quit the Liberal Party and resign from her upper house seat. Police found the bodies of two women inside a unit in Sydney's south-west yesterday. About 9:30am, emergency services were called to a home on Canterbury Road, near Dibbs Street, Canterbury, following a concern for welfare report. Upon arrival, police entered the unit and found the bodies of two women inside. They are yet to be formally identified but are believed to be aged in their 20s. A crime scene has been established and will be examined by specialist forensic police. A block of units in Western Sydney was evacuated this morning after a fire broke out at an underground car park. Smoke was billowing from the car park, while residents from the block of units at Railway Tce, Merrylands, waited on the street. Fire and Rescue said at least one car was on fire. The Sydney Film Festival kicks off tonight with an opening night gala showing of First Nations film We Are Still Here, at the State Theatre.

77,First Nations film in six different languages kicks off Sydney Film Festival,arts-culture,"  Sydney Film Festival opens with First Nations film We Are Still Here For the creators of the First Nations film We Are Still Here, the arrival of James Cook at Sydney’s Botany Bay 252 years ago is not the whole story. The film, an anthology of storylines woven together from 1,000 years ago in pre-colonised Australia to a dystopian future, teamed 10 directors and 11 screenwriters in six languages, a first for Australian cinema. The film will premiere tonight, as the gala opening feature at the Sydney Film Festival, at the State Theatre to a crowd of 2,000 people. Producer Mitchell Stanley, a Wiradjuri man from Sydney, said the film was unlike anything he had worked on. ""There was nothing in any of our film knowledge from an Indigenous perspective to respond to that arrival,"" Stanley said. ""We have all these perspectives and heroes that are more than just colonisation,"" he said. ""There were points where we were thinking, 'Woah are you going to do that? Are you going to write that? That's crazy, that's never been done in Australia,' and the film has benefited 10-fold from taking those risks."" Those risks include an animated storyline within the film and what Stanley calls a blend of laugh-out-loud comedy and tear-jerking drama. The film brings together a range of genres — animation, sci-fi, romantic comedy and period drama. The Australian-New Zealand co-production includes the work of directors Beck Cole and Danielle MacLean from Australia and Mario Gaoa from New Zealand filmed during Australia's COVID border closures. During filming, actor Clarence Ryan was temporarily denied access to the Northern Territory as he travelled from Perth to Alice Springs. ""We're on set and the announcement had just come out that the NT government was shutting down the borders to WA,"" Stanley said. ""While we had one shoot going on, we just thought our next shoot was about to fall under because we're about to lose our talent."" The drama of border closures gave the producer, who has been in the industry for 14 years, an added stress along with the ""weight"" of responsibility to culture. ""You were always reminded throughout production and the edit of the importance and the gravity of what it was that we were doing and the weight that we were carrying to make sure that this had to be not good, but great,"" Stanley said. ""The chapters, they're all like my children. It's the one film and it is the one baby growing up to being that old now."" Opening night will be the first time Stanley is able to see the entire team who worked on the film, and will share the experience with a crowd at the Sydney Film Festival. ""The film is for mob, it's for me and those people like me who see themselves in the stories,"" he said. ""It's the first time we'll see each other and say, 'Let's all sit down and watch it with 2,000 other people.'""

78,Celebrated Indigenous playwright takes on the life and times of tennis legend Evonne Goolagong,arts-culture,"  Aboriginal theatre maker Andrea James continues to tell vital First Nations stories in her tribute to tennis legend Evonne Goolagong Yorta Yorta/Gunaikurnai theatre maker Andrea James has been thinking a lot about her parents lately. They died at just 54 years old when the actor and playwright was in her 30s; she is now 52. Being reminded of her family — and of mortality — seems inevitable, given the subject matter of her latest project, directing Melissa Bubnic's Ghosting the Party, which opened in Sydney last month. ""If you have those people who left too early, you're always going to think, 'What can I do to pass on their legacy and their stories? How can I learn from their experiences to just live a good, full life that is going to benefit the communities that we work in?'"" James tells ABC Arts. ""My parents really didn't have much time on the earth and it definitely makes you aware that you could be taken away from it all at any time."" Last month, the celebrated playwright, director and dramaturge took home the coveted $30,000 Mona Brand Award for Women Stage and Screen Writers for her body of work, including more than 10 plays which centre contemporary First Nations stories and peoples, such as Winyanboga Yurringa and Yanagai! Yanagai! The judges commended her work for being ""unruly, delightful and heartbreaking"" even as it spoke to ""things many of us are too afraid to face"". James is an artist with a reputation for being willing and able to engage with complex, emotionally fraught issues, both personal and communal, and then share them with audiences – the kinds of topics explored in Ghosting the Party. A graduate of the Victorian College of the Arts, James previously worked as Aboriginal arts development officer at Blacktown Arts Centre, and was artistic director of Melbourne Workers Theatre from 2001 to 2008. Currently an associate artist at the Griffin Theatre Company, she says she ended up directing Ghosting the Party almost by chance and only discovered how much the work resonated later in the process. ""As I read into it [the play] deeper, I thought, 'Oh gosh, yes, this is really reminding me of my mother actually, [and] of all of the mothers, all of the grandmothers [in society].'"" The play introduces us to 87-year-old Grace (Belinda Giblin), who is ready to die – except her daughter Dorothy (Jillian O'Dowd) and granddaughter Suzie (Amy Hack) would rather she didn't. ""Grace is fierce, she has got a wicked sense of humour … and is really resolute and determined,"" James told ABC RN's The Stage Show. Grace's decision forces 57-year-old Dorothy and 34-year-old Suzie to confront their feelings of regret and to grapple with questions of mortality, forgiveness, and what makes a life worth living. James loves how the play depicts women of a certain age: ""This doesn't get placed on stage very often, but what happens to middle-aged women is they get put on the scrap heap. We're undervalued. ""Yet all these very tricky, very diplomatic things happen in the home, in the domestic space. What Melissa has achieved so beautifully is to bring domesticity up to the place it should be – where really, really important things happen."" The other play on James's plate is Sunshine Super Girl, which she wrote and directed. It kicks off an Australian tour this year, starting at Darwin Festival in August. While its debut at Melbourne Theatre Company was postponed due to COVID-19, Sunshine Super Girl premiered at Yarruwala Wiradjuri! festival in Griffith – Goolagong's hometown – in 2020. Produced by Performing Lines, it dramatises the story of Wiradjuri sporting legend Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who, having grown up in a country town playing tennis with a wooden-crate-slat and ball, became Australia's first Aboriginal world tennis champion, despite the entrenched racist and sexist politics of the 1970s and 1980s. Goolagong — the winner of seven grand slam singles titles — was a big inspiration for James; she was one of only two Aboriginal people that she saw on telly while she was growing up (the other was Glenn James, the AFL umpire and her dad's cousin). ""For young Aboriginal girls, there were no role models. They weren't in the magazines. They were not on television,"" says James. ""Her [Goolagong's] success, her coming onto our television screens and in the front pages of our newspaper, when she won that first Wimbledon in 1971, was just such a great thing for Aboriginal people, but for young Aboriginal girls in particular."" Her success came at a time of progress for Aboriginal peoples across Australia. ""We had just passed the referendums. Aboriginal people had just won the right to vote … the Aboriginal Tent Embassy happened in Canberra as well, and that was a really hot time,"" James says. ""And here comes Evonne Goolagong, who goes to the motherland, and takes on the crown and wins it – thank you very much – and takes it back home with such humility and grace, makes it look easy, and makes us just so, so proud."" The love story between Goolagong and British tennis player Roger Cawley anchors Sunshine Super Girl, with the play depicting how their vital connection overcame the pressures of her fame. Both Goolagong and Cawley read multiple drafts of the play and gave the playwright their feedback – which sometimes sent James back to the drawing board. They also flew down to Sydney to see how the play was going to be designed, with the action playing out on a tennis court where actors danced their way through tense games. ""Evonne was really, really moved. I cannot begin to imagine what it's like to see your whole life rolled out, to see your loved ones, some of whom you've lost, being personified on stage as well,"" says James. ""I'm so grateful that they were willing to give feedback about the process but removed themselves from it at the same time."" James's degree at VCA mixed acting, directing and writing, instilling in the director and playwright an interest in cross-disciplinary work. ""I try to resist that sort of pigeonholing of 'Your job stops here and starts there,' because actually, it doesn't, you know. I think of [theatre making] as quite a ceremonial process, actually … It's a really holistic process,"" she says. ""My work goes back generations and generations. It's in my DNA; I don't just switch it on and off. I think that the way that my roles shapeshift into that is about a complete cultural process that's really important to me, and that hopefully is reflected in the performance outcome."" James is also influenced by key figures from her family tree, including her great-great-grandfather Thomas Shadrach. In his humble classroom on the Maloga Aboriginal Mission on Yorta Yorta Country, he taught children who went on to become some of the leading Indigenous activists of the 20th century, including Doug Nicholls, a former governor of South Australia; Margaret Tucker and William Cooper (who is also related to James), co-founders of the Australian Aborigines' League; and Geraldine Briggs, the first president of the National Aboriginal and Islander Women's Council. James remembers being particularly moved when she read speeches by Shadrach and Cooper – with Cooper instrumental in the recognition of January 26 as a Day of Mourning for Aboriginal peoples, and to calls for Aboriginal representation in federal parliament. ""I understand now where the fuel for my work comes from,"" she says. James didn't always intend to build a career in the arts. She first trained to be a legal secretary, but discovered on the job that that career wasn't for her. It was then that she found herself thinking about her childhood and the moment where her ""whole world cracked open"" watching Alec Morgan's Lousy Little Sixpence, a documentary about the Stolen Generations told from Aboriginal peoples' perspectives. James is astounded that she watched the film while studying drama, rather than history. ""So, a little light bulb came on then. I thought, 'Not only can we learn about truth, but we can step into that truth and actually relive it and it's palpable' … From that point on, I just kept being drawn back to those theatre spaces where I could discern from quite a young age that that's where the truth could be told."" She set out to share the truth of Yorta Yorta people's experiences in her first full-length play, Yanagai! Yanagai! In Yorta Yorta language, ""yanagai"" means simply ""go away"". ""Those were the first words that were recorded by Edward Curr, who was the first non-Aboriginal man to come into our Country uninvited,"" says James. James was inspired to write Yanagai! Yanagai! by the native title claim brought forward by the Yorta Yorta Nation in 1994, which was ultimately dismissed by the Federal Court in 1998. ""My dear uncle Wayne Atkinson went on this massive process to interview people, so that we could demonstrate to Judge Olney what our traditional connection to Country was. In that process, there were literally folders and folders of evidence and information that was gathered,"" says James. ""It was such an epic, dramatic story, that the play just rolled out of me, and that's where it began."" Yanagai! Yanagai! had its world premiere season in September 2003 at Malthouse Theatre. ""We just went, 'This is Yorta Yorta people right here, right now … Come see us make our connection to Country in the way we've always done in theatre.'"" James was thinking about family again – including the activists who fought so hard and so long for the community to have representation – as she cast her vote in the federal election in May. The results set records in both houses of parliament, with 10 First Nations politicians elected to represent communities across Australia. ""We're all waiting with bated breath to see what will actually result; how First Nations people can work within a loaded system,"" says James. Hear the latest stories from stages across the country. She sees First Nations artists, and the stories they can share, as critical to the push for Indigenous recognition and representation. She discovered her own family history in ""dribs and drabs"" and found Elders passed on information when they decided the time was right. ""There's been a concentrated effort to actually disappear us, to put our Black history in the corner,"" she says. ""But our Elders have had an agenda … to make sure these stories are upheld and passed on so that they infuse us, so that we continue on this epic struggle that we're still all in and that's part of our self-determination and our survival as a people. This is something we have to keep doing. ""We were storytellers, and we always will be … Stories are the fuel that keep our communities alive and functioning; we've learned so much from them. Now, we just have to make sure that all of the stories are told – not just some of them."" Ghosting the Party runs until June 18 at Griffin Theatre Company. Sunshine Super Girl runs from August 12-13 at Darwin Entertainment Centre; from Sept 2-17 at Adelaide Festival Centre; from October 26-29 at Merrigong Theatre Company, Wollongong; and from November 9-December 14 at Melbourne Theatre Company.

79,House designer's eight-year dream dashed by heritage concerns,arts-culture,"  Castlemaine residents win fight to stop new townhouses being built next to heritage building Nicola Loder has been working on a design to build two eco-friendly townhouses in Castlemaine, next to a heritage building, for eight years. ""I wanted the new houses to recede into the bush setting. They were to be cloudy and hardwood timber,"" Ms Loder said. ""I like minimal, contemporary design, especially next to a house that you want all the eyes to go up to the old house, which is extremely articulated. ""Anytime I did anything more articulated in the design, it created a visual conflict. It stole the view."" ""It was a respectful development."" In 2020, the Mount Alexander Shire Council approved the designs to build the townhouses on Farnsworth Street. But a group of residents took that decision to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) which decided to reject the application in January last year. Alice Matthiesson is one of the Castlemaine residents who objected to the townhouses. She said the design did not fit the heritage look of the area. ""We thought that the townhouses were totally contradictory to the heritage nature of the area,"" she said. ""It's a heritage precinct. There's also The Old Powder Magazine's keeper house, which has got military significance and national significance. ""There are quite a few very important buildings in the nearby precinct."" In the VCAT decision, planner Holly Sawyer said the trees on the land were protected by a heritage overlay, and while the building layout was generally consistent with previously approved plans, the size of the buildings did not comply with the heritage overlay. ""The increased size of the proposed building envelopes will result in the buildings dominating the landscape rather than sitting within the bush setting,"" Ms Sawyer said in the report. Ms Matthiesson said the design of the houses, with flat roofs, is incongruent with the heritage house next door. The resident said she was not against building contemporary housing on the site, just not the ones proposed. ""There's no doubt there'll be two houses built on that site, one on each block. We're just looking for a more sympathetic building style,"" she said. Designer Nicola Loder said the flat roof was supposed to complement the bush setting and provide a contemporary contrast. ""The flat roof was really so it wasn't eye catching and more recessive,"" she said. ""I think it's OK for houses to speak of their time, across time. So it was a dialogue between a contemporary flat roof design and the historic design [next door]."" She said she did not want to ruin the heritage aspect of the area but complement it. ""I don't think fitting in means mimicking what's there,"" Ms Loder said. The design was sustainable and did not raise any concerns with Heritage Victoria, she said. ""It's a personal decision in the end as to what you like or what you don't like,"" she said. ""Heritage Victoria had no issue with the design, neither did two of the heritage advisers from council."" But Ms Matthiesson said the Mount Alexander Shire Council had dropped the ball when it came to heritage preservation. ""People just need to think a little harder about how they're going to do it,"" Ms Matthiesson said. ""Will it fit in? A little more consultation about roof forms and the overall impact on the area."" ABC Central Victoria will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday.

81,Bangarra’s incoming artistic director on taking the reins and staging a nine-part hymn to Country,arts-culture,"  Bangarra Dance Theatre’s incoming artistic director Frances Rings takes over later this year, but first she revives the award-winning Terrain Frances Rings doesn't remember a time when dance wasn't a part of her life. ""Dancing, the arts, and creativity was a space that I was really drawn to. It's always been a companion,"" she says. Growing up in regional South Australia, Rings would often dress up her siblings in pieces of material and in curtains, directing them in her own backyard productions. These stories and worlds helped Rings understand who she was, and how she related to her environment. ""I think they just thought I was a dreamer. And that I was always off with the fairies, doing something or creating something,"" she says. ""But it wasn't something I was bullied for. It was just: that's her, that's the way that she kind of connects with the world."" The Kokatha woman will be the next artistic director of Bangarra Dance Theatre, the country's premier contemporary Indigenous dance company, when she takes over from Stephen Page at the end of 2022. In the meantime, as associate artistic director for the company, she is bringing one of her most acclaimed works back to the stage this month: 2012's Terrain, a timely work about the impact of colonisation on the natural environment, and the important role that Indigenous peoples and knowledges play in caring for Country. Despite her early interest in dance, Rings came relatively late to formal training. Most professional dancers start taking lessons at around 8 years old (sometimes even younger); Rings was twice that age when she attended her first dance class as part of her HSC. Through these lessons Rings learnt about the Indigenous dance school NAISDA Dance College. So at the age of 17 she jumped on a bus and travelled to the school's then-campus in Sydney. ""When I walked into NAISDA there was this energy and this vibrancy that was bouncing off the walls. It was just this sense of pride, this sense of being confident, this sense of cultural knowing,"" she says. ""I'd never seen that quality before, or that sense of Black pride, and I just knew that I wanted to be a part of that."" Rings joined Bangarra Dance Theatre in 1993 after she graduated from NAISDA. Although she is often described now as a ""muse"" for Stephen Page, for much of Rings's first year at Bangarra Page only allowed her to perform in the cultural dances, and she was an understudy for the company's repertoire. ""And then the one opportunity that I did get to go on the stage [to perform repertoire], I freaked out and forgot all the choreography,"" she told the Talking Pointes podcast in 2021. But by the end of her 12 years dancing for Bangarra, Rings had performed everywhere from the Opening Ceremony of the Sydney Olympics to a riverbed, where car headlights functioned as a lighting rig. ""All of that spectrum of experiences are rich and powerful; I don't know any other company that could do that,"" she says. During that time Rings was also honing her choreographic skills, and in 2002 she made her mainstage choreographic debut with Rations, as part of Bangarra's Helpmann Award-winning double bill Walkabout (alongside Stephen Page's Rush). Aesthetically Rings is interested in choreography with ""clean shapes and distinctive physical architecture of body"" that still allows the spirits of culture, Country and people to converge. She's also drawn to making work that allows her to explore her connection to the world. ""I think artists tell stories that are an extension of themselves and each one of the stories that I share comes from places of deep emotional responses,"" she says. Rings's third work for the company, Unaipon, celebrated the life of Ngarrindjeri inventor and author David Unaipon. She first learned about the under-appreciated Unaipon from her sister. ""She was telling me because she was close with the community he's from … And I had no idea. And then I did this research on him — and I felt angry at first, because how can people like this exist and we're not learning about them in schools? ""Part of my passion is to see that [Indigenous] stories are given a platform. That we use our opportunity here at Bangarra as storytellers to be able to take those stories and put them out there in the mainstream, in the public consciousness, and be able to transform how people look at us and view us and understand us,"" she says. In 2012, Rings choreographed her first full-length work for Bangarra: Terrain. Terrain was a hymn to Country, exploring the relationship between Indigenous peoples and Country, and the fight to reclaim our land. Ten years on, the award-winning production returns, opening at the Sydney Opera House in June followed by seasons in Canberra and Brisbane. ""Terrain's really a timeless work because Country's always going to be a priority for Indigenous people. It's always going to be the cornerstone of our existence,"" Rings says. The show presents nine interconnected vignettes, each representing a different 'state of experiencing' Kati Thanda (also known as Lake Eyre): Red Brick, Shields, Reborn, Spinifex, Salt, Scar, Landform, Reflect, and Deluge. Scar and Landform — the sixth and seventh vignettes — are particularly relevant today. ""Scar is about man's impact on Country, and Landform is about the ability of Country to regenerate and heal,"" Rings explains. ""I think we understand that going through something like the bushfires and floods and the cycle of deluge, of destruction, of creation — this country's ability to rebirth and regenerate is quite powerful."" Rings hopes non-Indigenous audiences will take away this message about Indigenous knowledges and restoring Country. ""It requires them [non-Indigenous audiences] to maybe take a step back and maybe reset what they think they know about Country and go to those people who have lived with and cared for it for a long time and have learned through generations. I think that's really important. Those knowledge systems, they still exist around us today. You just have to be open to see it through the lens of Indigenous people to understand. ""Kati Thanda really inspired me because it is such a powerful, abstract, inspiring Country, but also [how] it's neighbouring to my mob [Kokatha] as well."" Before she started working with the dancers, Rings made two trips to Kati Thanda with set designer Jacob Nash and composer David Page (Bangarra Dance Theatre's longstanding music director, who died in 2016). They met with Uncle Reginald Dodd, an Arabunna Elder, who spoke to them about Arabunna ways of managing land and water in a sustainable relationship with Kati Thanda — ""from drought to deluge"". ""It was really inspiring to fly over the lake and see colours that you would not believe existed, from pinks and greens and blues and turquoise, and just these hues of Country. And that fills your spirit when you see that beauty and you see the scale of the lake,"" she says. ""There's a lot of not only incredible cultural information, but fascinating geographical and wildlife information as well, that is rich and inspiring and enduring."" Community visits like this are a foundation of Bangarra's practice. ""It's important to be able to be taken out onto Country, be told the creation stories while you are on Country, to understand how important those living systems are,"" Rings says. ""I think that going out there and seeing [Kati Thanda] full of water and [also] seeing it as a vast salt lake was equally powerful. And once I saw that, and I felt that from Country, I respected both life cycles of Kati Thanda. And you could see the beauty of it and the power,"" she says. But for Rings, the work was unlocked after Uncle Reg encouraged her to think about how Country affects her as an Indigenous person living in the city. ""I went away and I thought about it, because I was looking at it from his perspective, his family, his mob. And I had to turn it around and look at it from us as Bangarra mob that live an urban existence here,"" she says. ""We tell stories from all around the country, those stories are entrusted to us, but what does Country mean to us if we live here in urban areas? And not only for Bangarra, for other Blackfellas who have to live in the city because this is where our work is, and the work that we do is important for mob who live back on Country and live in regional and remote areas."" This moment of reckoning informed the first vignette of the show, Red Brick. In this section a sole female dancer is languidly passed between four male dancers, as they move across the stage. There's a harmony and subtle power to the way the group blends together. ""It's about hearing that call to Country, an ancestral call that you need to respond to. And I think you can make all the excuses and distractions and put it off, but it's always going to sit there humbugging you, but it's also to keep your spirit healthy and that keeps your identity strong,"" Rings says. Another crucial element of Terrain is David Page's score. Rings says the score alone can transport you to Kati Thanda. ""I can remember David telling me, 'Bubba, don't worry, I know it's late, but it's going to be really special because it's late. It means that I'm working on it. So trust me.'… And he's so right, because what he created fitted that work like a glove."" His aim was to use sound to create the sense of open space. ""And he did, you can feel it in the work. It's like you leave the theatre and you go somewhere else. And that's a genius. I just feel like if that was the only work that I ever did, I would be satisfied. I am satisfied. It's such a blessing."" Bangarra will also present Rings and Page's joint choreographic work SandSong later this year, after its premiere season in 2021 was cut short due to COVID-19 lockdowns. Staging two of Rings's shows in the same year has the added benefit of soft-launching her as artistic director. In 2023, the company's long-serving artistic director Stephen Page will ""pass the coolamon"" to Rings after 32 years at the helm, making Rings only the third artistic director in the company's history and the first Indigenous woman to take on the role. ""I've been waiting for this for a long time and I feel really ready. I would've loved to have done another full-length work previous to Terrain, but things happen for a reason. And I'm a firm believer in when the timing's right it'll happen,"" she says. Rings is also quick to acknowledge the generous support of Page, describing him as ""a cultural icon"". ""I wouldn't be in this position without Stephen,"" she says. ""Whitefullas call it mentoring. We just call it looking after mob, looking after each other, especially when we're in white systems."" For Rings, this version of support doesn't just deal in the immediate term; it looks to the future, developing sustainable infrastructure that can be built upon, and that exists beyond the needs of any individual. It's an idea that she holds dear. ""We know that our stories have to be told into the future,"" she says. ""We know that change is important. We know that evolving as an organisation, as a cultural foundation, is important. Every community does it when an Elder knows the right time to pass on knowledge to the next generation; it's a cycle. It's a reciprocal respect that is a part of our life."" This doesn't mean Rings is planning to entirely emulate Page's creative process though. She says frankly: ""I'm not going to do things the way Stephen does them. ""I'll obviously honour this incredible foundation and this incredible legacy that [Stephen has] built. Stephen will always be an incredible part of Bangarra and its identity. You can't unwrap that, and nor should you, I would never want to do that. … And I think the legacy that he leaves behind is going to resonate for generations. ""[But] I have my own vision for what I want to bring to the company. And I'm really excited to be able to see what unfolds,"" she says. Terrain runs from June 9-25 at Sydney Opera House; from July 28-30 at Canberra Theatre Centre; and from August 4-13 at QPAC, Brisbane. Tops Arts & Culture headlines.

82,Job fit for a prince: William lookalike and former Adelaide-based engineer gets royal treatment during Jubilee,arts-culture,"  Platinum Jubilee drives demand for Australian Prince William lookalike amid royal fervour There are few avenues available for those wanting to become a royal. One way is to be born into the royal family, and another is to marry into it. But Australian engineer Simon Watkinson has constructed his own path, of sorts — by styling himself as one of the royal family's most prominent members. For the Prince William lookalike, who moved from Adelaide to London about 15 years ago, the recent Platinum Jubilee celebrations have ensured a packed schedule, including garden parties and media appearances. ""I've been busier than the actual royals — I've been appearing in all the places they can't get to, as a lookalike,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide's Stacey Lee and Nikolai Beilharz. ""I was in Canterbury city being driven around appearing in shops and pubs, appearing at local street parties, doing photo shoots, newspaper interviews."" Mr Watkinson has been impersonating the future king for more than a decade, signing up with a lookalike agency just before his doppelganger's nuptials in 2011. ""I was told from a very young age from relatives in England that I looked like Prince William but never really thought about it,"" he said. ""Then I moved to London in 2006 and I was told endlessly on the streets that I looked like Prince William. ""I'd be stopped in bars and have drinks bought for me, to the point where I was thinking I've got to somehow make some money out of this. ""Just before the royal wedding … I looked into it and I joined a lookalike agency and then the next day I was basically doing a photo shoot and it just all went from there."" By his own admission, Mr Watkinson has become somewhat accustomed to the royal treatment, ""doing parties and flying around the world"". ""I've been flown in a helicopter to open housing developments where I land and then cut a ribbon and all sorts of things like that,"" he said. Mr Watkinson hails from suburban Adelaide — not, alas, from Royal Park, nor from Elizabeth (named after the current monarch), but from Brooklyn Park in the city's inner west. While demand for royal impersonators took a negative plunge during the COVID-19 pandemic, business has again peaked, thanks to Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee celebrations, which have just ended with a pageant in London. When he's not being stopped in the street or appearing at ceremonies wearing full regalia, Mr Watkinson works as a civil engineer. He concedes he doesn't spend exorbitant amounts of time sharpening up his act, but instead prefers to let his appearance do the talking. ""Because of the Australian accent … I try not to say much, which I think is sort of in keeping with the royals — they don't tend to say much,"" he joked. ""They're in the news so much that it's so easy to read about them all the time. ""Keeping up with episodes of The Crown also helps my knowledge with everything."" While The Crown sometimes depicts the life of the modern royal as a lonely and isolated existence, Mr Watkinson is kept company by a supporting cast. ""There's a whole royal family of lookalikes,"" he said. ""I have a few different Kates but I tend to just work with one main Kate and, yes, we do have lookalikes of the children and even have lookalikes of the dogs."" But will he ever meet the real Will? That's a fortuity he suspects may even elude someone with the royal touch. ""I know some people who know him, journalists and some of the people who work for him, and he is aware of me but I don't think they'd ever let us meet,"" he said. ""I was at an event where he came and all his security came in advance and they spotted me in the crowd and they were keeping a watchful eye on me, but they had a bit of a laugh.""

83,A museum honouring Chinese prospectors has reopened after COVID restrictions. But will the Chinese tourists return? ,arts-culture,"  Ararat's Gum San Chinese Heritage Centre honouring Australia's only Chinese-founded town reopens Volunteers in the western Victorian town of Ararat are hopeful that visitors, including Chinese tourists, will return now that one of the town's most unique attractions has reopened. Due to COVID, The Gum San Chinese Heritage Centre has been shut for the past two years. In that time, it has had a makeover, and the local council has reached a new memorandum of understanding that will mean the centre is run by volunteers rather than paid council workers. The museum recognises the group of Chinese prospectors who, while on their way to Victoria's goldfields from Robe, South Australia, happened upon gold in a creek bed where modern Ararat now stands. Friends of Gum San president Henry Gunstone said they virtually revamped the whole place. ""We've got new signs, new computers, and fixed the gold tank that was leaking,"" Mr Gunstone said. ""When you consider the Grampians gets one million visitors a year, COVID has robbed a major attraction from the area. ""We have to try and attract a portion of those to come here."" The centre received about 3,000 tourists a year before the pandemic, among them school groups from mainland China coming to learn about the only town in Australia founded by Chinese settlers. ""I met with [the See Yup Society in Melbourne] last week, and they are going to support us wholeheartedly,"" Mr Gunstone said. He said schools, including those in Ararat, visited just once, so the Friends of Gum San needed to meet the school principals and get them to visit. Mr Gunstone said it would be a challenge to get Chinese tourists back to Ararat. ""I have a lot of friends in our sister city of Taishan who can't get visas to come here, and we can't get visas to go there. China doesn't want us. ""Whether that will change under the new Prime Minister … it's been tit for tat right through, so it's going to be a difficult period for us."" Gum San's reopening comes following weeks of geopolitical jostling by the Chinese and Australian governments for influence in the South Pacific and years of generally deteriorating relations between the two nations. But Pichamon Yeophantong, senior lecturer in international relations at UNSW Canberra, said lockdowns in China were a more significant obstacle to tourism returning than global politics. ""It's highly unlikely China's borders are going to be open any time soon,"" Dr Yeophantong said. ""We might expect reopening in 2023, as the COVID situation in major cities like Shanghai is still very much ongoing. ""On top of that, we have also seen trends within China that have really emphasised domestic tourism."" Dr Yeophantong said beyond the tourism value to their communities, cultural tourism sites like Gum San could play a part in maintaining relations between China and Australia. ""The appeal of such sites should not just be about Chinese tourists,"" she said. ""It should also have appeal for people of other ethnicities and Australians more generally. The [Chinese] community that continues to exist there is part of the fabric of Australian multiculturalism. Fourteen thousand Chinese men trekked from the South Australian coast to Victoria's goldfields in 1857. With them was a young woman. ""What we need more, not just in Australian-Chinese relations but in Australian foreign policy, is an appreciation of that multiculturalism and a real focus on enhancing inclusion."" Mr Gunstone said outside of Ararat itself, not many people knew about the story of how the town was founded, and how that story was inexorably linked with the victimisation of Chinese arrivals to Australia in the 1850s. ""Laws passed by, especially the Victorian government, against the Chinese were horrendous,"" he said. ""Just two or three years ago, the Premier apologised to the Chinese people for the way they were treated back then. ""When you read the acts they passed, it's madness.""

84,Tasmanian Greens leader who watched 'too much' of Johnny Depp trial apologises,arts-culture,"  Cassy O'Connor, Tasmanian Greens leader, apologises for Johnny Depp defamation trial comments Tasmanian Greens leader Cassy O'Connor has apologised for ""the hurt and confusion"" caused by comments she made in support of actor Johnny Depp. Ms O'Connor said she had ""watched too much"" of the defamation trial involving Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard. ""I want to acknowledge, and genuinely apologise for, the hurt and confusion I have caused by allowing myself to be drawn into debate on the evidence of the Depp Heard trial,"" she posted on social media. ""The trial itself has been triggering for victim-survivors everywhere, including me."" Unlike a previous libel trial against The Sun that Mr Depp lost in the UK, the actor won his US defamation case against Ms Heard. During the six-week trial in Fairfax, Virginia, Mr Depp and Ms Heard accused each other of violence. The seven-member jury found a statement that Ms Heard made about domestic abuse in a 2018 opinion piece clearly referred to Mr Depp. He was awarded $US10.35 million. The jury also found in favour of Ms Heard, who said she was defamed by Mr Depp's lawyer when he called her abuse allegations a hoax. Jury members found Ms Heard should receive $US2 million. Fans of Mr Depp were at the Fairfax County courthouse daily during the trial, and the proceedings were televised. Experts have warned the public nature of the case and the intensity of the public discourse surrounding it could have a chilling effect on survivors of domestic abuse. Ms O'Connor used her Twitter account to show support for Mr Depp and criticised Ms Heard and her evidence at the trial. She also raised the trial in state parliament last week, interjecting during a debate to criticise Labor MP Michelle O'Byrne, whom Ms O'Connor said was ""about as good at that lectern as Amber Heard is in the Johnny Depp trial, a total fake"". Ms O'Connor withdrew the comment after Ms O'Byrne raised a point of order, saying she took personal offence to the comment. In her apology posted on Twitter, Ms O'Connor also said: ""I acknowledge the trial & verdict have been weaponised by those who hate women, abusers, & hard right elements. To have a world that is safer for women and children, & all vulnerable people, we have to maintain the just rage against those forces, as I have throughout my life. Here's how Johnny Depp's lawyers managed to convince the jury and why the courtroom drama might not be over. ""To victim-survivors, and those who represent them, as well as Greens supporters, I am sorry not to have bitten my tongue in this instance. I had watched too much of the trial. I hope my record of advocacy and law reform over the past 14 years will, ultimately, speak for itself."" Shortly before Ms O'Connor apologised, feminist writer Clementine Ford weighed in, saying it was ""concerning to see the leader of the Tasmanian Greens … coming out so hard"" in support of Mr Depp. ""What a terrible slap in the face to Tasmanian victim-survivors,"" Ms Ford tweeted. Elinor Heard from Engender Equality, an organisation that supports people affected by family and domestic violence in Tasmania, said focusing on a celebrity trial was not helpful. ""It's not the conversation to be having when there are so many families suffering in our communities as a result of family violence,"" Ms Heard said. She said it was good to see ""self-reflection"" from Ms O'Connor in the form of her apology. Kathryn Fordyce, the chief executive of northern Tasmanian sexual assault support service Laurel House, said it was ""regrettable"" that Ms O'Connor weighed into commentary about Ms Heard. ""She is a woman with a leadership role and a very public profile and comments that make it more difficult for victim-survivors, or for anyone, to talk openly about their experiences of family and sexual violence is concerning,"" Ms Fordyce said.

86,Heard of The 4275 Collective? These Scenic Rim women hope so,arts-culture,"  Scenic Rim artists to open new hub 4275 Collective to showcase 'underground' talent It's the gateway to what tourism heavyweight Lonely Planet has declared one of the top 10 regions in the world to visit this year, but something is missing in Canungra. As part of Queensland's Scenic Rim the town is wildly popular thanks to its natural beauty and cafe scene, particularly with the weekend-drive market from Brisbane and the Gold Coast. But, the town has lacked an artistic hub. Local artist Courtney Guerin is behind the push to change that. ""For us it's all about … making the arts community more visible in Canungra,"" Ms Guerin said. Ms Guerin specialises in drawings and mixed-media art. She was surprised to learn a local arts group hadn't been formed before. More than 40 artists and makers have now signed up to The 4275 Collective. The group has secured headquarters and are transforming a double garage into The Maker Space. A meeting at the nearby Blue House, with its tranquil cafe garden setting, quirky artworks and collections, was the perfect place to brainstorm the concept. Multi-talented artist, Jane Anderson, whose skills include costume making and woodwork, is the secretary. Mrs Anderson signed up as soon as Courtney put up a social media post to gauge interest in forming an arts hub. ""I was there straight away,"" Mrs Anderson said. ""I've lived in Canungra for over 12 years now and I've always had a pull towards the arts community,"" she said. The hub will open next month with a small retail shop for artists and makers to exhibit original art and sell small batches of locally made goods. Visitors can also see musicians and dancers perform. The women agree The Collective is overdue in exposing local skills still kept ""underground"". ""We're the gateway to the Scenic Rim and it's well-known for its arts,"" Ms Guerin said. ""We see [that] our neighbouring towns Boonah, Beaudesert and Mt Tamborine all have very strong arts communities. ""We decided it's time for us to bring the same to Canungra."" Celebrating local artists is the perfect tonic when dealing with COVID, floods and fires. ""After the past few years of really tough times for the world and our community, it's just been fantastic to get together and support each other,"" Mrs Anderson said. The group will stage monthly workshops or ""artscursions"" where a different artist or maker will share their skills with fellow members and the community. The hub opens on July 1, operating Friday to Sunday from 8am till 3pm.

88,These footy players were suspended in midair to recreate the 2011 AFL mark of the year,arts-culture,"  Football players suspended in midair for NGV art installation recreating 2011 AFL mark of the year A live performance depicting the 2011 AFL mark of the year by suspending players in midair with ropes has been shown at the National Gallery of Victoria. Andrew Krakouer's famous mark came to life on Sunday in the NGV's great hall, where spectators gathered to witness the players being bound and lifted into the air. Krakouer was playing for Collingwood when he leapt onto Adelaide's Luke Thompson to claim the spectacular mark. The performance, Still Lives: Melbourne, was shown as part of the RISING festival, taking place in venues across the city until June 12. Five former Aussie Rules players from various levels of the game — Jasper Pittard, Jason Ball, Annie Mack, Jim Marks and Simona Castricum — were involved in the performance. Krakouer, who also played for Richmond, said he was stunned by the number of people who came to see the work. ""It just shows the impact that Australian Rules football has on people and the community — it connects everyone from all different walks of life and diverse backgrounds,"" said the Minang and Inggarda man. ""It's something I'm extremely proud of and not in my wildest dreams did I ever think it would be a live sculpture like this, so I'm extremely humbled and honoured."" Gideon Obarzanek, co-artistic director of RISING, said the festival is about place. ""Nothing says more about Melbourne than progressive social values, our love of sport, particularly football, and art and culture,"" he said. Obarzanek said the work by artists Luke George and Daniel Kok was a metaphor for bringing bodies and communities together, and embedded within it were themes of racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia. ""It's been really the sporting codes, in many respects, that have been sometimes progressive and sometimes a bit led by social change,"" he said.

90,Stars of Elvis biopic rock the red carpet at film's Gold Coast premiere,arts-culture,"  Stars of Elvis biopic rock the red carpet at film's Gold Coast premiere Queensland's Gold Coast has rolled out the red carpet to Hollywood's A-listers at the Australian premiere of the new Elvis biopic. Oscar-Award-winning Australian director Baz Luhrmann joined the cast of heavyweight stars on the Gold Coast on Saturday night, including Tom Hanks, Austin Butler, and Australian actress Olivia DeJonge. The long-awaited film drew global attention after premiering last month at the Cannes film festival. Butler, who plays Elvis Presley, known as the King of Rock 'n' Roll, said depicting the American icon was ""the privilege of my life"". ""It was so much fun every day,"" he said. ""It was a lot of hard work, but every day you feel there's so much inspiration. ""It feels so good to be back [on the Gold Coast] where we made the film."" The movie made headlines in 2020 when, during filming, Hanks was diagnosed with COVID-19. Despite its rocky beginnings, Luhrmann said the production went to plan. ""After the initial shock of Tom [Hanks getting COVID-19], it was a dream shoot,"" he said. ""We actually came in on schedule and on budget. ""So many people gave so much. I mean, the restaurateurs who stayed open just to feed us. It was magical."" Hanks did not stop to speak with fans or the media while on the red carpet, instead posing for photos with his co-stars and leaving before the film began. Butler said working with Hanks — his ""hero"" — was a ""dream"", and playing Elvis made him nervous ""every single day"". ""I'd wake up every day around three or four in the morning with my heart pounding, just feeling the weight of it,"" he said. ""That's one of the greatest gifts it gave me as well, because Elvis talked a lot about his own stage fright and his own anxieties and stuff, and he achieved some pretty amazing things. ""It's cool to get to face my own fears through him in a way."" The film has as much glitz and glam as the Elvis era. Designer Catherine Martin said she designed more than 9,000 costumes before she stopped counting. ""It was kind of a crazy quantity that I didn't imagine at first,"" she said. ""In terms of extras costumes alone, there were 9,000 complete costumes just for the background cast. ""Austin had over 90 costumes as Elvis, and then it just gets into numbers that I can't even think about."" The epic was filmed and produced entirely on Queensland's Glitter Strip, with Luhrmann relocating his production company headquarters to Miami. It drew thousands to Pacific Fair for the premiere, with some lining up for hours. Australian stars such as Lincoln Lewis, Troy Cassar-Daley, Lisa Curry and her Elvis impersonator husband Mark Tabone walked the red carpet alongside Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate and Governor Jeanette Young. Ms Palaszczuk said she planned to make the Gold Coast the home of the stars. ""It says volumes about Queensland and what Queensland can do we now have Hollywood here on the Gold Coast,"" she said. ""I want to have a permanent film industry here on the Gold Coast for Queensland. And that's Queensland jobs … that's what it's all about."" Elvis fan street art has already started popping up around the city, with artist Matty Tapae painting a 12-metre mural in ""dedication to the Elvis movie … just out of love."" ""I just did this as a big thanks to Baz for bringing the premiere here and bringing the GC arts back alive,"" he said. The movie is set to open in cinemas on June 23.

91,"Reworked, remixed and remembered: How the ABC news theme crept into our hearts",arts-culture," ABC Backstory ABC news theme Majestic Fanfare may not be 'anything special', but is held dearly by many Australians It started as a piece of sound-library music and through reworks, remixes and generations of Australians growing up hearing it, the Majestic Fanfare has wedged itself into the Australian consciousness. Written in 1943 by British composer Charles Williams, the Majestic Fanfare wasn't really intended to be a stand-out piece, despite the fancy-sounding name. The name of the music was about the mood it is meant to conjure, rather than a reflection of the actual instrumentation, as Australian composer and conductor Richard Mills told Libbi Gorr on ABC Radio Melbourne. Have you got a story to share with us about how the ABC changed your life? ""It was a typical piece of British film library music,"" he said. ""They had vast banks of LPs that had what we call library music on them. It was music that could be used for any occasion, and it was classified by mood."" The ABC started using the Majestic Fanfare as the intro to the radio news bulletins in the early 1950s, replacing the shortened version of Advance Australia Fair that had been used prior. The same music was used before the TV news when the ABC expanded to television broadcasting in 1956, until it was replaced in 1985. Mr Mills was asked by the ABC to revive the old-fashioned orchestral fanfare in 1988 for Australia's bicentennial. ""I spent two days on it, because I had to take it down from a cassette and then rewrite it,"" Mr Mills told Gorr. ""I think it's a perfectly well-made little fanfare that works very well. It sounds dignified. [But] I don't think it's anything special."" While the Majestic Fanfare might not be anything special in musical terms, it has become special to many Australians, who shared their stories as the ABC marks 90 years of broadcasting. ""The news theme was stuck in my head for years and now the nostalgia it brings is immense,"" Amanda Brick wrote. ""When I was little, my mum tells me I called it the 'Daddy coming home' music, as my dad usually got home from work around then,"" Lynelle Urquhart wrote. ""We'd moved to Canada and were feeling rather homesick when we finally managed to connect to ABC Radio,"" David wrote. ""Hearing that music [the Majestic Fanfare] was a real thrill and made a big difference to our life away from Australia. ""I think it was the music rather than the news itself that made the difference."" In the early 1990s, ABC's youth radio station, triple j, gave the Majestic Fanfare a very 90s remix. The triple j news theme was written and produced by Paul McKercher and John Jacobs in 1991. ""I was an in-house producer at the time and I was asked to come up with a new news theme,"" Mr McKercher said. ""It needed to be something that was immediately identifiable as being of the ABC, but also needed to be contemporised."" Mr McKercher said John Jacobs found a 1978 record of the Majestic Fanfare in a dumpster out the back of the ABC in Ultimo and they decided to use that as the base for the theme. The complex history of one powerful song. ""I played guitar over the top of it, the beat track came from a Prince record … there were other beats that came off DJ records,"" Mr McKercher said. ""Also the scratch that comes just before the final phrase is off NWA's Straight Outta Compton."" Triple j had been the only radio station, possibly in the world at the time, to play NWA's controversial song F**k Tha Police on air. After some complaints from state politicians, ABC management banned the song from being broadcast. This triggered staff at triple j to go on strike, playing NWA's Express Yourself on a loop for 24 hours. ""I thought it'd be fun to get the scratch out of F**k Tha Police and slip it into the triple j news theme,"" Mr McKercher said. Australian composer and former ABC employee Peter Wall said he didn't believe the Majestic Fanfare was right for the ABC. ""I have a very strong view on Majestic Fanfare and that is that it's written by an Englishman and I think that's wrong,"" he said. ""I think the Australian Broadcasting Corporation news theme should be written by an Australian. ""Having said that, like a lot of people, when I go overseas and if I hear that music, I love hearing it because of what it means."" While the Majestic Fanfare is still used on ABC Radio, the TV news theme has had a number of versions over the years, including a tune composed by Mr Wall and Tony Ansell. ""I was managing the ABC in Newcastle at the time and I got a call, [saying] 'We'd like you to write a new news theme for the ABC,' Mr Wall said. ""I thought it was a crank call."" Mr Wall and Mr Ansell had worked together on a number of TV program themes. They put together the news theme for ABC TV over a weekend in the Hunter Valley. It was used for 19 years before being replaced in the early 2000s. But Mr Wall and Mr Ansell's theme was revived with a remix by WA electronic act Pendulum in 2010, with Rob from the group telling triple j that they still love to play it for Australian audiences. ""It's our favourite one. We never get to hear it unless we're in Australia. Other countries didn't grow up with the ABC,"" he said. ""Half of it is the nostalgia thing. That was the whole thing for us: growing up hearing that when you're 10 years old in the living room. If you haven't had that I'm not sure you'll get it.""

92,Arnhem Land 'detectives': The artists helping discover who painted these priceless works,arts-culture,"  Arnhem Land art 'detectives' helping discover who painted these priceless works More than a century after anthropologist Sir Baldwin Spencer collected bark paintings from Arnhem Land, research is underway to identify the artists who created the work. These are some of Australia's oldest and most prized bark paintings, and they have been held in a vault nearly 4,000 kilometres away in Melbourne. A group of artists and a cultural adviser from Arnhem Land have flown south to see the paintings in person for the first time. Back in 1912, Spencer acquired bark paintings in exchange for tobacco near Gunbalanya, then a mission known as Oenpelli, in western Arnhem Land. Over the next decade, he commissioned 120 more bark paintings for cash via his local contact, buffalo hunter Paddy Cahill. The paintings toured to national and international acclaim including Houston, Texas, in the US. But the artists responsible were never recognised. Now artists in Gunbalanya are working with researchers to name those who painted the irreplaceable 1912 -1922 barks, document their stories, and give descendants a say in what happens next. ""It's real detective work,"" the lead researcher working on the project, Associate Professor Sally K May said. ""These works are considered the birth of the bark painting movement that we see continuing today."" Oral histories, historical records, measurements of handprints and comparisons to rock art painted at the time are all part of the research. The paintings feature X-ray depictions of fish, kangaroos, echidnas and ancestral beings in a range of styles. ""This is an incredible snapshot in time of the master artists of the time,"" Dr May said. She said Spencer wanted ""the best artists of the time painting for this collection"". ""[The barks] are so unique and clearly there's a big story behind them. We are working with community to see what the story might be."" One story emerged in Melbourne last month when cultural adviser Kenneth Mangiru saw a three-metre bark of a kinga (Kunwinku word for crocodile). He instantly recognised the work of his great-grandfather Majumbu. ""My great-grandfather – my mother's father's grandfather – he did a crocodile painting, on rock art, and he did it on bark, a big one,"" he said. ""I came to the museum in Melbourne and I saw a big one, with the bark."" Professor Joakim Goldhahn, another researcher working on the project, said an identical image was painted on rock half a day's walk from Gunbalanya at the same time as the bark. ""We can see his family in the art, the handprints of his youngest sons, about four and eight years old. We are working with a family portrait almost,"" Professor Goldhahn said. As research continues, a first-hand account has surfaced from one of the artists commissioned by Spencer in 1912, Paddy Compass Namadbara. It was discovered in the archives of art collector Lance Bennett, after parts of a book he wrote for an exhibition in Japan were translated back into English. ""He's the only one — by his own voice — who tells us his experience, in his own words and memories, from the Aboriginal perspective,"" Professor Goldhahn said. The artists would like to take the priceless barks home, but there are no plans to do so. ""The works are very friable. When the ochre is painted onto rocks it almost tattoos under the surface: When it's on bark, it sits on the top,"" researcher and PhD student Alex Ressel said. While adhesives are used in today's art, a mix of sap, kangaroo blood and saliva were used in 1912 to bind ochre and clay. Among the Melbourne visitors last month, artist Shaun Namarnyilk spoke of a strong connection to the work. He saw variations in the thickness of cross-hatching of the crocodile bark as evidence Majumbu was mentoring a younger artist — a practice that continued today. ""So it's like really thick lines and I see that in the legs there, it's different. They both work together, father and son,"" Mr Namarnyilk said. Back in Gunbalanya, Namarnyilk painted a dolobbo (bark) inspired by the visit, with the same story of the Kolobarr (a male red Kangaroo) and Mimih spirit. In Melbourne Museum with the artists last month, Dr May described the visit as historic and emotional. ""We are going to dig through the archives, and any artists' names we can find, we can start work on their biographies, moving it away from Spencer/Cahill Collection to actually being a collection that represents Aboriginal people and these amazing artists that produced the works,"" she said. And the research has the support of the institution that holds the priceless collection. ""Each action we take now to decolonise our institution will have incredible and ongoing impacts for future generations,"" head of First Peoples Department, Museums Victoria, Dr Shannon Faulkhead said. As for an exhibition of the work, Museums Victoria said it would be only at the families' request.

93,"For decades, they've been just a footstep away. Now the residents of Ramsay Street are moving out",arts-culture,"  Neighbours is coming to an end after 37 years, but the Australian soap's legacy is far from over For 37 years, Melbourne has had an extra suburb. Welcome to Erinsborough. It's been the site of murder, amnesia, arson, sordid love affairs, unexpected family reunions, drownings and disastrous car crashes. Only none of it has been real. The fictional neighbourhood is home to Ramsay Street, an idyllic cul-de-sac set somewhere in Melbourne's east. It's housed beloved characters and launched the international careers of some of Australia's biggest names. Over the years, it's evolved — reluctantly at first — from a street of all-white residents into a diverse neighbourhood. Most of all, it's kept a lot of people in a notoriously boom-and-bust industry in work for a long time. And now, after nearly 9,000 episodes, 63 weddings, 20 births and 68 deaths, Australian soap opera Neighbours is coming to an end. Neighbours creator Reg Watson learned his trade on British soaps. ""It was a brilliant concept,"" says Anne Charleston, who played Madge Bishop. ""And he had the age range from children through to grandparents. So there was something, somebody there for every member of the audience."" ""He kept it simple,"" says Ian Smith, who played Madge's husband and neighbourhood fuddy-duddy Harold Bishop. The influence of the UK's long tradition of soap operas on the Neighbours canon is clear — a large cast, dramatic storylines and simple suburban sets are the foundation of the show. ""[Reg] understood that audience, he understood that kind of storytelling, and understood how to make that sort of drama, that fast turnaround,"" former scriptwriter and editor Philippa Burne says. Watson's idea for a show was knocked back by Channel 9 in 1982, but picked up by Channel 7 as Neighbours in 1984. It was then axed a year later, and picked up by Channel 10. It was a rocky start for the revamped show. ""Ratings weren't flash,"" TV historian Andrew Mercado says. The publicity team worked flat-out to promote the show, taking the cast to shopping centres and, according to Mercado, ""basically begging people to watch the show"". ""And it worked,"" he says. The addition of then-unknown actors Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan in 1986 helped power the juggernaut. This year, Minogue said she would be ""forever grateful"" for her time on Neighbours. ""We had no idea how big the show would become and how passionately viewers would take it to heart,"" she said. None felt that passion more than British fans. In October 1986, the show was bought by the BBC. It was first screened at 1:30pm, but soon made its way to a higher-rating timeslot with a repeat screening at 5:35pm. ""And boom,"" Mercado says. It was a bleak time in Thatcher-era Britain. The year prior, 1987, started with a cold wave so chilly parts of the sea froze over, then was marked by the deadly sinking of a ferry, the Hungerford massacre, an extratropical cyclone, the Remembrance Day Bombing and the King's Cross Fire. ""And along comes this kind of burst of sunshine,"" Mercado says. ""This happy-go-lucky Australian show with people who live in beautiful houses with huge backyards and all this space to go outside and play cricket in the street all year round."" Since moving to Channel 10, this suburban Australian dream has been filmed on a studio lot in Nunawading in Melbourne's outer east. The outsides of the houses you see on Ramsay Street are real — they're just on Pin Oak Court in Vermont South, a short drive away. Ian Smith reflects that it was everything English people thought Australia was — living next door to your doctor, calling him by his first name. ""And a pool in your backyard?"" he adds. The show's most famous episode – Scott and Charlene's wedding – had 2 million viewers in Australia when it aired in 1987. In the UK, about 20 million people tuned in. A month later, Minogue released her first single. By 1989, Neighbours was pulling 20 million viewers every single day in the UK — a third of the population. Its young cast became superstars. There was even a Neighbours video game. It has since been exported to more than 60 countries around the world and the format has been reproduced in other languages. It was appointment viewing. Current cast member Takaya Honda remembers family evenings built around dinner and Neighbours on the TV. It was, as he says, ""a thing"". ""It's bizarre to think about Neighbours going for as long as it has, because when you break it down, the premise of the show is a dead-end street,"" Mercado says. But the Neighbours writers' room has pumped out five episodes per week for the better part of four decades, and that has delivered more drama than any suburban street should ever have to deal with. ""We did diabolical things to them all,"" scriptwriter and editor Philippa Burne says. Like when Dione ""Dee"" Bliss died after a car driven by her new husband went off a cliff on their wedding day. When the show decided to renovate its back lot in 2004, it turned it into one of the soap's biggest moments — the arson of a popular Erinsborough pub. ""[It was a] huge day in the writing room, when they came in and said 'you can burn down Lassiter's',"" Burne says. ""Like, oh my God it's like a gift."" It's one of the many storylines brought about by off-set circumstances. Sometimes, if the show is running under time, writers are given characters, a set and just minutes to come up with what's known as a ""filler scene"". And if you've ever wondered why characters choose to break up or have very private conversations at somewhere like the pub? It's because that's the set that was available. ""I was involved with the Neighbours plane crash,"" former scriptwriter and editor Peter Mattessi says. ""Basically we had a situation, we had too many cast and so we need to kill some off … ""Let's do a plane crash!"" The infamous 2005 storyline ended with a plane submerged in Bass Strait. In reality, the actors were splashing around in the pool from the set of 1990s game show Man O Man. It's a reflection of the fact doing big scenes on a soap opera budget isn't easy. Anne Charleston remembers the day Harold drowned at sea in 1991. ""I mean, that was sad because it was supposed to be a roaring, waving, sea, and it was like millpond,"" she says. ""They were throwing rocks in there to make it look as if it was rough,"" Smith replies. Of course, it wouldn't be a soap opera if the plotline that engineered his return to the show years later didn't involve amnesia. There was also the time Bouncer the dog inexplicably had a dream he was marrying the pooch next door. And, true to the genre, there have been so many weddings. Burne says she still sometimes feels guilty about killing off beloved Madge in 2001. Charleston says the death of her character was ""a mutual arrangement"". ""They wanted rid of me. And I wanted rid of them,"" she says. But she still remembers it being ""really difficult"" to say goodbye. Shane Isheev, who has been writing for the show since 2015, says he's ""known to be a lover of the more heightened, crazy stuff that we do on the show"". Isheev started off as a junior writer and now holds the demanding role of script producer. ""One of the great things about the Neighbours structure is that it is designed to be a training ground,"" he says. Even the current executive producer, Jason Herbison, worked his way up through the ranks. His entry point to the show was off the back of a letter he wrote to the show when he was in Year 11, saying ""this is what I think is wrong with the show"". He returned home from school one day to a phone call from a Neighbours producer who told Herbison he had some good ideas and there might be a job for him when he finished school. ""And I looked to the people that were older than me, to train me, and that spirit is very much alive today."" The Neighbours machine is powered by writers, producers, editors, sound technicians, camera operators, hair and makeup artists, caterers and many more roles. ""We produce two and a half hours of television in a week. And we do it, you know, for 48 weeks of the year,"" actor Ryan Moloney says. Moloney has played Jarrod ""Toadfish"" Rebecchi since 1993 — for more than half his life. ""I think the level of ability, and what we bring to the table is far beyond what most people really know or understand,"" he says. At any one time, there are usually at least two crews shooting different scenes and production in train for all different stages of an episode. ""You wouldn't believe the amount of people who are going to be out of work,"" Neighbours stalwart Ian Smith says about the show's end. Only one original cast member is still on the show — Stefan Dennis, who plays neighbourhood villain Paul Robinson. Many who have left Ramsay Street have been launched into international stardom. Margot Robbie, Guy Pearce, all three Hemsworth brothers, Russell Crowe, Natalie Imbruglia and Ben Mendelsohn all appeared on the show. ""You just learn an incredible discipline and you can work really, really fast. You're just really conscious of everybody else's jobs,"" Robbie said in 2020. The list of the show's most famous exports has a notable feature — the biggest stars in the early years were white. ""It didn't reflect really any version of Australia at that time in terms of diversity,"" scriptwriter Peter Mattessi says. Charleston sums it up: ""It was vanilla."" A groundswell of criticism about on-screen representation first came from the UK, where media is generally more diverse. As current executive producer, Herbison concedes the criticism of the early years is fair. ""There was very little diversity. And there was very little diversity anywhere on television,"" he says. He is keen to highlight the progress made over the last decade, and the diversity of the current cast and crew. But that change didn't happen easily or quickly. The first Asian family was introduced to the show in 1993. Their short-lived appearance involved a storyline in which the Lims were accused of barbecuing a pet dog after it disappeared. Nearly two decades later, the first South Asian family was introduced in 2011. The Kapoors were broadly celebrated in the UK but received vicious online backlash in Australia. The family was written out by 2013, with one character dying and the other two ""going back to India"" — despite the family being from Melbourne. ""You can't just parachute in an Indian-Australian family or a Chinese-Australian family and go 'cool, we're diverse now'. That is a process that begins with who is telling your stories,"" Mattessi says. That meant more of an effort to bring people from a range of backgrounds into the writers' room. A cast more reflective of real life in suburban Melbourne has followed. But last year, a growing number of actors came forward to say they faced racism on set, alleging management turned a blind eye. The allegations saw the media union intervene and insist on mandatory anti-racism, sexual harassment and discrimination training for all staff. At the time, the former race discrimination commissioner said the response showed Australia still had a long way to go when it came to dealing with allegations of racism. Takaya Honda joined Neighbours in 2016 in the role of doctor David Tanaka – whose gay wedding was the first on Australian television following the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Honda says he would not still be on the show if he had experienced or seen racism on set. One of his favourite things about playing David is that he has Asian heritage and is gay, but those parts of his life are not his defining features. He says the cultural impact of the show has been ""massive"". ""Not only in how it represents Australia and then Australians get to see themselves on screen, but also how the world views Australia,"" he says. He says he hears from fans who tell him the storylines have helped them come out as gay, or empowered them to live more proudly. A plot point about his character needing a kidney transplant resonated with viewers who experienced the same thing. Actress Rebekah Elmaloglou says the trials experienced by her character Terese Willis, including alcoholism and breast cancer, also resonated with viewers. ""Neighbours has always just been there,"" she says. ""It's always been on TV somewhere in the background. ""And I think it's relatable."" The soap's status as a constant was challenged in March 2020 when the pandemic hit and production had to shut down. Filming resumed about a month later with a very different environment — there was no kissing or holding hands, the cast and crew were siloed into different groups, and camera magic made physically distant actors look more intimate. It was one of the first productions in the entire world to return to filming. ""And suddenly the phone began to ring and ring and the New York Times, were on the phone and productions all over the world wanted to talk to us,"" Herbison says. Their model became a blueprint for other shows. While Neighbours survived COVID, it has now reached its final days. Ratings have been steadily declining in Australia for years now, and in 2011 the show was punted to 10's secondary channel 10 Peach. Its steady UK viewership has kept it afloat and more than a million people still tune in to Channel 5 to watch Neighbours every night. But the British network has pulled the pin, saying it instead wants to spend more money on UK productions. The final episode will air in August. Filming will wrap up even sooner. Ryan Moloney says it's been an incredibly sad time. ""You got all your friends all on the one spot and then you know, you're not going to see them again,"" he says. The about 200 people employed by the show have been polishing their resumes and updating their headshots as the soap draws to a close, leaving an already unstable industry with one fewer source of reliable work. Some of the show's biggest names have been brought back to Melbourne to film scenes for the finale, including Jason Donovan and Kylie Minogue reprising their iconic roles of Scott and Charlene. Mattessi hopes even after the cameras stop rolling, it won't be an end to life in Erinsborough. ""Karl and Susan are still going to be there,"" he says. ""Toadie is going to still be popping in for a cup of tea here to talk about his problems. ""Don't worry, Neighbours will still go on without you.""

94,Photographer challenges 'masculine stereotypes' by capturing 'authentic' images of female farmers,arts-culture,"  Photographer Claudia Caporn celebrates female farmers and women in agriculture with 'educational' portrait series Western Australian photographer Claudia Caporn says the stereotype of a farmer in Australia is a ""young, fit, male"" — and it's something she wants to change. Growing up in the Wheatbelt region, she has been surrounded by female farmers all her life. Presently travelling around Western Australia, Ms Caporn hopes to use her photography to change the face of agriculture. ""I'm just continuing to travel around with my camera, trying to get a picture of women that is authentic and real, and sort of challenges the idea of the Aussie farmer being a healthy, young, fit male in an Akubra hat,"" Ms Caporn said. During a recent visit to the Great Southern region, she attended the Denmark Agricultural School to take photos of the female students. Farm manager at the school, Kevin Marshall, said there were always women working in agriculture, but it wasn't always on display. ""They're on their family farms, and that progression or succession planning is happening, we just don't see a lot of it,"" he said. Claudia is hoping her photographs will increase the representation of women in the industry. After receiving the Minderoo artist fund grant last year, the 25-year-old is developing a series titled Women of the Land. ""It's a series of photographic portraits… I wanted to use my photography to be able to critique sort of the masculine stereotypes within the industry,"" she said. ""I [also] wanted to use this series as an educational tool for people who live in the city who are, by no fault of their own, more disconnected from the realities of farming and agriculture which is something we all rely on."" Growing up in Quairading in the Wheatbelt region, Ms Caporn wanted to highlight women in agriculture after being surrounded by female farmers all her life. ""Being rural I was able to use my photography to show a different reality than to a lot of other people, and I thought that I could use the camera to try and do some good,"" Ms Caporn said. After visiting the Wheatbelt, Esperance, Grass Patch, and the Great Southern, Ms Caporn will travel to the Pilbara to meet women working on cattle stations. ""It's been really great to meet lots of younger women in their 20s and 30s who are really pushing the boundaries and really owning being a farmer or agricultural worker in their own right,"" she said. Celebrating 75 years of Rural reporting. A lot of the men she has met say they don't know why there's such a male stereotype. ""The men have been super supportive as well, they 100 per cent agree that women are vital and do so much important work – heavy, hard, manual labour, it's not just running the business from the house,"" she said. ""I didn't want this series to take away from the fact that men do work, it's just trying to bring awareness that women also do this work.""

95,How an art exhibition in WA's north is helping prisoners break the crime cycle,arts-culture,"  Cossack art exhibition helping Roebourne prison inmates break the crime cycle At an exhibition in the historic ghost town of Cossack, art created by prisoners is proving to be popular. The Desistance Dreams exhibition features 21 works of Aboriginal art painted by inmates at Roebourne Regional Prison, located nine kilometres from the Cossack Gallery in WA's Pilbara region. Using bold, bright colours and a blend of traditional and modern styles, the paintings explore themes like connections to country and cultural stories. So far 10 of the paintings have been sold. One of the prisoners whose art was displayed said he would continue to paint after his release. The inmate, who cannot be named, encouraged other prisoners to get involved in the program. ""It brings light to the prison surroundings and makes me feel free. ""I find something I like and then make a story to go with it."" Ngarluma woman and Cossack Activation Committee cultural adviser Kerry Anne Churnside said art provided an alternative way for prisoners to express feelings they previously struggled to share. ""You put the canvas and a paint brush and things in front of them, and then you'll see everything coming out … they bring it out on the canvas and work with their hands to provide that information."" Ms Churnside said the ""deadly"" painting program helped prisoners reconnect with their country and culture. ""These people haven't been forgotten about, they're born into this skin group system … they may go for a time, but they still got to come back because they still have an obligation and roles and responsibilities of their skin group system."" Roebourne Regional Prison education tutor Kim Riordan, who delivered the visual arts program, said education in the prison was about giving people the tools to not reoffend. ""The whole idea is to help break that cycle,"" she said. ""To help people to see themselves as the types of people that can get out and solve the problems that come their way, work out a lifestyle that will be healthy and happy."" Ms Riordan said the artists were involved in every part of the exhibition, from buying the canvas, creating the paintings to hanging them at the gallery. She said the process helped build resilience and trust and resonated with the prisoners enough to make them want to pursue art upon release. ""One hundred per cent want to continue art for mental health; it's definitely a recognition of how that helps them connect back to their identities. ""There is a small portion who have gained the confidence and the ability to continue as an artist, whether it's an exhibiting artist or working with merchandise, artistry or perhaps with murals for the community."" Garlbagu tourism and events manager Emily Zimmerle said some visitors had questioned why art by prisoners was on display, but the gallery's team was quick to explain the program's benefits. She said overall the exhibition had received an abundance of positive feedback, with almost half of the artworks already purchased. ""Every time somebody walks in, they love it just looking at it, and when they find out what it's about, they love it even more and they can't stop asking questions."" She said visitors who were travelling around the state's north often felt connections to the artwork which depicted places they had seen. These connections were helping to dismantle stereotypes about prisoners, she added. ""[The visitors] can tell the story [to friends and relatives] about the rehabilitation or the opportunities that the artist is given and that they're supporting that."" Ms Churnside said creating art instilled a sense of pride in the prisoners and gave them confidence to reconnect with family. ""They can show their family what they can do and what they come out with and the talent that they have within them."" Moving forward, Ms Churnside hoped the artwork would inspire future generations to steer away from a life of crime. ""With the kids, they see what good things the elders coming out with and say, 'I'm going to copy that'; when they look and they see [the art], they say, 'I want to be like that, I want to do that artwork like him or her'.""

97,"Monsters, striped pyjamas, hairy bums: 12yo artist sells out his first solo show",arts-culture,"  Art Tui Bussenschutt, 12, sells out first solo exhibition of quirky, hand-drawn illustrations As the work-from-home movement flourishes, co-working cafés displaying original artworks are popping up in regional areas, as well as in cities. Twelve-year-old Art Tui Bussenschutt, who cites Basquiat and Picasso as influences, is one such artist benefiting from a show in a café in Berry on the New South Wales south coast. His first solo show, featuring 19 artworks, was a sell-out. Kate Dezarnaulds, whose background is in arts and festivals, is the founder of WorkLife, a network of co-working spaces that host live music and art exhibitions. ""We created WorkLife to build a network of thinkers and doers, a home away from home so people can focus, get their work done and not be distracted by the washing,"" Ms Dezarnaulds said. ""With the changes over the last few years, it just makes sense."" The organisation has 45 members in the Illawarra suburb of Coledale, and 30 members in Berry. ""It's my job to make sure when you come to WorkLife, it's not a sterile office, it's a community and a place where you can connect with your community at the same time,"" Ms Dezarnaulds said. Scrolling Instagram looking for work to display on her café walls, Kate came across Art's hand-drawn illustrations. ""The first thing I saw was this unbelievably well-resolved original vision,"" she told the ABC. ""For a young person to be able to execute works as consistently as this and for every one of them to be totally different from the previous one, and that they have this great sense of humour and personality about them … I was like, 'We've got to have a show, he's amazing and I'd love to see more of them,'"" Ms Dezarnaulds said. With more than 700 Instagram followers, Art has garnered interest in his quirky, philosophical, hand-drawn characters. ""We are shipping to New Zealand, Canberra, Melbourne and then locally, so it's quite a good spread,"" Ms Dezarnaulds said. Mother-of-three, ceramicist Fliss Dodd assists her younger son by managing the Instagram page, Art Tui. Want more local news? Sign up to the ABC Illawarra weekly email newsletter Fliss says Art has a fantastic sense of humour. ""It's just so unique and interesting and his characters are full of personality,"" she said. She says all of her children are creative but Art spends more time on it. ""Art spends less time on screens, and I think that has a lot to do with the time he puts into his art,"" she said. Art started drawing very young. ""He would create sweet little lead pencil sketches while we were watching sport for the older two, and he would actually be drawing his brother and the team from the sideline,"" Fliss said. Over time, Art gravitated towards the brush and chisel-tipped markers his grandma bought him. Art says he draws ""anyone or anything from my imagination, anything that comes out of my brain"". ""I use geometric shapes or organic shapes,"" he said. ""I usually do the face after that, work on the face and the body comes with it."" ""He talks about starting with the eyes and nose and then going from there,"" Fliss said. ""We've never touched his work, but we have guided him. ""Generally, after he's drawn it, he'll come to us, and it's just in the pen stage, and he'll ask, 'What do you think?' ""And we always say, 'Wow, can't wait to see it with some colour on it'. ""It comes naturally to him."" Louis Couttoupes, who owns and operates a restaurant in Kingston, in the ACT, with partner Iwona, recently purchased five pictures. ""We had this empty, underground concrete bunker that we needed to personalise,"" Mr Couttoupes said. ""In Art's art, we found an irresistible joy. ""It's quirky and incredibly humorous but has a sort of droll melancholy woven through,"" he said. ""It's so clever, with such attention to detail — the scales, the teeth, the shading. ""Our favourite part, though, is there is still plenty of 12-year-old Art in there: the skater beanie, the striped pyjamas, the monsters, the hairy bums."" ""There's an element of the grotesque but it's rendered so sympathetically and wryly you can't help but feel good when you look at them,"" Iwona said. ""We find them so uplifting.""

98,Rapper The Kid Laroi 'unbelievably' sorry for cancelling Melbourne show 40 minutes after scheduled start,arts-culture,"  The Kid Laroi apologises to fans for cancelling Melbourne show 40 minutes after start time Grammy-nominated Australian rapper The Kid Laroi has apologised to fans for rescheduling two Melbourne shows — one of which was cancelled 40 minutes after it was set to start. The rap superstar, best known for hit Stay featuring Justin Bieber, was due to take to the stage at Rod Laver Arena at 9pm on Friday night. Footage posted to social media shows the crowd reacting angrily as an announcement comes over loudspeakers to inform them of the cancellation about 9:40pm. Doors had opened to the stadium two hours earlier. The 18-year-old apologised in an Instagram story hours later. ""Melbourne — to say that I'm sorry is an understatement,"" he wrote. He said he woke up on Friday morning ""feeling really sick"" and despite medical intervention after a sound check, his condition worsened as the day progressed. He said he had returned multiple negative results on COVID tests. ""I was getting super light-headed and my body felt super heavy,"" he said. ""I promise you with all my heart that I gave everything in me to try and get up on that stage tonight. ""This is my first ever tour and I absolutely hate that I've had to do this, especially so last minute as it's not fair on you guys, but at the end of the day I have to put my health first and I would be lying to you if I told you I was okay to come up and perform for you."" The Kid Laroi is on a massive international tour which will go to Europe and the United States after he leaves Australia. He performed a day earlier at a nightclub event known for being a cheap student night. ""I love you all more than anything in the entire world and again, I am so so unbelievably f***in sorry,"" The Kid Laroi wrote in his Friday night apology. He ended the post with a broken heart emoji. A second show, originally planned for the following night, was rescheduled on Saturday afternoon. In a second statement posted to social media, The Kid Laroi said he woke up feeling even worse on Saturday and was told by a doctor he was unable to perform. ""My heart is broken, and I feel like I am letting you all down again, but I promise I will make it up to you,"" he wrote. ""I need to rest and get myself healthy so that I can give you the show you deserve when I come back to Melbourne next week."" Handsome Tours and TEG Live, who are running the Australia leg of the tour, said the June 3 show would run on Friday June 10, while the June 4 show would be moved to Sunday June 12. ""All existing tickets remain valid for the rescheduled dates without the need for exchange,"" they said. People unable to attend the new date will be eligible for a refund if they register before June 8. Some fans said on social media they had travelled from interstate to attend the show. The Kamilaroi rapper, born Charlton Howard, grew up in Sydney but has lived in the US while he has built a wildly successful music career.

99,"Comedian Biddy O'Loughlin carves her own career path, stepping out of her mum's shadow",arts-culture,"  Comedian Biddy O'Loughlin carves her own career path, stepping out of the shadow of her mum, Fiona O'Loughlin Biddy O'Loughlin is funny and can sing and is not just Fiona O'Loughlin's daughter. For those needing convincing, just check in with her closest fan, quite literally, 11-month-old daughter Dolly. For her comedy gigs, the single mother straps the ever-smiling baby onto her chest before starting her routine. ""As soon as we're on stage, it's like she just stops and listens and it's a bit of a sight gag as well, but it wasn't the intention,"" O'Loughlin said. ""I just didn't have any options and then people go 'wow, you're doing comedy with a baby, I love that, that's great' and I go 'well, I didn't really have a choice'."" It has been a rollercoaster career in the entertainment industry since she decided in her early twenties that she needed to go to Ireland to start her comedy career — far from the shadow of veteran Australian comedian and mother Fiona O'Loughlin. ""It just sort of made more sense than doing it in Australia where the pressure would be and also all the comedians backstage I would have known since I was 12 or 13,"" O'Loughlin said. ""It would have been way too much pressure whereas in Ireland nobody knew who I was, who my mum was, and it was great."" Although she does wryly admit that after her first Irish gig an audience member asked if she knew Fiona O'Loughlin. After living in Ireland, she journeyed to France and America to work, before running out of money and coming home. She then did a full-time three-year film degree and made several award-winning short films. Her life was then thrown upside down when she became pregnant and had Dolly. After adjusting to being a mum, she decided to move from Alice Springs where she grew up, to Adelaide to pursue her comedy career last year. But being a single mum and doing the comedy circuit has not been easy. ""Sometimes it's really, really, really hard, but I don't like to wallow. I could have chosen not to do this,"" O'Loughlin said. ""I just went 'nah this is what life has thrown at me, I'm just going to do it'. ""Some days are particularly stressful, but I know it will be okay, we will get there, I am a great storyteller."" O'Loughlin is branching out into cabaret and is currently appearing in the Adelaide Cabaret Fringe Festival, a festival that ironically also features a show by her mum. Much to her surprise, the 34-year-old recently discovered she actually has a decent voice and is keen to embrace a singing career, if with a few reservations. ""I really would love to give music more of a go, but something that's put me off about the music industry, you have to be some sort of a character,"" she said. ""I prefer the raw honesty of comedy to the branding of music, but I also just love to sing."" Nothing is getting in O'Loughlin's way — she recently came close to landing a television gig, picked up an agent and is making a last ditch attempt to get to the massive Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August. ""I'm hell-bent on getting to Edinburgh, so much that I've already registered, I just have to get the money now,"" she said. That is where Dolly comes back in, with the pair often doing a busking double act in the city. ""She's getting a bit too old for it now, I can do 20 minutes and I can usually make $20 to $40 in those 20 minutes,"" she said. The comedian says she would not be surprised if Dolly becomes an entertainer when she grows up, but she also hopes to provide a more stable home environment for her daughter than what she experienced growing up. O'Loughlin's teenage life was thrown upside down when her mum Fiona was discovered as a comedian and started travelling to gigs. ""It's something to be very aware of. I like having her [Dolly] on stage, whereas what happened with mum was, she suddenly blew up when I was 12 and she was gone,"" she said. ""I was the mum, so I was cooking and cleaning for all of the others [children] because I was the eldest girl."" She admitted Fiona's struggle with alcohol over many years had also been tough to take. ""It still is, even the stuff that's not in the headlines, she's also a wonderful woman, but it has been really tough on all of us,"" she admitted. Being a comedian and singer can be tough and you live or die with each performance. But having Dolly at the end of each gig is grounding and reassuring. ""She's the most important thing in my life, so after I have a tough gig and they do happen, I don't think it's as devastating as before when I didn't have Dolly — she loves me anyway,"" she said. Biddy said her mother has full confidence she will make it in Australia. ""She said she was going to buy stocks in me soon, so I think she thinks I'm alright,"" she said with a laugh.

100,"analysis: Fans of Stranger Things are embracing the old and the new but Kate Bush is still mine, mine, mine",arts-culture,"  Stranger Things has helped a Kate Bush classic top the charts and suddenly everyone is young again What's the first record you remember hearing at home? That older brother or sister who brought home Led Zeppelin or Joni Mitchell or Guns N' Roses or Public Enemy? That first moment of connection with a world you never knew existed sits powerfully and persistently in the memory, aided by the emotional heft of wanting to love something that the person you love already does – wanting to get closer to that adored sister, admired brother, by connecting through music. They should identify the brain synapse that's firing in that moment and study it: I think it might be the answer to the eternal question of what love really is. For me it was the Rolling Stones, Beggars Banquet. I was five. I could recite you the track list right now, and no one could ever persuade me that it's not one of their best. But much later, it was a strange record that my older sister brought into the house: the cover showed a dark-eyed woman attached to a kite wrapped in kimono silk and featured a track sung in a register so high I couldn't even sing along in falsetto. I remember feeling nailed to the floor, as if air in my head was expanding with the music. What was this? How could anything be this beautiful? I don't think my sister ever realised it, but that record, the debut album by a 19-year-old Kate Bush, The Kick Inside, became mine, mine, mine. It still is. But I'm happy to share it. I found the news this week that Kate Bush's 1985 masterwork, Running Up That Hill, was charting again — because it featured in the first episode of the fourth series of Stranger Things — wonderfully heartening. No, not because of nostalgia: I don't need my TV to keep sifting through the cupboards of my youth to keep me happy. But because music-sharing platforms were delivering on their promise of creating a musical universe that is truly time-shifted. By the weekend, Kate Bush was number one on iTunes and it clearly didn't matter at all that her music is approaching half a century old. For an entire generation of Zoomer fans, it must have felt like finding a beloved older sister's record stash in the back of the garage and everyone was young once again. There's an odd contrast going on to this open-hearted embrace of the old and the new by a legion of rusted-on Stranger Things fans. Just across the television road, another new show was enjoying a high-profile premiere: the next ""lega-prequel"" (legacy character prequel) from the Star Wars universe, and this time it's the untold tale of Obi-Wan Kenobi: just what was he up to in all those years between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope? An intense and immensely charismatic actor, Moses Ingram, was cast as Obi-Wan's nemesis, Reva. Rather than embrace the new with the old, a great number of Star Wars fans bombarded her with hateful and racist messages on social media. Her co-star Ewan McGregor posted his own defence and we had the bizarre situation of the official Star Wars Twitter account admonishing its own fans, saying: ""There are more than 20 million sentient species in the Star Wars galaxy: don't choose to be a racist."" Even though I've never seen it (now, don't all come at me at once) I know that wars still rage about the ending of The Sopranos or the casting of Jodie Whittaker as The Doctor but this was dark, new territory indeed. It made me think about the two-sides of nostalgia: as one horrified Star Wars fan posted, with a picture of an arrestingly Anglo cast from the Empire Strikes Back, ""I think they want to go back to these days…"". And there are some places that no amount of time-shifting should seem good enough to go back to. This weekend you can delve deeper into why music like Kate's hits you in all the right places and also spend some time with digital workmates: they don't leave their dirty coffee cups in the work sink. Have a safe and happy weekend – and after all that, what music to leave you with? Well, if it's good enough for the kids, let's hope they find this one on the spinning wheel of music-sharing platforms. I'm sure they'll be thrilled. Go well.

101,"Armed with a microphone and kelpie, Jack is making sure the lessons of the land don't disappear with farmers",arts-culture,"  As farmers leave the land, Jack is making sure their knowledge doesn't disappear with them It wasn't until university that Jack Cresswell realised his parents ""actually had sheep to earn an income"". ""Turns out it wasn't just because they loved it,"" he quips. Born and bred in the bush, the 28-year-old's love for all things agriculture is no mystery. After spending his early years on a multi-generational farming property in Wilcannia — purchased by his family ""for about six shillings"" during war times — they pulled up stumps and moved east to Dubbo when Jack was in primary school. The landscape was different and the farming ""more intense"", he says. ""We're still learning on our family farm, as of today, 20 years on,"" he says. “There is so much information farmers have in their heads that has been passed down through generations that may never get shared on if the next generation leaves the land.” The tradition of passing family farm businesses from parents to children is becoming less and less viable, with the number of farming families dropping 15 per cent per decade since the 1980s. Jack started Farms Advice Podcast in a bid to prevent the loss of intergenerational farming wisdom, and to create a two-way information exchange for those within the agricultural sector. From targeted information around what the federal budget means for farmers, to safety advice and tips on identifying mental health issues in the workplace, the 28-year-old is using the platform to create an online community centred around learning. ""I wanted to connect with my mates from farms all across Australia after finishing uni, so it started as a bit of a blog for four years, but no-one was really reading it,"" he says. ""I thought, 'What's the next best platform that farmers can access for free, on the go, where they don't really have to stop what they're doing? And that was podcasting."" The weekly program — which sees Jack tackle a range of topics with industry experts — has grown from a ""pretty unpolished"" hobby into 5,500 monthly listeners, all looking for new techniques or technologies ""to improve the way they farm, work or service the industry"". ""We're all learning together,"" Jack says. ""It's not about one [individual] property. It's about everyone else that's in the same boat."" The ABC's Trailblazers program provides a platform for people aged 18 to 28 who are doing inspiring things in their regional town. Since the 1980s, disposable incomes from farms have become considerably tighter, while costs of operation have increased. For Jon Daly, business development manager for Byfields — a business advisory group that deals in agribusiness and sponsors the podcast — the platform provides an outlet to translate ""conversations that were being had day to day by our [account managers] with our clients"". It doesn't matter who you are or where you live: Mark is making videos about the day-to-day life on his farm for you. ""And washing away all the talk about tax returns and diesel fuel rebates and all that sort of stuff, and getting down to the real discussions around the really important things,"" Jon says. ""Succession planning, estate planning, those real, big-ticket items that are affecting our industry."" While Jon doesn't shy away from the fact that getting involved with podcasting was largely a ""commercial decision"" — ""I liked the idea of it because they were they're a growing trend,"" he reflects — it was Jack's ""grit and determination"" that saw him reach out to Farms Advice. ""I just remember going, 'This young bloke … he's wanting to do something that's making a difference. He's wanting to help others',"" Jon says. ""When you talk to Jack … it feels like you've just rolled into the corner of the paddock in the Land Cruiser and you've cracked the esky open and you're just having having a beer and having a chat."" It's not just listeners who have walked away with new lessons, either. ""I've learnt a lot from broadacre croppers and agronomists,"" Jack reflects on the program. ""And that's really what I hope everyone gets from it as well."" Farmers are under-represented among all businesses, Jon adds, ""and there's some 320,000 of them across Australia"". ""So, they're very crucial to our society and providing food on plates,"" he says. ""Anything that can be done to help them get that food on the plate and do it in a more efficient, more productive manner, that can only be a good thing."" This push to improve systems of information-sharing is being felt across the country — and across platforms. Airlie Landale, an agricultural economist and independent consultant, was back working with her dad on the family farm when she found herself at a crossroads. She wanted to ""help the business move forward"", but time pressures meant it was often ""really hard to get off-farm to upskill and learn more"", she says. ""As part of my generation, naturally I turned online … but I just found it really difficult to find what I was looking for. ""Was there funding available for infrastructure? Or what were the best producers doing in terms of water efficiency? I just had so many questions and I couldn't get them answered."" It inspired her to create FarmTable, a national knowledge exchange platform for Australian farmers and producers, and other members of the agricultural sector. Agricultural research — as well as templates and tools for things such as workplace health and safety and budgeting — are brought together in an online library, alongside a national database for rural and agricultural events, courses and grants. Her group also runs Farmer eXchange, an online community where those in the sector can exchange ideas, ask questions, connect with others and share knowledge. ""I love the quote, 'Alone we are great, together we are brilliant',"" Airlie says. ""So many of us operate in our little silos when there's so much knowledge across the sector. ""We're not often part of big companies where there's networking and sharing of information, so enabling that to happen, for knowledge to be transferred between producers, [across] industry, that's where the power comes. ""I think for us to truly be innovative as a sector, all of us have to play a part in that, and I think that [the] sharing economy is really important."" With three seasons of the podcast under Jack's belt, ""the feedback has started to dribble in a little bit"". What's your Australian Story?  The ABC has been uncovering ordinary Australians with extraordinary stories from all corners of the country for the past 90 years. Submit your Australian Story now. ""[People are saying,] 'We've implemented technology into our farm', which is a big one because farmers, sometimes they're unsure and they need reinforcement, which may be just a podcast episode,"" he says. He wants to create more impact across agriculture, ""whether that's travelling around and seeing people face-to-face or going to events"". Above all, he says, he wants the podcast to continue to be a free and accessible platform for farmers to hear directly from ""authentic and credible sources"". ""I think it's just about creating quality content for the audience, and continuing to answer the questions that people are asking online,"" he says. ""I want to create that community around learning and connecting.""

103,Religious leaders gather to welcome establishment of interfaith library,arts-culture,"  Great Stupa of Universal Compassion near Bendigo to host interfaith library of religious texts A library devoted to texts and artefacts from different faiths will be built at the Great Stupa of Universal Compassion, near Bendigo in Central Victoria, which organisers hope will attract scholars and people from around the world. The region's religious leaders say the library will be a place for people to learn about spirituality, enlightenment, religion, faith, and science. Organisers of the Great Stupa already have 1,500 texts put aside to catalogue into the library when it is finished in November this year. It includes 250 texts uploaded into its online library, which it is hoped scholars and people from around the world will use for education. ""All the work started seven years ago but in a very small way, with just a few boxes of donated books,"" said volunteer librarian Barbara Rozmus. ""Initially I was working on my own, just catalogue the books onto a simple system, and it grew from there."" Ms Rozmus worked as a librarian at the National Library of Canberra for 12 years and in public libraries before that, project managing library science and developing public programs with multicultural communities. ""So it's still pretty small, but big plans,"" she said. ""It's developing along with the themes of faith and science. ""Buddhist faith and Buddhist books are certainly very well represented in the library, but we also have quite a big section already on interfaith, presenting other faiths. ""The very particular angle we are taking is looking at materials, supporting knowledge, but intersection of faith, Buddhism, and science."" The construction of the library will start in a matter of weeks and is expected to be completed by November so that it can open by the end of this year. The library is a project 42 years in the making when the Great Stupa's chair, Ian Green, envisioned a library to become a leader in libraries on theology and philosophy. ""It was in 1981 that Lama Yeshe said to me that up on that hill up there we have a big stupa, and in this big stupa would be a big temple and a library. So now it is about to become a reality,"" he said. ""It will become a resource that scholars and those interested in these particular subjects will actually come along and have a place where they can study. ""Where they can come here, work on computers, do research, but also they can login remotely as well."" The president of the Kehiliat S'dov Zahav, the progressive Jewish association of the Goldfields in Central Victoria, David Kram, said being a library that transcends faiths, people will be able to find the Holy Quaran, the Hebrew Bible otherwise referred to as the Old Testament in Christianity. Dr Kram has already donated several books on Judaism that place the faith in the wider world. ""It's important to have religious texts that are written not to, not for, members of their own faith, but to the world at large,"" he said. ""I really welcome this wonderful idea of building blocks of education to combat ignorance. ""The three building blocks [of the library] are Buddhism, interfaith, and science. Science as we know it, of course, comes out of a wider branch of knowledge called philosophy, the love of knowledge."" Near the Great Stupa is the Atisha Centre where Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns live and study at a retreat. Its director Gaylten Dondrup wants to see some of the older texts dedicated to the Lamrim path to enlightenment that many practising Buddhist begin with, autobiographies, and historical accounts such as videos of Lama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche at an early age. Thubten Yeshe was a Tibetan who was exiled in Nepal and co-founded the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT) which the Great Stupa of Universal Compassion falls under. Thubten Zopa Rinpoche is a Tibetan Buddhist scholar and the spiritual director of the FPMT. ""Most people don't understand most faiths,"" the Venerable Dondrup said. ""So by having a library here, having a bit of access to know what those philosophies are and being able to share those with us, gives everyone a bit more bit more of an understanding."" The Victorian government is spending $430,000 to help the Great Stupa organisation build the library, and its Member for Bendigo West, Maree Edwards, said it was vital the texts were made available for online research. ""There's the science component to it as well — connecting the science with the faith across the world,"" she said. ""Bendigo is already a very diverse community and we have many, many people from different multicultural backgrounds already. ""We have more refugees from the Karen community than anywhere else in Victoria."" What all leaders, religious and community, agree on is that the library will be a place that accommodates all faiths. ""It just brings about harmony, peace and harmony, within the community,"" the Venerable Dondrup said. ""That's the most important thing, to be able to share all the different faiths.""

105,"'Oh, who are you kidding now?': Why Kirstie had years of cosmetic enhancement — then ditched it",arts-culture,"  How beauty became our damaging obsession Australians' body image problems are getting worse. Amidst an 'epidemic of body image anxiety', could one simple act change everything? The term 'body modification' covers everything from hair-dye and braces, to lip fillers, nose jobs and butt augmentation. What's considered normal or extreme comes down to who you hang around with: depending on your social circle, you might consider make-up unusual, or regular botox injections the norm. But across the spectrum of procedures, there are two powerful common points. More of us are opting for body modification than ever. And more of us are judging the choices others are making. UK philosopher Heather Widdows says we are increasingly comparing ourselves to others online, with a ""moral judgement that goes both ways"". It's directed towards those who do and those who don't modify their bodies, she says. And it's becoming a destructive force. ""We have an epidemic of body image anxiety,"" Professor Widdows says. ""We have to move away from that."" In Australia, more than 43 per cent of people are highly concerned about their body image, according to Monash University's Body Image Research Group. In a study of over 3,000 mostly female Australians, aged 18 and over, the Butterfly Foundation found that over 70 per cent said appearance was ""very important"" and wished they could change the way they look. Roughly one-fifth of the respondents had attempted to change themselves to look like images they saw on social media. Nearly half felt pressure to look a certain way. Behind statistics like these is the influence of beauty ideals on body image — and it's time to talk about that, Professor Widdows says. ""We need to start taking it seriously."" Joseph Taylor, 36, says he grew up hating his ""stereotypical [ethnic] big nose"". He's since had three nose jobs, the first when he was 17. Schoolyard teasing played a part in his decision. ""Kids can be horrible,"" he says. ""Someone probably said something like, 'Oh, you big nose'. ""It must have, at some point, really got to me."" ""When we're young, we're constantly trying to be the best that we can be on the exterior because we feel that's all that matters … and we're so impressionable,"" Mr Taylor says. But it's not only in our youth that we are susceptible to this influence. For young people and adults alike, beauty has become ""our primary obsession"", Professor Widdows argues. She's not out to criticise beauty rituals. After all, as she notes, ""we are embodied beings; we live in our bodies. It's how we see other people, how we relate to them"". The cosmetic enhancement industry in Australia is booming. We meet the people chasing their aesthetic ideal and those jumping off the cosmetic enhancement conveyor belt. And plenty of beauty practices are enjoyable. Mr Taylor, for example, says today he is happy and confident with his appearance, and he feels in control of the influence of beauty in his life. ""I've definitely grown to like the way I am,"" he says. It's when beauty ideals tip into an obsession that problems can arise. For example, when not weighing what you'd like ruins your day. When getting one selfie right takes hours of preparation and editing before posting. Or when not being happy with the way you look might even stop you leaving the house. These, Professor Widdows says, are things she's observed in researching her latest book, Perfect Me: Beauty as an Ethical Ideal. She believes they signal a ""very profound shift"" in values. ""We've gone from beauty being one thing we care about to it being almost defining of who we are,"" she says. ""How we present success used to be the car or the house. Now it's how we look."" Professor Widdows suggests several reasons for this shift. We live in a more ""visual culture"" today, where ""the image always speaks louder than words"", she says. Courtesy of social media, we are able to constantly examine our appearance in relation to that of others. Also, where once beauty treatments were ""very topical and superficial"", now ""we literally can change the shape of our bodies"", she says. ""You go from the cut of the dress to the cut of the breast."" Philosopher and physician Yves Saint James Aquino argues that with an increase in accessibility, there's now a ""normalisation"" of body modification, which has also fuelled its rise. ""Now because it's so common, it's part of people's lives, they feel less stigmatised … and therefore they feel freer to do it,"" he says. Dr Aquino says another factor has led to the rise of body modification: prolonged exposure to our own faces on video calls throughout the pandemic. ""People are encountering their faces more than ever,"" he says. ""That's when they start noticing things that they haven't really noticed before."" This, Dr Aquino says, has led to an uptick in cosmetic surgery around the world. In the last five years or so, there's been a sharp increase in the use of injectables (such as in wrinkle-reducing or lip-filling procedures) in Australia. And the Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) operation is the fastest growing cosmetic surgery in the world today. At 2018, Australians were spending more per capita on cosmetic surgery than people in the US, with anti-wrinkle (Botox) injections the most popular operation at the time. And while it is mostly women choosing cosmetic surgery, the number of male clients is growing. Former Vogue Australia editor-in-chief Kirstie Clements had the majority of her cosmetic procedures in her 40s, including lip fillers, Botox and collagen injections. A decade later, she'd had enough. ""I didn't like that sort of overworked look that it gives you, the kind of chubby cheeks and squinty eyes,"" she says. ""When I got to my 50s, I thought, 'Oh, who are you kidding now?' ""So I gave it up."" Ms Clements, now 60, believes ageism is a driving force in the increase of cosmetic enhancement. ""The pressure is for us to try and keep up and to stay young and to be fresh,"" she says. And cosmetic procedures are even more readily available today. ""There are now literally lunchtime procedures where you can go back to work and nobody cares that there's a few marks in your face,"" Ms Clements says. ""They're not taboo. It's as fashionable as getting a piece of clothing, which is quite sobering. It's your skin that's being punctured."" Ms Clements calls out the ""constant hammering"" of edited or altered images that prompt us to question if we should benchmark ourselves against them. ""It's the brave woman who says, 'No, I don't care what any of you do. I'm happy in my own skin',"" she says. But resisting pressure isn't just about bravery or defiance; it's about deflecting messages that arrive with increasing frequency. Where once we might have encountered beauty images 12 times a year in a monthly magazine, today ""you're seeing things 12 times in 10 minutes"" on social media, Ms Clements says. ""It's getting more and more pervasive … So it's the strong person who can stand back and say 'no'."" Professor Widdows is concerned about a future in which we might ""begin to see exceptionally modified bodies as normal"". To downgrade the status of beauty in our lives, she is calling for a culture shift. What do people of colour, who've often been racially vilified for their appearance, have to say about others cherry-picking their features? She wants us to ditch the negative comments about other people's bodies and appearance. ""Often, cosmetic surgery recipients report that their insecurity began with a nasty comment,"" she says. Professor Widdows believes more of us need to understand the harm that negative comments and body shaming can cause, arguing that it should be considered as seriously as any other form of discrimination. ""I say, if you don't do [body modifying], don't feel smug because you don't feel the pressure,"" she says. Similarly, if you do engage in body modification, don't question those who don't. ""Rather let's think about, culturally, do we want to live in a society where people feel pressured to engage more and more? That's the bit I want to push back against, the social pressure,"" she says. Professor Widdows' plea? Stop talking about other people's bodies — full stop. ""Let's not look at what people do or don't do. Let's not say, 'this practice is okay, that perhaps is not',"" she says. ""Let's just take the pressure completely off.""

106,Art explores grief and beauty of short lives at Queensland's only children's hospice,arts-culture,"  Hummingbird House children's palliative care portrait exhibition explores love, grief and lives cut short The image is haunting. Two figures lie entwined on the ground. One is clearly an adult, the other a child. The black and white stillness is jarring. Viewers might wonder as to the picture's meaning but for Kaitlin Cole, its purpose is very clear. It forms part of her new role as guardian of her late son's memory. Ms Cole and other families are part of a new exhibition called My Little Sunshine Stories, a collection of photos and audio gathered by artist Navin Samuel Regi over four years of working with families and staff at Hummingbird House, Queensland's only children's hospice. Ms Cole describes her son Rory Bakker, who passed away in 2019 aged 12, as her ""red-headed, little delight"". ""He was the child who always loved to smile. He loved to live, even though he couldn't do everything that everybody else could do in life,"" she recalled. At 26 weeks pregnant, Ms Cole had symptoms of an infection and high blood pressure. Ms Cole told ABC Radio Brisbane's Loretta Ryan that a scan showed her baby had suffered a stroke. ""Initially, his life was just like any other little baby but over the years, we ended up having more health issues that would come up,"" Ms Cole said. ""He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, he had chronic lung disease, and the expectations were that Rory would not come through this. ""We were then referred to palliative care a couple of years later. I think we got referred officially to Hummingbird House as one of the first clients in the house."" Hummingbird House is Queensland's only children's hospice and provides specialised paediatric palliative care to babies, children and young people with a life-limiting condition. Families can choose to spend time at a purpose-built home in Brisbane, or in their home or community. Ms Cole was hoping for some ""really nice family photos"" and when Mr Regi asked if she would be part of his project, she ""jumped at the chance"". ""I will admit when I first walked in the [exhibition] space I burst into tears and kind of lost it a little bit,"" she said. ""After death care is is really lacking in this country and so when I came into the space and saw what was done and what honour was done to the photos, it was very overwhelming emotionally for me."" That haunting black and white image of Ms Cole and her son is her favourite piece in the exhibition. ""I was given the opportunity after Rory passed away to have a vigil for him outside,"" she said. ""It seemed like every bird in Brisbane came and said goodbye to him. And there's a photograph of him and I on the ground. ""And I'm just holding him. You can't see our faces but you know it's a mother and son in that moment."" When Mr Regi witnessed the death of someone he was caring for, he said he began to ""question my reaction to my own grief"". He said the Hummingbird House project offered him a precious insight into the experience of death. ""Rather than me telling people what to do and you know, putting cameras in front of their faces and taking a photo, it's really a collaboration,"" he said. ""It's about telling stories, trying to figure out the best way to tell that story through a single image and an audio recording. ""I have found myself in positions where I'm the only other person in the room where both mum and dad would be grieving as their child was dying. ""And that's an incredible honour to be in that space and to be trusted with that story."" The name, My Little Sunshine Stories, came about when two of the families featured spontaneously starting singing the Jimmie Davis tune to their children. The content of Mr Regi's exhibition is something Fiona Hawthorne sees every day, but the photography and sounds still took her breath away. Stanley Geebung says he has a ""second chance"" at life thanks to the efforts of palliative care workers, as a national survey reveals many Australians do not understand the type of care the service provides. She is the general manager of Wesley Mission Queensland's palliative care services, under which Hummingbird House falls. There are about 5,700 families who could use Hummingbird House services and Ms Hawthorne concedes ""maybe we need more"". ""But I think rather than another bricks and mortar hospice, Hummingbird House is now stepping out to support communities to support families where they live, they love and they will ultimately grieve,"" she said. ""That's our next step, to get Hummingbird House into communities around the state with compassionate neighbours and compassionate communities. ""It's not work. It's actually a privilege to stand beside these families."" The My Little Sunshine Stories exhibition runs until June 11 at KEPK, Unit J2/241 Station Rd, Yeerongpilly.

107,"Lights, camera, action: Murder mystery puts Australian South Sea Islanders in focus",arts-culture,"  Stan television series Black Snow focuses on Australian South Sea Islander history A horrific crime that rocks a small town. A teenage girl murdered and the killer never found. It is the premise of a new television series set to begin filming in Queensland this month and released on Australian streaming service Stan later this year. However, it is more than a classic ""whodunnit"". The storyline is deeply rooted in the history of its North Queensland backdrop. Producer Kaylene Butler said the six-episode series, Black Snow, acknowledged the Australian South Sea Islander community and their significant place in history. ""We never had the opportunities to have our stories told within history or our curriculum with schooling,"" Ms Butler said. ""We are known as the forgotten people. ""This is our doorway for more stories in the future and for others to tell their own individual stories of black birding as well as our heritage."" Ms Butler said her experiences growing up as an Australian South Sea Islander shaped the making of Black Snow. ""My great, great grandfather was chief and was taken in the black birding era,"" she said. She said she had been working with family members from Tana Island and Queensland. ""It's been a blessing within the story. It will be known that we are very much within our Christian ways, and they've been praying for this,"" Ms Butler said. Black snow is the nickname for ash which falls from the sky when cane is burned and, one can speculate, is one of the reasons for the name of the show. The show focuses on the fictional murder of Jasmine Baker, which devastates her Australian South Sea Islander community. It is not until 2019 that a time capsule unearths a secret that puts cold-case detective James Cormack on the trail of the killer. Black Snow was created by Lucas Taylor, who Ms Butler said grew up with Australian South Sea Islanders. ""He was probably curious and did a lot of research on our forgotten people and I think he wanted to bring it to the screen,"" she said. ""He has done it in a beautiful way … even though it's a cold case murder mystery."" The experience of working on the show has brought many emotions for Kaylene Butler, including feelings of immense joy but also post-traumatic stress. She said the show addressed how character Jasmine Baker's family came to be in Queensland in the 1990s. ""It's telling people this is what really happened … there was slavery, within either First Nations as well as our South Sea Islander peoples, in our history,"" Ms Butler said. ""This is how we've come to adapt to be where we are and who we are."" She said it was time for Australian South Sea Islander people to tell their stories. ""There'll be a lot of questions and I'm hoping this could be a start of many answers,"" she said. The town of Proserpine will provide the backdrop for the fictional town of Ashford.

We will see people in the street that look like us,"" she said. ""We'll see people in the street that look like the farmers that we worked with, and fall back in the time."" There have been a number of casting calls made to locals in surrounding regions, requesting their involvement. ""We understand that many of our young people have a dual identity … many of them are Australia South Sea Torres Strait or Australian South Sea Aboriginal,"" Ms Healy said. ""We ask that they recognise their cultural identity and ,whether they're young or old, we are needing those characters in the series."" Ms Healy became an official cultural advisor to the series in September last year. ""It's my lived experience,"" she said. ""That's given me the opportunity to speak to the producers or screenwriters and say, 'Well that's not correct … what that young woman is doing … this is how we would have been told to do it'."" She is also running a cultural awareness program for the cast and crew. ""Using my knowledge of the history documents that I've read over time, in my own experience, I put together a workshop and tour,"" she said. Ms Butler said it was keeping her information alive. ""I feel like the government has dropped the ball on us in telling our story and keeping it alive,"" she said. The sentiment is shared by many South Sea Islanders who grew up in Queensland. Ms Butler said the cultural awareness sessions brought everyone together. ""There's a lot of emotion within that room,"" she said. ""We've set a benchmark of being together in a cultural way, as well as being able to tell this beautiful story. ""I hope it opens the door for more people to understand us and know us.""

108,"Uncle Herb reflects on a lifetime of playing 'the cheapest instrument in the world', the gumleaf",arts-culture,"  Uncle Herb Patten reflects on lifetime of gumleaf playing Celebrated Gunaikurnai gumleaf player Uncle Herb Patten first encountered gumleaf music as a child in Newmerella, when he witnessed his mother's brother, Uncle Lindsay Thomas, pull a gumleaf from a tree. ""I was only five years of age and it fascinated me. He grabbed this leaf off the tree and I saw him put the leaf to his mouth and he made a sound,"" Uncle Herb said. ""I was right next to a tree and I grabbed a leaf off a tree and just copied him."" Uncle Lindsay was just one of the many gumleaf performers hailing from areas such as Lake Tyers in Victoria and Wallaga Lake in southern New South Wales, who performed in travelling gumleaf bands throughout regional Victoria after World War I. Playing at mechanics institutes, gumleaf performers were often World War II soldier-musicians who would entertain communities with military medleys of wartime standards such as Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag and It's a Long Way to Tipperary. ""We had a piano in our family, that was there before I was born, my grandmother bought it in Melbourne before she moved to Newmerella. There was no TV of course in the early 50s,"" Uncle Herb said. Coming from a family of entertainers, a young Herb Patten learnt to play many of the wartime standards on the gumleaf by ear, eventually making his national radio debut on the ABC Australian Amateur Hour radio show hosted by Terry Dear in the 1950s. ""Through the influence of my gumleaf playing and my Aunty Violet playing the piano, I appeared in that show and came second,"" Uncle Herb said of performing at the Orbost Mechanics Institute as a nine-year-old. Uncle Herb went on to play at the first Gumleaf Championships in Australia, which were held at the Maryborough Golden Wattle Festival in 1970. Over the next 20 years, he would regularly compete at the championships, which were frequently taken out by serial Queensland winner Les Hawthorne. ""I came second, second, second — about six times"", Uncle Herb said of his experiences playing in talent competitions. It was an omen that was ultimately confirmed when he captured national attention as the runner up on the inaugural series of Australia's Got Talent in 2007. But for what he may have missed out on in competition prize money, Uncle Herb has sustained a consistent public profile and celebrated identity as a gumleaf performer and historian. After collaborating with Monash University musicologist Dr Robin Ryan on several research projects, including his definitive book How to Play the Gumleaf in 1999, Uncle Herb achieved a Master of Arts degree at RMIT in 2007. As a gumleaf performer, he has performed as a busker on the streets of Melbourne, to the stage at the Sydney Opera House, bringing the tradition of gumleaf playing to schools, festivals, public events and frequently appearing on TV and radio. ""The gumleaf, it's a great medium. Kids love it. I've performed at over 1,200 kindergartens over the past 35 years,"" he said. ""I've done that many high schools, and universities. I've done that many openings. I've performed at the Entertainment Centre across from the Yarra several times. I've done Moomba from the '60s, '70s, through the '80s."" Approaching his 80th birthday, Uncle Herb continues to play publicly, hoping one day to travel to China to record more music and perform at the Leaf Flute festival. From his continued research, he suspects that melodic leaf playing may have been introduced to Australia via the Chinese who came to Australia during the gold rush. But with much of the southern part of Australia's Indigenous history lost during stolen generations, the origins of gumleaf playing for Indigenous people remain unclear. But in an effort to keep the gumleaf tradition alive, Uncle Herb recently performed as part of a showcase of top performers at the Giiyong Festival in Eden, New South Wales. Organised by side fellow gumleaf master Uncle Ossie Cruise, the event celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Wallaga Lake Gumleaf band, which toured southern NSW and East Gippsland in the 1920s. Still amazed at how gumleaf playing captures the imagination of young and old and people from all cultural backgrounds and walks of life, Uncle Herb hopes to inspire young children to take up the readily available instrument. ""It's a live instrument, it's a living thing. It's not a wooden guitar or a brass trumpet or a kettle skin drum, it's a living instrument,"" he said. ""It's the cheapest instrument in the world.""

109,Darwin student confronts cultural identity with award-winning self-portrait,arts-culture,"  Exit Art exhibition for Year 12 NT students selects people's choice winner, Izzy Craven Izzy Craven can't always understand her Filipino grandmother. But when the young Darwin artist presented her award-winning self-portrait, no language was needed. ""She was just very excited when she saw it, because she still actually has the scarf that I painted,"" she said. ""She said something in Filipino that I can't really understand, but she was very happy."" Navigating cultural identity was a central theme in Izzy's self-portrait, which earned her the people's choice award at a prestigious art exhibition for Year 12 students in Darwin. Now in its 30th year, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory's (MAGNT) annual Exit Art exhibition showcases the talents of promising students from across the Territory. Titled 'Your Best Australian Girl', Izzy's tongue-in-cheek self-portrait features a scarf made by her Filipino grandmother, a traditional Korean hat from her mother and an assortment of Asian and Western food products. ""I think the concept this year was about my identity and my culture. And then thinking about my culture, I'm just so disconnected from it,"" she said. ""Like, I don't know that language at all. I'm Korean and Filipino, and I didn't know that language or anything about it. And the only thing that connected me was food."" Izzy said the piece was also inspired by a song titled 'Your Best American Girl' by Japanese-American artist Mitski, which explores the concept of feeling like a foreigner in your own country. This balancing act between honouring family history and participating in mainstream Australian culture struck a chord among young artists and audiences in the Top End, according to exhibition coordinator Kellie Joswig. ""I think that there's fairly consistent themes that are presented, concerns about self-identity, cultural identity,"" she said. For other young artists, climate change was a hot topic. ""Some artists are really passionate about the environment and trying to express those ideas through their artwork through sustainability, the landscape and housing sustainability,"" she said. Teacher Sarah Taylor said her students held the Exit Art exhibition in high esteem. ""I brought both of my Year 12 art classes in and literally after seeing work in that space, they don't care about their grades — they care about getting into Exit Art,"" she said. ""It's just like the end game for them. And to see that their work is exhibited in that scenario, then it seems like we're not just painting and cutting out pieces of paper anymore. ""There is substance and it goes somewhere. It's not just to make something pretty, obviously.""

110,Courtney Act's new season of One Plus One,arts-culture," ABC Backstory Courtney Act is back to host a second season of One Plus One Author and drag performer Courtney Act, also known as Shane Jenek, brings her lens back to the ABC's One Plus One series for a second round of in-depth conversations with eight celebrities. The theme is ""fame"" and the first episode stars much-loved Australian comedian Mark Trevorrow – it's his first long-form interview in 40 years as himself. Most Australians would know Bob Downe, one of the most loved and enduring comedy characters created by Trevorrow. ""One of the first glimmers of queerness that I saw on Australian television was when Bob Downe was on Good Morning Australia with Bert Newton back in the 90s,"" Courtney recalls. A young Shane Jenek sought Trevorrow out when he first moved to Sydney from Brisbane at the age of 18, where they ended up performing on the same stages and becoming friends. ""I think Spicks and Specks was sort of the first thing he did as Mark,"" Courtney says, ""and that was a real liberating thing for him to do as himself without the guise of Bob."" One of the themes in this season of Courtney Act's One Plus One is navigating identity under the spotlight. It's something Courtney has dealt with as both Shane and Courtney, and something Trevorrow has also pondered – where does Mark end and Bob begin? ""Maybe both started off as characters, but then over time sort of merged with our own personalities,"" Courtney says. ""In the beginning, Courtney was a way for me to express femininity and to dress up in wonderful outfits in a socially acceptable way – but really, that's just who I am."" The guest list for the show is carefully selected by Courtney. Other interviewees who have grappled with gender, sexuality and identity in the public eye include transgender actor and activist Georgie Stone and gay professional Australian soccer player Josh Cavallo. Then there's author Renee McBryde, who shares a deeply personal story about being the daughter of a convicted murderer – a secret her mother made her keep. ""One Plus One is such a great opportunity to curate a list of people with different stories that I love and I think are great to amplify,"" Courtney says. Like talking to ""Tom Nash about his experience of being a DJ and also having a disability"" or ""Jay Laga'aia, who is famous from Playschool but also so many TV shows that we know and love, and hearing about his experience of race and the entertainment industry"". Going deep isn't a challenge for Courtney. ""I don't like small talk,"" she says, ""actually getting to have a real, proper conversation with someone is something I much prefer."" One of the things Courtney appreciates about the One Plus One format is that it's not a heavily produced show, so viewers are able to watch a real conversation. ""There's no gotcha moment, there's no agenda,"" she says. ""It's just a pleasant conversation with somebody. And in an anxiety-producing news cycle, it's kind of lovely just to watch two people enjoying each other's company."" ""All the people that I've spoken to for One Plus One are real outliers in that they're all people who didn't accept the status quo and defined who they were on who they really were,"" Courtney adds. ""I think there's something really exciting and empowering and beautiful about that."" Courtney is passionate about spreading awareness of difference – leading to acceptance. That's something she hopes to achieve through these conversations. ""I've been an advocate of being yourself and expressing yourself however that might manifest in you,"" she says. ""The ABC tells so many wonderful stories that are different to the experience that many people have lived, and I think through that we get to foster a sense of empathy, and more patience and more acceptance of people who are different and have different experiences. ""I think that's so important right now because there's something lovely in understanding that our similarities are greater than our differences in those situations.""

112,'He can smell the gunpowder': Podcaster's Bonegilla series charts life after horrors of war,arts-culture,"  Bonegilla Migrant Camp stories are those of escaping war, finding a new life in Australia World War II survivor Manfred Reich was in an underground bunker, fearing for his life, when only 50 metres away Adolf Hitler shot himself, ending an era of war. ""[During the war] he was bombed and shot at,"" Manfred's son Simon Reich said, recounting the stories his father told. Simon has spent countless hours turning stories such as this into a podcast titled Up from the Rubble. ""Just getting him to answer questions was such an emotional time,"" he said, sparking an interest in collecting the stories of others. After receiving a grant through the Community Broadcasting Foundation through Albury-Wodonga's 2REM station, Mr Reich is now producing a second podcast series focusing on the Bonegilla Migrant Camp, 12 kilometres from Wodonga in north-east Victoria, where his father went through. ""When he came out from Germany in 1958 he went straight to the camp,"" Mr Reich said. ""Albury, Wodonga, Wangarata, all the north-east of Victoria is peppered with migrants from war-torn Europe."" So far Mr Reich has sat down with and interviewed around 40 people, including the story of 84-year-old Nancy, born in Malta. ""I remember the war,"" she told Mr Reich during one of the podcast episodes. ""I was young but I remember a lot of it."" ""Airplanes, bombing crashing, running to the shelter. My father working, digging for the dead bodies because he never wanted to fight. ""It was hard."" Mr Reich said it was important to gather firsthand stories before they were gone forever. ""I think it's great to capture these stories before the people aren't able to tell them anymore, we're getting to the end of some of their time here on Earth,"" he said. ""The stories are incredible. They're either heartbreaking or as funny as can be."" He said recent events in history, through Russia's invasion of the Ukraine, has had an impact on survivors of war, like his father, bringing up memories from their past. ""My dad's feeling a little bit overawed with it all. He says he can smell the dust and the gunpowder and hear the rubble and everything again,"" Mr Reich said. ""It's been 80 years nearly since the war finished and its the same things over again."" The documentary series will be aired on 2REM before being released as a six-part podcast series and finding a home at the Bonegilla Migrant Experience and Albury Library Museum.

113,The light fantastic: Former printery at Queen’s Wharf to become canvas for digital projection project ,arts-culture,"  Brisbane's Queen's Wharf to feature digital artwork by Alinta Krauth and Jason Nelson One of the public artworks to be installed as part of the $3.6 billion Queen's Wharf Brisbane project has been unveiled. The heritage-listed The Printery Office, which was purpose-built in 1874 to print and maintain Queensland government documents, will become a giant canvas for 52 different digital light projections, one for every week of the year. Created by Queensland husband and wife projection art duo Alinta Krauth and Jason Nelson, the artworks will be beamed onto the northern face of the building. Called A Cottage Year, Ms Krauth said the digital art time machine was ""an artistic flashback to the environment of the Brisbane Commandant's Cottage in the early 1850s and '60s, around the time it was demolished to make way for The Printery Office"". ""Using climate, weather and other historical environmental data from those last years of the cottage's life, the digital projections will be like a portal to the cottage's past and its surrounding area,"" she said. ""There will also be an augmented reality artwork in its own right, where visitors can explore the courtyard's history even further."" Ms Krauth and Mr Nelson live in the Scenic Rim and have exhibited across the world in countries such as Germany, America, Ireland and Norway. Mr Nelson said it was ""wonderful to be part of this cultural focus happening in our own backyard"". ""Usually, this kind of artwork is temporary. Around the world you see examples of digital art on giant screens or buildings like in Times Square or at festivals. They show up for a short time, then are gone,"" he said. ""This opportunity in Brisbane is rare. It's permanent, public, working with a heritage-listed building, and with the Olympics coming, it's such a privilege to be involved."" Royal Historical Society of Queensland's Dean Prangley said The Printery Office building had also housed a science centre, the state's Births, Deaths and Marriages registry and would soon be a hub of dining and entertainment. ""This is a perfect example of how to preserve the past by using the present,"" he said. One of Australia's most highly regarded art figures, Philip Bacon AO, who leads the Queen's Wharf specialist artistic advisory panel, said heritage buildings were preserved at great cost, ""so the art must be an appropriate complement"". ""The vision for The Printery Office and courtyard area is for a beautiful and active location that will appeal to locals and draw visitors from around the country and the world,"" Mr Bacon said. ""A large, static artwork would be an impediment to the flow of people traffic but A Cottage Year, while not only stunning of itself, will amplify the ambience and magic of the location."" The first of the site's signature artworks was announced in February. It will be an eight-metre high, eight-tonne bronze sculpture by world renowned artist Lindy Lee, to sit at the George Street entrance of the resort precinct. A supersized, mosaic wall mural of Australian lungfish by local artist Samuel Tupou was revealed in April. The digital artwork will be in place for the development's planned staged opening from the second half of 2023.

114,"How singing helped this farmer connect after drought, divorce and a mouse plague",arts-culture,"  How Sing Australia's choir collective helps to improve mental health and wellbeing in regional communities Can singing in a choir improve your mental health? This was the question Dubbo farmer Steve Aughey asked when he joined Sing Australia, a national collective of community choir groups. Years of drought, divorce, and a mouse plague had taken its toll. ""Once you start singing, the notes take over your problems,"" Mr Aughey said. ""The important thing was it had no audition; that was my social start in Dubbo."" There is plethora of research to show that pairing music and lived experience opens up a range of opportunities to process grief and difficult emotions. The University of Melbourne's head of music therapy, Professor Katrina Skewes McFerran, says that singing as part of a group is key. ""Singing together as a choir is quite different to any benefits that you may experience from singing on your own,"" she said. ""When you sing with people, you connect to them through the notes and harmonies, through the rhythm."" In fact, the neurochemicals released in the brain while singing in a group are reminiscent of the experience of falling in love. ""Singing does give you a good buzz and I'm certainly not very flash at it, but I enjoy it,"" Mr Aughey said. A key element of Sing Australia's mission is to include everyone. Michele Peak is the leader of Sing Australia's Dubbo chapter and encourages anyone to join in, regardless of their ability. ""If you can talk, then you can sing,"" Ms Peak said. ""When we sing together it brings out emotions and memories, [and singing with] someone … it [builds] a deeper connection."" The conductor of Sing Australia Dubbo, Bob Lloyd, was amazed at how much his mental health improved being a part of a singing group. ""When I first started it was at the end of my teaching career,"" he said. ""I had a number of medical ailments as well as anxiety and depression. ""I found Sing Australia as an outlet to help me feel a part of a group and also to just let go and feel a bit silly at times."" For Steve Aughey, the weekly Monday night catch-ups are also a good opportunity to get off the farm, relax, and have a yarn. ""Everyone supports each other if they're going through a rough patch,"" he said. ""They're a good group; it is just like a family."" This small documentary is part of an impact campaign, connected to the ABC six-part series Space 22, that aims to connect people with accessible creative exercises and programs to improve mental wellbeing.

115,"Part way up Everest, Finch wrote his invention was 'no longer laughed at' — the puffer jacket turns 100",arts-culture,"  From the slopes of Mount Everest to the streets of Hobart: The humble puffer jacket turns 100 On the slopes of Mount Everest 100 years ago, George Finch, from Orange in the central west of New South Wales, revealed his latest invention to his fellow adventurers. ""Finch, who had a scientific brain, invented a wonderful green quilted eiderdown suit of aeroplane fabric. Not a particle of wind could get through,"" expedition photographer John Noel wrote. What the photographer had witnessed was the birth of the puffer jacket. Today, jackets lined with duck down or a synthetic alternative are some of the most popular and common items of winter clothing out there. They're everywhere, from the streets of Hobart to the Met Gala in New York. But in 1922, Finch's bright green coat — made from the skin of a hot air balloon and stuffed with eiderdown — drew sneers from the English climbers in his group. Wearing anything other than jumpers, scarves and Tweed was seen as unfair and un-British. ""They have contrived the most wonderful apparatus that will make you die of laughing,"" wrote one. ""I always knew the fellow was a shit,"" remarked another. Later on, high in the Himalayas when everyone else was freezing in their Tweed, Finch wrote: ""Everybody now envying … my eiderdown coat, and it is no longer laughed at."" Finch was ahead of his time, but he understood the power of duck down. ""When you think about the ducks that are flying along at 100 miles an hour and they drop down into that freezing cold water, it's the down, the insulation, that keeps them from freezing to death,"" said Jeff Sadler from The Quilt and Pillow Factory in Hobart. It's those tiny feathers that form a thin layer on the underside of the bird that can keep a person alive on Everest. ""And it's so light! Being a bird of flight, it needs to be aerodynamic as well."" Other natural fibres keep you warm, but as Mr Sadler explained, none fill a jacket or quilt and wrap around you in the way down does. ""With wool or synthetics, they're usually laid in a mat,"" he said. ""So they lay over you, instead of snuggling around you."" If cared for, good quality duck down doesn't lose its fluffiness. The Quilt and Pillow Factory has been cleaning and repairing the same down products for over 20 years. ""It's the only product you can bring back to its original state,"" Mr  Sadler said. For much of the 20th century, puffer jackets were worn only by polar explorers and mountaineers. ""It used to be quite an elitist item of clothing that was quite expensive,"" Kathmandu chief Reuben Casey said. ""I think as production has improved in Asia and other places, it's become quite accessible to people."" Once in reach of the average person, they realised just how good they are. ""You can pack it up when you're travelling to a cold climate, pull it out of your bag and away you go,"" Mr Casey said. ""It keeps you warm when you're watching the footy, or the kids play sport, or you're out for a walk. ""It's just a staple of everyday life now."" The black puffer jacket has been big business for Kathmandu, particularly over the last 10 years. ""We've had a lot of success with the black puffer jacket,"" Mr Casey said. ""It's what we're famous for, what we're known for."" But with success comes competition, and there are now dozens of brands on the market. That has led to increased demand for down, and animal welfare groups have raised concerns about how that demand is met. Of particular concern is the reported live-plucking of ducks by some suppliers, particularly in Asia. Mr Casey said his company did not use live-plucked down and sourced their fibres from birds destined for the meat market. ""One hundred per cent of our down is responsibly sourced,"" he said. ""It's not as if we produce down specifically for the jackets: it's a by-product. ""As long as that [duck meat] stays popular, there will be a lot of down produced."" Many of the big brands now offer synthetic alternatives to down jackets. While these have some advantages, such as being more water-resistant, they are often expensive, heavy, and do not offer the same warmth. ""They are improving, and there are some very good ones out there,"" explained Barbara Matthews from Recycled Recreation. ""I would think that down is here to stay, and you can't really beat that, but there are definitely ethical concerns. ""In the old days, every piece of equipment you got was good quality, but now it's a lot harder to source and it's very expensive."" For those worried about how their jacket is made, she recommended avoiding cheaper products, which were more likely to use low-grade, unethical down. Otherwise, there's recycling. ""So, getting second-hand product is great. Obviously learning how to care for it properly, cleaning it, washing it, patching it if it gets holes."" If looked after, Ms Matthews said there was no reason why a puffer, based on Finch's design, will not still be around in another 100 years.

116,Do you love listening to sad songs? Here's why,arts-culture,"  Sad music can bring us to tears, yet we enjoy listening to it. These people have been trying to work out why US author Susan Cain is a big fan of sadness. More specifically, she is deeply interested in sad music, and the ""mysterious and seemingly paradoxical"" joy or pleasure that it can elicit. Ms Cain has been trying to understand why sad music – that of Leonard Cohen, for example – moves her more than other kinds. Understanding it has been made trickier by a certain stigma around sadness. We tend to shy away from sad emotions as if they're something to be ashamed of, Ms Cain argues. ""We all know that life contains these two poles of joy and sorrow and everything in between … and yet, we're not supposed to talk about one half of our emotional experience,"" she tells ABC RN's Life Matters. But in a world filled with ""toxic positivity"", she says exploring feelings of ""sadness or heartache or longing"" is not just OK – it's essential to living a full and meaningful life. When Ms Cain listens to melancholic music, it doesn't make her feel sad. Rather, the music gives her a ""sense of connection"" to others. It inspires feelings of ""love and gratitude"" to the musician or music ""for being able to transform what obviously began in sorrow into something that's beautiful and even transcendent"". Life Matters is here to help you get a handle on all the important stuff: love, sex, fitness, health, parenting, career, finances and family. The human ability to ""transform pain into beauty"" is, she says, ""the mystery of sad music"". She's been thinking about it for decades – and she's not alone. Plenty of research has been devoted towards understanding the connection between music and sorrow. Ms Cain points to research by MIT economist Karol J Borowiecki, who studied the letters of Beethoven, Mozart, and Liszt to figure out how happy or sad they were. He then correlated those letters with the pieces of music they were producing at that time. ""[Professor Borowiecki] found that the deeper pieces of music, the ones that are considered by music historians to be their greatest, tended to be written during times of sorrow,"" Ms Cain says. He wrote that the research offered insight into ""how negative emotions can provide fertile material upon which the creative person [can] draw"". Australian singer-songwriter Kate K-S says some of her songs are so sad she cried while writing them. She's chosen to put many difficult or sad moments in her life to music, and says she finds the process ""extremely cathartic"". It can be for those who listen, too. ""It is a common thing that people will say after a gig that at a certain moment I brought them to tears,"" Ms K-S says. She believes that's because audiences ""feel seen"" in those sad songs. ""Sadness becomes a comfort for some people,"" Ms K-S says. ""People realise, oh, it's not only me that feels like this. Someone else feels like this. ""It's sharing an experience."" The question of why people might enjoy listening to sorrowful music has also been contemplated by researchers and thinkers, dating as far back as Aristotle. Like Ms Cain, Emery Schubert, a professor of music at the University of New South Wales, has also been pondering the question for decades. For years, he too considered people's enjoyment of sad music to be a strange paradox. Lately, though, he's begun to change his thinking. ""It's a more complex story,"" he says now, suggesting that the apparent conflict of enjoying sad music might, in fact, be overblown. Understanding why music has such an impact on our emotions means you can unlock the best way to use it for healing after a break-up. ""We actually are not these simple, linear creatures that just say, 'I enjoy this music [and] it is sad, what a paradox'. ""I don't think that's how humans work,"" he says. Rather, Professor Schubert argues that ""different classes of experience that can occur in parallel"". We can experience multiple feelings and emotions at the same time, he says. ""It's not a big deal, because we're complex humans"". Perhaps, then, the question should be, why does music make us feel anything at all? Professor Schubert points to the work of music psychology professor Patrik Juslin, considered by many to be the world's number one music researcher. According to Professor Juslin, there are seven ways music makes us feel something, explains Professor Schubert. One is music's contagious effect, whereby you ""catch"" whatever it is expressing simply by listening to it, ""just like you catch a cold"", he says. Another is music's ability to evoke a certain memory, and the emotions attached to that memory. Conditioning is yet another way music can make us feel. ""In Western culture we learn that something in the minor key, minor mode, generally sounds sadder than something in the major key,"" Professor Schubert explains. Well, not according to early 18th century philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. Professor Schubert says Schopenhauer and other great philosophers argued all arts forms other than music ""represent something about the human world"" and ""remind us of these real-life situations"". They believed music, on the other hand, ""is the only art form that does not need to represent. It can just exist in this sound form"", Professor Schubert says. Ms K-S says another thing that can set music apart from, say, visual arts, is that it's often created in a group. Seeing or hearing ""exceptional musicians, real masters of their instrument"" perform together creates ""moments of synergy … with a lot of emotion"", she says. ""It's extremely powerful."" Ms Cain is clear to distinguish sadness or melancholy from depression or clinical depression. The distinction she draws is a feeling of ""happy melancholy"" or a ""bittersweet"" state. Indeed, the title of her latest book exploring this topic is Bittersweet: How Sorrow and Longing make us Whole. Ms Cain believes there is pleasure to be derived from the ""recognition that light and dark, joy and sorrow [and] bitter and sweet are always and forever paired"". ""There's just an inherent impermanence to everything and everyone that we love most."" And with the awareness of that state comes ""a really deep and piercing joy at the beauty of the world"", she says. ""Transforming pain into beauty"" is ""redemptive"", Ms Cain says – and ""at the heart of everything"", including music. ""The joyful side of ourselves, that takes care of itself. That part's easy,"" she says. ""It's the pain part that's tricky."" Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.

118,Former deputy premier Jackie Trad appointed to chair of HOTA,arts-culture,"  Former deputy premier Jackie Trad appointed to chair of Gold Coast's Home of the Arts precinct Jackie Trad says she has the full confidence of Gold Coast City Council as the new chairperson for the Home of the Arts but has declined to comment on her efforts to suppress an unrelated Crime and Corruption Commission report. Ms Trad served in senior ministerial roles in the state Labor government, including as treasurer and deputy premier, before losing her Brisbane seat in the 2020 election. In March, it was revealed that Ms Trad had taken action in the Supreme Court to have a Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) report withheld from public release. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk later confirmed taxpayers are paying all or some of Ms Trad's legal costs. But Labor members of a parliamentary committee last week blocked the opposition's attempts to release details of those costs as the matter was still ""under investigation"". ""I can't go into those specific matters,"" Ms Trad said. ""But I can say that I am very confident that the Gold Coast City Council have given me their vote of confidence in taking on this role."" It is not known whether the CCC report makes any findings against Ms Trad. When asked if the public can have confidence in her credibility, Ms Trad said the council-owned Home of the Arts (HOTA) ""will be managed as expertly as it has been"". ""HOTA is expected to break even this year,"" she said. ""Its ratio of self-funded operations is actually increasing and more than 600,000 people, local as well as from right across the region, have come to HOTA so far this year."" Ms Trad's appointment comes after difficult 12 months since HOTA's gallery opened in 2021, with COVID disrupting staffing, visitation numbers and operating hours. The first phase of a confidential review into HOTA's operation was considered by councillors during a closed meeting earlier this month, which includes the management of its $37 million outdoor stage. The $60.5 million gallery was also drawn into an unusual public debate in April, after Mayor Tom Tate's spiritual adviser described HOTA as a ""demonic stronghold"" which had been the site of a ""spiritual battle"". Mr Tate said he had a great working relationship with Ms Trad during her time as deputy premier and that her appointment as chair came ""with great excitement"". He said HOTA's masterplan aims to develop digital exhibitions along with a new theatre complex. ""With technology now, we want to include a gallery/digital museum,"" Mr Tate said. ""[On] the Gold Coast, we do things a bit different, but it'll be a niche market where [an]other gallery hasn't offered."" Ms Trad said that ""it's now time we took it to this next stage"" and expand HOTA's outdoor recreational space and live performances. ""The masterplan is incredibly exciting,"" she said. ""HOTA will get bigger and it will absolutely get better now that we're post-COVID."" Ms Trad will work with state and federal governments for HOTA's expansion. ""Labor has had an agenda around more funding for arts; I know HOTA and the City of Gold Coast is absolutely competitive in that."" The ABC understands HOTA's chair receives a salary of less than $30,000 a year. Ms Trad was directly appointed to the role by the council's chief executive Tim Baker after working on the board under acting chair Kate Brennan for the past six months.

119,Bronze monuments honour Indigenous women who 'really looked at what family life was about',arts-culture,"  Kurnai Aboriginal matriarchs of Jackson's Track to be celebrated by new monument in Drouin park When artist Rebecca Vandyk-Hamilton first came to Aunty Cheryl Drayton with the idea of creating a bronze monument of her relatives, the Kurnai elder was apprehensive. ""I put the idea to [Aunty Cheryl], and her first thoughts were ... 'we don't make monuments … that's not how we remember people',"" Ms Vandyk-Hamilton said. But the artist soon got Aunty Cheryl and other Kurnai elders and families excited to commemorate these matriarchs in a permanent way. The monument of Kurnai women Euphemia Mullet Tonkin, Dorothy Hood and Regina Rose is set to be created this year in a park in Drouin, just east of Melbourne, along with a historical storytelling piece. ""There are less than five per cent of monuments and statues in Australia that commemorate real women, so how about we create something that's a good companion for [world renowned boxer] Lionel Rose in Warragul?"" Rebecca Vandyk-Hamilton said to Aunty Cheryl. Last Friday at the start of reconciliation week, Drouin residents went to the park to hear about the project from Aunty Cheryl, Ms Vandyk-Hamilton and local sculptor Jessie McLennan. About $155,000 was secured for this project through the Victorian Women in Public art grant, and another $40,000 through the Baw Baw Shire public art fund. If all goes to plan, the bronze sculpture will be installed in Drouin's civic park by the end of the year, standing almost two metres tall. ""This sculpture is going to be situated in a lovely little area at the towards the end of the park that is near the boardwalk, where people can come and look and meditate really,"" Ms McLennan said. Three of Aunty Cheryl's family members will be depicted in the monument: her mother Euphemia Mullet Tonkin holding a basket of washing, her grandmother Dorothy Hood with a bible and her Aunt Regina Rose shown playing a guitar. ""Those stories are important for people to know because that was their passion,"" Aunty Cheryl said. ""Aunty Gina was always on that guitar and entertaining the children and then my mother was passionate about [cleanliness] — because of kids being removed back then, and then my grandmother … she'd be listening to Billy Graham, and on a Sunday night service, and we all had to be quiet if we're at her house."" Aunty Cheryl said these three women guided the other women at Jackson's track and her grandmother Dorothy was instrumental in stopping family violence at the camp. ""Three great people who really looked at what family life was about and embedding that culture so that it didn't get lost,"" she said. Want more local news? Sign up to the weekly ABC Gippsland email newsletter Aunty Cheryl said the sculpture would create an ongoing legacy for these three women in the community. ""I think the community then take pride in the fact that they know that it is about their connections to country … and they can go on to strive to do the same sorts of things that they, their grandparents and, and great grandmother did,"" she said. Ms Vandyk-Hamilton said she had artist's nerves about making the end product as perfect as possible. ""This one is really important to me that it shows the stories of these three women in in the best possible light and creates conversations that will make a difference in the community,"" she said.

120,International travel ban overturned for competition-ready school student team,arts-culture,"  A group of Brisbane students who qualified for an international linguistics competition have been given an exemption to an overseas travel ban, but only some of the students will be able to go. Eight Brisbane State High School students were initially told they could not travel to the Isle of Man to compete at the International Linguistics Olympiad next month, due to a Queensland Department of Education ban, despite the federal government opening borders months ago. After the ABC covered the story earlier this month, the school was given an opportunity to apply for an exemption, which was granted, but only four of the students can go. The department's ban applies to all state school students, and had already prevented pupils from Mountain Creek, Merrimac and Worongary state high schools from attending a robotics championships in Texas this year. Independent schools were not required to adhere to the ban. When ABC Radio Brisbane asked the education department why the ban was still in place earlier this month, a spokesperson said they were working through ""issues related to COVID insurance and other matters"" to lift the restrictions ""as soon as it is responsible to do so"". Tory, a mother of one the Brisbane State High School students, said after being interviewed on ABC Radio Brisbane and ABC News, the department revealed the school could apply for an exemption. ""So, the school pulled out all the stops and did all they could to convince the education department to grant an exemption to these students, and finally on May 24, we were given the green light,"" she told ABC Radio Brisbane. ""Unfortunately, there were two teams that placed equal first in the competition from Brisbane State High School, and when the school initially declined the invitation to go to the international competition, the national organisers then naturally offered it to the third and fourth place. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. ""Unfortunately, the one spot then has to be shared amongst the Brisbane State High School teams."" An education department spokesperson said the department was still working through issues related to COVID-19 insurance and other matters in an effort to lift the restriction as soon as possible. ""While this process is ongoing, the department can provide exemptions on a case-by-case basis,"" the spokesperson said. ""To date only one school (BSHS to attend the International Linguistics Olympiad) has sought an exemption, and it has been granted based on certain conditions being met. ""The safety of students and staff will always be our number one priority.""

121,Recreating Grandma's styles for a new generation of knitters,arts-culture,"  National library trawls archive to recreate vintage knitting patterns for new crafters When the National Library of Australia (NLA) began digitising old newspapers and magazines and adding them to its database Trove, one search term was surprisingly popular. ""We started to notice that one of the subject headings that was most often targeted was knitting patterns,"" Kathryn Favelle, director of community engagement at the NLA told Christine Layton on ABC Radio Perth. ""What was happening was that a great online community of knitters was starting to dig into the old newspapers and magazines to find inspiration. ""We started looking and saying, 'What could we do with these knitting patterns and how could we bring them to a new audience?'. The result has been a book, Vintage Knits, recently released by NLA publishing, which has 25 knitting patterns from the 1930s, '40s and '50s as well as stories of the history of knitting. But Ms Favelle said creating the book wasn't as simple as copying the patterns directly from the archival material. ""Often in the old patterns only one size is provided in the newspaper or pattern book, we're used to now getting pattern books that offer you four, five or six sizes to choose from,"" she said. ""The knitters that they were publishing for knew how to knit and adjust [the size]. ""Most of us don't have that skill anymore, so Vintage Knits takes those old patterns and has adapted them for modern knitters and also gives us some tips and tricks for how we can make adjustments of our own."" When the book development first started, the NLA approached volunteer knitters to test the original patterns and made a surprising discovery. ""Their first attempt to knit these vintage patterns up, using the same ply wool and same-sized needles, often resulted in something that was much smaller than what we would be expecting for that pattern,"" she said. ""Everything was coming out smaller, shorter."" ""Whether that was an issue around the quality of the wool, or the fact that our body sizes have changed, and people are taller and wider, bigger in the shoulders than perhaps they were 50–60 years ago. We had to experiment with the pattern to see what would work and what would give a similar effect today."" Yarn has also changed, and many of the fibres and brands that were recommended almost 100 years ago are no longer available, while knitters now have many more options to choose from. Styles in those decades were also noticeably more fitted than modern day knitwear, she said. ""One of my favourites in the book is called the Margaret. It was created by a woman called Margaret Eaton and she was responding to a request from knitters for something that would replace a silk blouse."" Published in 1936, in the middle of the Depression, the pattern responded to tough times when readers may have been looking to reuse wool from an old garment and make something themselves. It's also fairly simple. ""One of the reasons why I like the Margaret is that it's in a very simple garter stitch. If you only know one stitch in knitting, garter stitch is the one that you learn first."" While it has traditionally been a women's craft, Ms Favelle said that men also had a long history of knitting and it had had a resurgence in popularity among all ages with the pandemic lockdowns. A little less than a year ago I was spending almost all of my downtime glued to my phone. ""We often think of knitting as being women's work and through the '20s, '30s and '40s women would have been the dominant household knitters,"" she said. ""But there is a long tradition of knitting by men; shepherds, farmers used to do their own knitting of Aran jumpers."" Like many people, Ms Favelle learned to knit at home as a child. ""I remember being nine years old and going into the local knitting shop at Top Ryde and choosing the wool and pattern for my first knitted jumper. It was such a special moment,"" she said. ""My grandmother used to to knit a lovely singlet for the new babies in the family, and I think it was probably her knitting that inspired me. But it was mum who taught me."" ABC Radio Perth listeners shared similar memories. Rosie: ""My father was in the navy in World War II and he taught me the basics of knitting. Mum couldn't knit to save herself."" Clare: ""My granny taught me to knit when I was four and then I stopped in my early twenties; but then picked it up again during lockdown in 2020."" Barb: ""I recall being so excited when my father came home from a trip and brought my sister I a ball of wool and knitting needles. I was probably about seven or eight years old. I made my husband-to-be a jumper in 1967 from good wool. He still wears it – the only repairs needed are around the cuffs!"" While she still knits, Ms Favelle said these days she often prefers looser styles that require less precision, and said there were many how-to videos online to help beginners get started. ""It's for everyone and it's great that it's really been embraced through the long period of lockdowns and uncertainty as we've looked for new ways of doing things, new things to do with our hands. ""Knitting is really great for keeping your mind busy and your hands busy.""

122,"When Debi Marshall began investigating the Family Court murders, she received a chilling warning",arts-culture,"  Debi Marshall was warned against investigating the Family Court murders. Years later, she's still chasing answers Don't prod that snake. That was the warning given to me by the late New South Wales coroner, Kevin Waller, in 2013 when I told him I was writing a book on the Family Court murders. ""Make no mistake,"" he warned me. ""The prime suspect is still a free man. This story could get you killed."" I knew from my research that this was not an idle warning. The story of the Family Court bombings and murders — an unrelenting crime spree in Sydney in the early 1980s which hit at the heart of our judicial system and left three dead, dozens seriously wounded, and still more who miraculously escaped death — was not one I could ignore. Even more incredible was that, more than three decades on, these were the coldest of unsolved cases — despite overwhelming circumstantial evidence and a blood group that matched the prime suspect, fireman Leonard Warwick. A vengeful litigant in the revolutionary new Family Court formed under the Whitlam government, Warwick had engaged in a bitter battle with his former wife, Andrea, for custody of their young daughter Trudi. I started researching the cases in 2012 at Channel 7's Sunday Night program. My first approach was to Warwick at his home outside Sydney. I was alone and, in no uncertain terms, he ordered me off his rural property. That walk back down his driveway, during which I prayed he would not shoot me in the back, was the longest of my life. In hindsight, this was the day Warwick went on high alert that his days of freedom were numbered. Leonard John Warwick, who was last month found guilty of three murders and a series of court-related bombings in Sydney in the 1980s, will die in prison after being sentenced to life without parole. I was on high alert, too. I had prodded that snake. Would the snake now strike me? But I couldn't turn away. I tracked down Warwick's former wife Andrea and daughter Trudi, as well as other victims and their families, and witnesses. Every person I spoke to claimed they had not heard from NSW police for more than 30 years. Each was still terrorised by the thought that the Family Court killer would return. The journey into the dark heart of these stories was so surreal that I struggled to believe it had happened in my country and my lifetime. I had held the hand of Justice David Opas' widow, Kristen, as she wept while recounting how she tried to save her husband after he was shot at point blank range at their courtyard gate. I also held the hand of Joy Wykes, widow of Graham who was killed by a bomb explosion as he bent to pray at a Jehovah's Witness service. After my story aired, NSW Police formed a taskforce to re-examine the cases. By now, the Family Court victims had lost all faith in the police and judicial system. I understood that only too well. My own interest in true crime and justice was accelerated by the murder of my partner Ron Jarvis in 1992 and my pursuit of his killer, Stephen Standage. Ron was just 37 when he was shot in remote Tasmanian bushland. His body was not found for seven months, during which time I went after Standage and he, in return, went after me, threatening that if I didn't back off I would end up wearing cement boots. Standage murdered another man, John Thorn, in identical circumstances a decade after killing Ron. It was his undoing. It had taken 22 years to bring Standage to court, where he was sentenced to a record 48 years' imprisonment. In my victim impact statement, I told him I hoped he would never again see the sky as a free man. My book, The Family Court Murders, was published in 2014. Months later, in July 2015, Warwick was finally charged. When I received news of his arrest, I was at the hospital with my greatest supporter, my beautiful 86-year-old mother, Monnie, who had suffered a stroke. ""That's wonderful news, darling,"" she said, when I told her what had happened. They were the last words she spoke to me. Monnie died a week later. The Family Court Murders is a story that bears all the hallmarks of a crime thriller: a serial killer in a cat and mouse chase with police and judiciary; a changing modus operandi of guns and bombs; a stalker who hunted his hunters. But tragically, this is not fiction. At its heart is the story of a man who stopped at nothing to achieve his ends. His victims were simply collateral damage. The centrepiece of his abuse, of course, was Andrea, whom he violently assaulted, stalked and harassed. The price she paid to stop the murders was a heartbreaking sacrifice that no woman, no victim of domestic abuse, should ever have to pay. So how did Warwick, who consistently and brazenly flouted Family Court orders, outwit both state and federal police for more than three decades? Why was he not charged in the 1980s when so much evidence was stacked against him? What happened to his sister, Eileen, who has not been seen since 1965? Warwick was charged but found not guilty for the shooting murder of his brother-in-law, Stephen Blanchard. If he didn't kill him, who did? I interrogate these and so many other questions in my new four-episode investigation on ABC TV. But what is not in question is that, like Stephen Standage, Leonard Warwick will never again see the sky as a free man. I called Kristen Opas the day Warwick was sentenced. She cried with relief. ""That's wonderful news, darling,"" she said.

123,"Homestead linked to Dorothea Mackellar finally heritage-listed, but is that enough to protect it?",arts-culture,"  Dorothea Mackellar-linked Kurrumbede homestead heritage-listed near Gunnedah A historic homestead built in north-west New South Wales by the family of famed Australian poet Dorothea Mackellar has been heritage-listed after a three-year campaign. The Mackellar family built Kurrumbede, near Gunnedah, in the early 20th century. Historians say the poet was a frequent visitor to the property and used the surrounding scenery as inspiration for much of her work. But a local historical society was alarmed that the expansion of a nearby coal mine could pose a threat to the homestead, due to the potential effects of coal dust and underground blasting. Dorothea Mackellar Memorial Society president Philippa Murray said the property would be ""right on the lip"" of Whitehaven Coal's Vickery mine once it was expanded. ""I'm confident that now we have an added layer of protection,"" Ms Murray said. ""It does give the property owner, Whitehaven, access to heritage grants for restoration, so that is a good thing and we hope they would take advantage of it."" A spokesperson for Whitehaven Coal said it had committed long ago to preserving Kurrumbede, including investing $500,000 to upgrade the gardens, and opening the homestead to the public last year. ""Regardless of formal heritage status, working to preserve this special property for future generations is business as usual for us,"" the spokesperson said. The company's managing director Paul Flynn had previously said plans to extend the Vickery mine were ""consistent with the preservation of the homestead"". The memorial society had campaigned for the property's inclusion on the heritage register for about three years and had multiple meetings with NSW Environment Minister James Griffin. Ms Murray said Whitehaven Coal was initially reluctant to support its inclusion. ""But thank you to them, they've come to the party and realised that there is a groundswell of public opinion for it,"" she said. She said the profile of Dorothea Mackellar meant the property was of national significance. ""She encapsulated the Australian countryside, I think like no one else has done since,"" she said. Tamworth MP Kevin Anderson supported the campaign and said it was a fine addition to the prominence of Dorothea Mackellar. ""This is something very, very special for Gunnedah,"" Mr Anderson said.

124,"Most international festivals don't want to work with her anymore, but this Russian artist has left a message of peace in Brisbane",arts-culture,"  Looking at Viktoria Veisbrut's newest mural you would never guess her home country was at war. Stylised versions of popular cartoon characters mingle with Ms Veisbrut's own imagined characters, relaxing, hanging out, and getting along. Earlier this month, the Russian artist travelled to Australia for the Brisbane Street Art Festival, where, amid her country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, she painted her vision for a better world on a wall at Brisbane's Howard Smith Wharves. ""It's kind of my dream, when people from different parts of the world can be just friends — and in general like countries — can be just friends,"" she said. ""They're just hanging out together, having fun, enjoying their life how they want to."" It is a utopian vision crystallised by Russia's conflict with Ukraine, which has changed her whole life. ""There [Ukraine] is completely nightmare,"" she said. ""Almost all people in Russia have relatives and people who they love in Ukraine — so it's sad and bad."" Ms Veisbrut said the invasion took her friends and family by surprise. ""It started very quick — and we didn't know,"" she said. ""I just think that it's kind of crazy what happened in the 21st century."" Ms Veisbrut said it was a miracle she was able to secure a visa to Australia given the international backlash to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""A lot of my friends lost their jobs in a week, maybe, after, because they were working for foreign companies who declined to work with us,"" she said. ""Now it looks like a little bit apocalyptic … you go to the mall and all of these shops are closed, closed, closed."" She said most international festivals no longer want to work with her. With her bank card blocked in most countries, she cannot display her work in foreign galleries either. Ms Veisbrut's visa was approved on the day she was scheduled to travel to Australia – and she still cannot believe she had the opportunity to travel. ""It's a miracle that I get a visa here. I'm so happy for that,"" she said. Festival director Lincoln Savage said organisers reconsidered whether Ms Veisbrut should be allowed to join the festival after the invasion. ""In the end, we decided that it wasn't our place restrict an artist who has no involvement,"" he said. ""We want opportunities for people, and maybe it's a good chance for dialogue to be opened. ""I think it was good to kind of have a connection in a time like this, when potentially a lot of doors are closing, and a dialogue is difficult to have. ""Art is something that, I think, needs to be free."" He said the mural was ""clearly a very happy, positive, colourful work — and that is everything that Viktoria does."" Plenty of locals urged Ms Veisbrut to move to Australia while she was in Brisbane for the festival. ""Already here a few people told me, 'Yeah, come move to Australia — good place, it's perfect,'"" she said. But she returned to Russia last week. ""I'm not sure that I'm ready and want to leave my home,"" she said. ""I was grown there.

125,Fight to save a piece of Redcliffe foreshore history crumbling to the elements,arts-culture,"  Fight to save Suttons Beach pavilion, a landmark on the Redcliffe foreshore neglected for decades For anyone under the age of 85, the Suttons Beach pavilion has always been a feature of the Redcliffe foreshore. But after years of neglect and exposure to the elements, the bayside landmark could vanish. The historic building faces demolition, with concerns raised about its structural integrity. On Wednesday, Moreton Bay Regional Council will vote to award a tender for ""invasive testing"" to work out how much, if any, of the pavilion can be preserved. Council will then decide whether to restore the existing structure or knock it down and rebuild it. Residents gathered at Suttons Beach on Sunday, pinning ribbons to the fences around the now-closed pavilion. What started as a Facebook group has snowballed into a legal entity, the Save Suttons Beach Pavilion Preservation Group, complete with its own logo and merchandise. ""It literally is the last standing piece of history here in Redcliffe,"" Jodie Starr, president of the Save Suttons Beach Pavilion Preservation group, told reporters. ""So when this came about I was like, 'no way, I'm not going to see another piece of our history torn down,'"" Ms Starr said. Built in 1937, the Suttons Beach pavilion has had many lives, hosting dances during World War II and later the Miss Australia carnival. Originally comprising a kiosk, showers and change rooms, the building eventually became a museum and most recently, a restaurant. But after several renovations and extensions, little remains of the building's 1937 fabric. The current ""art deco"" appearance of the building is the product of an early 2000s facelift, according to a report to council. It stated the works ""extensively, unsympathetically and irreversibly"" altered the building. ""It's like chalk and cheese,"" Moreton Bay Mayor Peter Flannery said, admitting the council had to ""take some responsibility"" for the building's run-down state. He said commercial tenants did not carry out maintenance they were meant to under lease agreements. ""Council didn't jump on them and force that to be done,"" Cr Flannery said. The building has an issue with water from the cliffs coming through the walls and into the slab of the older pavilion. Cracked and crumbling concrete has been observed in parts of the building. However, an engineering report to council in 2020 concluded the structure posed ""no immediate risk of failure"". The report recommended more testing of the concrete slab to gauge its future life expectancy before council committed to a significant redevelopment. The fight to save the pavilion has attracted support within council, with division six councillor Karl Winchester addressing residents. ""Residents quite rightly see this as a line in the sand for our community,"" he said. Mr Winchester is advocating for money to be put aside in next month's council budget towards either a restoration or rebuild. ""It's not necessarily going to be the entirety of the work required here, but we need to have a funding commitment clearly in our budget document,"" he said. ""Ratepayers expect us to do the right thing by this building."" The mayor would not put a figure on the potential cost of restoration but said a rebuild was likely in the tens of millions. Newly re-elected local MP, the LNP's Luke Howarth, had secured a $5 million funding commitment from the previous federal government. While federal Labor made no commitment, Mr Howarth said he would continue to lobby for Commonwealth funding. ""It should be a bipartisan issue,"" Mr Howarth said. ""Without state or federal funding, [the restoration or rebuild] would take so much longer to be done."" Mr Howarth also called on the state Labor government to stump up funding. The member for Redcliffe, Yvette D'Ath, could not be reached for comment today but previously said it was a council issue. Heritage architect Andrew Ladlay wants to see the building conserved in some form. ""Anything can be repaired,"" he told the ABC. ""It's been expanded quite a bit to the point where it's hard to recognise the original building. But originality isn't always important when it comes to cultural significance."" There's now been a proposal for the nearby Redcliffe Peninsula Surf Lifesaving Club to move into the pavilion. The council has signed a non-binding statement of intent with the club, exploring its potential to manage the building. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. ""As a community not-for-profit organisation, the Club sees significant potential benefits for its members and the broader community,"" the statement read. But not everyone's on board. Local June McCrorie said she wanted the charm of the old English-style bathing pavilion to be maintained. ""We've got beautiful surf clubs but we don't want another one with pokies,"" she said. The speeches on Sunday ended with a poem written by long-time local Rupert McCall. ""When the walls of history crack, once the soul is taken, you don't ever get it back. ""To sacrifice a monument always leaves a scar, because every time we lose one, we lose part of who we are.""

127,Getting up close to tiny creatures,arts-culture,"  Macrophotography of insects, spiders puts new perspective on tiny creatures When Flynn Prall started working in the bush all day as a trainee conservationist, he began to take notice of the tiny creatures around him. He was so intrigued that when his day job with Mandurah council finished he'd head back to the bush — but this time with his trusty camera in hand. His fascination with insects peaked when he spent hours watching a white-tailed spider try many different methods to trick a black spider to come out of its web. ""I realised there's a lot more to these things,"" the 25-year-old said. A usual day for Mr Prall and his friends is picking a piece of bushland they've never been to, walking the trails, and then scanning the grounds and branches in the hope of finding some insects ready for their close-up photo shoot. All these insects are visible to the naked eye, but Mr Prall said his magnified lens showed people a new perspective. ""All of them usually are [visible], but a lot of the details you can see in my photos are not,"" he said. ""It's really cool to hear from people that because of my photos they don't kill spiders anymore."" Not only do Mr Prall's photos catch the eyes of ordinary people, but they're also helpful to science. ""A lot of the time you go out and you take a photo of something, you'll come back and send it to a few groups of scientists, and half the time no-one's seen it before,"" he said. ""It's always awesome when you send a photo off to a scientist and they respond in all capitals freaking out."" Just recently, this was the case with a photo Mr Prall took of a peacock spider, which he describes as his favourite encounter. Another spider enthusiast James McMulkin and Mr Prall sent their photos through to biologist and peacock spider expert Jurgen Otto, who confirmed the species Maratus nubilis had not yet been identified. Mr Prall said peacock spiders could be found all over Western Australia. ""We've got peacock spiders in our sand dunes, one [species] that's only found on Bluff Knoll, which is around 1,000 metres above sea level, which is just nuts,"" he said. ""Now my friends and I are heading up to Kalbarri to find one that's only found at Nature's Window — so they're just everywhere."" Mr Prall said his macrophotography helped scientists who couldn't visit the bushlands. ""Anyone can really help, you've just got to walk into local bushland and see what you can find,"" he said. Recently two other new species of peacock spiders were discovered by citizens who unintentionally came across them in Western Australia's south. Paul Winthrop, a construction planner, was searching for spider orchids between Margaret River and Nannup when he got distracted by a weevil. Next thing he knew a tiny little insect jumped at him. Mr Winthrop crouched down to check it out and when he realised it could be a peacock spider he snapped a photo and posted it onto a peacock spider social media group. Within the hour Dr Otto had contacted Mr Winthrop telling him he had discovered a new species – Maratus pinniger. Mr Winthrop said it felt amazing to find out he'd discovered a previously unidentified species. ""I've been reading up on peacock spiders for the last year or so and spent a lot of time out in the bush looking for other things, so to find one and for it to be a new species was just fantastic,"" he said. Michelle Peak, a service station manager, was searching for a glimpse of a peacock spider, and on her third try she finally stumbled across one in Jalbarragup. Thrilled she got to see one, she snapped a photo only to find out she discovered a new species – Maratus candens. Ms Peak said she didn't believe she'd discovered a new species at first. ""It probably took a few days to properly sink in … but it was so exciting,"" she said. Dr Otto said the last season had been exceptionally productive thanks to four amateur photographers. ""Without them I would not have been able to photograph, film and describe a single new species in the last 12 months, let alone the three species that we ended up with,"" he said.

128,"It used to be hard for Joe to get onto comedy stages, so he's made his own",arts-culture,"  Comedian Joe White laughs about 'the heavy stuff' to highlight refugee stories When Joe White first came to Australia, he did not speak a lick of English. His only real cue to join conversations was when somebody asked him about the name he was given at birth — Tiluhun Hailu. It was hard for him to fit in with an unfamiliar name in a predominantly white school in Perth. ""When I was playing soccer in the [school's] youth group, the guys couldn't pronounce my name, but they needed a name to call so I'd pass the ball,"" he said. ""At the time I really liked this R&B singer named Joe who represented what I wanted to be: confident and cool."" As his Australian accent grew stronger, and because he was going by Joe, people he spoke to on the phone often assumed he was white. Since then, he's gone by the name Joe White. According to the comedian, his family have always told him he was funny. But his humour developed as a coping mechanism during the years of hardship his family faced after fleeing a violent civil war in Ethiopia to neighbouring Sudan. When he was seven years old his father abruptly left the family after a night of heavy drinking, leaving his mother to raise six kids alone. White said his father felt burdened by the devastation of losing everything he'd worked for in Ethiopia and resorted to alcoholism. ""He was not the loving father that we remembered anymore,"" he said. ""[Alcoholism] was his way of dealing with the demons that came with knowing you've just lost everything."" With seven mouths to feed and no income, White's mum applied to leave Africa entirely to ensure her kids a safer future in Australia. ""Our neighbour had mentioned that if she goes to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan, there is a United Nations Office where she can put her case forward and maybe get a go at a better life,""  White said. His family waited four years before hearing anything about their application. ""We became homeless as soon as we got to Sudan, we just went through hell and back,"" he said. He has said during that time, the family would tie themselves together with rope and clothes while they slept to prevent kidnapping. ""Getting approved to come here [to Australia] was like winning Lotto for us,"" he said. White said he ended up adapting to life in Australia a lot easier than he'd expected. With government support, he picked up English quickly, completed school and secured a job in finance. ""Every day I'd be in a tie, I had a company car, I got a credit card. It was sweet,"" he said. Some comedians believe there are limits to who can joke about what, but others say that if we value freedom of speech, no topic should be taboo. So where does that leave the audience? While everything may have looked good on paper, it was the breakdown of a 10-year relationship that had him reconsidering his career path. It was a skeptical reading with a psychic that encouraged him to jump into a completely new industry and give comedy a shot. ""I just thought this woman was telling me what she told the last five people before me,"" he said. ""But I was going through this phase, where I was trying everything to tick boxes to find my purpose so I thought it couldn't hurt."" His jokes are mainly inspired by his past and the transition to life in Australia, which he said he hoped would foster more empathy for refugees. Most of all, his time on stage is a way to honour his mother — even if she's sometimes the punchline. ""I was able to not only tell my mum's story, so she didn't suffer in silence, but try to help others find different ways to speak about heavy stuff,"" he said. When he started his career about a decade ago, White often found himself being the only person of colour in a line-up. His mum was hesitant about him leaving a stable career in finance for comedy, but she eventually came around. That support has meant the world, especially in the early days of trying to break into the industry. ""While I was new, it was quite competitive. Especially if I did well, some people really weren't welcoming,"" he said. Now internationally touring and sharing theatres with the likes of Trevor Noah and Jim Carr, White has overcome a lot of those initial barriers. He now tries to give back to the African communities that gave him the confidence to do what he does. ""Whether it's donating money or mentoring new comics, I don't forget the core reason which is to tell my story,"" he said. White has been enthusiastically encouraging young African comics to also enter Australia's comedy scene. In 2019, he put together Best of Africa, a multi-state live stand-up comedy show. It was showcased at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and the Perth Fringe World Festival. ""People see there's demand for African line-ups,"" he said. ""It's still very challenging to get on certain platforms sometimes because there are gatekeepers, so I made my own."" A small but loyal community of African comedians was starting to build in Melbourne. Chido Mwat, a medical doctor from Melbourne who migrated to Australia in 2012 from Zimbabwe, said she was never the class clown. But she was always drawn to comedy as it pushed her out of her comfort zone. ""I can be a bit awkward sometimes. Through the years, I've found ways to navigate that — comedy being the main way,"" she said. After a few sets at open mic nights across Melbourne, Mwat offered to open for some of White's shows. This small community became crucial for Mwat as she had not told her family about her career choice. To this day her father doesn't know she does stand up. ""My parents are from a place where education is your key to financial stability, so they always wanted me to focus on being a doctor,"" she said. ""No one forced me to do anything, I don't regret it, but it was time to do something I wanted to."" Since starting comedy, she said she saw the progress the Australian comedy scene has made and was optimistic about its future. ""I felt like I was the only black female, so then I didn't feel empowered at that point in time,"" she said. ""I have full trust in this generation to kind of turn things around, we're definitely going in the right direction to do that.""

129,The complex and fascinating history of Australia's wild buffalo,arts-culture,"  Photographer David Hancock's 30-year journey documenting Australia's wild buffalo Ever since the buffalo was introduced to Australia nearly 200 years ago, its relationship with the land has been a complicated one. Small herds were imported from Asia by the British in the early 19th century, as a food source. However, when colonists abandoned their northern settlement on Cobourg Peninsula in 1849, those herds were released into the wild. The colony was the third failed attempt at colonisation of the Northern Territory's Top End, where the British had hoped to gain control of Dutch trading routes. Disease, malnutrition and cyclones made it too challenging. While the harsh conditions were too much for colonists, the rugged savannas and wetlands of Arnhem Land – with similar climates of Timor and Indonesia – proved perfect for the buffalo. An estimated feral population of nearly 200,000 can be now be found across the entire northern-most half of the Northern Territory. For photographer David Hancock, his connection with the wild buffalo of Northern Australia began in the 1970s, during the cattle industry's push towards a live export trade. Could Top End Buffalo be the next Wagyu? One Northern Territory producer says they have all the ingredients to be top-notch eating meat. He was documenting a national program to eliminate both tuberculosis and brucellosis from livestock, where culling of buffalo was used to stop the spread of disease on to domesticated cattle. It led him on a 30-year journey documenting the species in the Top End, which has been published in a book named Nganabbarru, the Bininj-Kunwok word for buffalo. ""I was pretty tired of working down South, it was all pretty dull really,"" Mr Hancock said. ""It was really good to come up and get out bush – I had some friends who had musterers as friends, and they had helicopter pilots as friends. ""As it turned out, they were keen to have a photographer out there on those musters, because there was so much happening that they couldn't photograph."" The decades-long photography project has taken him to some of the most remote and beautiful parts of the country. ""It's just confirmed my love and appreciation of the Top End flood plains,"" he said. ""They're a fragile and beautiful environment, and they are at risk from any kind of feral invasion."" ""The one area that I really have a lot of concern about is the Arafura Swamp — this is one of the biggest paperbark swamps in Australia. ""It's just the most amazing place, and buffalo have intruded into there. They're still in probably one of the most pristine environments in Australia and it'd be a shame to see it [be damaged]."" Following their release from abandoned British colonies, swamp buffalo became a formidable foe for the various First Nations groups across the top end. The significance of first contact with the large beasts is reflected in rock art paintings of Djabidjbakalloi, where life-size images of buffalo appear alongside images of boats, horses and guns, sites which Mr Hancock was able to photograph thanks to Warddeken IPA rangers. ""You've got to remember that Aboriginal people are the ones most impacted by buffalo, he said. ""When they got here in the early to mid 1800s, there hadn't been a large animal in Northern Australia since megafauna, which was 50,000 years before. ""And these were people who didn't have guns, and they just had to deal with these big animals. ""In many ways, the buffalo has become part of their traditions and mythology. Particularly in that rock country of Western Arnhem Land you see a lot of drawings of Buffalo. ""Those animals must have made a huge impression on people right from the beginning."" As buffalo herds spread further throughout Arnhem Land, Aboriginal people were at the forefront of turning environmental disaster into economic opportunity. More landowners in the Top End choose to muster buffalo for commercial gain, rather than reducing the population via aerial culling programs and it's leading to a worrying spike in numbers. Tom Dawkins, the chief executive of the NT Buffalo Industry Council, said the buffalo hide industry that began in the 1880s was the result of different Aboriginal groups seizing the chance to generate income from animals that were not owned by pastoralists. ""David makes the point that buffalo were seen as no one's property,"" he said. ""Whereas sheep or cattle were always seen as being owned by someone, you wanted to be very careful going after livestock like that, but buffalo were seen as sort of more accessible in that respect. ""That was a huge part of the history, and what drew a lot of Aboriginal people to work with them. And there's some extraordinary stories about the careers that were carved out."" Similar circumstances prevail today, where buffalo producers see skyrocketing beef prices and increasing numbers of feral buffalo as an enormous opportunity to supply a growing Asian market for cheap protein and mitigate their environmental impact. ""I think in every regard it is a very compelling proposition, because we do have those market imperatives, export revenue for the Territory, food security for our neighbours,"" he said. ""But we're also talking about doing that in a way that provides employment, economic activity and dividends for traditional owners. ""In a way that represents sustainable land management and offsetting environmental damage from overstocking. It is a very compelling industry."" Dawkins said that culling feral populations should be used as an absolute last resort, given the growing profitability of the live export market. ""We're very concerned about the dangers of wild dogs and feral pigs with shoot-to-waste programs — they exacerbate those problems,"" he said. ""The challenge for our industry is to continue to work with government, traditional owners, the Northern Land Council and all stakeholders to ensure that that shoot-to-waste is only ever the last resort, and that we have created every chance to find an economic solution there, before we resort to that sort of measure, which seems terribly outdated and unacceptable."" Much like Mr Dawkins and other farmers who work closely with buffalo, photographer David Hancock holds the creatures in high regard, despite their impact on what he describes as one of the most magnificent landscapes in the world. ""In a domesticated situation as proven in Asia, buffalo live with families,"" he said. ""They're part of the family, so domesticated buffalo can be quite a gentle animal."" Between British colonists, Aboriginal hunters, photographers and farmers, the complex mythology of these destructive yet gentle beasts lives on in the Territory.

130,'I want to be without fear': George Haddad and Omar Sakr on growing up queer and Arab Australian,arts-culture,"  George Haddad and Omar Sakr centre bisexual Arab Australian protagonists in their debut novels Omar Sakr remembers looking up and seeing a small plane trace ""Vote No"" in big, smoky letters that left a trail like clouds in the sky. It was 2016, as the same-sex marriage debate raged in Australia. In Son of Sin, Sakr's debut novel, the young Arab Australian protagonist – a believer, a sinner, and the son of an absent father and a violent mother – also looks up and sees that writing in the sky. Sakr writes: ""He was used to ignoring their nonsense. The whole country was debating the legal validity of love, churches and mosques and Liberals unleashing all the hatred and fear they'd spent so long cultivating. He was used to the negative will of strange millions, too."" Sakr tells ABC Arts that it was an ""incredibly ugly and incredibly hurtful"" experience. ""You were suddenly now having to have a conversation that, to be frank, is something any sensible person would recognise we had many decades ago, and did not need to have again; it was really just an excuse to hurt us,"" he says. George Haddad, author of Losing Face, also remembers the lead-up to the same-sex marriage plebiscite as a time of unwarranted scrutiny: ""It felt like we were suddenly, for no reason, being judged in a kind of weird, contemporary witch trial of the digital age, where everyone was having their say about someone else's happiness, someone else's life."" Haddad came out to his mother Nawal in 2017, after he was outed by an extended family member without his consent. ""It really became quite an anxiety-inducing thing,"" he recalls. In their new novels, Sakr and Haddad, draw from history and memory to create moving narratives centred on bisexual protagonists living in Western Sydney. Like Sakr and Haddad, the characters they wrote into life – Jamal Khaddaj Smith and Joey Harb respectively – have much in common: they belong to migrant communities; they are sons of single mothers; they are not rich; they live in a country where people who look like them have learned to be careful around the law; they're bisexual; and they're uncertain about what they believe and with whom they belong. You can picture Jamal and Joey sharing a joint, each knowing something about loneliness. Sakr has previously drawn on his own experiences in his poetry collections These Wild Houses (2017) and The Lost Arabs (2019). ""People are always going to have these ideas about writers' lives informing their work. If you're going to come to my work with that assumption, then I'm going to run at it,"" Sakr told ABC RN's The Book Show. He dubs Jamal his ""distant avatar"", through which he tells the story of a young man's sexual awakening and struggle to locate himself within the faith, traditions and family ties he has inherited. The novel depicts the harrowing physical abuse Jamal experiences at the hands of his uncle and later, his mother. But Sakr finds tenderness for her, and that warmth suffuses Son of Sin. ""After I wrote my first poetry collection, I realised that it was really, really important that I give as much love as I could to the characters who are representative of my family members, because you only get what I give you, right? ""So, I made a concerted effort after that to give the context to my mother: how she is a product of her environment, and the violence that was inflicted upon her first."" Sakr also embeds letters from his father, WhatsApp messages from relatives and even things his aunty said to him, in the novel. He says he is often asked if it is hard to share these details with readers. ""It was harder to live it, to be honest; to live it and survive it,"" he says. ""But in revisiting those memories and also in fictionalising them, I take some of the power away from those moments … I use it to reclaim agency that was lost through the abuse."" Sakr doesn't just write about his family memories – he also writes about the racist political climate in Australia in the 2000s. In the novel, Jamal watches the Cronulla Riots of 2005 unfold, and later comes home to the aftermath of a raid by the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad (a police unit formed in response to the riots). ""It was incredibly frightening to see what I saw on the news, but also to hear the conversations that were going on around me – all the talk of reprisals and of gangs,"" recalls Sakr. A different perspective on history In Losing Face, Haddad too is interested in exploring the aftermath of an event that dominated the national conversation: the brutal gang rapes of six women in Sydney's south-west in 2000, by a group of young men including brothers Bilal and Mohammed Skaf. Haddad was 13 when the crimes made headlines. ""Coupled with September 11, that was the kind of onset of this 'othering' of Arab — really, of ethnic — men,"" he recalls. ""I remember it as a kind of consciousness being layered over how I performed in my everyday … I was conscious that I was now perceived as part of a violent group."" In Losing Face, Joey is present at the scene of a similar crime; he does not willingly participate but does not stop it from happening either. The choice to write from the perspective of a perpetrator kept Haddad up at night. ""It was really troubling for me to think that someone, or a survivor, might be offended by this, that I'm shedding light on the perpetrator of the crime rather than the victim; but ultimately, I can't speak from that victim's perspective,"" says Haddad. Instead, he shows us much of the trial through the eyes of Joey's grandmother, Elaine. Widowed, wrestling with a gambling habit and a pile of unpaid bills, she feels like an ""entirely useless matriarch"", yet Haddad makes her the moral centre of his novel – and it is she who isn't ready to let Joey off the hook. Haddad has five sisters, and was particularly close to his mother and his aunty – to whom he dedicated Losing Face. ""They weren't just carers, they were storytellers. … That really gave me a kind of heightened awareness, or understanding, of not only women's place in society, but migrant women's place in society, in the family and in relation to the men in their lives."" Losing Face was informed by Haddad's research into masculinity, shame and suburban life in contemporary Australia, as part of his doctoral thesis at Western Sydney University. He explored similar themes in his prize-winning 2016 novella Perish and Populate. ""When I'm around other men who don't see my queerness, I can be privy to really problematic things. I find it really hard to speak up in those situations and that probably has something to do with just being scared for myself. I think that plays out in Joey as well,"" he reflects. Sakr has also found that his masculine presentation can render his queerness invisible, with some family members reacting with ""real disbelief"" when he came out to them. ""I'm 6′1″[185cm]. I'm bearded. I do have an almost stereotypical Lebanese masculine presentation, right?"" In letters, his father seemed to say he might accept Sakr's queerness if he appeared more feminine. ""There's just really simplistic gender politics going on in the community, I think,"" says Sakr. For now, Sakr is comfortable with how he looks, partly because he's happy to demonstrate that there are different ways to be queer. ""But then I also have to acknowledge that were it not for the pressures that I feel, I would present differently. There is in our culture this strong sense of discretion and humility, which I think is weaponised against women, but also against queer and trans people."" Sakr had no model for how to be open about his sexuality and still be part of the community when he was growing up. ""I'm getting emotional thinking about it because it's such a shame,"" he says. ""Just because we're queer does not mean we don't feel the same extraordinary love for our family, and that same desire to be part of the community; to be part of the village; to be the uncle, the aunty, the elder, the cousin who comes over and helps out and has dinners and does all these things. I just wish that our community woke up to that fact."" Through Jamal, Sakr embraces this full-hearted vulnerability, sketching out an unabashedly bold and complex portrait of an Arab Australian man. He also writes explicit sex scenes. ""I enjoyed writing those the most – everything else was so painful and it felt like this is the joy,"" says Sakr. He also wanted to undermine what he sees as ""mainstream pressure to sanitise queerness and make it palatable"". ""The way that [queerness] is typically shown is to have them holding hands or saying they love each other, and it's like, 'No, we f***.' Yeah, we hold hands, yeah, we love each other, and yeah, we can be cute, but I wanted that heat to be present in the work, in the way that it was present in my life."" Tune in for author interviews and news from across the book world. Haddad takes a different route but arrives at that same place of rejecting shame. When Joey finds himself connecting deeply with Ivan, a boy he meets at a concert, there are no labels attached. It feels effortless. ""It was a definite, concerted effort to challenge stereotypes,"" says Haddad. He wanted to write about a character who was gradually coming to accept his queerness — rather than struggling to come to terms with it. ""I'm writing about how I want queerness to go, and also how I've heard stories of queerness go; we're becoming a lot better at dealing with these kinds of things without shame and trauma. It was important for me to do that for Joey as well as his family."" Sakr is elated to be working at a time where there's so much incredible Arab Australian writing finding an audience. He name-checks Sarah Ayoub's The Cult of Romance, Yumna Kassab's Australiana, Amal Awad's The Things We See in the Light, Amani Haydar's The Mother Wound, Sara El Sayed's Muddy People, Michael Mohammed Ahmad's The Other Half of You and Randa Abdel-Fattah's Coming of Age in the War on Terror — and Haddad's Losing Face. ""There's a lot to celebrate,"" Sakr says. Haddad agrees, even as he expresses impatience that his and Sakr's books are considered a special subgenre of Australian literature. ""These are Australian stories primarily; they are queer stories that are a consequence of our identity. It is something that we're proud of and excited about, but we need more such writing so that we're not singled out but [rather] diluted into one massive pool of diversity,"" says Haddad. On a personal level, Haddad knows he now models to a younger generation what an openly queer Arab Australian man looks like. Yet, he finds it tough to be visible and vulnerable in this way. ""This is the thing that I've struggled with the most: I have a lot of bigoted and homophobic relatives who, if they were aware of my career and of the things that I'm saying publicly, would probably bring my parents grief. ""And certainly, I worry about that vulnerability and that visibility, but if we keep hiding away or we keep trying to kind of shade things, what are we saying about our existence?"" Sakr says he's learned to use language in a way that emphasises healing: ""Instead of saying you were hurt, say you were changed. Then it becomes about seeing what those changes were and that also enables you to imagine how you can change again. ""Who am I becoming now? I'm a person invested in love, invested in being whoever I want to be without fear. I don't think I could have said that before writing this book.""

131,Is this Australia's first meat workers' choir?,arts-culture,"  Is this Australia's first meat workers' choir? Pacific Islanders working at a Brisbane abattoir are using singing to keep homesickness at bay. The 40-strong choir formed after Samoan and Solomon Islander workers at Australian Country Choice's Brisbane facility started meeting after work for singing sessions. After management heard about the singalongs, an electronic keyboard and a guitar arrived. So too did an invitation to hold an Easter concert for staff and friends. The performance featured hymns sung back home to celebrate Easter as well as traditional dances. ""Two different nationalities getting together and singing together was just outstanding, and really rewarding for them and for everyone else here at ACC,"" said chief operating officer Andrew Ross. Malo Sione, who works in the office and packing area, has sung in church choirs all her life. ""The reason why I'm here is for the future of my family, my little family of three kids and my husband residing in my beautiful country of Samoa,"" she said. Of the 800 staff at ACC's abattoir, 10 per cent are from the Pacific Islands. They're in Australia on working visas approved under the federal government's Pacific Labour Scheme (PLS). Mr Ross said staff admired the workers, many of whom have left children, spouses and elderly parents for up to three years. ""It goes without saying, but it's something some of us Aussies could never do,"" said Mr Ross. ""They've done the tough roads leaving their home country to come to Australia, and whilst it's not home, you have to make it feel like home, and they have to get the rewards so they can help their family."" Solomon Islander Joyce Siofa'a, who often sings while she works, said the sacrifice is worth it to earn wages she can't earn at home. ""It's good money, I'm using it to build my house, and as I'm the oldest in the family, I'm helping my parents,"" she said. Samoan, Afa Ese, is saving for his children and is buying another house. ""It's a long time, I miss my wife and kids, but I am lucky to be in Australia right now. I am so happy,"" said Mr Ese. The choirmaster is Siatua Ah Kuoi, who everyone calls Jack. ""My father's a Methodist minister so I grew up singing in choirs. It's in my blood."" The strong 31-year-old to whom moving carcasses around is ""like a walk in the park… we are Islanders!"" tearfully explained how singing connected him to home, especially his sick father. ""Singing is like an escape for me… my dad, it is the only thing I can talk to him is through music."" ACC's general manager of further processing and logistics, Mollie Auvaa, is mum-in-chief to the Pacific Island workers. It's a role she's comfortable with as she's both a Samoan chieftain and princess. ""They're elected and they go through criteria selected by the government to come and work in Australia,"" said Ms Auvaa. ""It is quite important they adapt to the Australian culture and do their best, as they're representing their country."" The chronic labour shortage in Australia's meat processing sector is long standing and only worsened during COVID. Even the arrival of more than 80 workers in the last six months hasn't helped ACC's abattoir run at full capacity. With the PLS so important to the company, claims some employers and labour hire companies are abusing it by underpaying and exploiting workers, deeply disappoints Andrew Ross. ""We need as an industry to support the labour scheme, and make sure we value it, and see it's not used in the wrong way,"" Mr Ross said. ""We need to make them part of the industry's future. ""We would not have 84 people here now and would not have another 54 on their way at the end of May if we weren't treating the PLS workers with respect and treating them equally,"" Mr Ross said. Choirmaster Jack says singing has connected workers with home, family and church. ""They all come to me and say this is a nice thing. They thank me for that. I don't want anyone to thank me or congratulate me, the only thing I want to see is the smile… the unity that is what I am looking for.""

134,'Pioneering days': Acclaimed filmmaker retraces steps to 1970s Castaway series,arts-culture,"  Oscar-winning Australian cinematographer John Seale retraces footsteps to 1970s Castaway series Oscar-winning cinematographer John Seale has been behind the lens on scores of critically acclaimed movies, including Dead Poet's Society, Witness, The English Patient, Rain Man and Mad Max: Fury Road. What many people don't know is that he underwent ""the apprenticeship of his career"" in the early 1970s on a series called Castaway, which aired on ABC TV and was largely filmed at Port Macquarie in northern NSW. The period drama was based on the trials of a group of shipwreck survivors who became stranded on a Pacific island in 1840 after their Australia-bound ship went down in a hurricane. It was a co-production between the ABC, Scottish Television and a German company. Seale said the project helped launch his highly successful international career. ""It was one of the first times I got to work with international people,"" he said. ""As an Australian who has learnt the business here, back then we tended to head towards a 'what if' approach."" He said crews would experiment with different methods of shooting. ""We didn't really know the rules in a way so we made our own,"" he said. He said international crews brought their rules to their production process. ""On this one there was an English director, German actors and an Australian crew,"" he said. ""So, I was able to go overseas years later and feel comfortable that I knew what I was doing."" Castaway is back in the spotlight almost 50 years after it first aired thanks to efforts in Port Macquarie to produce a documentary-style film about the series. Retired National Parks and Wildlife Service ranger Mike Dodkin and heritage consultant Mitch McKay are leading the project. ""We are trying to keep this story alive as part of Port Macquarie's history,"" Mr Dodkin said. ""It was pioneering days in the film industry back then…it's amazing what they achieved."" Australians involved in Castaway have been invited back to Port Macquarie and Seale recently travelled from his Sydney home to visit the Castaway site for the first time since the 1970s. He was joined by Australian actor Alan Cinis who was 12 when he appeared in Castaway. Most of the Castaway scenes were filmed at Port Macquarie's Miners Beach, within what is now the Sea Acres National Park, with one scene filmed at North Narrabeen in Sydney. Seale and Cinis trekked down to Miners Beach along the original, and now heavily overgrown ""Castaway track"". ""It's wonderful, looking at the beach again now, so many years later and trying to work out where we did certain shots,"" Seale said. Cinis said it was an emotional day. ""It's like visiting a house that you used to live in as a kid that you had some really good times, that you kind of get that little thrill from each room…it's very personal,"" he said. He said spending 14 weeks iin Port Macquarie for filming was ""one of the great experiences of my life"". ""The Castaway production gave me legs… you work with good people, you work with some of the top companies, and it flows on from there,"" he said. Cinis and a fellow child actor, Lexia Wilson, had to stay in Port Macquarie, away from their families, during the Castaway filming and were also required to do schoolwork. ""I hated the schoolwork, the poor tutor, I just wanted to be on the beach, or watching the filming, or watching the sand crabs,"" Cinis said with a laugh. A group of 20 indigenous people from Kempsey were also involved in the series. ""They came down over a three-day period, they were paid $20 each,"" Mr McKay said. ""We found out during a Castaway reunion in 2017 that only two of those 20 actors were still alive."" Seale, now 79, said while Castaway marked a significant moment in his career, he found it hard to pick favourite projects. ""You put so much effort into each one that you really hope that's going to be one of the best films ever made, so in a way they are all a favourite,"" he said. It's hoped the Castaway documentary will eventually screen at the Sea Acres National Park visitor centre, ensuring the ""castaways"" aren't lost for good.

136,"Physicist walks his toy fox-on-a-skateboard, Jeremy, from Broken Hill to Adelaide to educate students about quantum mechanics",arts-culture,"  Physicist Dr Peter Hill walks from Broken Hill to Adelaide to educate students about quantum mechanics A quantum physicist sets off on a journey, armed with a skateboard and a small toy fox. It sounds like the set-up for a Carl Barron joke. Instead, it is the story of Dr Peter Hill, who is trying to raise awareness for his field of expertise and change how it is taught in schools. The retired scientist decided to walk the 500-kilometre journey to raise money for the Royal Society of South Australia. He hoped more school students would be provided with an updated curriculum when it came to quantum physics. ""Essentially, it's not being taught at all,"" Dr Hill said. ""The stuff that's being taught at school is the stuff that was being taught in 1917."" Dr Hill said it was a personal passion to help educate more kids in quantum physics, because he believed it would help them better understand other areas of society. ""Quantum physics describes a lot of useful things like how computers work or how solar cells operate … and you'd get really lost if you didn't have quantum physics,"" he said. Dr Hill is not making the journey on his own, with his faithful sidekick Jeremy Bronfox riding on top of his skateboard. ""A friend Bronwyn, who's a crochet ninja, or mastermind, or whatever they're called, created it,"" he said. ""He's got a crocheted fox girlfriend in Adelaide who he'll see, called Baroness Lynette Von Foxhoven."" Dr Hill hoped the weather would be fine during his journey because he had not brought a tent with him when he slept rough. ""I have a Kmart sleeping bag. I also have a tarp if it rains, but I hope it doesn't,"" he said. Dr Hill trained for his journey by walking 200 kilometres from Broken Hill to Wilcannia, as well as shorter treks north-west to Silverton. He planned to do the majority of his walk at night, for safety reasons. ""I'm planning to walk six hours then have two hours' rest, and repeat if I can,"" Dr Hill said. ""I'm having to walk a lot at night so you can see the trucks in the distance."" Dr Hill's walk coincides with a significant milestone in quantum physics — the discovery of quantum particles. ""It just happens to be the 100th anniversary of the, 'No going back' experiment that was done in Germany in 1922,"" he said. Dr Hill's journey began in Broken Hill on Wednesday night, and he arrived in Cockburn on the SA-NSW border on Thursday. Next he will travel to Olary, then onto Manna Hill, Yunta, Oodla Wirra, Terrowie, Hallett, Burra, Saddleworth and eventually Adelaide.

137,Flowing pastels and dancing young people colour Melbourne city with 'Unapologetically Blak' tram art ,arts-culture,"  Melbourne Art Trams for RISING festival feature Indigenous artist Patricia Mckean's work A vibrant tram rumbling through the heart of Melbourne tells a unique story from coastal south-west Victoria — a long way from the bright lights and buzz of metropolitan life. Splashed across the outside of the carriage is an effervescent artwork of flowing pastels and dancing young people created by 23-year-old Patricia Mckean. The young Gunditjmara-Kirrae Whurrong digital illustrator and animator is one of six First Nations artists featured in the 2022 instalment of the Melbourne Art Trams for the RISING arts festival. The travelling circles entwined through her piece, Not Sorry for Who We Are, take viewers on a journey to Gunditjmara Country in south-west Victoria and the story of her family. ""I honoured my grandfather, Banjo Clarke, and he's looking up to everything as everyone looked up to him,"" Mckean said. ""Grandpa is a big inspiration to me because of his leadership. ""He helped with land rights and many other connections back in the day."" She said her grandfather was respectful and wise and was known as ""the wisdom man"". Mckean said she was surrounded by creativity when growing up in Warrnambool, thanks to her mother, renowned Kirrae Whurrong artist Fiona Clarke. Mckean said she was carving her own creative path in Naarm, Melbourne, hundreds of kilometres from her home. She said it felt ""really cool"" to know her Indigenous tram art piece would be heading up and down Swanston Street. ""Seeing it all really big on the tram was mesmerising. It's just surreal,"" she said. The artworks have transformed the mundane appearance of the trams and elevated Indigenous representation in Australia's second-most populous city. They each respond to the theme, ""Unapologetically Blak"". Boonwurrung-Wemba Wemba artist Jarra Karalinar Steel, who curated the pieces, said she wanted the collection to be diverse. ""I didn't want it just to be all elders or all young people. I wanted it to be how I am in community,"" Karalinar Steel said. ""I am around amazing, young, talented, beautiful, creative artists and get so much from my elders and other established artists."" She said the works would be on the trams for 12 months. ""It's something people can really take in for a decent amount of time,"" Karalinar Steel said. ""I'd love to see a fleet one day to have First Peoples representation on the tracks.""

138,"Best new books: Award-winning writers, poetry and eclectic short stories",arts-culture,"  The best new books released in May as selected by avid readers and critics Welcome to ABC Arts' monthly book column. Each month, we'll present a shortlist of new releases read and recommended by The Bookshelf's Kate Evans and The Book Show's Claire Nichols and Sarah L'Estrange — alongside freelance writers and book reviewers. This month, we're thrilled to present recommendations from Declan Fry. All four read voraciously and widely, and the only guidelines we gave them were: make it a new release; make it something you think is great. The resulting list features a postcolonial riff on Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway, a collection of dryly humorous short stories, an eccentric family memoir from a Mexican journalist, a poetic encounter with mortality, and a bildungsroman set in Western Sydney. University of Queensland Press Joey is 19 years old and drifting through life. High school is finished but he's stuck; living with his single mum and brother in Greenacre, in Western Sydney, he spends his days working part-time at a local supermarket and getting stoned with his old school friends. Joey is different to the people around him in looks and temperament. Amongst his hyper-masculine friends, he is gentle and quiet. Rather than looking like his Lebanese mum, his green eyes and fair skin reflect his absent Australian dad — a man he hardly remembers. His sexuality makes him different too. Joey is queer but this remains unspoken amongst his family and friends. About a third of the way through this book, something terrible happens: Joey and his friends are involved in a violent, appalling crime. While Joey is not the chief perpetrator, we are challenged to ask ourselves if his apathy makes him complicit. While Losing Face explores the ramifications of masculine violence, it's the women who shine in this novel. Joey's mum Amal is unforgettable — bolshie and botoxed, she is as fierce on politics as she is on the latest episode of The Bachelor. Joey's grandmother Elaine is the proud family matriarch whose preference for lighting the backyard barbecue with petrol reflects her determined, fiery nature. She's obsessed with the family's reputation, and Joey's crime – and subsequent court case – is a source of great shame for Elaine. But she has secrets of her own too. At night she heads to the RSL, where the buzz of pokie machines soothes memories of a painful past. There has been some wonderful fiction coming out of Western Sydney in recent years (Michael Mohammed Ahmad, Omar Sakr and Rawah Arja all spring to mind), and with its pacey plot and rich characters, Losing Face is a worthy new addition to this body of work. CN Hachette Reading fiction inspired by the classics can be an enriching experience, as it informs an understanding of the original while extending its meaning to a new setting. This is the case in Daisy and Woolf by Goan Anglo Indian writer Michelle Cahill — it's both a literary homage and a postcolonial critique of Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway. Woolf's novel is celebrated for its experimental writing and stream-of-consciousness style; it recounts a day in the life of a British aristocrat, Clarissa Dalloway, as she prepares for a lavish party. Many readers will be familiar with the Pulitzer Prize-winning book The Hours, by Michael Cunningham, which was also inspired by Mrs Dalloway. Cahill takes the minor character of Daisy Simmons in Woolf's novel and dedicates an entire book to her elevation to a character with a rich inner life. Daisy lives in India, and Cahill uses Woolf's repeated references to Daisy as ""dark"" to draw her as a Eurasian woman with Anglo Indian heritage. The other major figure in this novel is Mina, a contemporary author of Goan Anglo Indian ancestry who is writing a novel about Daisy. The narrative toggles between Mina's struggles to research and write the book, and the story of Daisy, which is set in the 1920s and is recounted in letters and journal entries. The emotional and psychological cost for Mina of writing Daisy into life, which involves delving into Anglo Indian history, spurs some of the most affecting passages. Mina writes it is ""a story that is mine to tell and not Virginia Woolf's, and yet not entirely mine, because it is within me, of my people, the Anglo-Indians, while also beyond me"". For lovers of metafiction, Daisy and Woolf provides a rich vein of literary excavation and reclamation. SL Serpent's Tail (Allen & Unwin) In the world of Paul Dalla Rosa, life is meaningless – and, yes, sometimes meaningful, but mostly in order to accentuate this. It is periodically interrupted, too, by the grotesquerie of his characters, of those who surround them, or of both. Should you ever end up in a Paul Dalla Rosa story, know that your malaise will extend everywhere and nowhere, haunted by a sense of misaligned, subterranean violence. The narrator of the opening story, The Hard Thing, wonders if he ""had misjudged my plans, all of them"". He's more optimistic than most: many of these characters live as if trapped inside the dissociative pout of a Daria episode. They are prone to feeling ""existential and diffuse"", of having ""failed to capitalise in some generalised yet hyper-specific way"" or in a way ""that is unspecific yet total"". They are often headed toward Very Bad Things. Dalla Rosa is fond of artful, deadpan repetition. (An example, from the opening of In Bright Light, which describes a struggling actress returning a greyhound: ""She apologised to the shelter staff, and in the hope they would not speak to reporters, donated a sum of money. The shelter staff spoke to reporters."") The collection's sardonic, DeLillo-esque humour arises from the discrepancy between the roles people assume and the ways in which they actually act. As in the Talking Heads song Seen and Not Seen, people hope, through force of will, to mimic the people they see ""in movies, on TV, in magazines, and in books"", even if it all turns out to be a terrible mistake. In the opening lines of Contact, my favourite story in the collection (Short Stack and In Bright Light are close runners-up), a woman working at a call centre ""is sent surveys that will be tabulated and used selectively to justify operational and organisational change"". (Like modernist poet William Carlos Williams buzzed on MDMA and shilling for the man, so much depends on the side-eye of that artful insertion, ""selectively"".) Seeking approval during her initial job interview, the woman describes the value that she thinks ""will seem most impressive from a person her age"" (it's ""self-respect""). In Dalla Rosa's world, selling out isn't shameful; it's aspirational. With an eye firmly trained on capitalism's confidence-tricks, Dalla Rosa holds a mirror up to the hedonist queers, the sadbois, the disaffected, the disenchanted – to all of us, floating through space, begging for the void. DF Scribe Emiliano Monge's grandfather faked his own death – dramatically, with explosives – and his father disappeared to join Mexico's partisans, and that's just the start of it, for both of them. Monge himself can also be elusive, and in this extraordinary book – subtitled ""A memoir of fathers who never were"" — he is chasing lost fathers, family myths, conflicting stories, and figures who appear and don't appear on a family tree. He's trying to make sense of the shadows and gaps and absences in his own history. Monge is an award-winning Mexican novelist, short story writer and newspaper columnist, and he pursues these lost histories unconventionally and with verve. The book opens with his grandfather blowing up a corpse in 1958, but it moves neither back nor forward from there; rather, it navigates around and about, in a variety of voices and tenses and styles. Why the explosion in the quarry? And who was the corpse? What happened to the family in the aftermath, and when did they know it wasn't really his grandfather? Not so fast, Monge suggests: neither the events nor the answers are the thing. The storytelling and the undercurrents are the thing. The grandfather did not stay dead: he reappeared four years later, and his widow – no longer a widow – was furious, incandescent: ""The bastard's still alive and well!"" This is narrated for us by Monge's father, Carlos, in a series of testy conversations written as one-sided dialogue, in which he berates his son, swears at him, stops for a coffee, strides around the room, and is exasperated by all these damn questions. First person, third person, diaries; lacerating self-analysis, funny asides, brutally violent description, historical detail of revolutions and uprisings, brushes with narcos, and political entanglements; this book uses style and perspective and focus-shifts in a way that's dizzying, ambitious, confusing, shocking — and ultimately thrilling. KE University of Queensland Press The Jaguar, Sarah Holland-Batt's third poetry collection, is her most accomplished yet. Reading one of its poems, The Gift, in the New Yorker during lockdown, I was awe-struck. Composed of four sections, The Jaguar is bookended by suites devoted to fathers – her father Dr Anthony Holland-Batt in the first and her grandfather in the last. (Sarah Holland-Batt has also become known in recent years as an advocate for better aged care.) The undertow of her father's final days with Parkinson's disease informs the collection, as when, observing scenery alongside the Nile, she describes childhood saints ""whose vigils never cease, / whose faces do not age"". Her own vigil renders time and tense ambiguous; in the affecting meditations of Time Remaining, she describes, with great pathos, noticing the inadvertent poetry of her father's speech: ""He says, I'm beginning to wonder // and he's gone again, eyes swivelling / through the morphine, rolling / in the mulberry velvet of it // and I can see it's true: my father is beginning / to wonder, he is at the verge / of something he is only starting // to comprehend the shape of."" The third section is characterised by another leave-taking, as the poet meditates on the end of a relationship. She invokes the motif of stone, an object both steadfast and impenetrable, and a metaphor, also, for inner resolve; ""a small assertion of selfhood"", as she writes in the poem On Worthing Beach (if not, indeed, emotional opacity). The jaguar, meanwhile, ""whose key method of killing / is by piercing the brain itself"", symbolises entropy: the passing of time, consumerism, the proximity of life to risk, and decadence (one poem connects the animal to Cartier's panther, another to the luxury car her father bought when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's). Holland-Batt's linguistic dexterity remains, as ever, consistently fresh and surprising: hospital injection fluids are ""like a sling / of trapped rain""; a nettle leaf has a ""prickling pelt"". Once a month The Bookshelf turns into The Book Club. New themes appear, too, including the poet's intimations of midlife, which serve to gracefully counterpoint her reflections on mortality. As in all of Holland-Batt's work, there is a real affection for the names of things – animals, places, people – that serves as a kind of memorialisation.

139,"Ken Hutt almost died trying to paraglide from Mount Everest, but says it was worth it",arts-culture,"  Ken Hutt set out to paraglide from the top of Mount Everest — he didn't make it, but his message to end polio did A Queensland man's quest to become the oldest person to paraglide from the top of Mount Everest has ended in near tragedy. Accompanied by QUT filmmaker Joe Carter, Ken Hutt, 62, set off in April and spent weeks at Base Camp preparing to make the long journey to the pinnacle. However, the glide was not to be — Mr Hutt developed a life-threatening chest infection at camp two, about 6,400 metres up the world's highest mountain. Mr Carter said Mr Hutt had to turn back. ""Without the ability to breathe properly in an environment where every gram of oxygen inhaled can mean the difference between surviving and death, he had no choice but to descend,"" Mr Carter said. ""Once you get beyond camp two, you cannot get medical aid or be rescued."" One in seven people don't survive their attempts at Everest and three people died while the group was on the mountain. Mr Hutt's mission was to raise the profile of and money for Rotary International's End Polio Now campaign. While he failed to achieve his gliding goal, his message made it to the peak, delivered by the three remaining members of the group. But the journey was not without further emergencies for remaining climbers: two members of the group had to be airlifted to safety on the descent, drilling in the dangers the mountain poses. Mr Hutt said the mission was not a failure, despite making his way down the mountain in a more conventional way than planned. ""We have already raised more than $250,000 for polio with the expedition, and our thousands of followers on social media around the world have been sending messages of support and relief that our whole team has made it safely down,"" he said. Mr Carter stayed at base camp with Mr Hutt's son after training guides to film Mr Hutt for his documentary Fly from Everest. The filmmaker has a background in making extreme sports films. He said this time was different. ""To have a storyline now where Ken was forced to retreat from the mountain without achieving the summit or the paragliding flight is not necessarily a sad ending — in fact, seeing Ken reunited with his son at base camp, and the knowledge that he has achieved so much for Rotary's End Polio Now campaign and is going home to his family is actually a heart-warming and inspirational way to end our story here,"" he said. The documentary will still be produced. We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

140,Sex offender Robert Hughes to seek new life in UK if he is released from prison,arts-culture,"  Sex offender Robert Hughes to seek new life in UK if he is released from prison Convicted child sex offender Robert Hughes plans to ""maintain a very low profile"" in the United Kingdom if he is granted parole and deported, a Sydney court has heard. The disgraced Hey Dad! actor has been in prison since 2014, after he was found guilty of 10 sexual and indecent assault offences committed in the 1980s. He was handed a minimum sentence of six years and has been eligible for parole since April 2020. The 73-year-old appeared before a hearing of the State Parole Authority in Parramatta today via video link, wearing glasses and prison greens, as the court was told he and his family are still considered ""deniers"". His former co-star Sarah Monahan watched on from the public gallery, after flying from the United States to once again face her abuser. Hughes has renounced his Australian citizenship, meaning he will be deported if granted parole. Solicitor Hannah Bruce, from the Prisoners Legal Service, said Hughes had consistently been assessed as medium or low risk of reoffending, making him ineligible for any rehabilitative programs in custody. The court heard Hughes' wife has made inquiries with a specialist psychologist with experience in sex offenders who maintain their innocence. ""Those specialist services are not available while he remains in custody in NSW,"" Ms Bruce told the hearing. ""They are available to him on release to the UK."" Ms Bruce also submitted he would not be ""completely unmonitored"" in the UK because he'd be subject to ""firm"" obligations to report his contact details and travel plans with authorities. She said his focus upon release would be ""maintaining a very low profile and spending the rest of his time in the UK with his partner"" while ""abiding by any conditions that would be placed on him by the UK authorities"". The panel reserved its decision for a week. Outside the court, Ms Monahan said she was struck by how ""terrible"" the sex offender looked. ""He looked really, really old,"" she said. ""Anybody who's going through it and they're scared to go into the court and see them, absolutely do it, because it takes all their power away. ""I wanted him to see me, that I was there, and that I wasn't scared anymore."" Ms Monahan said she did not trust the proposal that Hughes' wife was organising specialist psychological treatment. ""On the one hand I'd prefer him to stay in jail where he's not hurting kids, and on the other hand, it's like let him go, let him be someone else's problem and then I don't have to deal with it anymore,"" she said. She believes Hughes is still a risk. ""He's an old man and he's frail, but they don't change,"" she said. ""He's a denier, so he still thinks he hasn't done anything wrong. So he'll keep doing wrong things."" We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

141,His final wish was for a bold 'Big A' welcome sign for his adopted town. That wish has come true,arts-culture,"  Late Alan Farwell's passion for the arts recognised with Clare Valley welcome sculpture People arriving in the Clare Valley gateway town of Auburn are to be greeted with a bold new testament to its artistic culture and the passion of a late resident. The Big A — which will be officially dedicated in coming weeks — is unlike any welcome statement in the region and local Graham Richards said that was exactly the point for Alan Farwell, the man who made it possible with a bequest. ""He wanted it to be something unique to the town and he must have given it a lot of thought because he had already put it in his will,"" Mr Richards said. ""We were very close. I was with him before he died when he asked me to see it through."" Mr Farwell died shortly after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2015. Mr Richards headed up the project for the Auburn Community Development Committee (ACDC), hiring Adelaide artist Craige Andrae to design a welcome statement for Auburn. ""He came back with a simple A. It had a pleasing optical effect, being two parts that combine as you pass it,"" Mr Richards said. ""I had my heart in my mouth because the design I wanted was the design that went up. ""I'm absolutely delighted I was able to see Alan's wish come to fruition. It's an amazing thing."" Mr Farwell had been a teacher before pursuing his passion for fostering youth music and arts. He helped found the children's arts festival Come Out (now Dream Big) in the 1970s and was chair of the South Australian Independent Arts Foundation. After moving to Auburn in 2002 he became ACDC chair and helped establish the CJ Dennis Festival, named for the famed Australian poet born in the town. Rhonda Seymour, formerly of Broken Hill, took over the role after Mr Farwell died. She said Mr Farwell had been an integral part of the community, which was a friendly and welcoming one when she arrived. ""Alan had a lot of time for making connections with people and getting things done for Auburn,"" Ms Seymour said. ""Of all the communities I've lived in, I've never known a community member to leave money behind for a particular project. ""I think it is rather special a sign of his caring for this community."" Ms Seymour said while there was a mix of opinions of the sign, it represented the town's strong arts community, both traditional and modern. ""A lot of towns have welcome structures but this is quite different to the bluestone or iron, sheaves of wheat or grape bunches,"" she said. ""It's reflecting that we have a long history of arts and this is something that makes us stand out."" An official opening of the now-completed welcome sign will be held in the coming weeks, involving the dedication of a plaque in memory of Mr Farwell.

142,'It snowballed with enthusiasm and love': The heart-warming tale of the world's largest tea cosy,arts-culture,"  Giant hand-knitted tea cosy gunning for Guinness World Record turned into rugs for NSW flood victims Tucked away in Victoria's South Gippsland there's an event that brews a cosy atmosphere and is steeped in community spirit. The Fish Creek Tea Cosy Festival has returned this year after a COVID-19 hiatus and it is back with a bang. The star of the show was a super-size, hand-knitted tea cosy, draped over a specially constructed teapot frame more than 5 metres tall and 19 metres in circumference. The aim was to set a new Guinness World Record by smashing the previous title set in 2009 for a 3.9 metre by 11.1 metre tea cosy, knitted by nursing home residents across several countries. The record-breaking tea cosy is now being turned into blankets to support flood victims and homeless people. Teacher Dianne MacDonald, from the Melbourne suburb of Frankston, led the mission. ""I was teaching these kids, Maya, Julian and Lily, to knit, and they were really good kids and ready for a challenge,"" she said. ""So, I thought, let's crack a Guinness World Record, and I started looking around for a record to crack."" Ms MacDonald said the long-term project had involved hundreds of knitters, who had gone through an estimated 2,000 balls of wool to create around 1,500 multicoloured squares, which were then connected into blankets. ""We called on a group I started in the Frankston area about 10 years ago called Knit-A-Row-And-Go,"" she said. ""It involves putting knitting baskets out in the community, in cafes, and schools and waiting rooms, and people come along, and they do a few rows and put it back and the next person comes along and does a few rows."" The project proved to be far more than a storm in a teacup, spreading well beyond the Victorian border. ""People just kept coming in and wanting to help and be a part of it; there were local businesses that got involved … there were people in Western Australia, in Queensland,"" she said. ""We went to New Zealand and there was a cafe where we were knitting, and they wanted to be involved and started sending over squares. ""It just snowballed with enthusiasm and love; it was such a beautiful project."" The 2022 Fish Creek Tea Cosy Festival, which has just wrapped up, was seen as the perfect venue to unveil the giant tea cosy with volunteers working together to construct a tea pot frame large enough to display the creation. Ms MacDonald is now putting together an application to submit to the Guinness World Records. Ms MacDonald said the giant tea cosy had now been disassembled and turned back into blankets which will go to people in need. ""The majority of them are going to Lismore for the flood-affected people up there, they have been asking for blankets,"" she said. ""It feels good being able to help people and also to recycle everything. ""Some of the other rugs will go to support local homeless people, through Community Support Frankston and Big Issue Melbourne."" Tea Cosy Festival committee president Marge Arnup said it was a delight to host the festival for the first time since 2018 and revel in the huge number of quirky and creative entries. ""It was amazing, we had really strong crowds, great community support … you would be surprised at the number of tea aficionados who are out there,"" she said. ""We ask people to make traditional, functional tea cosies, and exuberant whimsy tea cosies which can be made out of anything and don't have to be functional,"" she said. ""Traditional tea cosies really have to meet CWA guidelines ... the craftsmanship is really important."" The judge of this year's festival was a resident from Upper Lansdowne on the NSW Mid North Coast, Robyn Lauder, who was 'discovered' by the festival committee after she appeared in a previous ABC Mid North Coast story for her tea cosy expertise. Ms Lauder said the surprise experience had enriched her life and created new friendships. ""It has absolutely added lots and lots of joy and reinforced my faith that people can work as teams and look after each other,"" she said. Ms Lauder said it was great to see both young and old still embracing traditional crafts. ""It was just so fantastic to see the complete range of crafts people used and the ideas people came up with … and there were also lots of children involved,"" she said. ""So, some crafts are not disappearing and it's not just the elderly that are doing them.""

143,Aunty Barbara has a special place in the hearts of Junee's prison inmates. Here's why,arts-culture,"  Dreaming Inside poetry provides window on the thoughts of Indigenous men in jail Over the past decade, Aunty Barbara Nicholson has made the journey to Junee Correctional Centre more than 300 times. The Wadi Wadi elder works closely with the prison's Indigenous inmates as they learn how to connect their thoughts and feelings to words. Untitled (excerpt) if i could go back to my twelve year old Self & tell my Self three things it would be, 'focus more in School, choose different friends & choose a little wiser & Stay away from all drug's [sic]. to me Silence is a Strong thing, i was allways [sic] a Silent person & would never Speak to anyone about anything & it Soon became a dangerous thing to my mind that was untill [sic] i learnt how to deal with the things i was being silent about without Speaking to people. i don't have many things to Speak about as I haven't had the best & happiest life as of yet but once im out of custody i will be able to create a happy life now i am clean & only have those that truly do love me a part of my life … Snipper 2022 The men write poetry mostly, and free-flowing, train-of-thought poetry written from the perspective of an angry, incarcerated Indigenous man makes for tough reading. ""We think about change a lot, but what is change?"" Aunty Barbara asks. ""You don't really get significant change from one momentous event, but I think you can change from an accumulation of a lot of events. ""And I've got an accumulation here, it's 10 years, so let's hope that can change things."" Aunty Barbara has worked with hundreds of men, and says she remembers each one of them. ""These men are not hungry for food, not for physical sustenance. They are hungry for human contact, they are hungry for love,"" she says. A decade after Aunty Barbara first started working with the inmates, the 10th edition of their journal of poetry, Dreaming Inside, has been published. Launched by acclaimed author Melissa Lucashenko in Wollongong, the stories touch on love, life and loss as disenfranchised men express themselves through poetry, highlighting their own pain and misdemeanours. At the launch, both Aunty Barbara and Lucashenko reflected on the importance of working with people inside jail. A lot of people ask Aunty Barbara if she is frightened going into jail. She's not. She says while there's a forbidding atmosphere, she feels safe. ""If anyone tried anything funny with me, there'd be 300 Aboriginal inmates in the jail who would sort it out one way or the other,"" Aunty Barbara says. So, what is it like working in a jail? Aunty Barbara describes it as, ""Daunting, somewhat fearful at times, absolutely exhilarating and soul feeding"". ""I get more out of those trips than those boys get from me, I can tell you,"" she says. As an Indigenous woman who is concerned about the inmates' access to culture, Aunty Barbara thinks culture is strong in Junee Correctional Centre. ""[Aboriginal culture] … it's often stronger in there than what I sometimes see on the outside,"" she says. ""It's what sustains them in there. ""And the ones who are culturally strong encourage the ones who are not so culturally strong because they were brought up out of country."" Lucashenko, who hails from the unceded land of the Bundjalung nation, and has been couch surfing since the recent floods in her hometown Mullumbimby, was glad of the opportunity to launch Inside Dreaming Volume 10. In preparation for the event, the award-winning wordsmith, author, poet and academic checked the definition of prison, and discovered its Latin word means to apprehendere. ""It literally means to take or to take hold of, and I thought, 'That'd be right',"" Lucashenko says. ""There's a lot of things that have been taken over the last couple of hundred years: land, lives, culture, children, prime years of people's youth."" Lucashenko is a founding member and active participant of Brisbane-based grassroots organisation Sisters Inside. Established in 1992, Sisters Inside — much like Dreaming Inside — is celebrating 20 years of assisting criminalised women, girls, children and families. ""It's very rare for a grassroots organisation to work in this space, especially prisons,"" Lucashenko says. ""We all know that there is trauma, poverty, racism, white supremacy that leads to people to have outbursts and become violent. ""It's not that the violence isn't real, it's that there is a better way. ""If we are going to apprehend the brothers in Junee, and the other people behind bars, the refugees included, homeless people who are using prison as somewhere to get a feed and a bed, mentally ill people who end up in jail because we don't have a decent system of caring for each other, if we are going to apprehend those people, then let's do it in the true meaning of the word, let’s take them all in and look after each other.""

149,Woman who impersonated Home and Away star to catfish multiple people loses court appeal,arts-culture,"  Lydia Abdelmalek, who impersonated Home and Away actor Lincoln Lewis to catfish women, loses court appeal A ""fantasist"" who pretended to be an Australian soap star and catfished multiple women, convincing them to send her intimate photographs and ""ruthlessly"" stalking them, has lost an appeal against her conviction. Lydia Abdelmalek, 32, today appeared in the County Court of Victoria which threw out the legal challenge against her conviction for crimes a magistrate previously called ""calculated and cruel"". The victory is a significant one for prosecutors who told the appeal judge that Abdelmalek, of Lalor in Melbourne's northern suburbs, was a liar who had ""mercilessly"" hounded her victims with a ""soap opera"" cast of characters, including Home and Away star Lincoln Lewis. Today's verdict comes more than three years after Abdelmalek was initially found guilty of six stalking charges. Judge Claire Quin said she rejected Abdelmalek's evidence, which she found ""inconceivable"" and ""farcical"". ""Her account does not make sense,"" the judge said. ""I am satisfied the appellant was responsible for the stalking behaviour,"" she said. ""I find therefore each of the charges proven."" In another twist, Judge Quin told the court that a phone seized at Abdelmalek's home during the appeal, in relation to another case, contained ""incriminating"" evidence. The court heard there was a wealth of material on the phone which ""supported the accounts provided by victims"" including hundreds of texts and pictures to the women she stalked, intimate photos and Lincoln Lewis' real voicemail. ""Much of this material was not available at the time of the Magistrates' hearing,"" Judge Quinn said. ""The enormity of this behaviour could not be over exaggerated."" Family members and friends wept as the verdict was handed down in a packed courtroom. Abdelmalek did not react. She has now launched an appeal against her sentence, but has had her bail revoked and will be held in custody. One of Abdelmalek's victims waved as she was taken away by guards. Today, one of Abdelmalek's victims, Jess, paid tribute to investigators and prosecutors. ""I can't thank them enough,"" she said. ""The Victorian police have just been amazing and supportive, and the whole prosecution team have worked tirelessly to get us this result. ""Now it's off the streets and hopefully off the keyboard and can't ruin anyone else's lives."" She said she was taking things day by day. ""My life's been on hold for nearly 10 years so I'm not quite sure how that's going to look, but it's looking a lot better at the moment."" The verdict comes after a lengthy and, at times, bizarre hearing which lasted close to a year and involved a kilogram of chocolate being tendered into evidence. Stolen identities. Proclamations of love. How a malicious imposter fooled two smart, young women, simultaneously seducing and stalking them. In the dying days of her appeal Abdelmalek took the unusual step of taking the stand and giving evidence in her own appeal, a move which is usually avoided because it opens up the accused to intense cross-examination. Prosecutors also played the 32-year-old recordings, taken by victims, of what appeared to be her own voice. ""That's your voice, isn't it,"" prosecutor Angela Moran said. ""No, it's not my voice,"" Abdelmalek said. ""But it sounds identical to you, doesn't it?"" the prosecutor said. ""Not from my opinion,"" Abdelmalek said. Throughout the appeal Abdelmalek professed her innocence and claimed that she was also the victim of a person pretending to be Lincoln Lewis, who had used her phone to ""extensively and ruthlessly"" stalk the women. But Ms Moran said that was a ""pack of lies"". ""I'm telling you that I lived it and that's exactly what happened,"" Abdelmalek said. ""Because you always tell the truth,"" Ms Moran said. ""Oh, not always. I don't think everybody tells the truth a hundred per cent,"" Abdelmalek said. Abdelmalek's campaign of terror against Emma, an international flight attendant, started more than a decade ago. A former Home and Away star clashes with the lawyer of a woman who stole his identity to hoodwink her stalking victims, with a court being told that he feared the catfishing scandal could affect his career. In 2011, a few weeks after a bad break-up, Emma received a Facebook request from someone she believed to be Lincoln Lewis, an actor best known for his roles on Home and Away and Tomorrow When The War Began. Emma and the person behind the profile hit it off and it was not long before things took a romantic turn, and the pair began sending each other intimate photos and videos. But the parameters of their supposed relationship soon began to gnaw at Emma — every time they arranged to meet, there would be an excuse. It eventually raised enough doubts for her to contact an old friend who put her in touch with the actor. In September last year, the real Lincoln Lewis took to the witness stand and recalled the conversation. ""It's going to sound really weird saying it like this, have you and I been dating for the last couple of months,"" Lewis recalled Emma asking him. ""That really threw me, and I said, 'What? No, what are you talking about?' And that's when Emma started to sound really stressed and panicked … and then started saying, 'No, tell me you're lying, please tell me you're lying, Linc,'"" Lewis told the court. ""This person has photos and videos of me … I thought I was dating you,"" he recalled Emma telling him. In reality, the person behind the fake profile was Abdelmalek, who was photoshopping pictures of Lewis and stealing his voicemail. At one point during the appeal, Lewis pulled open the collar of his shirt to prove that a photo was fake. ""I have two really apparent moles like one's here on my collarbone,"" he said, gesturing. ""If it's not prominent on that photo, then to me, it looks doctored."" Emma eventually confronted the fake Lincoln Lewis who claimed to be a man called Michael Jason Smith, who said that he and his friends had set up a fake Facebook page for the actor and were talking to people as a joke. ""He said that things got out of hand and he became interested in me,"" Emma said. The pair began talking and eventually formed another romantic relationship, also completely online. It was then that Michael Jason Smith said that his real name was actually Danny Jason MacGreene, and that he had been using a fake name to escape an ex. But prosecutors say that none of those characters were real and, in reality, it was all Abdelmalek, who even went as far as staging a fake kidnapping of Michael Jason Smith. ""When she realised that you were not actually Lincoln Lewis, you created another deception to persuade her that you were Michael Smith, what do you say to that,"" said the prosecutor, Ms Moran. ""No,"" said Abdelmalek, under cross-examination. ""When she tried to pull away from you, you mercilessly exploited the fact that you had those intimate videos and images,"" the prosecutor said. ""No,"" she said. Witnesses told the County Court that the stalking campaign against Emma was relentless and cruel. Her father told the court that Emma was receiving up to 60 messages a day, even while she was overseas at work. ""There was no let up,"" he said. ""She used to stay with us the day before she travelled and this particular morning, I heard a bit of a commotion in the bathroom and I got up to investigate. ""I found my wife with [her] and [she] was crying and staring at her phone. She was all dressed up to go to work and she was just shaking like a leaf and sobbing."" Emma took her own life in 2018. Abdelmalek also targeted another woman, Jess, while pretending to be Lincoln Lewis. Like her other victim, Abdelmalek struck up an intense romantic relationship with Jess, and went as far as helping her victim's daughter with homework. She also convinced Jess to send intimate photos but, like with Emma, pulled out every time they were meant to meet. When Jess also became suspicious, she managed to contact the real Lincoln Lewis through a mutual friend and learned she had been scammed. She later convinced Abdelmalek to transfer her money for a broken phone screen as part of a sting with detectives, who managed to trace the cash back to the catfish. Abdelmalek was arrested at Victoria's maximum security Baron Prison in 2017, where she was a youth worker. During her appeal, she told a judge that she was also duped by a fake Lincoln Lewis, who she contacted on Facebook because she wanted to follow in his career footsteps. ""I wanted to become an actor. I think it was just a thing that I wanted to do and I started asking people on Facebook what acting classes I could possibly do,"" she said. Under cross-examination from her own lawyer, Abdelmalek said that she was told to transfer money into Jess' account by someone pretending to be Lewis. ""I had asked him, at the time, if I could pay him for his acting advice,"" Abdelmalek said. ""He gave me a bank account and he said that he didn't want the money. But there was somebody that he knew that was a single mum that was struggling and to put the money into this account and he'll pay it. ""And then I went into Westpac and deposited the money and they gave me a receipt."" When prosecutors put to Abdelmalek that a phone had been uncovered in her possession containing messages to Emma, intimate images of Emma, and Lincoln Lewis' voicemail, she shrugged it off. She said that the messages arrived on her phone when she recharged her credit balance. ""What you're saying is absolute fantasy land, it can't happen,"" the prosecutor, Ms Moran, said. ""You are the catfisher who created deception around these people to the point where they couldn't live their lives any more,"" the prosecutor put to her. ""No,"" Abdelmalek said. *Names and some details have been changed to protect victims.

150,Modern twists help familiar fairy tale Cinderella stand the test of time,arts-culture,"  Familiar fairy tale features modern twists in Australian production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella Cartoons, live actions, musicals and operas — the tale of Cinderella has been retold countless times. A simple search on the film and TV database IMDb yields hundreds of results. So, why do producers and audiences keep coming back to the all too familiar fairy tale? The exact origins of the rags to riches storyline are a little ambiguous. Some themes are thought to date back to ancient Greece but one of the most popular early versions was Charles Perrault's 1697 tale. Since then, it's been re-imagined dozens of times. The Brothers Grimm took a slightly darker approach in 1812. The story debuted in feature film form in Walt Disney's 1950 animation, Cinderella. Hilary Duff's 2004 modern-day take A Cinderella Story saw the heroine leave a mobile phone at a high school dance, not a glass slipper. Lily James's 2015 live-action Cinderella was a nod to the classic. Just six years later, it was followed by singer Camila Cabello's jukebox musical iteration. The latest film re-imagining, in case fans needed another, hit the Disney Plus streaming service earlier this month. Sneakerella features a male lead as well as the stepsisters and stepmother traded in for male versions of the characters. The tween-targetted tale received mixed reviews online. Acclaimed composers Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical rendition officially opens in Melbourne on Thursday night, with a few of its own modern-day twists. ""The version I remember as a child was the animated film. This version is a little different to that"" said the actor playing Ella, Shubshri Kandiah. ""She's no longer this kind of damsel in distress that we are used to seeing in our typical princesses, but she is a woman who is very much in charge of her own destiny. ""She choses the journey that she wants to take in this and I think that's really exciting. ""She shows a lot of insecurity and is very relatable at the start, but where she ends up, as a strong woman who knows that she is enough just as she is, it's really beautiful,"" Kandiah said. ""It's really an honour to be in this role."" ""It's so nice to get messages on Instagram from people of South Asian heritage saying it's so exciting to see you in this role,"" she said. ""A lot of people have experienced not seeing themselves on screen or on stage, so it's nice that that's finally coming up."" ""Shrubshri is opening up the world to this beautiful myth that we've heard so many times, and she's making it her own,"" said Josh Rhodes, the original Broadway choreographer. ""The fairy tale belongs to everyone now."" When asked why the story stands the test of time, Rhodes said: ""We always want to believe that we can always pull ourselves up, I think we all have been in dark places."" ""We're trying to bring everything that you want Cinderella to be, the glass slipper, the staircase, the dress, the magic, all of that entire tale, but we're trying to infuse it with a modern push for independence,"" said Mr Rhodes. ""At the end of the day, you're responsible for your destiny. ""Everyone needs to be a fairy godmother to someone … it's our job to push kindness into the world and I think that story will go on forever.""

151,The art of transforming marine rubbish to clean up an archipelago,arts-culture,"  Marine rubbish from the Abrolhos Islands is being transformed into art and beautifying the archipelago A pearl producer who founded a project that transforms marine junk into art says it is making a significant difference on the islands where volunteers collect the rubbish. Pia Boschetti said the idea was sparked after a clean-up at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands about 12 years ago when she and volunteers were wondering what to do with the rubbish they collected. A journalist suggested she let local artists use the junk, which included everything from old floats and ropes to bottle tops, plastic bottles, pieces of manufacturing wood and even the odd intact light globe. ""I automatically saw a vision of bringing the rubbish in, putting it on the wharf and artists coming down and taking it away and then bringing it back in the form of artwork that I could exhibit in my shop,"" Ms Boschetti said. Flotsam and Jetsam was born. Volunteers collect the rubbish which is brought from the islands back to Geraldton on a fishing boat then sorted on the wharf. At the sound of a siren, people take what they want to create their pieces. A month later they are put on show and prizes awarded. In Ms Boschetti's Marine Terrace store, the pieces on show this year include a Viking hat, a net ""tutu"", a giant seahorse and a jellyfish made from plastic bottle bases and rope which sparkles in the window, lit inside with fairy lights. She believes the focus has shifted over the years with more attention now paid to collecting smaller pieces of plastic. ""Now we actually concentrate on an area, and we are able to pick up all the small bits because it is these small bits that actually float around the ocean,"" Ms Boschetti said. ""Animals eat them, birds are eating them; they are finding bits of plastic in birds' tummies now."" Verity Pearce, who works in administration in an architecture business in Geraldton, loves the chance to get creative and have her work exhibited. She has won a prize with her wearable art and received a ""highly commended"" award. ""Seeing what people can create from nothing is amazing,"" Ms Pearce said. This year she created a ""water sprite"" costume with a tutu made of old rope and a bodice formed using net. ""I think it is like a community project; giving back to the community as well,"" she said. Want more local news? Sign up for the weekly ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt email newsletter Geraldton resident Glenda Blyth, who creates baskets from plants, switches to using ropes and other finds at Flotsam and Jetsam. ""I have been involved since day dot,"" she said. ""I just think it is such a wonderful concept, cleaning up, bringing it in, letting people come and pick it up, making something,"" she said.

152,Key works by Aboriginal artist William Barak heading back to Australia after New York auction,arts-culture,"  Descendants of William Barak buy two of his works at New York auction Descendants of prominent Wurundjeri artist William Barak have bought two of his culturally significant artworks at auction in New York, after a crowdfunding campaign and a last-minute intervention by the Victorian government. Auction house Sotheby's auctioned off the late 19th-century painting and shield on Thursday morning, Melbourne time. Both were believed to have been given to a Swiss family who had a strong friendship with William Barak and owned vineyards on Kulin Country, in what is now the Yarra Valley, in 1897. The painting sold for more than $530,000 and the parrying shield sold for more than $74,000. The Wurundjeri Woi-Wurrung Cultural Heritage Corporation set up a crowdfunding page to buy the artworks, and had a bidder in the room in New York. The group raised $117,627 through the page, and the Victorian government contributed $500,000 after a meeting late on Wednesday. There were also contributions from the City of Melbourne and Melbourne Airport. Wurundjeri elder Ron Jones, a descendent of William Barak, said he was watching the auction with tears in his eyes. ""I feel pumped, I tell you,"" he told the ABC's 7.30 program. ""We brought an ancestor's relic back to Australia where it belongs, and Uncle William Barak, what a tremendous man he was."" He said the artworks would go on display, and that he hoped all Victorians would get to see them. ""If people follow our history, it's a great learning tool to show that we didn't have a written history so Uncle William's paintings were depicting our culture and our history, through drawings. ""If people know how to read William Barak's paintings, he's telling the story of Wurundjeri people, not just Wurundjeri but all the people living on Coranderrk."" He said it was disappointing to see the artworks listed on the auction site. ""That was given as a gift to that family group, now if they no longer want to keep it in their possession, hand it back to those people, to that country,"" he said. William Barak was influential in the establishment of the Aboriginal farming community known as Coranderrk, in the colony of Victoria. Barak watched his father and uncles negotiate with the white settlers, and he witnessed the signing of John Batman's ""treaty"" for the land that became the cities of Melbourne and Geelong. Victoria's Minister for Creative Arts Danny Pearson said there would now be discussions with elders about how best to store and present the two works. ""We wanted these items to come home, that's why we've provided $500,000 to make that happen, and it's going to happen,"" he said. ""And on National Reconciliation Day, these priceless artefacts that provide a window into a time that stretches back tens of thousands of years — they're coming home where they belong."" He said the government would work with the Wurundjeri Corporation to get the works back to Australia and put them on display. Co-chair of the First Peoples' Assembly of Victoria and proud Nira illim bulluk man of the Taungurung nation, Marcus Stewart, welcomed the items returning home. ""We are pleased that these items will be returning home to the Wurundjeri people and look forward to this happening more often,"" he said. ""Repatriation of culturally significant items is important to our people, and it goes hand-in-hand with truth-telling and Treaty. ""With these items finally returning to Country, we are reminded that we need a permanent keeping place, such as that proposed by the Wurundjeri and the City of Melbourne."" The artworks' existence and their sale were only recently discovered by the Wurundjeri people. According to the Sotheby's catalogue, Jules de Pury returned home to Switzerland with the artworks. ""William Barak's two and three-dimensional artworks document Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung culture and speak to the survival of First Nations' traditions in defiance of colonisation,"" Dr Nikita Vanderbyl from La Trobe University wrote. The de Pury family still owns and runs the Yeringberg winery and vineyard in Coldstream, in the Yarra Valley. Sandra de Pury said the Coldstream branch of the de Pury family donated all the William Barak works they had to the Yarra Ranges Regional Museum years ago. ""We believe these artworks should come back to Australia because it's important, and we've been doing what we can to support it,"" she told the ABC. The Wurundjeri have not been in contact with the Swiss part of the de Pury family.

156,"Tom Cruise brings star power, real stunts and his iconic aviators to electrifying Top Gun sequel",arts-culture,"  Top Gun: Maverick sees Tom Cruise reprise star-making role more than three decades on Whatever you think of the man, you've gotta hand it to Tom Cruise the movie star. Over a 40-year career he's battled couches, motion-smoothing TVs, COVID set breaches and the spectre of professional obsolescence with a pathological zeal that's practically supernatural, channelling a brand of hotshot American idealism that's become almost endearing, or at least sufficiently cartoonish to be abstract. He might be the hardest working man in (movie) show business, but if the critical buzz surrounding his 36-years-in-the-making sequel Top Gun: Maverick is any indication, he's about to be tasked with his biggest challenge yet: single-handedly rescuing the blockbuster from the clutches of IP-enamoured corporations and their superhero cheerleaders. The movie that made Cruise a superstar, 1986's Top Gun is a quintessential artefact of Reaganite multiplex entertainment, a feature-length air force recruitment ad whose patriotic moves were offset by the seductiveness of its pitch – the magic-hour imagery, the sleek, Giorgio Moroder-produced soundtrack, the glistening homoeroticism mainlined in director Tony Scott's irresistible, MTV-era formalism. Top Gun: Maverick opens as if it's still 1986, awash in Harold Faltermeyer's hairspray synth metal and Kenny Loggins' air show perennial Danger Zone, brazenly signalling its intent to play as a beat-for-beat recreation of its predecessor, an unfiltered rush of adrenaline. Somewhere over the Mojave desert, Cruise's now middle-aged Captain Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell — aviators, leather jacket and star-spangled grin all intact — is clinging on as a supersonic test pilot for a spy plane program that's about to be folded in favour of drone warfare. He's an antique flyboy in the military ointment at a time when pilots are expendable; a movie star who still does their own stunts in the age of computer-generated body doubles. Despite being a decorated pilot and a war hero, Maverick is still pissing off a stern Rear Admiral (Ed Harris) with his antics, like a frat boy razzing the stuffy college dean — a man-child whose reckless need for speed has kept his career grounded. Nothing ages a character more than slipping into the costume of their youth, even someone wearing his years as well as Cruise; yesterday's tower-buzzing bad boy is today's nostalgia-ridden burnout, its yuppie teen pimp tomorrow's millionaire sex trafficker. ""The future is coming,"" growls the Rear Admiral, ""and you're not in it."" Lucky for Maverick, and for us, he's got One Last Shot. At the behest of his old wingman and now navy Admiral, Iceman – reprised, in a touching and graceful appearance, by Val Kilmer – the ageing ace is sent back to the Top Gun academy to train the navy's best fighter pilots for a mission that requires his particular set of cockpit skills. The assignment bears an unmissable, perhaps deliberate resemblance to the Death Star bombing mission in the original Star Wars: a squad of F/A-18 Super Hornet fighters, chosen for their radar-evading ability, have to fly low and fast through a mountain canyon and hit a tiny target in order to destroy a uranium plant in an unspecified location. With their shadowy planes, blacked-out helmets and made-up insignia, this faceless enemy might as well be Imperial TIE fighters, if not video game bogeymen. Near the San Diego base, Maverick reconnects with an old flame, Penny — Jennifer Connelly, in a canny bit of fellow 1986 movie icon casting — who's on hand to tend bar, dispense backstory and reassure him that all his mistakes can be forgiven. Everybody else could slide right in to a Cold War blockbuster: the base admirals (Jon Hamm, Charles Parnell) riding Maverick's ass; the cohort of cocky young fighter jockeys with call signs like Hangman (Glen Powell), Phoenix (Monica Barbaro) and Payback (Jay Ellis), whose towel-snapping banter would be right at home in a vintage James Cameron movie. Also on the team: Lieutenant Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw (Miles Teller), son of Maverick's late co-pilot, Goose (Anthony Edwards, in flashback), wearing the moustache and Hawaiian shirts of his old man and still sore about his dad's death — a moment that continues to haunt Maverick, too. With its electrifying action sequences and go-for-broke energy, Top Gun: Maverick is eager-to-please entertainment that throws back to the fist-pumping, star-powered blockbusters of Hollywood's 80s and 90s. Whenever the movie is in the air, it's rousing, genuinely exhilarating stuff. The aerial sequences, filmed, at Cruise's insistence, without digital effects and using real planes — the actors trained for g-force conditions, and in many instances operated the cockpit cameras themselves — quicken the pulse in ways that most contemporary blockbusters could never approach. Tops Arts & Culture headlines. Director Joseph Kosinski, who debuted with TRON: Legacy and helped goose Cruise's self-cloning fantasies in Oblivion, has a knack for finding the action's sweet centre of gravity. Top Gun: Maverick's dogfights pull you forward in your seat and push you back with the illusion of a flight simulator; the kind of immersive, first-person experience that — ironically, for a movie obsessed with analogue craft — is only replicated these days by virtual reality. But elsewhere the movie strains to manufacture a sense of emotion or a moral reckoning with the passage of time, its superego writing cheques that its body can't — and doesn't want to — cash. It's too busy rocking and rolling; the allure of the action too strong, the haze of nostalgia too thick. It's also a film that exists in a bubble of retrograde geopolitical fantasy, imagining the American military as underdogs and interventionist heroes, and oblivious — as any good throwback needs to be — to the complexities of the current global climate. Playing at reconciliation between surrogate fathers and sons, Top Gun: Maverick is a movie for middle-aged men desperate for validation as good dads; for a nation that yearns to see itself restored as heroes on the global stage (it's no coincidence that Maverick's P-51 Mustang, the aerial star of World War II, features prominently and triumphantly in the film's visual design). Cruise gets to be father and son, wise old vet and eternal youth: posing alongside both Rooster and Iceman as though time had collapsed in his presence; reclining with Connelly against a vintage Porsche like a forever-teenage bedroom pin-up. Yet if the first Top Gun was already juvenile catnip for a generation of moviegoers weaned on video games and Star Wars, it also had an eroticism and relative gender complexity that the sequel refuses to touch. Compare the former's relationship between Maverick and Kelly McGillis's older, more accomplished (and metatextually queer) flight instructor to the safe and sexless partnership with Connelly, a romance with all the chaste fumbling of an adolescent crush (at one point, Cruise even tumbles out of a second storey bedroom window, like a teenage boy on the run). The late Tony Scott's elegant trashiness — his lurid, loaded imagery — is absent; a good-natured variation on the original's infamous beach volleyball scene could be a commercial for health insurance, while Hans Zimmer's generic, over-determined score has none of the delirious lift of Faltermeyer's LinnDrum-driven, air guitar-ready cheese. (Lady Gaga's bombastic contribution, while perfectly fine, is no Take My Breath Away; but you already knew that.) For all of Top Gun: Maverick's breathless thrust, there's something disconcerting about its unwillingness to engage with anything beyond its feel-good vacuum. Just as the Russian MiGs in Top Gun were really repainted American F-5s, Top Gun: Maverick leaves the impression that these characters, more than ever, are waging a war against no one but themselves — against time and fading youth; against notions of global power that are as worn through as the tape belt on a Walkman. In this way Cruise really has rescued the blockbuster, even if it's less the future of cinema than the past in drag. Still — what a ride. Top Gun: Maverick is in cinemas now.

158,'They should be handing it back': Descendants of William Barak in fight to save rare artwork from auction,arts-culture,"  Wurundjeri people crowdfunding to buy rare Aboriginal artworks, return them to country Descendants of prominent Indigenous artist William Barak fear they will lose two rare artworks when they go under the hammer in New York on Wednesday. Auction house Sotheby's will auction off a 19th-century painting and a decorative shield. Both have been kept in the same Swiss family since their creation. The Wurundjeri Woi-Wurrung Cultural Heritage Corporation has set up a crowdfunding page to buy the artworks, and is in an 11th-hour push to secure the money. Uncle Ron Jones, an elder and a descendant of the artist, said the artworks belonged back on country. ""I'm quite sure that if William Barak was here today he would be totally unhappy that people are making money out of it,"" he said. So far, the group has raised just over $60,000, a long way from its goal of $1 million. The Sotheby's website lists Corroboree (Women in possum skin cloaks) at about $500,000 and the shield at about $36,000. The artworks' existence and their sale were only recently discovered by the Wurundjeri people. They believe the pieces were likely gifted in 1897 to Jules de Pury, a nephew of Baron Frédéric Guillaume de Pury, who had a strong friendship with William Barak and grew vineyards on Kulin Country. What makes these recently discovered pieces particularly unique is that they stayed in the de Pury family for about 125 years, according to La Trobe University historian Nikita Vanderbyl. ""The connection between Barak and the de Pury family make this provenance information so watertight and it's such a strong narrative that it is very different from previous examples that have come up at auction,"" Dr Vanderbyl said. ""If they've got a conscience, they should be handing it back to the traditional bloodlines of that family group,"" Wurundjeri Corporation treasurer Ron Jones said. The elders crowdsourced to save another artwork in 2016, but the bids for the piece, titled Ceremony, far exceeded what they thought was needed, creating heartbreak for the community. They hope that does not happen again. Mr Jones grew up hearing the stories of the late artist from his grandmother and mother — Barak's grandniece. ""He was very short in size but big in stature,"" Mr Jones explained. Barak was influential in the establishment of an Aboriginal farming community known as Coranderrk, in the colony of Victoria. Mr Jones's grandmother recalled how Barak made their community self-sufficient with food, and arranged a cow for fresh milk. Barak watched his father and uncles negotiate with the white settlers. And he witnessed the signing of John Batman's ""treaty"" for the land that became the cities of Melbourne and Geelong. Mr Jones heard ""how he was so respected"" even among European colonisers. Ngurungaeta (headman) Barak painted his traditions and ceremonies as a way of preserving his culture at a time when ceremonies were banned. Dr Vanderbyl completed a PhD on the artist and was asked to write the descriptors for Sotheby's auction. ""This is a moment when Aboriginal people were accommodating, or adjusting, or fighting colonisation — all of these things were happening at once,"" Dr Vanderbyl explained. ""They came into the colonial world but they brought people like the de Pury family into their world."" There are 52 known Barak paintings and drawings, and Mr Jones explained: ""They tell a complete story."" ""We never had a written language,"" he said. ""Remember all our language was done by oral [communication], so that would be a way of telling people — storytelling by painting."" ""That fundraiser is to bring something back home that belongs to our history here, not just for the Wurundjeri people but for education so that everyone can enjoy it."" Dr Vanderbyl agreed the artworks should be back on country. ""These are regarded by the Wurundjeri as their national treasures,"" she said. In 2015 an exhibition called Oil Paint and Ochre combined archives from the Australian part of the de Pury family, which had donated its artworks to the Yarra Ranges Regional Museum at Lilydale. The Wurundjeri have not been in contact with the Swiss part of the de Pury family. Mr Jones told The Drum he felt ""let down"" by all levels of government. ""If they are talking about Treaty and bringing us all together, let the government show a bit of faith … let's bring it back home."" The Wurundjeri Corporation asked for a meeting with Victoria's Aboriginal Affairs Minister, Gabrielle Williams, but was not successful. A Victorian government spokesperson said it acknowledged the artworks were invaluable to the Wurundjeri people, but the responsibility for the protection and repatriation of significant cultural objects from overseas lay with the Commonwealth. However, the entirety of the new federal government will not be sworn in until next week. For these works, it will be too late.

159,'I've been looking forward to this': Controversial Captain Cook statue removed after half a century,arts-culture,"  Statue of Captain James Cook removed from Sheridan Street, Cairns by new owner It has been a controversial sight in Far North Queensland for nearly 50 years, but an 8-metre-tall statue of Captain James Cook has now begun its ""final tour"". The statue beside the Cairns thoroughfare of Sheridan Street was taken down from its roadside perch at the northern entrance to the regional city on Tuesday. The block of land it has long called home is slated to become a James Cook University teaching hospital. Demolition contractor Martin Anton bought the rights to dismantle and remove the controversial statue for one dollar, and said he had ""a little bit of butterflies with expectation"". Gimuy Walubara Yidinji man, Isaac, observed the removal of the statue he described as ""a very ugly representation of this country"". ""Hopefully it doesn't get put up anywhere near Cairns,"" he said. The statue's removal was twice postponed due to wet weather. ""I've been looking forward to this for a very, very long time and it's finally here,"" Mr Anton said. ""It's his last stand."" Mr Anton said there were lots of challenges associated with the demolition ahead of the statue's ""final tour"". ""We've got the best people in the business from every walk of life,"" he said. ""It's a team effort and we just want to get it down safely and move on from there."" The statue was removed with a large crane and placed on a truck. On Wednesday, it will be taken out of Cairns on the Palmerston Highway through Atherton, Mareeba and across the Tablelands region to a property in Mount Molloy. But it has not yet been decided what the future holds for Captain Cook. ""He's just going to be located on site for storage purposes until the structural engineers have had a chance to go right over him and make sure he's as good now as he was 50 years ago,"" Mr Anton said.

160,"'Measure many times, cut once': Original steel used in artistic homage to old Batemans Bay bridge",arts-culture,"  Old Batemans Bay bridge gains new life as sculpture using steel from original structure When the old Batemans Bay bridge was torn down last year, its replacement was a welcome update for the many hundreds of locals and visitors who use it every day. But there was a lot of love for the old steel structure that spanned the Clyde River for 65 years, and the community made it clear to Transport NSW that it wanted a tribute to the bridge once it was removed. Almost a year after the call went out, a sculpture cast from the original steel will be complete this week; its final destination just metres from where the bridge stood. The bottom half of the almost six-metre-high artwork by Sydney artist Joel Adler is made from the original trusses that held up the structure. ""From one angle it looks like a series of bridges, and from another angle the idea is that it looks like a tidal chart,"" Mr Adler said. ""I started to realise that the motif of the ocean and the river and the curves and the waves, especially with a material that is so unforgiving like steel, is really interesting."" It has been a high-stakes job and the old material was difficult to work with. ""When we started working on the steel, the rest of the bridge had been demolished, so we knew very well that we had to measure it many times and cut once,"" Mr Adler said. The team measured the material in inches because that was the standard used during construction of the bridge in the 1950s. ""The manufacturing techniques we have now are better and you get smoother edges and sharp corners, but it's not as beautiful that way I think,"" Mr Adler said. Six-and-a-half tonnes of steel was trucked up to Sydney, where Mr Adler used a method known as nesting to map out the separate pieces on the material. Nesting uses 3D modelling to work out where the pieces should be cut out on the steel, minimising waste. ""They were then put through high-tech fancy plasma cutters, which built a modelling 3D version of the steel before making the first cut,"" Mr Adler said. ""It was all pretty well automated, which was amazing to see, especially on such old material."" Want more local news? Sign up for the weekly ABC South East NSW email newsletter The sculpture was designed in eight parts so that it could be trucked back to the coast. ""As you can imagine, it's not an easy thing to move,"" Mr Adler said. The decades-old material was finished in the same style as the old bridge, down to the colour of the paint (bridge grey). Mr Adler hopes the piece has retained the charm of the old bridge which was loved by so many. ""I'm keen to see what people think, and I really encourage locals to get up close to it and feel the old steel. ""The old bridge is made in a very different way to the new bridge, and I think a lot of people loved it for that … the old steel, being able to keep a piece of that on the bay within metres of where the old bridge used to land, is very special.""

161,"David Bowie, Kylie Minogue, Paul McCartney: Robert Rosen has snapped celebrities in their most unguarded moments",arts-culture,"  Photographer Robert Rosen snaps celebrities in unguarded moments — often with their permission Over the course of his four-decades long career, Robert Rosen had countless, fleeting, late-night encounters with iconic household names. Retire to the eclectic environs of the RN Drive Drawing Room, for music, musings and unexpected conversations. Often, it would be at a party or nightclub and usually he would be holding a glass of champagne and a pocket camera. The social and fashion photographer snapped the likes of Grace Jones, Nina Simone and David Bowie, often capturing them in unguarded moments. And his secret to getting those remarkable shots? ""You've got to be invisible at times or just blend in,"" Rosen tells ABC RN's The Drawing Room. One of those celebrities — someone whose print recently sold for nearly US$200 million — influenced the direction of his career. ""I met Andy Warhol in 1980 in London. I was invited to a party for him and I watched him doing Polaroids — and I was inspired,"" Rosen recalls. ""After the meeting … I rang Polaroid in London … and said that I wanted to do a collection of autographed Polaroids of famous people."" The photography company sent him a camera and an unlimited amount of its iconic instant film. Since then, he's snapped hundreds of portraits of celebrities at parties and nightclubs, both on Polaroid and regular film. A new survey of his work, Glitterati, is currently on display at Sydney's Powerhouse Museum, and it collects the best images from his lifetime behind the lens. Rosen was often a welcome guest at parties and nightclubs, and the well-known subjects of his photos were happy to pose. While he enjoyed photographing celebrities, he says he also relished capturing affectionate moments between them, something he could only do when he blended in with everyone else. ""I would just put the camera in my pocket, and the security or whoever's on the door just waved me through — which is what happened with the Paul McCartney photo, the kissing photo,"" he says. ""I just love to see people kissing and that affection and warmth [spilling out] into the room. ""If I was talking to someone at a party, I'm always looking over their shoulder. And so, if I see somebody about to kiss, I'll just say to [the person I'm talking to], 'excuse me', and I'll rush over and do the photo, and then go back and continue our conversation."" Rosen grew up in suburban Melbourne, after his family emigrated from South Africa in 1960. After high school, he studied photography at Prahran Technical College but pulled out after a teacher pressured him to take a more commercial approach. He enjoyed capturing interesting characters and so, not wanting to be deterred from his own style, he jumped at the opportunity to move to Kings Cross in Sydney. ""Kings Cross was in the middle of it with the prostitutes on the street, the drag queens in the little nightclubs and stuff like that. And I thought, 'Wow, this is it. I want to be here',"" he says. He also wanted to be a fashion photographer and started off as a freelancer but didn't get much work in Sydney. So in 1975, he moved to London and began traipsing around the city, showing his portfolio to well-known photographers. Getting a foot in the door proved to be harder than he initially thought, and he couldn't afford to get his own studio, so he worked as a barman on the Kings Road. The city's nightlife offered many opportunities. ""I had a wonderful girlfriend who was very social, and we would go out nearly every night to the fashionable restaurants and into the nightclubs like the Embassy Club,"" he says. It was at this venue that he noticed photographers taking pictures of the celebrities who frequented the place. The photographers would sell them to the newspapers the next day. So Rosen decided to try it too. ""I took my little camera and started photographing [the celebrities] and because they knew me, because I was there every night, [they were happy to pose],"" he says. The owner of the club liked his non-intrusive style and soon made him the Embassy Club's official photographer. Here, and at many other London venues, he would snap many of his candid celebrity photographs. Building celebrity connections played a large role in his career, but it wasn't all glitz and glamour. When he was living in London, he'd sometimes attend up to six parties or openings each night. ""My working day would start about 6pm in the evening. I'd go to an art gallery opening or a book launch, or something like that. Then [I'd] go for a dinner at some fabulous restaurant, and then hit the nightclubs until three or four in the morning,"" he recalls. ""Then we'd go for breakfast in Piccadilly in one of those hotels, and then go home and go to bed at about 9am or 10am."" He laughs at the memories. ""I'm still alive. Hell, now I still can't sleep until about 2am."" Rosen went on to work for various fashion magazines, including Vogue Australia. He would often photograph fashion shows with his trademark style. ""That started the fashion career of doing catwalks, doing the London shows and then going to the Paris shows,"" he says. After living in London for some time, he returned home to Australia and began working for Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. But after working for the fashion magazines for 35 years, Rosen retired. He now lives in Bali, a far cry from the hustle and bustle of London. ""It gets a bit tiring, you know, those all-night things and stuff. And I just thought, well, I've done all that I can or all that I want."" Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.

""Families that have been at the library for story time can come over to enjoy the outdoor precinct here at GPAC as well,"" Latrobe City Mayor Kellie O'Callaghan said. ""We're acutely aware of the connections between the other spaces we have in the creative precinct, and how they intersect with the CBD — it's very much an opportunity for people to gather."" The GPAC complex serves as an upgrade from the old 227-seat Latrobe Performing Arts Centre built in 1972, now known as The Little Theatre. With a 25-metre-high fly tower and stage as big as the Arts Centre in Melbourne, the 750-seat, two-tier, accessible theatre also features a soundproof viewing box. This was designed for theatregoers who are sensitive to light and noise stimulation, have vocal ticks or difficulties remaining still for the duration of a performance. There is also an accessible ticket pricing model. Latrobe City Deputy Mayor  Dan Clancy said the facility would make concession tickets available to anyone in the community experiencing financial challenges. ""There should be no barrier to anyone within our community to access the theatre,"" Cr Clancy said. ""You ring up or you book online, and you say 'I'm after the full price' or 'I'm after the accessible price'. No questions asked."" However, venue accessibility and viability for cash-strapped local artists and performance groups hoping to hire the theatre remains a work in progress. Local theatre director Phillip A Mayer, of the Here There and Everywhere Theatre Company, questioned the viability of building a 750-seat theatre in a town where much of the local patronage is driven by smaller-scale community productions. ""The big space is inaccessible to us, and they've put the prices up at the Little Theatre,"" Mr Mayer said. ""The reality is that we're just going to have to use smaller venues that will do door deals."" With household budgets tightening as the cost of living soars, Mr Mayer believed GPAC would struggle to attract big shows that fill the seats. ""Most people around here will go to Melbourne to see the big shows,"" he said. Cr Clancy insisted council was monitoring the market threshold for GPAC's Corporate, Educational and Community hire rates, and producers were welcome to negotiate with the venue. He suggested groups requiring financial support investigate partnership arrangements with local organisations, or whether their show meets the funding requirements of Creative Victoria and Regional Arts Victoria. In much the same way that Traralgon has become synonymous with world class junior tennis, as a training ground for stars of the future, Latrobe City Council hoped the shire would develop a reputation as a creative industries training hub. ""Tech Connect is a partnership between the Arts Centre Melbourne, which is a Registered Training Organisation for training across Victoria,"" Cr Clancy said. ""Traditionally, people had to go to Box Hill TAFE 20 years ago to get their Certificate II in lighting or sound design, or their riggers ticket. ""Now they can do it through the Arts Centre Melbourne, but they don't have to go to Melbourne, they can come here to Gippsland."" Cr Clancy said The Little Theatre building would serve as a training centre, with technicians, sound designers, set designers and engineers from all across Victoria coming to Gippsland to do their training. ""It's really good for Gippsland, for the technicians who work and live here but also the people who stay extra nights, buy meals and things in the stores here,"" he said. ""It's an economic driver that starts to change the landscape within all of Gippsland, not just here in Latrobe.""

163,"Angela's alpaca fleece weaving doesn't 'follow the rules', and nor does her life",arts-culture,"  Alpaca farmer leaves corporate job for farm life and the art of Japanese Saori weaving West Gippsland's Angela Betheras remembers the day she said, ""Dad, I'd like to be a farmer"". ""Well, you better get a job and earn some money because you're not getting mine,"" her late father John Betheras replied. And so a career in Melbourne beckoned. ""I was a corporate girl. My last role was international supply chain manager for Coles Myer,"" Angela says. She eventually found her way back to the land, near where she spent her childhood on her parents' Charolais cattle property at Labertouche, over an hour east of the city. ""My dad never really let us ride the tractors or things like that,"" she says. Fencing, he said, was ""really boring"". ""I curse him. He's no longer alive, but when I have to fix a fence I go, 'Why didn't you just let me do fencing when I was little?' Then I could fix the damn fence myself,"" Angela says. Angela now runs Nickelby at Darnum, an alpaca farm at Yarragon, almost entirely on her own. She has a little help from Betty, her Massey Ferguson tractor, and a strong network of contractors she has built up over about 15 years. ""They're guys that I can trust because a lot of people want to rip women off on farms,"" she says. The farm fence is by no means where her business ends. A childhood spent mostly on horseback set Angela up for a lifetime of hard work, risk-taking and entrepreneurial thinking. When the ""bottom fell off the beef market"", she remembers her parents warning their children they would need to tighten their belts again. At four years old, she replied: ""If we tighten our belts any further, we're just not going to be able to breathe"". ""My family quote me all the time,"" Angela says. ""I worked in a tin garage selling hot dogs and pies and pasties from grade five right through to second year uni. I never had weekends off."" She had her own business ideas too – one being selling seashells at the beach to her friends, whose parents did not appreciate the clever business idea. Angela now has about 50 alpacas, which provide the fleece for garments she designs and sells in her Yarragon store. She dyes and weaves the fibres herself too, with a lot of washing and drying in between. ""So I think I work for about $5 an hour,"" she says. Fortunately, she finds the alpacas intelligent and easy to farm. ""You don't herd them up, they just follow you like a Pied Piper. They're very intriguing,"" she says. ""People say, you could be earning big bucks in Melbourne, but I go, 'How boring's that?' ""I'm doing something I love. I have no money, but this is how I want to spend my life. ""I don't tend to follow the rules of anything."" This character trait led her to Japan in 2016 to study a design movement that celebrates the free and unique. ""I'm not good at following patterns,"" Angela says. She met the late founder of Saori weaving, Misao Jo, who was 103 years old and did not speak at the time. ""[Misao Jo] took a liking to me. I don't know whether she thought I was funny or whatever, but she kept coming up to me and giving me cuddles,"" she says. The Saori movement started by accident, literally, when Misao Jo created a flawed kimono sash. Her work was rejected, but Misao Jo saw beauty in its human quality. ""It's all about design, there are no mistakes, humans aren't machines, we create,"" Angela says. ""I see it like painting on a loom and every piece being different."" Today, the practice carries on without its founder despite there being only three registered Saori teachers in Australia. Angela employs Saori philosophy in all her work. For example, someone might order a black and white scarf. ""I'll have to say, I'm really sorry, there's a spot of red in there,"" she says. Angela was diagnosed with melanoma in 2018 and undergoes treatment at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne. A central Victorian woman is one of only three accredited teachers of a Japanese form of freestyle weaving that is beginning to grow in popularity. Although she has been highly independent in her career, cancer has taught her to accept more help. ""When I was diagnosed with my cancer, a lot of [contractors] came out and helped me spray and things like that, which was lovely,"" she says. But she makes sure a day trip to Melbourne for treatment is a special event. ""Everyone is working, waiting for their holidays. I don't actually look to go on holidays,"" she says. ""If I took a week off, it would be to go back to Japan … I'd do a crawl around the country going to wool shops — that is my life. Or go and see another alpaca breeder or go and check out some fertiliser."" But she admits, her work style is ""pretty manic"". ""My studio … has fibre all over the floor, threads, bits that I've cut and chopped yarn everywhere,"" she says. ""Sometimes I think I'd just love to be an author and I could sit somewhere in a cafe with a laptop, that would be so nice instead of this mess that I create everywhere.""

165,Remote WA art gallery welcomes visitors back after two years of COVID isolation,arts-culture,"  A world-renowned art gallery in a small Kimberley community has reopened to the public after a prolonged closure due to the pandemic. Warmun Arts Centre was closed for two years and two months after Aboriginal communities in Western Australia were placed into mandated closure to non-residents. While access was still restricted to Indigenous communities, Warmun's acclaimed art centre was on the outskirts of the community, on a riverbank opposite residents, and would operate under strict COVID protocols. ""It's exciting,"" art centre manager Melissa Callanan said of the May 16 reopening. ""I want to pay a play tribute to the elder group in the community because we had an extraordinarily high vaccination rate, which has ultimately made this possible."" The gallery used the two years of closure to reinvigorate its interior, repainting walls, improving curation skills of locals and showing works through new virtual software. Artists painted from home, with supplies of canvas, brushes and paints dropped off in bundles. Like many remote art centres, it also boosted online sales during the pandemic. ""We've done well in the closure time, we've actually done incredibly well. We've maintained our sales,"" Ms Callanan said. Surprisingly the strong demand from galleries for the centre's more expensive works by Elders and senior artists, which are not usually sold through online methods, also held up. ""In the first year of lockdown we held 28 exhibitions — two in London, one in Berlin plus Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide."" ""Our Elders are extremely well recognised nationally and internationally,"" Ms Callanan said. ""People like Shirley Purdie, she had a major acquisition through the Museum of Contemporary Art and was showing there last year and she had a sell-out exhibition in Sydney. ""And of course, we have Mabel Juli, who we call our rock star and we have constant requests for commissions of her very famous Moon and Star which is at the Museum of Contemporary Art and also held by the National Gallery of Australia."" Ms Callanan said the gallery, owned by the Gija people, had worked hard to maintain profits returning to the community, because external galleries would deduct commissions. ""Last year we thought we have to start to work harder to make more direct sales, because that's better for the community members and better for artists,"" she said. ""A lot of the major art fairs went online last year. That means those sales come to us directly."" Warmun's artists have strong connections to their heritage and country, and have overcome adversity, including when the gallery was rebuilt after floods ripped through in March 2011. The board was keen to welcome visitors back but visitors must follow COVID-19 prevention guidelines, including taking a rapid test, which will be provided free of charge.

166,How growing up in a country town is giving these fashion designers a cutting edge,arts-culture,"  Three fashion designers from regional NSW join sustainability push Cameron Robert McCormick is a household name in Manilla, which, admittedly, is a town of only a few thousand. He is well-known for teaming up with the local leather maker to create heels inspired by Lady Gaga, dressing girls in custom frocks, and using his fashion-forward mother as one of his models. While not necessarily a thriving fashion hub, with just one clothing store which also doubles as a hardware shop, McCormick still found opportunities to express himself and feed his passion. ""I was always interested in fashion and dressing up, like, I really loved book week at school,"" he said. ""There used to be Vogue magazines at the newsagent's and I think they got in one or two a month and I would be one of the ones who bought it,"" he said. The 26-year-old is broadening his reach after launching his eponymous label. He moved back home during the pandemic and has used the opportunity to launch his brand which is centred around made-to-order pieces to ensure accessibility and sustainability. ""The country has given me space,"" he said. ""I have been able to set up a studio here and I am able to focus a lot more of my time into it because I am not travelling the fast-paced rush of Sydney."" His homecoming and the launch of his first line have been made even more special by talented childhood friends and a widower who donated a shed full of fabric. The floral vintage prints in his collection are as authentic as they look. ""It was basically an entire storage shed of fabric because she [the late wife] was a quilter,"" he said. ""She had sadly passed away and he thought I would be the best person to have it so I used a lot of her fabrics in my first collection."" He also enlisted three friends to model, photograph, and provide makeup and a farm location for his collection's first shoot. McCormick's label was woven with the support of his family and his community. ""My biggest fans have kind of been from home you know, they are the ones that have kept tabs on you,"" he said. McCormick isn't alone in the quest to produce high-end fashion sustainably from regional NSW. Meg Wilcher also seized every opportunity to dress up during her school years. Her favourite form of rebellion during her teenage years in Tamworth was the clothes she wore. The 28-year-old Melbourne-based fashion designer would pack an extra pair of clothes on mufti-days to put on once she left the family home. ""I think I have always had this inner rebellious side that just hates feeling trapped or conforming,"" she said. ""There's photos of me when I was five and my favourite outfit was a double belt singlet, mini skirt, leopard print, with multiple butterfly clips in my hair."" Interestingly, the designer did not stick with textiles as a subject despite learning how to sew from her mother who was a textiles teacher. Wilcher put the decision down to creative differences with teachers. But the move was an early display of her unwavering commitment to expressing her authentic self which has helped guide her in the world of fashion. Wilcher's time with major brands exposed her to the realities of mass production and the damaging effect the industry has on the environment, but it also spurred her on to help create change. ""[I was] being slapped in the face with all of these extreme examples of textile waste creating these garments with a huge footprint that wouldn't sell,"" she said. ""I could use my platform and voice to set an example and standards."" Wilcher is working towards what she believes should be the norm, bringing her label, Après Studios, entirely onshore to improve sustainability. But the process has not been easy or cheap, especially when some brands still aren't getting onboard. ""I am forever walking this tightrope but the greater the demand, the greater the supply,"" she said. Wilcher is not only considerate of her impact on the environment, but of the people who want to wear her clothes. ""I have a pretty strong gut feeling towards creating things that fit a purpose to begin with, trying to do it as responsibly as possible, but also in a way that is as inclusive as possible,"" she said. She is now balancing ethical fashion with a new vision for her label too, one that put the spotlight on mental health. ""My brand shift is moving a little more towards dressing for your mood and honouring how you feel and checking in on others."" Elizabeth Murray grew up in Nemingha, just outside of Tamworth, where she learnt to sew at the age of four and went onto complete a highly competitive TAFE fashion course. The young designer said she found her style during the course, but it was her grandmother's flare for fashion that first inspired her. She said her grandmother was ""always wearing matching colours, and matching pinks"". ""We would always get ready for church and my grandma would always dress us up."" The pair explored styles at op shops, but some of the threads they picked up were deemed a little too loud to debut on the main street and were reserved for her grandmother's house. ""The Vinnies in Tamworth was insane, it is one of the best op shops ever,"" she said. Thrifting remains a strong part of her personal mission statement as a way of limiting waste, getting creative and not becoming consumed by the lure of a new outfit for every occasion. ""People need to realise that just having a set wardrobe of a few things is fine, you don't have to have a new outfit every single time,"" she said. Murray is taking a year off after the intensity of finishing her fashion course during the coronavirus pandemic. When her label is ready to launch, she plans for it to be Australian made to create local jobs and to ensure it does its bit to reduce the industry's carbon footprint. But there's one thing she wants consumers to do now to help the cause to tread more lightly on this planet. ""My brand is definitely going to be about things that you can wear over and over again and if you need something to spice it up ... go to the op shop,"" she said.

167,'The reason you are watching a woman anchor': Leigh Sales pays tribute to 'trailblazer' journalist Caroline Jones,arts-culture,"  Caroline Jones remembered as trailblazing journalist and generous mentor Former ABC journalist Caroline Jones has been remembered as a groundbreaking broadcaster who embraced her role as a mentor to others later in her career. Jones died this week aged 84. Caroline Jones is remembered as a warm and kind person with a wicked sense of humour, but perhaps her biggest legacy is the strides she made for women in media and television. In a career spanning more than 50 years, Jones was the first female reporter on ABC current affairs show This Day Tonight, the first woman to anchor Four Corners, and was associated with Australian Story since its inception in 1996. Current and former journalists from across the ABC and beyond have shared their memories of Jones as a ""generous"" woman who broke a new path for women in Australian media. Former Insiders presenter Barrie Cassidy said was ""one of the first presenters on the ABC with genuine star qualities"". ""So much talent yet so humble and dignified,"" he said. Norman Swan, physician and ABC health broadcaster, said he worked most closely with Jones on Radio National's Search for Meaning program. ""Caroline had moved away from journalism to exploring how we find meaning in life. It was her journey too,"" he said. ""What I saw was a gritty, determined and highly polished broadcaster who knew what she wanted to achieve and did it.  It was what made her very special."" 7.30 host and anchor of the ABC's federal election coverage, Leigh Sales, began the evening with a poignant tribute to Jones. ""The reason you are watching a woman anchor the ABC's federal election coverage tonight is because trailblazers like Caroline Jones did the heavy lifting over decades,"" Sales said. ""Her list of firsts for a female reporter are too lengthy to mention, but along with her journalism, she was a great encourager of her colleagues and we pay tribute to her incredible public service, her grace and her impeccable character."" Many others who she worked with, mentored and inspired took to social media to share their tributes.

168,"The 'bag ladies' who have upcycled donated fabric into nearly 19,000 bags",arts-culture,"  'Bag ladies' upcycle donated fabric into nearly 19,000 bags in fight against plastic. Their charge? Nothing Mary Banks was 33 years old in 1965. A lot was happening back then — the Vietnam War, a dance craze called ""the twist"" and the first polyethylene shopping bag. Hailing from Sweden, single-use plastic bags spread beyond Europe into the United States and eventually Kingston, Mary Banks' seaside hometown on South Australia's Limestone Coast. A cheaper alternative to cloth and paper bags, she remembers their arrival clearly. ""Well, to start with, they were fantastic. We thought it was just wonderful,"" Mary says. ""And now here we are trying to get rid of them."" Now well into retirement, Mary is part of an unexpected, yet devoted, force combating the use of single-use plastics. Kingston SE Small Steps, affectionately known around town as the ""bag ladies"", turn donated materials into hand-sewn recyclable bags. When local Liz Wingard founded the group in October 2019, she thought they'd make a few hundred. Prior to South Australia's single-use plastic ban, one of Kingston's supermarkets was issuing 3,000 plastic bags a week. A large amount for a small community with roughly 2,000 people. ""So our aim was definitely to reduce them,"" Liz says. The group's gone on to make nearly 18,000 shopping bags and 8,500 produce bags out of recycled materials — everything from old curtains to tea towels and duvet covers. ""We have had donations of all sorts of things. And we know that a lot of the material that we get would normally have gone into landfill,"" Liz says. ""We're able to save that and recirculate it, reuse it, and hopefully encourage others to do the same thing."" Meeting at a retirement village every Monday for several hours, it takes five women roughly 15 minutes to make each recycled shopping bag. ""We have people who cut the fabric, someone who stitches the handles, and the next person turns the handles for us. Then we stitch the bags, we overlock bags, we give the bags back. And then they're ready to go,"" Liz says. ""We have a number of girls who take bags home to do work at home [too]."" Starting in the supermarket, the bags are now offered free-of-charge in two-thirds of Kingston's small businesses. As well as making the bags, they offer an amnesty box at both the supermarkets where people can return the bags they've used. ""We encourage people to bring them back … providing the quality is still there,"" Liz says. ""We wash them, re-iron them and put them back into circulation again."" While the environmental impact would be enough to motivate many of the women to take part, it's the social element that keeps them there. Of the women involved in Small Steps, several live alone. For Mary, who lives at the retirement village, the passing of her husband was hard. ""It'll be eight years in October he's been gone. And we did everything together,"" Mary says. ""You just have to get out … there's a variety of people who don't socialise [here] but I think it's a good part of life."" Despite not being a sewer herself, Mary makes herself useful. ""I iron, I turn handles, I make coffee. Not that it's that good a coffee really,"" Mary says. ""It's a lovely group and we have lots of fun. And at the same time we're doing things. ""It would be easy to just sit and do nothing, but I decided that wouldn't help anybody or my family. So I do things."" Mary represents the higher end of the age spectrum. There are some younger women in the group. Having owned her own fabric shop, Clair, from Melbourne, was glad to find the Bag Ladies when she moved to Kingston earlier this year. ""It was interesting at first because as a quilter we deal in precision and [with] the bags we're dealing in quantity,"" Clair says. When homesickness fell, the group made all the difference. ""They've just turned everything upside down and made it lovely, they're wonderful,"" Clair says. ""Having just moved here and knowing nobody, not a soul, Liz has hooked me up with all the clubs and activities, every interest that I mooted. ""I think she's a centre, she's somebody who binds a lot of things together."" These days the bag ladies show no sign of stopping. Far from an exclusive group, their doors are open to any who are interested in joining. ""If there's ever any younger people who would like to learn a skill we have skilled people here that would be more than happy to show you the ropes,"" Liz says. ""They're all a really friendly, giving group of people with practical skills, practical advice.""

169,Should your doctor be prescribing art therapy to help your mental health?,arts-culture,"  Could art on prescription be the key to turning around mental ill health? Australia has one of the highest rates of mental ill health in the world. We book in time with our GP for mental health concerns more often than any other ailment. One in four of us will experience an anxiety disorder during our lifetime, and one in 10 will experience depression. The statistics paint a pretty bleak picture, but what if actually painting the picture is part of the solution? Bronwyn has always been skeptical about art therapy. She says it conjures images of privilege and pretension. ""It's a little bit wanky,"" she says, laughing. ""I kind of associate it with hipsters living in the inner city or wealthy white mums who are, like, stressed about their divorce settlement."" Bronwyn has had anxiety for most of her life, and developed PTSD after the sudden death of her brother on flight MH17 in 2014. She says the trauma she experienced means her anxiety is life-long. Even though she has a great psychologist, she was on the lookout for additional strategies to help manage it. ""Anxiety for me is something that's permanent and it's something that ebbs and flows,"" she said. ""There are periods of time when my anxiety is so heightened that talking therapy doesn't cut it, nothing cuts it, so I wanted to try something completely different. ""Also because I had some surface-level judgements about it, I wanted to put my money where my mouth is."" So, she did what she never thought she'd do. She signed on for art as therapy. Bronwyn was one of seven people from very different walks of life who signed on for an experimental program on ABC TV. It's called Space 22, and follows the seven Australians through different creative outlets such as photography, painting and singing to judge what benefits these activities can provide. If successful, the program would add to the growing calls for time engaged in the arts to be part of treatments doctors and other healthcare providers in Australia could prescribe. Space 22 follows seven strangers, each with their own lived experience of mental ill health, as they take part in an ambitious experiment to test if participating in art can help them heal. When Bronwyn walked into the art space with her fellow test subjects, her initial feelings were that of severe discomfort. ""I was really nervous and overwhelmed,"" she said. ""And I was very aware of the fact that I was with a bunch of people that I don't know."" After some initial reservations, the group began to bond over their shared experiences of mental ill health as they were guided through a range of creative outlets. Bronwyn found painting and drawing made the biggest impact on her. ""I realised a big part of it is that the focus is on the process of creating rather than the final product,"" she said. ""I found it so freeing."" Very quickly, Bronwyn found herself turning to drawing to calm her nerves for the day ahead. ""When we'd arrive in the morning, I'd just go straight in and get a piece of paper and pencils or chalk or whatever was there and start doodling until we started,"" she said. ""It was instantly calming for me because it took my focus away from the space and the cameras and the whole thing and just onto what I was doing."" She says the creative outlet is another tool in her arsenal for managing anxiety. ""I've been taught these skills and I now have the resources to, like, self-administer, in a way. ""And by that I mean literally sit down and do a drawing or painting."" Katherine Boydell, a professor of mental health at the Black Dog Institute, oversaw the experiment and says creative activities have a unique effect on the brain and the body. ""There are many studies, a burgeoning literature really, on the relationship between art and mental health and wellbeing,"" Dr Boydell says. ""It's everything from biophysiological studies, like how do your cortisol levels change in response to painting or singing? What about blood pressure, heartbeat? ""There are all sorts of measures that show the arts have an impact on us physically."" She says being engaged in the creative process helps us move past some of the intrusive thoughts and feelings mental ill health can stimulate. ""As you're engaged in the act of creating, it gives the brain an opportunity to shut out the busyness and the unwanted thoughts from anxiety — it's all pushed aside to focus on that outlet,"" she says. But there was another benefit Dr Boydell observed occurring throughout the experiment: a sense of community. ""Watching the cast working together, at least half of the activities involved group work. And so, what you observe happening are these very human connections, these sharing experiences even though [the individuals] are quite different. And so that creates a sense of 'I am not alone'."" There are growing calls for arts to be prescribed as part of a mental health treatment plan by the Australian healthcare system. Countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada already have similar programs in place, where patients can be referred on to a therapeutic arts service by their doctor. How creative arts are helping empower people living with a mental illness. While Australians may struggle to pick up an arts prescription note from their GP right now, there are plenty of ""wonderful pockets"" across the country holding social groups and building an evidence base, says Dr Boydell. ""There is a lot going on. They are being evaluated and there is research being done on them. But there is no integrated sense of bringing all of these people working in these different pockets together,"" she said. Bronwyn can't see why art as a social prescription wouldn't be embraced by the healthcare system. ""We understand the impact of exercise and movement on wellbeing, we understand the impact of medication and we understand the impact of traditional talking therapy, so why would we not also try and incorporate in creative therapy?""

Ms Bryant is part of a growing movement in the fashion and beauty industry, which is developing products for and with people with disability — recognising a virtually untapped trillion-dollar customer market. Parkinson's is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes tremors, balance problems and weakness, including in grip strength. Ms Bryant, who has worked for years as a professional makeup artist, started her accessible business Guide Beauty after she began to struggle using her usual cosmetic instruments. ""What I thought were simple techniques that I used to be able to knock out in 15 minutes … I just couldn't get it quite right. I couldn't get the control,"" she said. The problems she was having inspired her to design cosmetic tools that were suitable for everyone regardless of their level of disability. ""I ran home, and I pulled out my makeup kit and I pulled out my husband's tool kit. And I started prototypes,"" Ms Bryant explained. ""I actually ended up developing the brand because I got Parkinson's [and] when I got my diagnosis, there was something kind of empowering in the moment."" She launched Guide Beauty in 2020 and the business has been a huge success for representing people with disabilities. Ms Bryant tried several styles before choosing tools that were built to a universal design standard so they're comfortable for everyone. The tools are designed to have large grips, facets for resting, and bring the handle closer to the face to make the application stable and easy to use. ""We could kind of help shift the narrative so that people could understand the value of inclusive representation on a design level, because that makes sense from a business perspective,"" she said. ""That makes what is the right thing to do, also a smart business decision. ""The fact the industry has responded so well makes me realise that I don't think we're going to be alone in this space for long. I think people are going to be starting to shift their design process."" Ms Bryant is not the only one to have found their calling. James Parr admits his journey to becoming one of Australia's most sought-after models with a disability had a bumpy start. When he was dignaosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, and was told his leg needed to be amputated, he thought it would ruin his life. ""I would say to my friends, 'if the leg goes, I go, I'm not doing it',"" Mr Parr said. ""When it actually came to the surgeon telling me the best option is to amputate, I was like 'cool, let's do it'. And it happened five days later."" Mr Parr was back in the gym 10 days after the surgery and said the amputation gave him a reason to start modelling, to change the narrative that having a disability was a sad outcome. ""I was like, 'I don't align with being sad or I don't align with it as a negative thing,'"" he said. ""It does bring more opportunities … I think part of why I love it and why I get myself out there and I'm so passionate about it, is representation."" He hopes to expand his public image from ""disabled model"" to ""model with a disability"". ""I'm trying to really hone my craft … I am a disabled model, but I want to be a model who has a disability … I just want to change that a bit because it's a bit devaluing."" Mr Parr has been represented by international inclusive talent agency Zebedee Talent and had just walked the 2022 Melbourne fashion week runway with his prosthetic leg in clear view. Launched in 2017, Zebedee Talent represents diverse models, with a focus on talent with disabilities, visible differences and those from the LGBTQIA+ community. Zebedee senior model booker for Australia and America, Victoria Johnson, said the disability modelling industry was a financially important but often overlooked side of the business. ""Disabled people make up 20 per cent of society so it is really important that disabled people are included and visible in such a huge industry, Ms Johnson said. ""It is the ethical right thing to do, and it is also the economically right thing to do. The spending power of disabled people worldwide is $1.2 trillion, so it makes sense for a business to be inclusive."" The fashion industry is worth $27.2 billion in Australia, but what do you do when the fashion industry wasn’t built for you? ""The spending power of disabled people worldwide is 1.2 trillion dollars so it makes sense for a business to be inclusive. ""It is really important for people with disabilities to feel represented and to feel self-worth."" Zebedee was started in the UK by two sisters-in-law both with experience in modelling and disability support. The agency represents some famous talents including British Model Ellie Goldstein, who has down syndrome. Zebedee only launched in Australia last year and already represents 60 talent with over 600 worldwide. According to Ms Johnson and Zebedee junior model booker, Maddie Kalman, Australia is leading the way for disability representation in the industry. ""I think it's really important to be diverse in that way in the fashion industry in Australia,"" Ms Kalman said. ""I think Australia is getting there with diverse and inclusive representation, we still have a long way to go, but we won't stop until 20 per cent of people featured in advertising and fashion are inclusive of people with disabilities. ""But I think it's really important … even if there's not room, let's make room."" Ms Johnson said some of the important international fashion events in Europe, America and the UK did not always make room for models with disabilities. ""We're not sure why they're struggling with inclusivity in fashion shows, to be honest,"" Ms Johnson said. ""It feels like you take a step forward and one or two back, but hopefully we can get to that place again, with our models working in the major places. ""We were really successful at Melbourne fashion week. Most of the shows did include a model with a disability or difference, which was awesome."" In Australia, adaptive clothes are considered assistive technology and can be purchased through the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Emma Clegg, occupational therapist and co-founder of adaptive clothing company JAM-the-Label said the NDIS had made it easier for people to purchase high-end accessible clothes. ""The Australian market is quite unique in that we have the NDIS, a lot of other countries don't have a similar funding model,"" Ms Clegg said. ""And so people can actually purchase adaptive clothing through their NDIS plans as low-cost assistive technology because it assists in active dressing and promotes independence and participation in an everyday skill or task."" Ms Clegg and her business partner launched JAM in 2017 to help people like their clients wear comfortable and fashionable clothing that worked better in wheelchairs. Some of the design features include shorter backs on jackets so extra fabric doesn't bunch up between the wearer and the wheelchair, fully zippable sleeves and sides on tops, poncho-style opening on jackets, carry bags and the absence of itchy tags. JAM model Jason Clymo said the NDIS made it easier for him to buy comfortable adaptive clothes instead of mainstream items that caused pressure sores. ""Before I was on the NDIS, I actually didn't even really engage very much with the adaptive fashion industry because I didn't really know much about it,"" Mr Clymo said. ""It was actually through meeting JAM-the-Label that I realised that adaptive fashion was becoming quite a large part of the industry and realising that this was actually a really good option for me."" Ms Kalman said tokenism was still a problem in the industry, with a lot of major brands booking one model with a disability just for publicity. ""They're getting the jobs which is great, but it's like some brands are just ticking a box and they're having like a token disabled person to make themselves look inclusive, but they're not really,"" she said. Mr Clymo, who has represented mainstream modelling agency Wink as well as Zebedee, said he hoped in the future segregation in the fashion industry would vanish. He said having models with and without a disability showcasing the same products would hopefully educate the industry more broadly, and the practice would become mainstream.

172,Welcome to 'Haywood': Riverina town embraces 15 minutes of Mad Max fame,arts-culture,"  With the Mad Max production bandwagon in southern NSW, the host town Hay has received a much-needed economic boost. Hundreds of film crew members have descended on the western Riverina town to film Mad Max: Furiosa. Business owners are reporting an uptick in customers and hotels have been fully booked since March. Hotel manager Amiel Rabbelier said the influx of people into town had been great for business, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. ""You'll notice the cafes and restaurants, they're all getting [a] hit,"" he said. ""Especially on the weekends when a lot of the people that are here working on this film are off and hang around town spending money."" Mr Rabbelier said there was a lot of work on offer as businesses tried to cater to the visitors. ""People are hiring everywhere, we can't get enough staff here,"" he said. The last film in the Mad Max series, Fury Road, was due to be filmed in the state's far west. But, at the time, Broken Hill was too green and production shifted to Namibia, in southern Africa. Film production has since returned to regional NSW and is set to move to Silverton, near Broken Hill, next. Details surrounding Furiosa, which is being directed by George Miller, are shrouded in secrecy and local participants have signed non-disclosure agreements. It is understood the filming in Hay has been mostly for stunt work and the film's main actors, such as Chris Hemsworth, are not expected to visit the town. In the past, Mad Max films have been action-packed features complete with explosions and daring stunts. While technology has come a long way since the original 1979 film starring Mel Gibson, on-location filming is still needed. Cafe manager Megan Griffiths, who has lived in Hay her entire life, said it was the busiest the town had ever been. She said her cafe sold more than 220 coffees in a single day. ""Mornings have got a lot busier than normal. They tend to head out a bit earlier than we would normally start getting busy,"" Ms Griffiths said. Hay Shire Council Mayor Carol Oataway said the agricultural town of about 2,500 people was recovering from more than just a COVID-19 downturn. ""We've just come out of a very long drought and confidence was at an all-time low,"" Ms Oataway said. ""We had businesses shutting their doors in the main street, we had a declining population, school enrolments were declining. ""It's nice to feel that we're coming out of that and we've got some confidence happening in the town."" Hay residents have also enjoyed the 15 minutes of fame filming has brought to the town. Christa Sheaffe said the town felt ""alive again"". ""Unfortunately with COVID it was very quiet. I think people were nervous to get out and about but I feel like there's a real buzz about town again,"" she said. When asked if he would liken Hay to Hollywood, Mr Rabbelier said it was more like ""Haywood"". ""It's definitely got that feel. It's a big thing to be a part of so I think everyone is excited in a way,"" he said.

174,Fee-for-flattery: WeChat publisher offers candidates a positive spin. But there's a price to be paid,arts-culture," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Chinese-language publisher offers election candidates gushing praise on WeChat. But the flattery comes with a price tag A mysterious media agency is behind a fee-for-service offering to federal election candidates, including Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, placement of favourable news articles and interviews on the Chinese-language social media platform WeChat. Australian Financial News (AFN) has published more than 131 advertisements and articles related to the federal election since January, according to researchers from Deakin and Monash universities who are monitoring election material on Chinese social media. Some of this content is presented as news articles written by independent journalists. The ABC has discovered a proposal from AFN for a political candidate that offers, for a fixed price, six weeks of ads, as well as a video and article on WeChat. AFN has helped at least five political campaigns from across the political spectrum advertise to Australia's Chinese-speaking community via WeChat, which boasts more than 1.2 billion active users, many of whom are among the 1.2 million Chinese Australian voters who will cast their ballot on Saturday. Look back at how the 2022 Australian federal election unfolded Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Labor leader Anthony Albanese, Communications Minister Paul Fletcher, and North Sydney candidates Catherine Renshaw for Labor and independent candidate Kylea Tink, have all been featured in advertisements on AFN's WeChat channel. Mr Frydenberg — who is in a life-or-death struggle in the inner-city Melbourne seat of Kooyong against independent candidate Monique Ryan — has paid for advertisements on AFN's WeChat Channel. It was Mr Frydenberg's campaign that featured most prominently on the AFN channel, with more than a quarter of all AFN election content — including ads, advertorials and commentary — since January 6 containing at least one reference to the Treasurer. When pitching to prospective clients, AFN also sent examples of the WeChat advertisements they had published on behalf of Mr Frydenberg to prospective political clients. ""There are banner advertisements with the Australian Financial News promoting the Morrison government's economic record and plan for a stronger future,"" a spokesperson for Mr Frydenberg said. ""Information on Anthony Albanese's record of supporting higher taxes on Australians has also been featured through banner advertising. WeChat researcher Robbie Fordyce from Monash University also noted there had been a marked increase in the number of advertisements and positive editorial content about Mr Frydenberg from April 2022 onwards. He said ""this level of coverage"" would typically only be available to paid clients. While the Treasurer's office acknowledged that it had placed authorised campaign advertisements on AFN, it denied paying the company to publish flattering editorial coverage. ""There is no payment for articles,"" Frydenberg's spokesperson said. Though AFN has been a prominent player on WeChat during the election campaign, it maintains an elusive business presence. Its listed business address in the Barangaroo precinct of inner Sydney was empty when the ABC visited last week. Its phone number was also no longer connected to the business. Its director, Han Guoliang, was also previously a director of, and shareholder in, Chinese-Australian media outlet Sydney Today. In 2020, AFN apologised for publishing ""false allegations"" about an Australian funds manager. A 2021 AFN press kit, it refers to itself as an ""AFN think tank"" which lists economist and former Labor Party trade minister Craig Emerson as a member. Mr Emerson says he's never heard of AFN. ""I'm unfamiliar with this organisation, and don't have any recollection of having been involved in any of their dealings,"" he told the ABC. ""It appears the description of me is straight from my website."" The press kit also listed a series of companies and Australian government departments as their ""cooperative partners"". The list includes organisations such as business news and data provider Bloomberg, two of Australia's largest consulting firms, PWC and KPMG, and Victorian government agency Invest Victoria. Of those that responded to the ABC, all denied having any current connection with AFN. Invest Victoria said it had ""no record of any relationship or partnership with Australian Financial News"". Fan Yang from Deakin University — who is part of a research group that examined more than 3,200 election-related advertisements and articles on WeChat from 134 public accounts since May 2021 — says companies such as AFN operate as a fee-for-service business while maintaining the appearance of a news organisation. ""They're somewhere between the media and a business,"" she said. The research team found that AFN was one of the most-prolific publishers on WeChat of federal election-related content, and published more advertisements and articles about Mr Frydenberg than any other of the public accounts they monitored. ""In the last week, we have seen several cases with two articles a day from AFN with references to [Mr] Frydenberg,"" said Monash University's Dr Fordyce. Ms Yang and her colleagues also found that, across all 134 WeChat accounts they monitored for election content, 7.7 per cent included some mention of Mr Frydenberg, whether in an article's text or as an advertisement appended to a report. Mr Frydenberg's campaign also appeared to have provided AFN, and another WeChat channel, with original materials that would later appear in effusive articles. Eddie Chan, who runs a Melbourne dry cleaning business, was featured in a video and two articles on WeChat, praising the federal Treasurer. Mr Chan told the ABC the glowing video interview was arranged after he personally offered to help Mr Frydenberg in his re-election efforts. He said Mr Frydenberg arranged for his campaign team to film Mr Chan in his shop. The footage later appeared on AFN's WeChat channel. Mr Chan was happy to appear in the promotional material, saying it reflected his genuine view of Mr Frydenberg. ""Josh puts people together. He has a strong local connection,"" Mr Chan said. Independent candidate for North Sydney Kylea Tink has also run advertisements and an interview article has appeared on WeChat via AFN. Her campaign told the ABC the company provided a tailored proposal for several advertisements, an interview and a translated video that would run over six weeks. The advertisements, video and article were a package deal. In the headline story featuring Ms Tink, AFN wrote that the candidate ""understood the importance of seeking common ground while reserving differences"". ""Participating in public welfare affairs has made her more aware of the current social situation and public sentiment in Australia,"" the article said. At the bottom of the paid interview with Ms Tink, a disclaimer states the article is an ""election promotion"" article. An AFN article published on WeChat about Labor's candidate for North Sydney, Catherine Renshaw, includes the following authorisation: ""The above information is authorised by Bob Nanva of the Australian Labor Party (NSW). Level 9, 377 Sussex Street Sydney NSW 2000."" Under Australian electoral laws, content considered to be ""electoral communications"" typically requires an authorisation to ensure transparency, accountability and traceability. There is no such disclaimer or authorisation in the articles about Mr Frydenberg. Asked about the lack of a proper authorisation, Ms Tink's campaign said they would inform the publisher and ask them to add one. The AEC and Professor Renshaw have been contacted for comment, but neither responded by publication time. AFN's articles about Mr Frydenberg are almost universally flattering and, in some cases, appear lifted from other news outlets. One of the AFN stories, published in mid-February, was titled ""The next Australian Prime Minister is about to be decided?"" It describes Mr Frydenberg's life story, and appears to be paraphrasing positive sections of previous media reporting about the Liberal candidate from other outlets, including The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian. The article claims Prime Minister Scott Morrison was being abandoned by voters for leaving for Hawaii during the Black Summer bushfires and for attending football matches during the pandemic. ""Voters are running away in droves,"" the article said. ""If the Coalition hopes to return to power, it cannot rule out a new leader, and the current treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, would be a favourite."" Inside the Canberra bubble, ""drops"" are a well-known media management tactic used by politicians of all stripes — more often by the government of the day and especially in the run-up to an election. The glowing article then dives into how Mr Frydenberg's love for tennis has shaped him into a capable leader before explaining how his Jewish heritage made the ideal replacement for the country's top job. That story was read more than 25,000 times since it was published, among voters with Chinese backgrounds. AFN did not respond to ABC questions about whether Mr Frydenberg's office had reviewed or approved the articles before publication. However, the story was taken down after being contacted by the ABC. The Treasurer is facing off against independent candidate Monique Ryan in the Victorian electorate of Kooyong where, according to 2016 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), one-in-nine residents report having Chinese ancestry. He has faced backlash from Chinese-Australian voters over the Coalition's anti-China rhetoric. AFN and Labor did not respond to a request for comment before deadline.

175,Blockbuster exhibition will explore key influences of British fashion titan Alexander McQueen,arts-culture,"  Alexander McQueen exhibition in Melbourne will celebrate the artist's inspirations using the NGV's collection The first major Australian exhibition of the late British fashion superstar Alexander McQueen will come to Melbourne this summer, almost 13 years since his death in 2010 — and seven after the landmark exhibition Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty broke records at London's Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A), with more than 480,000 tickets sold. Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse will open at the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) on December 11, and is a collaboration between that institution and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), where it opened in April. Rather than reattempting a comprehensive, biographical retrospective such as Savage Beauty (which was initiated by the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, where it premiered in 2011), this new exhibition celebrates each museum's extensive holdings of McQueen's work, which include major private bequests. Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse also draws on the permanent collections of LACMA and the NGV to tease out the eclectic inspirations for the designer's work, which ranged from 15th-century religious art to 18th-century Scottish history, cinema, birds and butterflies. The show will span 25 McQueen collections and almost his entire career, from 1994's Banshee (his third collection and second professional runway collection since his now-legendary St Martins graduate show, Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims) to his final full collection, 2009's shimmering tribute to nature, Plato's Atlantis. The NGV started collecting McQueen in 1996, acquiring works directly from the designer — including pieces from his pivotal Highland Rape collection, where he controversially sent models down the runway in postures of distress and disorientation, wearing torn and stained garments, as a comment on Britain's violence against Scotland in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was not the only time McQueen explored his Scottish heritage on the runway, and the NGV exhibition will spotlight another key collection, with 12 looks from 2006's Widows of Culloden, which referenced a brutal 18th-century battle between British forces and Scottish 'rebels', and encapsulated recurring McQueen motifs such as tartan, birds and lace. The NGV iteration of Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse will build on the 60 garments and accessories featured in LACMA's exhibition (drawing on their extensive holdings, the largest in North America) and add nearly 50 additional designs from the NGV collection. The exhibition will take over the ground floor exhibition space of the NGV, where the exhibition Gabrielle Chanel: Fashion Manifesto recently closed. Katie Somerville, senior curator of fashion and textiles for NGV, says fashion nerds will particularly appreciate a set of ""toiles"" ('draft' or prototype versions of dresses) included in the exhibition. Somerville, who was in her first year as an assistant curator in NGV's fashion department when the gallery first acquired McQueen's work, has worked on the exhibition with Danielle Whitfield (curator of fashion and textiles, NGV) and curators from LACMA. She says: ""[McQueen] had a very curious mind; he had an incredible collection of books [and] he was very interested in history. And he very much went out and got into collections and looked at works in storage. Claire Wilcox at the V&A, for instance, had an experience of him accessing things in the collection for that purpose."" Clarissa Esguerra, associate curator of costume and textiles at LACMA, who initiated the exhibition after a major donation of McQueen pieces by Los Angeles-based collector Regina J. Drucker, says that she and her team were almost like detectives in working to identify some of the designer's more obscure references. ""McQueen was an encyclopedic artist, drawing from inspiration from all over the world, different time periods and mediums,"" says Esguerra. In conceiving the exhibition, she says an early ""aha moment"" came when she and her colleagues were looking at a dress from the Scanners collection (2003), which referenced the story of migration from the Arctic tundra of Siberia, through Tibet, into Japan. ""We were looking at the geometric pattern in the fabric, and we were like, 'What is this? What is this pattern? Can we identify it? Does it have significance?' And it does — it is a pattern that's very important to Tibet, because it was used as a Buddhist textile. And that textile motif moved to Japan with Buddhism. ""So [we realised that] he's telling the story of migration and fashion drawing on textile history — and our minds were blown. We were like, 'Oh my God, can we figure this out with other objects?'"" she recalls. She says John Matheson — a collector and archivist of McQueen's work — was also an invaluable consultant on the exhibition, combing through old interviews and show notes. An exhibition like Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse is only possible because of the nature of both LACMA and NGV as 'encyclopedic museums': institutions whose collections span diverse mediums from across the globe and throughout history. At NGV, the exhibition will feature more than 70 artworks and objects from their permanent collection — including photography, paintings, sculpture, antiquities, textiles, and historical fashion — in what should be an intriguing imbrication of art and fashion. Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse will be on display at NGV International, Melbourne, from December 11-April 16. Tops Arts & Culture headlines.

176,'A new standard': How this music festival changed to become more inclusive,arts-culture,"  The NT's largest music festival Bass in the Grass improves access for people living with disabilities Darwin's largest music festival, Bass in the Grass, normally draws thousands of tourists to the Top End and this year, Jim Simpson and Jeff McCourt are ready to party. The Northern Territory's largest music festival is making it easier for people with a disability to attend Disability organisations say more work is needed to ensure people of all abilities can access major events Access Arts Australia is working on a minimum code of conduct for events Both men live with cerebral palsy and use wheelchairs. ""This one could be really good … to see the music, to see the festival, to see everything,"" Mr McCourt said. The festival is taking place on Saturday and this year, organisers have made a series of adjustments to accommodate people of all abilities. Changes include shaded viewing platforms in front of stages, an accessible entry lane for ticket holders, free entry for carers and pro-floor matting, which makes it easier for people using wheelchairs to move around. Mr McCourt said it was important for people like him to also enjoy music and other events. ""[It was difficult to attend] some events like the super cars, so it's good [to have these adjustments,"" he said. Mr Simpson went to the event last year and took advantage of the viewing platforms, which allowed him to have an unimpeded view of performers. Using non-verbal communication and with the support of an independent living coach he provided a statement. ""I'm excited about going to the festival and dancing on the viewing platform,"" he said. As for the thing he's most excited about for the Saturday event, Mr McCourt had a surprising answer. ""The food!"" The festival's improved access changes have prompted access advocacy groups to demand more from major events. Annie Rily from disability support organisation, Carpentaria, said the festival's adjustments showed it was possible for festivals to be more inclusive. ""Bass in the Grass is setting a new standard this year and we want to see this continue,"" she said. ""We've got 20,000 people in the Territory that have a disability and we want to ensure that they can fully participate in events,"" she said. The issue extends beyond the Territory's borders; Access Arts Australia CEO Matthew Hall said despite good will, many events were falling short. ""Most music festivals [don't do enough] in terms of accessible toilets and viewing platforms and ramps and quiet zones,"" he said. Ability Fest, which was co-founded by Australian of The Year Dylan Alcott, is regularly pointed to as the blueprint for other major events to follow. Consultation is currently underway to create a minimum code of conduct, which Access Arts Australia hopes will be completed next year. Access2Arts Chief Executive Officer, Rebecca Young, hopes the code will provide organisations with a guide on how they can plan events. However, she said it would also act as a means of holding them to account, if they don't sign up. ""There are the best of intentions out there in the marketplace and across a lot of different arts organisations and festivals, but people not knowing where to start is often the first barrier,"" she said.

177,"Welcome to a new kind of house, packed with features seldom seen before COVID-19",arts-culture," Science ""The Barnaby"" might be a strange name for a home of the future, but that's what this four-bedroom demonstration house claims to be. Located in a small town in North Carolina, it's the size of an average new house in Australia and looks pretty normal from the outside. Inside, the differences are obvious: a front-door ""vestibule"" for no-contact home delivery, two ""pocket"" home offices (neither of which is a bedroom), a school room, a quarantine room, a ""secret room"" behind a bookcase (for being alone), and a whopping four bathrooms. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is a design shaped by the pandemic. The team of architects, social researchers, and marketing experts that dreamed it up say every detail is informed by insights from a survey into the impact of the pandemic on homes and communities in the US. What about in Australia? Here, the property industry is seeing demand for features like those of The Barnaby (though not four bathrooms). The dedicated home office is king, and there's generally greater appreciation for good design and quality of construction. COVID-19 shone a light on all the pre-existing problems with our housing and asked us to do more with our houses, including working from home (WFH). So, what does an ideal post-COVID Australian home look like? And will any actually get built? The Barnaby's design choices were informed by the America at Home study, which surveyed more than 6,000 US adults in 2020. There's a new commercial rush to automate our homes and appliances. Is this how we'll live in the future? It found that Millennials and Gen Xers wanted relatively uncommon features such as germ-resistant countertops and flooring, greater energy efficiency, more storage for food or water, touch-free taps, appliances and toilets, and space for more than one home office. ""Post-pandemic, people have realised their homes can do more and that better design matters,"" said Nancy Keenan, president and chief executive officer of Dahlin Group Architecture Planning, the California-based firm that helped design The Barnaby demonstration house. Key to making a home do more is something called ""the flex space"", or a room with multiple potential uses. What this boils down to is an open-plan living room and kitchen, and then lots of ""acoustically secure"" (ie. decently soundproofed) medium-sized rooms that could be home offices, bedrooms, media rooms, and the like. Along with this, there's a scattering of tiny ""pocket flex spaces"" that could be used as smaller studies or walk-in wardrobes. The idea is that a whole family (The Barnaby was designed for a Millennial couple with two young children, where one parent works from home) can use the one house for lots of different things, all at the same time. ""Providing spaces in the home that can be used in many ways is key to a successful floor plan, especially when designing to smaller square footages,"" Ms Keenan said. ""Our clients are also exploring the viability of optioning flexible furniture systems and moveable walls to enhance space flexibility."" These trends can be seen in Australia. Every two years, property developer Mirvac surveys customers about what they're looking for in a house or an apartment. The most recent survey showed a clear shift in thinking, said Diana Sarcasmo, head of design at Mirvac, which has $26 billion worth of assets under management in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. ""Half the people we spoke to in the survey said they were looking for a hybrid working arrangement going forward,"" Ms Sarcasmo said. That change is reflected in demand for home offices. ""There's been a 20 per cent increase in people in apartments asking for a study. And in housing, there's double the number."" The surge in pet ownership during lockdowns means people are willing to pay extra for doggy doors and dog-wash facilities. And hours spent WFH has made people aware of ""sustainability upgrades"" like thermal insulation. In the short space of one year, Annabelle and Alex have slashed the money they spend on electricity, gas and petrol to zero. Here's how they did it. ""People have always wanted sustainability upgrades, but weren't willing to pay for them,"" Ms Sarcasmo said. ""Now 64 per cent say they're willing to pay extra. That's a massive shift over the last couple of years."" George Massoud, design director at Frasers Property, another large developer, agreed. He's also seen people placing greater value on ""things like quality of light, ventilation, and acoustics"". And the home office with a door you can close is here to stay. ""The mediocre study nook doesn't cut it anymore."" Of course, it's harder finding space for all this in an apartment. Since the onset of COVID-19, house values have out-performed those of units. And dwelling values (houses and units) in regional areas have increased much more than those in capital cities. Eliza Owen, head of research at CoreLogic Australia, said the need for space was a contributing factor. ""Larger, more spacious homes allowed for a home office, and larger properties in regional Australia even allowed people to create their own oasis for entertainment and recreation amid the pandemic,"" she said. So are Australians ditching the inner-city apartment? No, Ms Sarcasmo says. ""There was a feeling during the middle of the pandemic that people would be driven further out of the city,"" she said. ""But in the last several months, what we've seen is great demand for apartment projects, if they're well located with amenities."" Mr Massoud, agreed: the picture was more complicated than Australians buying large houses in regional areas. Size matters, but so does, increasingly, location. People want to live in urban environments that are within walking distance to parks, cafes, pubs, restaurants, and the like. One reason for this may be the rise of WFH: We're taking greater interest in our local community. ""In homes and the apartment space, people are really assessing what's beyond their four walls,"" Mr Massoud said. He also believes homes won't get much bigger. ""I don't see larger homes being a trend, but I do see major improvements in quality."" Though Australia doesn't yet have its own version of The Barnaby , architects are working at imagining how our houses and apartments might be better designed to suit our needs. In March this year, a Brisbane exhibition featured the work of 10 Australian architects who had been invited to develop new concepts of the home and residential environments. The designs included a much greater focus on community and connection, including shared amenities for apartments, as well as verandahs, walkways, and verge gardens to connect neighbours. The exhibition itself was the idea of the Architecture et Cetera Lab, formed by three Griffith University design academics and practising architects, Cecilia Bischeri, Zuzana Kovar and Jessica Blair. ""COVID put what we consider normality under scrutiny,"" Dr Bischeri said. ""Residential space is becoming a habitat, in the sense we are going to function 24/7 in this space. ""Houses need to accommodate all interests and activities that in a normal situation you would experience outside."" Residential architects have seen a big increase in demand for their services, said Shannon Battisson, national president of the Australian Institute of Architects (AIA). In Canberra, where she works, public servants have been spending money on their homes, rather than on overseas holidays. ""One of the big things COVID has done has made people think, 'Hey, we might spend a lot of time here in the future and it's worth doing it well.' ""We went from having a six-month waiting list for our projects, and then that blew out to two years."" What people want isn't the only factor that decides what gets built. Most new apartments, for instance, are built for investors rather than owner-occupiers, says Tom Alves, head of development at the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. ""The shape and form of those apartments is not driven by need, but by global investment,"" he said. Houses are similar: Less than 6 per cent of new houses in Australia have architectural involvement. So far, COVID-19 hasn't had a big impact on the regulation determining the minimum standards for houses and units, Dr Alves said. The 2021 update to the Victorian Government's 2017 Better Apartment Design Standards addressed problems with poor acoustic and visual privacy, a lack of natural light, and an inflexible floor plan. Outlining the changes, the Victorian Government website states: ""More than ever, the coronavirus pandemic has shown us that all homes need to have access to air, nature, sunlight and personal space."" Other states and territories have not updated their apartment design standards since the outbreak of COVID-19. The National Construction Code, which sets minimum performance and quality requirements for new housing in Australia, is in the process of being updated to ensure homes are better insulated and energy efficient (though this was set in train well before the pandemic). COVID-19 will change design in Australia, but it may not be as widespread as we might like, Ms Battisson said. ""I think we'll be quick to revert to our usual ways."" But there is one sign of hope, at least in her opinion: fewer people are asking for home theatres. ""We're really against things like home theatres — it's a room that's pretty big and dark and can't be used for anything else. ""In COVID, not a single person asked for a home theatre. ""I'm kind of hoping they won't come back strongly after the pandemic."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

179,'Lead by example': Olivia Newton-John added to honour roll with Tina Arena tribute ,arts-culture,"  Australian Women in Music Awards recognise industry trailblazers at ceremony in Brisbane Dame Olivia Newton-John has joined fellow Australian music legends inducted in the Australian Women in Music Awards Honour Roll, with icon Tina Arena performing a touching tribute celebrating the singer-songwriter. Arena sang Newton-John's global-hit I Honestly Love You, rousing the crowd to a standing ovation as they celebrated both of the music powerhouses at the Australian Women in Music Awards at the Tivoli in Brisbane last night. Newton-John, who accepted the award via video from her home in California, said she was thrilled and grateful to accept the award following after some of her favourite singers — Helen Reddy and Judith Durham. ""I want to encourage everyone to support the work of Australian Women in Music Awards, because diversity is everything,"" she said. ""There are so many talented women who have never thought about going into a certain area of the music industry, not just to sing, as well as producers, engineers, technicians, and there's a whole world waiting for them. ""Once one person does it, others will follow — lead by example, thank you so much."" Following her tribute to Newton-John, Arena spoke of the challenges she has faced throughout her career, saying she had learnt so much about the discrimination in the industry. ""The preying on the vulnerability of artists is something that is really quite pathetic in the day and age in which we live in, so it is our duty to speak up about it. ""But it is also our duty, I feel, to bring change with love."" She presented the inaugural Tina Arena special impact award to Dina Bassile for her work creating disability access at live music and arts events. Bassile thanked her friends, family and ""every single conversation"" with artists with disabilities who have listened to her. ""And people who have listened to me and heard my voice and been willing to make the change to being more inclusive and more accessible to the disability community,"" she said. For championing new opportunities for those often under-represented in music, and for her own talent, disability activist and musician Eliza Hull received the diversity in Music award. Yorta Yorta woman Deborah Cheetham AO was honoured with the Queensland government's lifetime achievement award, for her devotion to the industry as a soprano, composer, educator and leader in the arts for more than 25 years, accepted on her behalf by Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. The event, the first held in two years due to the pandemic,  also included artists and music professionals speaking about the significant toll the years of COVID-19 had wreaked on the industry. The room fell silent as ""Little Pattie"" Amphlett spoke about the imbalance of power women face in the industry. AWMA founding executive producer and program director Vicki Gordon created the change maker award, presented by Little Pattie, to recognise the brave women who have fought against bullying, sexual harassment and bad behaviour in the industry. The award was presented to Tamara Georgopoulos, who spoke out about sexual harassment at Sony Music, and independent artist Deena Lynch, who performs as Jaguar Jonze, who spoke about sexual assault publicly, for sharing their stories publicly. The crowd was entertained with musical performances by Sahara Beck, Dizzy Doolan and Barkaa, Emma Donovan & Kee'ahn, Montaigne, and Sandy Evans and Satsuki Odamura. Newcomer Martha Marlow was recognised with the emerging artist award, while the songwriter gong went to Tania Doko. The ceremony at the Tivoli also honoured the many talented women working behind the scenes to make Australia's best music happen. This year Frontier Touring's Sahara Herald received the music leadership award, celebrating her contribution to the industry. The creative leadership award went to musician and festival director and programmer Emily Ulman. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Live creative production award, presented by Brisbane singer-songwriter Katie Noonan, was awarded to Kait Hall, who said it was the first time she had been in front of the lights at the Tivoli. ""It's really quite exceptional to be recognised creatively in the industry, we often get overlooked for these kinds of things, so to have someone understand the importance of what we do to bring your vision as songwriters to the stage is really quite an honour,"" Hall said. ""I'd also like to ask that all of the women that are in this room that get to make the choices about how they will be creatively represented on stage, whether that sound of vision or writing, please consider creating a diverse environment in your crew. ""Very little has changed in the two decades I've been doing this … nearly always, I am the only woman, front of house.""

180,"From fortune-telling machines to risqué pictures, arcade games make a comeback at new museum",arts-culture,"  Arcade games from the past find new future at Craiglie's Penny Parlour museum Simon Rogers has been collecting and restoring penny arcade games for most of his adult life. Now, he has opened what he claims to be Australia's biggest penny arcade museum. The Penny Parlour Museum is located at Craiglie, just outside Port Douglas, and includes fortune-telling machines, amusements, feats of strength and games of skill. ""I first fell in love with penny arcade machines in my youth at the funfairs in England,"" he said. ""I grew up in the north of England and I used to go to all the travelling funfairs. ""I also have a gypsy background, so I also had a lot of friends and family working at the funfairs."" The museum includes machines dating back to 1800s, as well as pinball machines from the 1930s. As most of his machines are more than 70 years old, there are no instructions, manuals or spare parts to be found on the internet, making them harder to restore. ""I first started collecting when I was only 16 and so far I have restored over 70 of them and they are on display here,"" Mr Rogers said. ""I opened the museum to put the restored machines on display as they are made to be played. ""Travelling arcades used to be one of the major forms of entertainment, not everybody could afford to go to the theatre so instead they would go to the penny arcade."" All the machines on display are now operational and they have all been saved from now defunct funfairs that used to travel across Australia. One of the biggest attractions of penny arcades around the early 1900s was the Mutoscope, which works on the same principle as a flip book. Mutoscopes were coin operated, and the customer would view cards through a single lens enclosed by a hood. About 700 cards would be attached to a reel that was driven by a hand crank. Most subjects in the Mutoscopes involved nudity and it was an early precursor to commercial pornography. ""When these Mutoscopes first came out they were considered triple-x, they were quite risqué for the early 1900,"" Mr Rogers said. ""There were lots of protests when these first hit the travelling circuits and they were always made quite tall so that children couldn't see into them. ""They were a big deal because you couldn't access photos of the nude human body back then. ""The travelling arcades and amusement centres had a bit of a seedy reputation anyway, they were the only places that would show these images as nobody else could or would show them."" Mr Rogers' favourite machine is the ""Pussy Shooter"" from 1928, which hasn't been restored but is still in working order. ""You put a penny in, and you get five ball bearings, and you need to knock the cats off the wall and if you get all five cats, your penny is returned,"" he said. ""It was an early version of the shoot-em down duck competition that you now see at the sideshow alley."" Other machines that were popular at penny arcades were the fortune-telling machines that, for a penny, would spit out a card or a photo. ""We have a machine that tells you if you're going to heaven or hell, we also have one that can print out a photo of your future husband or wife and there's a another one that can read your palm,"" Mr Rogers said. ""The fortune-telling machines were sometimes bolted to the front of shops so that people walking out of the shop would spend their change and drop a penny into them. ""The original penny arcades were made for the lower working classes, and they were a big deal when they would come to your town. ""Unfortunately when video machines and home computers came out in the late 1970s, it was the end of the penny arcade.""

181,Arts policy at the election: Who is offering what - and what's at stake?,arts-culture," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Labor and Greens arts policies and what the Coalition is offering this federal election The limited discussion of cultural policy in the lead-up to the federal election has left many in the arts sector wondering how the outcome of Saturday's ballot will impact them, as they recover from the devastating losses of the pandemic. With just two days of the campaign left, time has all but run out for the major parties to make any final policy announcements. The focus of the election debate has by and large been on housing affordability and cost-of-living measures, although several peak arts industry bodies and lobby groups have been vocal about the absence of pre-election arts commitments from the two major parties. Labor has, in the final week of the campaign, made a pledge to develop a national cultural policy, while the Coalition has stopped short of making any specific pre-election promises for the arts. The Greens by contrast have put forward a comprehensive plan with detailed arts funding commitments. With the federal election underway it can be hard to keep up with where each party stands on some of the key issues. We've made a little cheat sheet to make it easier. Among the ideas floated are an artist's wage guarantee and a residency program for schools and libraries. But do they hold up to scrutiny? And can the Australian arts afford not to have a comprehensive cultural policy at this critical juncture? Here is a run-down of arts policy pledges by the major parties announced to date. Despite commissioning an inquiry in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on the sector, the Coalition government has not included arts in its policy platform for this election, nor did it take an arts policy to the last election. In a statement to ABC Arts, Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts Paul Fletcher said: ""The Morrison government recognises that the arts sector continues to face challenges unique to the industry, which is why we acted quickly in establishing extensive support throughout the pandemic, totalling $500 million. ""The centrepiece of this support is the $220 million Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand (RISE) fund – so far we have provided $200 million to 541 projects, creating more than 213,000 job opportunities across Australia."" Crisis funding allocated to the arts via the government's Creative Economy package lifted arts investment significantly compared to pre-pandemic expenditure. In the last budget, the government committed a further $20 million to the RISE fund but flagged that other initiatives would be wound back — a forecasted contraction of more than 20 per cent by 2025-26, totalling $244.7 million. ""We value the arts as an economic driver — but also, and just as important, for their own sake. A re-elected Morrison government will continue to support the sector in ways that make the arts more accessible to Australians everywhere, and not just for an inner-urban elite,"" the minister said. In the final days of the election campaign, details of how the government intends to support the arts are sparse. When asked if the government will commit additional funding to the arts if re-elected, a spokesperson for the minister said: ""We'll make funding commitments at the appropriate time, just as we have been doing since 2019."" On Monday afternoon, Shadow Minister for the Arts Tony Burke took to the stage at iconic Melbourne live music venue The Espy to announce Labor's commitment to developing a national cultural policy. If elected, Labor will revive its 2013 Creative Australia policy, developed by former prime minister Julia Gillard and then-arts minister Simon Crean. Among its other pledges: Prior to Monday's announcement, Labor had made commitments to reinstate $83.7 million in funding cut from the ABC and lock in five-year funding terms to replace the current triennial terms for both ABC and SBS. Labor has also pledged under its First Nations policy to shore up intellectual property protections for Indigenous artists and to combat the sale of fake art. Burke said in his speech on Monday: ""For nearly a decade there has been no cultural policy guiding the advice of departments or the decisions of ministers. ""Instead we have had a culture war. Attacks on artists as workers. Attacks on the universities and TAFE colleges that train them. And attacks on the institutions including the Australia Council and the ABC which support their work. Our collecting institutions were left to fall into disrepair. ""An Albanese government will restore cultural policy and end the culture war."" At the last election, Labor proposed a comprehensive arts policy, similarly involving a refresh of their 2013 vision, but was criticised for featuring an uncredited stock image by German illustrator MoinMoin on the cover page. Burke acknowledged that the policy needs revision and emphasised that the order of priorities should be re-evaluated. ""[The] concepts are all sound, but I have a firm view that the order needs to reflect the extraordinary cultural strength that is unique to this continent. We have the oldest continuing cultural practices on the planet. ""The first pillar of Australia's cultural policy should be First Nations. First Nations first,"" he said. Labor has already announced funding for a number of arts initiatives, totalling $181.2 million, but Burke did not make any additional pre-election funding promises in his speech. The most comprehensive arts policy proposal in this election campaign has been put forward by the Greens. The party's spokesperson for the arts, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, unveiled the multi-billion-dollar funding initiative earlier this month. The proposal includes the establishment of a $1 billion Live Performance Fund, $1 billion for an Australian Stories Fund, and a multidisciplinary Creativity Commission worth $10 million a year. The Greens also pledged to extend RISE funding ""on an as-needed basis, and [to] fully fund all applications that meet the criteria of the grant funding"". Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. Key policy initiatives: Among the more innovative measures proposed in the plan is an artist's wage pilot program, which would provide $772.60 per week for up to 10,000 established or emerging artists annually. Similar programs have been implemented successfully internationally, including the French artist wage guarantee Intermittence du Spectacle, established in 1936, and the more recently enacted Irish basic income scheme for artists of 325 euros ($487) per week. ""Our Creative Australia policy says that art matters, that it matters to our communities, our economy, and that it should matter to our government and policymakers,"" Hanson-Young said. ""[It] supports the recovery of the arts industry as well as investing in its growth into the future. Our policy would make the arts accessible to everyone, as it should be."" The policy also includes an artist-in-residence program that would see an artist or author placed in registered schools and libraries around the country for one to two days a term. According to Hanson-Young, the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) has costed this program at $14.7 million a year. ""By investing in arts education and creating secure jobs, we will not only ensure a steady pipeline of artists to feed our local creative industries, but we can ensure that choosing the arts as a career is a financially viable option for our young people,"" she said. Hanson-Young confirmed the PBO projects that the total cost of the policy would approach $6 billion over the next decade and said this will be a ""top-order issue for the Greens"" if they hold the balance of power. ""We will push the next government to deliver genuine support and opportunities for the creative sector,"" she said. Of the 1,641 candidates running in this federal election, 90 per cent belong to a political party, 8 per cent are independents and the remaining 2 per cent belong to unaffiliated groups. Of the 130 independent candidates, there are a handful who have made public commitments to advocating for the arts. They include: Independent candidates Jo Dyer worked in the arts for more than 20 years and has proposed five key areas for arts policy improvement, including the development of a National Cultural Policy, a universal basic income scheme for artists, and a 20 per cent content quota for local streaming services, among other initiatives. Dr Sophie Scamps has outlined a seven-point plan for the arts, including greater support for arts education and the role of Indigenous arts and culture, stronger protections for public broadcasters, and also advocates for a national strategy. Allegra Spender is running on three key policy priorities for the arts: bolstering funding for the ABC and SBS, supporting creative industries (including restoring funding to the Australia Council), and rebuilding arts education. Australia has been without a substantive arts policy for nearly a decade. Since the Coalition government was elected under Tony Abbott in 2013, the federal arts portfolio has contracted both in terms of funding and stature. Dr Ben Eltham is a lecturer in cultural and creative industries at Monash University, co-author of Australia Institute’s Creativity in Crisis report (2021) and part of the Fund The Arts campaign. He says there have been a number of stringent cuts to the cultural portfolio under the Coalition, dating back to Joe Hockey's first budget in 2015, which included a $52 million cut to the arts portfolio and stripped $104 million from the Australia Council (80 per cent of which was later reinstated after sector-wide criticism). ""That was a disaster for the governance of the arts sector and did a lot of damage that's taken years to repair,"" Eltham says. ""I also think the ongoing attacks on the ABC across really the entire nine years of the Coalition government are really significant."" Despite the increase to arts funding in response to COVID-19, federal spending over the past decade has been in decline. Analysis by think tank A New Approach concluded that per capita federal arts funding fell by 22.7 per cent between 2007–08 and 2019–20. Eltham says arts funding is low on the government's list of priorities both politically and electorally. Two years of cancellations and hundreds of thousands of lost gigs have had lasting impacts on Australia’s performing arts sector. ""Arts Minister Paul Fletcher is very much running on his record, and he can rightly point to a significant amount of spending in terms of pandemic stimulus for the arts. The RISE program ran to more than $200 million and it's definitely the case that some of that money flowed to artists and was very helpful. ""[But] the last budget before the election wound back most of that stimulus and actually locked in cuts to a lot of the arts portfolio going forward. There's significant austerity coming down the line for the national cultural institutions,"" he says. In the lead-up to the election, peak visual arts and crafts body the National Association for the Visual Arts (NAVA) has been campaigning for stronger policy commitments from across the political spectrum using the slogan #VoteForArts. As part of their campaign, NAVA has produced an election ""report card"" to compare pre-election commitments between the major parties against five key policy priority areas. NAVA's executive director Penelope Benton says one of the most pressing issues for artists in this election is recognition. ""We want recognition that art is a real job: that artists and art is essential, not just for the people who make it or for diehard art lovers but for everybody."" She says the pandemic has had a huge impact on morale in the arts community. ""[Artists] feel really discarded and ignored. Mental health has taken a really big hit because of the [government's] rhetoric around [artists being] non-essential throughout the pandemic."" Because of the arts sector's reliance on casuals, many arts workers were ineligible for government subsidies during the pandemic. Eltham says the highly insecure and precarious nature of arts work — the ""original gig economy"" — has only been exacerbated by the pandemic. ""The most pressing problem in the cultural labour market is that wages are low and in fact falling in real terms. And that's a real crisis not just for the arts but more broadly for the enjoyment of culture from ordinary Australians. ""We're losing a lot of talent and we're also eroding the ability of ordinary Australians to gain access to a rich cultural life,"" he says. The Greens' artist's wage program offers a possible solution to this, but Eltham says its implementation hinges on whether the Greens are able to get the balance of power in the Senate. ""[If they don't], it's hard to see whether they'll have the leverage to get any of this up. But let's assume that they can make it work politically, then potentially, it is transformative."" Pointing to the proposal to double funding for the Australia Council, which would lift their total allocation to $439.6 million a year, Eltham says: ""That would be transformative for the small and medium sector, which is the most creative and the most energetic part of performing arts and small-scale creative sector in Australia."" Are you a dynamic early-career PhD scholars or Arts practitioner, with a flair and passion for communicating your work to a non-academic audience? Benton agrees that the Greens' policy has a lot of potential and aligns with a number of NAVA's priority areas. ""I commend the Greens for putting out this policy. I think it's really great. But there are a lot of really specific things in there that could do with some massaging. ""It's quite weighted to the performing arts sector and [the language] excludes the visual arts. [But] it could be broadened and I'd like to work with them on doing that. I've expressed that to Senator Hanson-Young,"" Benton says. In pledging to develop a national cultural policy, Burke said on Monday afternoon that a Labor government would seek to get the arts sector ""back on track quickly"". Benton says: ""I agree with what the Labor party have said, and I think everybody [in the sector] does, that we don't have another three or four years to be in the state that we're in right now. ""I think the first step is meeting with all the different art forms and talking to them. There's a lot of expertise in the industry already and there's a lot of listening that needs to happen,"" she says. Eltham takes a more critical view of Labor's announcement, saying their 2019 arts policy under Bill Shorten was a stronger pitch. ""I don't see a lot of merit in [this announcement], unfortunately. They've had nine years in opposition and they had a pretty good policy statement last time around. I actually see this as walking back on what was promised three years ago."" He also says that creating a national cultural policy isn't necessarily the best strategy. ""What we need is a big reinvestment in support for the arts and culture. If that's wrapped up with a shiny document and called a policy, then that's fine, but it's more about where the rubber hits the road. ""We've got to imagine the arts and culture in this country for the public good. We've got to invest in this sector, not because of its economic value, which is important, but because of its cultural value — because it's important to ordinary citizens, because it helps them understand what it's like to be an Australian in the year 2022 [and] because it helps us understand who we are as human beings."" While Benton broadly supports Labor's proposal, she has some caveats. ""I think a good critique of the Creative Australia cultural policy is necessary — it's 10 years old and things have changed,"" she says. ""I also think that collaborating, consulting and listening to First Nations practitioners is essential and really needs to be at the core of that work."" Labor has emphasised the need to put First Nations culture at the forefront of arts policy — a suggestion that has been made previously and which Benton and Eltham agree is now long overdue. ""[During the pandemic], there was this realisation that Indigenous art has become the national identity, and that's been recognised in the international arena for some time but has [lagged] domestically,"" says Matthew Everitt, president of Indigenous-led arts advocacy body the Aboriginal Art Association of Australia. Everitt is a proud Taungurung man from the Kulin Nation in Central Victoria and says for there to be greater recognition of Indigenous arts in Australia's cultural life, the development of a national cultural policy should be First Nations-led. ""There are cultural nuances that need to be understood about who gets to tell what stories. The ideation and the road map needs to come from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people — that's critical."" He says a whole-of-government approach and pan-industry consultation are also needed. ""You've got to look at the industry as a tapestry — everything's connected. ""[Consultation] has to be across the whole sector — right through distribution, wholesale retail dealers, arts centres, independent artists: the whole gamut — because they're the ones who are living it,"" he says. Acknowledging the far-reaching impacts of COVID, the government commissioned an inquiry into Australia's creative and cultural industries and institutions — they are due to report back on its 22 recommendations in December. Among the recommendations is the establishment of a National Centre for Indigenous Arts and Culture. ""That idea has been floating around for a long time, in different stages of feasibility. I think it is really important to not only look at what one National Centre of Excellence would look like but what it would look like in individual states,"" says Everitt. In embedding First Nations' arts and culture in policy, Everitt says it's time for governments to transition from a consultation to a co-design process. ""It's important for policymakers to be able to identify and prioritise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander challenges and advancements so … when we're talking about self-determination, economic participation, and social and cultural uplift, it's really important that we have these priorities in place."" While Labor has said they will centre First Nations arts and culture in developing their cultural policy if elected, Eltham says funding commitments are needed to make this pledge meaningful. ""Labor hasn't promised any new funding for the Australia Council, but if [they] wanted to do more funding for First Nations arts and culture, presumably that's where it would have to be done. So I question where that priority is going to actually materialise."" He says there are a lot of other opportunities for investment. ""Funding for Indigenous media for example, as the Greens have promised. Labor's [promise] of support for First Nations languages in schools [is] really positive. But I would like to see funding for First Nations performing arts, First Nations literature, First Nations music."" If the Coalition is re-elected and does not commit further funding to the arts beyond what has been announced in the budget, Eltham says it will return the sector to austerity. ""It'll reimpose fairly stringent funding cuts or at least static funding over the medium term. ""That really means it'll be an underfunded sector, and that's disappointing because things weren't exactly great in 2019 going into the pandemic. Then the sector has faced its worst crisis in 100 years."" Eltham says many parts of the sector, particularly the performing arts, are ""hanging on by their fingernails"". ""They absolutely have not recovered to anything like 2019 levels. So there's a lot of pain in the sector."" Benton says the lack of a strategic vision and robust support for the arts is ""a lost opportunity for the country"". ""The sector will be the shadow of what it should and could be. There'll still be elements of it that exist because people are so passionate about what they do, and will work to make things happen because it's important to us. ""But it's not healthy and it's not sustainable,"" she says. One of the key priorities NAVA has been advocating for during the election is to stimulate long-term sustainability in the arts sector. Tops Arts & Culture headlines. ""We really do need a whole-of-government national cultural plan because [although] the Coalition has given money to the arts throughout the pandemic … it isn't informed by a bigger picture. ""You have these big chunks of money being chucked at one-off things that have an impact in the moment, but then [they're] gone. ""[That approach] doesn't have impact across the broader ecology and that's what we believe a national cultural plan will do,"" she says. Benton says she retains hope that the government, if re-elected, will support the arts beyond what they've announced in the budget.

182,Court told actor who confronted Craig McLachlan about onstage kiss was warned she'd never work in industry again,arts-culture,"  Court told actor who confronted Craig McLachlan about onstage kiss was warned she'd never work in industry again A Sydney court has been told that actor Craig McLachlan threatened a fellow cast member that she would ""never work in the industry again"" after she confronted him about an onstage kiss. Mr McLachlan is suing the ABC, Nine newspapers and actor Christie Whelan Browne for defamation over several reports in 2018 alleging that he had indecently assaulted, bullied, harassed and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 tour of The Rocky Horror Show. The judge in the NSW Supreme Court heard from several witnesses, including actor Brendan Irving, who played the character of Rocky during the tour. Michael Hodge QC — the barrister representing the media organisations and Ms Whelan Browne — quizzed Mr Irving about a 2014 meeting he had with fellow cast member Angela Scundi. The court was told that, during the meeting, Ms Scundi told him she had confronted Mr McLachlan about an onstage kiss, telling him not to do it again, to which he responded: ""You will never work in this industry again."" Mr Irving described the atmosphere on set as ""touchy"" and noted that cast members were often affectionate with each other, which included ""hugging, kissing and sitting on one another's lap"". He told the court of an incident where Ms Whelan Browne shared images of her faeces with other cast members. ""She was going through a phase of taking photos of her poo and showing it to the cast,"" Mr Irving said. ""Her humour wasn't in line with mine."" The court also heard from Mr McLachlan's close friend, Kellie Chandler, who described Mr McLachlan as being ""very fragile"" after reports of the allegations against him were aired in 2018. ""He wouldn't come down from his bedroom and that broke my heart,"" Ms Chandler said. ""He's a shell of his former self. ""He's not the Craig that I know and love."" The case is centred around two reports aired on the ABC's 7.30 program, as well as an article published in the Sydney Morning Herald in January 2018, which the actor has claimed damaged his reputation. Mr McLachlan denies all claims of sexual harassment and bullying that were aired in the reports. During the defamation trial, 11 women are due to give evidence, alleging Mr McLachlan behaved inappropriately during theatre and television productions. About 30 to 40 witnesses are expected to be called during the trial, which is likely to continue for another four weeks.

183,Invention that signals 'we shouldn't be playing this late' saves community's basketball ring,arts-culture,"  Coburg basketball ring gets innovative upgrade after night noise complaints A public basketball hoop in Melbourne's north has been saved by the innovative thinking of a council worker and two industrial design students. The hoop in Coburg's Bush Reserve was removed after police and council received several complaints about the noise of late-night basketballers disrupting residents between 10pm and 2am. ""We want young people to have a good time, but to do it in a way that is a bit more respectful of those living nearby,"" Moreland City Council Mayor Mark Riley said. ""There are other sites where they can go that aren't so close to residents."" After verbal warnings were not enough to keep the late-night noise at bay the hoop was removed in July 2021. Determined to find a way to reinstall the ring, a council worker investigated what existing technology was available to automatically remove the hoop at night and return it during daylight hours. When he couldn't find any workable solutions on the market, he approached a number of Melbourne universities seeking a solution. Monash University industrial design students Marcell Aryananda and Jules Kabore were told about the brief and took up the design challenge. After researching various possible solutions and the cost, the pair came up with a relatively simple and inexpensive design. ""It's essentially a pole that extends out at certain times in the middle of the hoop to stop the ball going through,"" Mr Kabore said. ""But it is also a social cue that we shouldn't be playing this late."" The pole is connected to a circuit board which is programmed to extend the pole at 10pm and retract it at 8am. Mr Aryananda said it was powered by a battery and a solar panel. ""We have an internal clock to support that circuit board, so it knows what time it is,"" he said. The device was installed in early April and has performed well so far. All up the materials cost $1,200. ""I am relieved that it is working,"" Mr Aryananda said. ""The project has been really fulfilling honestly."" Mr Riley says it is a ""win-win"" for everybody. ""The local residents are really pleased with it, but the young ones kind of get it as well,"" he said. Moreland City Council is keen to try out refined versions of the invention at two other sites within the municipality. ""I was really impressed by the students' thinking,"" Mr Riley said. For Mr Aryananda and Mr Kabore, it was also a great opportunity to kickstart their careers. ""As young designers it's quite difficult to enter into the field,"" Mr Kabore said. ""The fact they were willing to help us in every regard and sponsor us through this has been great. ""We are not offered these opportunities very often.""

184,Dress library plans for Beechworth to make the deb ball more accessible for all,arts-culture,"  Dress library plans for Beechworth to make the debutante ball more accessible for all Beechworth's dress library is in its infancy and in less than a week around 75 dresses have been offered up. Old fashioned to some, a rite of passage to others, the debutante ball or ""deb"" remains popular in some regional communities, but price can prove an obstacle for those who want to join in. Josie Cornish, the woman behind the dress library, does not have memories of her own debutante ball. She said her family could not afford a dress, and it was an experience a lot of girls around her at the time shared. ""It would have been wonderful, but money didn't allow it,"" Ms Cornish said. But she remembers her friends who did and attended their ball looking ""absolutely beautiful"". ""It's sad that some people can't go because their parents can't afford the dresses"" Ms Cornish said, which was why she took her idea to start a local dress library to a Facebook Community Page. It quickly became clear that other people felt the same way. Offers of debutant dresses have begun to threaten to overwhelm her. The north-east Victorian town of Beechworth has a perception as quite a wealthy area, but Ms Cornish said many families were struggling. Experience at a local op shop meant she saw firsthand that there were some families scraping to meet day-to-day expenses, let alone the costs associated with a high school formal or debutante ball. There will be not just debutante dresses on offer — formal dresses and men's suits are also being included as they are volunteered. Ms Cornish said the advantage with debutante dresses was that the fashions tended to stay the same. ""The first one I got was seven years old and it's just amazing,"" she said. Ms Cornish's vision has been bolstered by four volunteers who have put up their hands to help operate the mammoth communal wardrobe. Already wrangling dozens of dresses, Ms Cornish said she was hopeful they would be able to offer a bigger range of sizes as more come in. The plan is that ""anyone can donate, and anyone can borrow,"" she said, and they plan to charge a small fee to offset dry cleaning costs. ""It's more a borrow. We're not going to charge too much, and if they can't afford it we'll charge them nothing,"" she said. It is not yet clear when it will be up and running, but ""we'll be ready soon"", she said. The next obstacle is space. ""The only problem is we're looking for somewhere to store them,"" Ms Cornish said.

186,"'Like a giant hug for Ukraine': The grand plan to cover bombed buildings, muddy graveyards in sunflower fabric",arts-culture,"  Like the famous artist Christo, who wrapped some of the world's most iconic landmarks in silk, an Australian artist wants to wrap the bombed buildings and muddy graveyards of Ukraine in fabric. But not just any fabric. It will be a quilt of sunflower patches. ""It's like a giant hug for Ukraine, especially for the children,"" artist Janno McLaughlin said as she sat in her WWII army depot home in Scone, in the NSW Hunter Valley. McLaughlin, who has connections all over the world, said her heart shattered as the news of Russia's invasion reverberated around the globe nearly three months ago. ""Because I had that little connection with those Ukraine kids that I worked with, my mind went straight to them — how are they, where are they, are they OK, are they alive?"" But in a bid to turn something so horrible into a bright burst of hope, she's now on the hunt for about 1,000 quilt patches to form a huge art installation. ""I want it as big as we can get,"" McLaughlin said. ""The more patches we can get the better. She said a creation that would cover ""an acre block"" would send a message. ""They need to feel like the outside world is looking at them and they are not alone,"" she said. She said Ukraine's national flower, the sunflower, was her inspiration. ""There's something about finding a symbol that the people of Ukraine can associate with,"" McLaughlin said. She said the quilt patches also symbolised hope and new growth. ""I envisage that the quilt will be a huge 100m by 100m at least, that people can stand around and hold in an art event,"" McLaughlin said. ""I'd love to drape it from one of those buildings that have been burnt out, or the bombed-out train stations or on one of those awful mass graves."" Fuelled by tea and scones, the local Country Women's Association is also on board. Scone and District president Lyn Tout said the association was all about helping people to offer comfort and support. ""People's wellbeing is so important,"" she said. ""If we can send some little messages of support and love and just embrace Ukraine, that's what the project is all about."" Ms Tout rallied more keen quilters at the recent NSW CWA Conference, where the organisation celebrated its 100th birthday. She said patches were coming from all over the world. ""I'm waiting on some from South Africa, we've had some from Massachusetts, New York, England, church groups, artists everywhere, New Zealand and all over Australia,"" Ms Tout said. On the other side of the world is Iryna Pyrtko-Morozis, the founder of cultural development and charity fund, Sincere Education. She lives in London but has family in Ukraine. She met McLaughlin last year. ""She simply makes an impact every single day. She talks about Ukraine every single day. She unites people in support of Ukraine every day,"" Ms Pyrtko-Morozis said. ""We cannot all go to actually fight in Ukraine, not even be volunteers, but we all can do our own part and that is what brings us closer to each other as humans and brings us closer to the victory of justice, truth and independence."" McLaughlin said it was hard as adults to fully understand what was happening in Ukraine but harder still for young minds. ""The way that they described it at Scone and District preschool was that people in Ukraine were sad and they wanted to do something that was going to lift their spirits, so that's how they explained it to the littlies there,"" she said. ""The Ukrainians really do believe they're going to win this. ""It's not a war they asked for. They're protecting their homeland and protecting their right to freedom. ""When all this horror is done, I can see [the quilt] being laid down … people coming together. Maybe we'll cry, sing … however, we are going to move forward."" McLaughlin and her team are assembling the patches in sections to make travel a little easier. She hopes to get it into the war-torn country by its Independence Day on August 24. ""The main goal is to make it first, then get it to Ukraine somehow,"" she said. ""If worst comes to worst, I'll just get on a plane and take it to London to [Iryna]."" She said what started as a little gesture had grown beyond expectations. Send your 30cm by 30cm patches to: Janno MclaughlinPO Box 746Scone, NSW 2337 ""Art is really powerful … you don't need to speak a language but you can be moved by it,"" she said. ""And in the making of the patches, there's something about it, while you're watching the news … It actually gives the maker a feeling of purpose, of empathy, it feels like you are doing something. ""Just trying to hold it together in the face of something so shocking.""

187,live: NSW Now: Community in shock over stabbing of Hawkesbury Mayor,arts-culture,"  Here's what you need to know this morning. The Deputy Mayor of Hawkesbury Council says the stabbing of the local Mayor during a violent home invasion has left fellow councillors and the community horrified. Patrick Conolly, 32, was stabbed in the arm and threatened by at least five men who forced their way into his Bligh Park home early on Monday morning. His wife and four young children were at home at the time but were not injured. Police believe the attack was a case of mistaken identity. Deputy Mayor Barry Calvert said Mr Conolly was understood to be recovering well after the ordeal. ""If I was him, I'd be in a state of shock,"" he said. ""You're just at home minding your own business and suddenly five or six big fellows come in and start pushing you around. ""It must have been traumatic for the whole family."" The NSW mental health commissioner says improved access to telehealth could be behind a jump in the number of people in regional areas seeking help. The commission's latest COVID-19 wellbeing survey showed the number of regional residents accessing support jumped from 40 per cent in 2020 to 53 per cent in 2021. Commissioner Catherine Lourey said she was surprised to learn how badly the pandemic affected mental health in regional communities last year. She said rural communities felt a stronger sense of connection and resilience during the first wave of the pandemic, but the cumulative effects of drought, fire, flood and the mouse plague might have led to a decline last year. ""That's a real concern for us to really keep top of mind — that especially for some regional communities, there's that sequence of impacts, and that probably contributed as well."" Artist, writer and educator Safdar Ahmed has won the Book of the Year gong at the NSW Premier's Literary Awards for his graphic novel Still Alive: Notes from Australia's Immigration Detention System. Described by the judges as a work of ""vision, ambition and achievement"", Still Alive was awarded Book of the Year  Award ($10,000) and the Multicultural NSW Award ($20,000). ""Ahmed's work stands out as an example of brilliant storytelling created with and through community, a labour of generosity, and love. It is an unflinching critique of policy and discourse that demonstrates the power of art,"" the judges said. Still Alive combines different genres to share the stories of asylum seekers detained in Sydney's Villawood Immigration Detention Centre and in offshore detention on Nauru and Manus Island. Other winners included Tony Birch, who was awarded the Christina Stead Prize for Fiction ($40,000) for his latest short story collection, Dark as Last Night, and Kate Holden, who won the Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction ($40,000) for The Winter Road: A Story of Legacy, Land and a Killing at Croppa Creek. Katherine Brabon won the publicly voted People's Choice Award for her second novel The Shut Ins, which dives into the life of a hikikomori (a person who avoids social contact). Two men have been charged over the assault of a 31-year-old man at Strathfield in Sydney's inner west. Emergency services were called to Strathfield Railway Station after reports of a brawl in the early hours of Sunday morning. A man suffering head injuries was found in a nearby car park on Albert Road and police were told he had been assaulted by up to three men who were seen running towards the railway station. The man was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in a serious condition. Late on Sunday, two 18-year-old men were arrested and taken to Auburn Police Station where they were charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company of others. They have been refused bail to appear before Burwood Local Court on Monday May 16. Anti-domestic-violence groups say a Fair Work Commission in-principle decision giving paid leave to millions of workers experiencing domestic and family violence is a ""game changer"". The industrial umpire yesterday announced the provisional decision granting around 2.5 million award workers 10 days of paid leave if they are victims of domestic violence. Whoever wins the federal election will have to decide whether to extend the leave to more than 8 million workers covered by the National Employment Standards. Hayley Foster from Full Stop Australia said it was a ""landmark"" decision. Unions are hoping it will set a precedent for all employed Australians. Sunny.

188,This 10-minute virtual reality experience is designed to counter suicidal thoughts with awe,arts-culture,"  UNSW’s Felt Experience and Empathy Lab combines art and technology to design psychosocial supports for wellbeing Picture entering a room that is like a blank canvas: colourless and bare apart from a door, two windows, and a virtual reality headset. Curiosity compels you to pick up the headset. At first, you see a simulation of the same bare room; the colours, scale, and layout remain unchanged. As you move about the room, you discover you can interact with elements of both your physical and virtual environments — what is known as a 'mixed reality' experience — and these small interactions transform the space. You open a window and the scene beyond morphs into a lofty mountain landscape; a luscious meadow; a sun-soaked beach. Edge of the Present is a 10-minute immersive and sensory installation developed by a team of mental health specialists, artists and technologists from Sydney's Felt Experience and Empathy Lab (fEEL). ""We spent a lot of time thinking about 'What would be awesome and how could you feel it?'"" says Professor Jill Bennett, director of the Big Anxiety Research Centre (BARC) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), which incorporates fEEL. fEEL uses cutting-edge immersive technology to create trauma-informed sensory experiences and tools — ranging from virtual reality installations to live art and performance. ""Art always gives greater freedom [and] that's a significant add-on to what psychotherapy allows. Especially in trauma therapy, because trauma is [an experience that is] hard to express,"" Professor Bennett says. The project was developed in consultation with people with lived experiences of suicide survival, and draws on neuropsychological research on the importance of cultivating imagination and future-thinking in preventing suicide. ""This is a new kind of practice, where we're knitting together distinct expertise to create something new that is built on a long tradition of psychotherapy,"" Professor Bennett says. In creating Edge of the Present, the fEEL team set out to design a sensory experience that would evoke positive mental imagery and a sense of awe. ""Because people with severe depression don't tend to experience awesomeness. In fact, they often have what's referred to as 'overgeneral memory': when they think about themselves in the past or when they think about their future, which uses the same kind of neural pathways, they don't have a lot of emotion attached to that,"" Professor Bennett says. In addition to the eight dynamic landscapes that evolve within the installation, Edge of the Present incorporates sensory stimulants — including a simulated breeze and snow. ""It's hard not to be uplifted by that, and when we test it on people, their mood improves and feelings of hopefulness improve."" Professor Bennett's team at fEEL draws on what is known as psychosocial design to study embodied experiences of mental illness, trauma and aging. ""At the moment, there is great interest in moving beyond just the narrow clinical or medical realm and saying, you know, we need to think of trauma support more broadly,"" she says. Get a selection of the best mental health content from across the ABC by subscribing to our monthly newsletter In the context of mental health care, psychosocial interventions are broadly understood as therapeutic strategies that are non-pharmacological (i.e.don't rely on medication) and instead focus on improving social and psychological factors that may be contributing to mental ill health. Psychosocial interventions encompass a wide range of strategies, including cognitive and behavioural therapies, group therapy, exercise, skills training, community engagement and creative activities. Through their community consultation and collaborative research, Professor Bennett's team applies a psychosocial lens to designing creative projects that explore trauma and enhance wellbeing. ""[We create] tools and programs that are beneficial to people's mental health — but not just mental health conceived as a chemical imbalance in the brain and an individual thing, but that understands people's interactions, the social determinants of trauma and mental health, and how environments and social relationships can contribute to better mental health,"" says Professor Bennett. In developing Edge of the Present, one of the key psychosocial design considerations was embedding agency in the way participants interact with the space. ""We didn't just want to create this 'blissed out' experience, because with suicidality, the really key thing is that you have a sense of your own agency and that you can make things happen. ""It's this sense of, you do a small action, and there's a reward. You can open doors and windows and that triggers something amazing,"" she says. The title of the project stems from a conversation with one of fEEL's lived experience collaborators, who described the state of suicidality as ""being on the edge of the present"" and unable to see into the future. ""What we're saying is, 'Let's just see what can happen, just try this one tiny thing, and see if you can create some change'."" Professor Bennett says people who haven't experienced suicidality may underestimate the significance of being able to take a small forward action. ""As [someone] in our focus group pointed out, you might be able to experience awe in actual nature and, at a certain point, virtual nature doesn't replace real nature. But the point is that you have to plan a trip, you have to drive there … [with this tool], you open a door and it's not one but eight massive experiences in succession. ""And that's the key thing if you are in major depression or if you're suicidal; to get that instant hit is really important,"" she says. In testing Edge of the Present, Professor Bennett's team conducted a pilot study to assess how participants felt after interacting with the installation, and found that positive mood and wellbeing increased by 16 and 13 per cent respectively, while feelings of hopelessness decreased by 35 per cent. ""There is a significant improvement in mood, and so what we want to do is to try to scale this and see if it can be sustained,"" says Professor Bennett. In Australia, suicide is the leading cause of death among young people. In 2020, deaths by suicide represented just under one in three deaths among people aged 15–17 (31 per cent) and around two in five deaths for people aged 18–24 (39 per cent). ABS data shows that over 90 per cent of people who died by suicide in 2020 reported at least one risk factor, and two-thirds of people experienced both mental and behavioural disorders and psychosocial risk factors. Katherine Boydell is a Professor of Mental Health at the Black Dog Institute and collaborated with fEEL on Edge of the Present, and says there is significant need for these kinds of projects to be scaled up and made more readily available. ""We've just applied for a grant to see if we can make this immersive experience more accessible, so that you don't have to have the actual physical structure of the room — you can just put on a headset,"" she says. Creative and non-pharmacological approaches to addressing mental ill health are becoming increasingly important in Australia, Professor Boydell says — particularly in overcoming some of the barriers to help-seeking associated with more traditional or clinical approaches. Research shows that around one in two Australians experiencing mental ill health do not seek help (although hearteningly, the treatment rate is improving). ""One of the barriers to help-seeking in the formal system has been stigma. And when you think about community resources, [arts-based interventions] are almost like a stealth intervention because it's not focused on mental health — it's focused on doing something else to have an impact on mental health,"" Professor Boydell says. In 2020, the Productivity Commission's mental health inquiry identified ""significant gaps"" in psychosocial support services because of inefficient and short-term funding arrangements, and identified a need to scale up services to make them more accessible. The report found that of the estimated 290,000 Australians who experience severe mental illness, only a quarter currently access psychosocial support measures through government-funded programs. Professor Boydell says this emphasises the need for a ""whole-of-community approach"". ""We have good evidence that engaging in the arts has all of these wonderful positive impacts on overall mental health and wellbeing. ""Especially, when it comes to this 'epidemic of loneliness' … [arts-based] social prescribing programs can really address some of those broader social determinants of health in a more holistic way,"" she says. According to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), mental health is the number one reason Australians visit the GP, and has been for the past five years in a row. The need for expanded support services has only been accelerated by the pandemic, with ABS data from 2020-21 showing that 15 per cent of Australians aged between 16-85 experienced high or very high levels of psychological distress, up from 13 per cent in 2017-18. Young Australians were more than twice as likely as older Australians to experience high or very high levels of psychological distress, with a rate of 20 per cent for people aged 16-34 years compared with 9 per cent for those aged 65-85 years. Professor Bennett echoes the need to develop arts-based psychosocial support measures at scale. ""We're very much concerned with delivering psychosocial benefits. And this is common to approaches that focus on trauma — because trauma, for the most part, is not an illness of the brain; it's something that results from an event or a set of conditions that are traumatising,"" says Professor Bennett. ""Treatment can't just be pharmacological, it has to be looking at how we can change a situation, how we can bolster someone's sense of agency and control, and how we can enable them to develop what's sometimes called resilience."" She says arts interventions and programs are particularly well-placed as psychosocial support strategies. The benefits of creative practice on mental health and wellbeing are widely documented. From treating anxiety and depression to Alzheimer's Disease and post-traumatic stress disorder, there is an overwhelming body of evidence in favour of integrating arts and creativity into mental health care. Last October, RACGP called upon the federal government to invest in a national social prescribing scheme to address the worsening mental health crisis fanned by COVID-19. Professor Boydell says: ""[Social prescribing] is about thinking about informal and community resources that can address health and mental health issues that are more aligned with a 'social determinants of health' approach."" ""So if you've got somebody who's going to a clinic for depression, but they're depressed because they're marginally housed, or they're in debt over their heads, or they're lonely, then you can begin to imagine that no amount of psychosocial interventions or medication is going to address that issue,"" she says. That's where social prescribing can help. Through her work at the Black Dog Institute, Professor Boydell has spent many years researching and evaluating the benefits of arts-on-prescription programs, which are a subset of social prescribing. In Space 22, a six-part documentary series premiering on ABC TV on Tuesday night (May 17), seven Australians with lived experiences of mental ill health take part in an arts-on-prescription experiment. With the support of mental health specialists, including Professor Boydell, participants explore past traumas through a series of creative workshops led by multidisciplinary artist Abdul Abdullah, Archibald-winning visual artist Wendy Sharpe and singer-songwriter Eddie Perfect. Vivienne, a 55-year-old retired medical researcher, is one of the show's participants. She heard about the program through a community centre she is involved with in Sydney's inner west, and says that as a scientist she was excited at the prospect of exploring how art impacts the brain. ""There are feelings inside of me that, even when they come up, are really hard to express in words,"" she says. ""And I thought if I can express them in other ways because, you know, art is a form of expression … maybe that would be really good."" Vivienne has had a long journey with mental health. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), she describes herself as a fighter. ""I started being abused when I was five. My life has been about recovering from that experience."" In her twenties, Vivienne turned to drugs and alcohol as a way to cope. ""I just needed something to soothe me and to take the pain away really,"" she says. ""My whole adult life has been about getting therapy and maintaining my sobriety, but there've been times where I've gone back into that and lost faith in the process. And then I've had to come back out of it again. ""I'm lucky because a lot of people don't make it."" She says she reached a turning point about five years ago, when she turned 50, and is now in a place where she feels ""less attached to the past"". Embarking on the Space 22 project was a transformational experience for Vivienne. She says working with Wendy Sharpe was particularly affecting. ""Wendy really got to the heart of us, you know. She wanted us to paint our feelings. For me, that was the process where my brain actually felt like it switched. Like, almost my thought pattern changed. ""It's just a different way of seeing things and it's really brought out the colours in everything,"" she says. Professor Boydell was recruited to help assess the efficacy of the Space 22 program, and its impact on participants' wellbeing. ""In Space 22, [the participants] are expressing their experiences by using visual and performative and literary means, so it's another way of sharing things that are difficult to put into words and to talk about,"" she says. ""I also think it creates this sense of not being alone, a sense of community, and [a] decrease in isolation or feelings of loneliness… not to mention the capacity to be creative."" Professor Boydell says these connections can be ""transformative"". Having never participated in artistic practice prior to Space 22, Vivienne says that painting is now a part of her life. ""There's such a strong connection between me and the canvas. Like, it's the only thing I can see. It's amazing."" She says putting on music and painting has become a way for her to self-soothe. ""That's why I used to take drugs because I couldn't soothe myself. Post-traumatic stress lives in your central nervous system and it becomes unbearable if left untreated. ""I'm telling you, doing the painting, just watching the colour go on, it's so soothing, which is what we all need. ""And that's the stuff that gets me through the difficult days."" Space 22 premieres Tuesday May 17 at 8pm on ABC TV. Edge of the Present will be featured in The Big Reach arts and mental health festival, an initiative of BARC, which runs between May 26 — 27 in Brisbane.

189,"Graphic novel about refugee experience wins $30,000 and top prize at literary awards",arts-culture,"  Refugee advocate Safdar Ahmed wins Book of the Year with graphic novel Still Alive at NSW Premier's Literary Awards Artist, writer and educator Safdar Ahmed has won Book of the Year at the NSW Premier's Literary Awards on Monday night for his powerful graphic novel Still Alive: Notes from Australia's Immigration Detention System. Described by the judges as a work of ""vision, ambition and achievement"", Still Alive was awarded Book of the Year ($10,000) and the Multicultural NSW Award ($20,000). ""Ahmed's work stands out as an example of brilliant storytelling created with and through community, a labour of generosity, and love. It is an unflinching critique of policy and discourse that demonstrates the power of art,"" the judges said. Still Alive was expanded from Ahmed's 2015 Walkley-winning documentary web-comic, which was made with the assistance of activist organisation GetUp! ""I certainly hope that this makes some contribution towards a sea change in this country in terms of how our government treats people who come to Australia seeking asylum, away from a policy of unconscionably cruel mandatory and indefinite detention and toward something a bit more humane,"" Ahmed said in his acceptance speech. Safdar Ahmed talks about Still Alive: Notes from Australia's Immigration Detention System. Ahmed has lived with the chronic inflammatory condition Crohn's disease for the past 10 years, during which time he has been supported by his mother. ""I think I'll give [the prize money] to her as a small way of thanking her for all the years she's helped me out,"" he told ABC Arts. This year's Christina Stead Prize for Fiction ($40,000) was awarded to Tony Birch for his latest short story collection, Dark as Last Night. Accepting his award at the State Library of NSW ceremony, Birch noted that he got his first library card 60 years ago. ""Without the public library I would not have become a writer. And without the public library many people would never get to access books. These are our institutions that we should treasure,"" he said. Other winners on the night included Kate Holden, who won the Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction ($40,000) for The Winter Road: A Story of Legacy, Land and a Killing at Croppa Creek; and Shaun Grant, who won the Betty Roland Prize for Scriptwriting ($30,000) for his screenplay for Australian film NITRAM. Katherine Brabon won the publicly voted People's Choice Award for her second novel The Shut Ins, which dives into the life of a hikikomori (a person who avoids social contact). Scroll down for full list of award-winners Ahmed's Still Alive combines journalism, memoir, the aesthetic conventions of underground comics and the horror genre to share the stories of asylum seekers detained in Sydney's Villawood Immigration Detention Centre and in offshore detention on Nauru and Manus Island. It also includes a potted history of Australia's refugee policy since the 1990s, under both Labor and Liberal governments. His book was written over six years but is the culmination of 10 years of volunteering with the Refugee Art Project, a community art organisation that Ahmed co-founded in 2010. The not-for-profit invites refugees to tell their own stories through drawing and painting, with some of the work going on to feature in exhibitions, journals and 'zines. ""In a restrictive environment like Villawood where, at the time, there were no cameras and no mobile phones with recording capability, [and] no journalists allowed to go in there, [making art] felt like the best way to record what was going on,"" Ahmed says. Still Alive also examines how art can be healing and cathartic, and give people a sense of agency. ""Art and storytelling allow trauma to be visualised, externalised, and re-embedded in its context, which provides greater feelings of safety and distance from it over time. In this sense art can help us process our experiences on some level to provide a new sense of control over our story and how it should be told,"" Ahmed writes. Writing Still Alive, Ahmed wrestled with whether he should insert himself into the narrative. Initially, he says, he thought, ""No, this book isn't about me. And the narrative and the emotional gist of it should be conveyed very strongly through other people's narratives."" But he soon realised that he needed to depict himself as well. ""Refugee Art Project was about using art to form community and to enable friendships and to help people process things in their own way and on their own terms,"" he explains. ""It would have been a bit dishonest for me not to talk about that as well, because I feel like art has done that for myself."" Ahmed writes in Still Alive about how art was a useful tool for processing his emotions when he lived with chronic depression: ""Art has helped me understand something about my relationship to the world."" He was inspired to create Still Alive by the graphic journalism of Maltese American cartoonist Joe Sacco (Palestine), which engages critically with the subjectivity of its author. ""That self-reflective element allowed me to ask broader questions about my own attitudes, my role in that environment [and] how refugees are perceived, [in order] to deal with those broader discourses,"" he says. In Still Alive, he writes: ""I find it hard to draw myself into this comic … it tackles life and death issues, which are bigger than my solipsistic art. Through the lottery of birth I've had a life of privilege, so I might not be the best person to record these stories. But as an Australian citizen aren't I implicated in the abuses of my government?"" He addresses ethical concerns about telling vulnerable people's stories by reproducing the work of refugees in detention, from the Refugee Art Project, with their permission and input. ""I felt very fortunate and privileged to be given the responsibility of sharing other people's stories and trying to create some representation of what people were telling me about their experiences of being in detention indefinitely,"" he says. Still Alive is the second graphic novel to win Book of the Year at the NSW Premier's Literary Awards, after Shaun Tan won in 2007 for The Arrival. While graphic novels are popular in countries such as Japan, France and the United States, interest in the form has also increased in Australia over the past 15 years — with independent publishers such as Twelve Panels Press, which published Still Alive, showcasing the work of Australian creatives. ""The market is always growing in the sense that, I think, graphic novels are becoming more appreciated, particularly by young people,"" Ahmed explains. He loves graphic novels because they bring together his interests in visual art and writing. ""I like to think of it as combining the logical, rational side of my brain, which is interested in telling stories and explaining causes and effects, with the intuitive, mystical side of me, which is more drawn to imagery and evocative visuals,"" he says. As a form, graphic novels are also uniquely suited to telling stories that are intended to spark change. Ahmed explains that cartooning has its origins in political protest and mocking people with power and privilege. ""For me, the power of graphic novels is that they belong in a tradition of subversive art … I see it as a form which is very well-tailored to creating work which is complex and rich, but also very critical."" Ahmed says he always hoped the book would find its way into the hands of young people and, since it was published, he has heard from many educators — including teachers and librarians — about Still Alive reaching that audience. ""I wanted young people to be educated and inspired by it,"" he says. ""I think young people care a lot more about the issues that actually matter, like climate change and human rights … I see change coming [from young people]."" This year's NSW Premier's Literary Awards has acknowledged another often-overlooked form: the short story. The last time a short story collection won the Christina Stead Prize for Fiction was in 2005 (Tim Winton's The Turning). To see short stories attract this level of attention is particularly validating for author, activist and historian Tony Birch, who has devoted much of his career to the form. While one of his major successes was a novel, The White Girl (which won the Indigenous Writers' Award at the NSW Premier's Literary Awards in 2020), he has published five short story collections, including Dark as Last Night. ""It's very rare that a short story collection wins a fiction prize when it's in the same category as novels,"" Birch says. ""I really love writing short fiction, so to have a short story collection win a general fiction prize, I really am very happy about that."" Dark as Last Night is a collection of 16 vivid short stories about ""people on the margins"". The stories traverse childhood experiences and family connections, as well as issues of domestic abuse, racism and grief. One describes a brother and sister packing up their late brother's housing commission flat. In another, a boy teaches his little brother how to ride a bike before he defends him against a gang of thieves. In another, teenagers in '70s Melbourne connect over the music of David Bowie. The collection was described by the award judges as ""captivating"": ""[The stories] rub at the seams and scars of contemporary life and carry us, along with their flawed but ultimately lovable characters, into bright hope, humour and appreciation."" For Birch, it takes more concentration to write a short story collection than a novel, as it involves inhabiting many different characters, as well as crafting the stories into a cohesive whole. ""One of the things I'd probably rally against is some people thinking the reason why short story collections tend not to win major prizes is that they're easier to write or it's not the same accomplishment as a novel,"" Birch says. ""I don't think it's harder or easier work, it's just a different form — and I think people should stop seeing short stories as an apprenticeship to move on to a novel,"" he says. Birch's younger brother, Wayne, died suddenly three years ago. Three stories in the collection are dedicated to him and draw upon Birch's experience of loss. Readers who have identified with his writing about grief approached him at writers' festivals to talk about their own experiences. ""I'm quite happy, obviously, for people to interpret the story any way they like and [to] relate it to any experience they like, as long as I feel that I've made a connection with a reader,"" he says. ""For me, that's the only reason to write: to make a connection with readers.""

190,Fashion Week ends with a new beginning for First Nations fashion designers as pop-up store opens,arts-culture,"  Momentous end to Fashion Week sees First Nations fashion designers announce official opening of Sydney pop-up store Fashion Week ended last week with an emphatic exclamation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander excellence. The First Nations Fashion + Design (FNFD) closing runway highlighted designers from right across Australia. FNFD celebrates independent Indigenous designers and supports their growth and development in the fashion industry. Supported by THE ICONIC, First Nations Fashion + Design wowed a packed crowd on Friday night, with female musicians and a primarily female line-up of designers as a way to explore the matriarchal structure of First Nations' culture. And while the event marked the end of a week in which fashion was front and centre, it's also a new beginning for First Nations fashion. For Sydneysiders, Election Day this Saturday, May 21, will also mark the official opening of the Edit Collection and First Nations Fashion + Design pop-up store in Chatswood on Sydney's Lower North Shore. It will be open for a month. Available will be the designs on display at Friday's show. The theme of the night was Our Island, Our Home – a campaign by Torres Strait Islander people to raise awareness about climate change. Christine Anu and Zipporah Corser-Anu, The Merindas and rapper BARKAA performed to a hyped audience. It was one of those rare events in these pandemic times in that it attracted a very large crowd. And there didn't seem to be a single person in the audience who didn't think this was an event worth attending and a fitting conclusion to Fashion Week 2022.

191,"'It's the vibe!': Land clearing case won, despite legal argument likened to The Castle's Dennis Denuto",arts-culture,"  Judge cites The Castle's Dennis Denuto in win for environmentalists against Liberal politician John Tucker's bid to clear land Tasmania's Supreme Court has blocked a state government MP from clearing a huge tract of land on his farm after a seven-year court battle waged by environmentalists. Despite likening part of their legal argument to that put by bumbling fictional lawyer Dennis Denuto in The Castle, Justice Stephen Estcourt has ruled in favour of the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, which had applied to stop Lyons Liberal MP John Tucker from clearing 1,800 hectares of native forest at his Ansons Bay farm. Dennis Denuto, played by Tiriel Mora, is the lawyer to protagonist Darryl Kerrigan in his bid to save his home in the 1997 Australian movie The Castle. Denuto famously argued ""it's the constitution, it's Mabo, it's justice, it's law, it's the vibe… I rest my case."" In the film, Denuto loses the case — which is later taken up, and won, by a retired Queen's Counsel with extensive experience in constitutional law. Tasmanian Conservation Trust chief executive Peter McGlone welcomed the Supreme Court decision. ""This is a fantastic outcome that has saved 1,800 hectares of native forest including habitat for numerous threatened species, including the Tasmanian devil, tiger quoll and New Holland mouse, and 491 hectares of critically endangered eucalyptus ovata forest,"" Mr McGlone said. Mr Tucker's father, also John Tucker, applied to clear the land for conversion to pasture in 2009. His application was refused by the Forest Practices Authority, which argued his plan would not properly protect threatened species as required under the relevant laws. After losing his appeal of the decision, Mr Tucker Snr then applied for compensation, which was knocked back by Liberal Environment Minister Matthew Groom almost five years later. ""I am not satisfied that you have undertaken to manage the threatened native vegetation community under a conservation covenant or management agreement,"" Mr Groom wrote in his 2014 letter. Mr Tucker Jnr successfully submitted a new plan to the FPA in early 2015. Part of the Nature Conservation Act allows landowners who have not received compensation to reapply for certification. In the Supreme Court, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust argued the plan submitted by Mr Tucker Jnr was different to that submitted by his father so did not meet that clause. Justice Estcourt's decision agreed the FPA was ""wrong to believe, as it evidently did, that it had no alternative but to certify the 2015 plan"". He described one aspect of Senior Counsel Lisa De Ferrari's argument as ""not unlike that of Dennis Denuto"" — but ultimately quashed the FPA's 2015 decision to certify Mr Tucker's landclearing plan. Forest Practices Authority chief forest practices officer Peter Volker described the decision as ""a bit of a wake up call"". ""It shows that environmental law is changing all the time and community expectations are a lot higher than they used to be,"" Dr Volker said. ""I think it's a bit of a wake up call for the FPA as a regulator, landowners and the government in terms of the change in community expectations around land clearing and conservation of natural and cultural values. ""The decision's has given some legal clarification around some very grey areas."" The Supreme Court decision does not prevent Mr Tucker from reapplying to clear the land, but any application would be assessed under new laws — including the Commonwealth EPBC Act. In a statement, John Tucker said the decision was ""very detailed and involves complex questions of law which we are still considering with our counsel"". ""The decision to quash the determination of the Forest Practice Authority provides clarity going forward… that we can avoid in any future applications."" Mr Tucker said at ""all times my late father and I have acted upon the advice of professionals and followed the recommendations and advice of the FPA"".

192,"Actor Craig McLachlan admits pretending to fellate a banana as a 'joke' on set, court hears",arts-culture,"  Craig McLachlan sent video of himself 'pretending to masturbate' to actor Christie Whelan Browne Actor Craig McLachlan has admitted he sent a video of himself ""pretending to masturbate"" while ""fully clothed"" to an actress he is suing for defamation. McLachlan is suing the ABC, Nine Newspapers and actress Christie Whelan Browne over 2018 reports alleging he indecently assaulted, harassed, bullied and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. McLachlan denies all claims of sexual harassment and bullying in the stories and says they ruined his reputation and put an end to his acting career. Under cross-examination in court Monday, the media's barrister, Michael Hodge QC, questioned McLachlan about a series of videos he sent to co-star Whelan Browne. Mr Hodge asked McLachlan if he texted a video of him ""purporting or pretending to masturbate"", to which McLachlan responded, ""fully clothed and not in a toilet, yes."" McLachlan was also accused of behaving crassly on set — something he strongly rejected, saying ""I don't use the word crassness in theatre"". The 56-year-old was subsequently questioned about a 12-minute blooper reel filmed in 2014 while McLachlan was a cast member on the ABC's The Doctor Blake Mysteries. Responding to questions from Mr Hodge, McLachlan admitted that in the video he is seen ""pretending to masturbate the arms of the crew"" and ""running up and kissing members of the crew"". Mr Hodge also asked: ""there's another thing you do on set; you do a performance when you have a banana, you pretend to fellate it?"" ""Yes,"" McLachlan responded. ""And then appear to deep-throat it?"" Mr Hodge questioned. ""The banana is already the appropriate shape but yes,"" McLachlan responded, adding that he didn't do it ""all the time"" but ""it's a joke I would perform."" Under questioning, McLachlan then agreed that this ""kind of sexual innuendo"" was brought by him onto the set of the 2014 Rocky Horror Show. Mr Hodge also suggested McLachlan manipulated co-star Whelan Browne into apologising for not congratulating him on being nominated for a 2014 Helpmann Award. McLachlan told the court he ""was confused"" by her lack of public congratulations because ""we were friends"". The jury heard that during this period, McLachlan emailed the show's director, Christopher Luscombe, referring to Ms Whelan Browne as a ""horror"" while also texting Whelan Browne, ""I've always supported you"". Hodge suggested this was evidence of ""manipulation"" — a suggestion McLachlan denied. McLachlan's team will have further opportunities to put forward their case as the trial continues. Later this afternoon, McLachlan's cross-examination finished and his partner, orchestral conductor Vanessa Scammell, entered the witness box. She described McLachlan as ""a wreck"" in the aftermath of the news reports and she became increasingly upset when testifying that his mental state was ""so damaged … I could barely get a constructive sentence out of him"". ""He was devastated, humiliated and betrayed,"" she told the court. ""He started to surf at night so [no one] would see him on the beach — such was his humiliation."" Ms Scammell will return to the stand tomorrow. The defamation trial is expected to run for another four weeks and will hear from 11 women who have accused McLachlan of inappropriate behaviour, claims he strongly denies.

196,Sculpture walk celebrating Yorta Yorta artists opens at Winton Wetlands,arts-culture,"  Winton Wetlands' sculpture walk celebrating Yorta Yorta artists opens A new sculpture walk has been unveiled at Winton Wetlands showcasing the work of Yorta Yorta artists. The Lotjpatj Natjan Danak, which means yarning and gathering pathway to sculptures, features 14 artworks from Yorta Yorta artists that represent special places, totems, cultural practices, and stories. The installation, which has been a collaboration between Winton Wetlands and the Yorta Yorta community, has been years in the making after receiving state government funding but was delayed by the pandemic. Winton Wetlands chief executive Sue Lebish said the group was thrilled the walk was open to the public. ""That collaboration has been extremely important because this is their land, we want them to come back and enjoy it and show everyone the interpretation they have in this land,"" she said. Yorta Yorta Nations Aboriginal Corporation representative for the project, Sonia Cooper, said it was exciting to see the project come together. ""With the support of the Yorta Yorta community and especially the artists and their families, this has happened, not only as a collaboration with the installation but making sure we bring the artist's ideas and their cultural expressions and their artistic expression out in the sculptures,"" she said. The pathway around the sculptures has been landscaped in the shape of a long-neck turtle, which is the totem of the Yorta Yorta people. ""The turtle is an indicator of wetlands health and river health, if you don't see the turtle cruising around or moving about then you must think something is up,"" Ms Cooper said. She said it was great to see the diversity in cultural expression across the artworks and people would be able to make their own connections to the area. ""While we have cultural expression, there is an element of contemporary works inside some of the art pieces as well, but it is linked to traditional cultural expression. ""Some are about the creation of country, it is about totemic species, it is about how that artist connections as an individual to country.""

197,Australia's Sheldon Riley impressed the Eurovision national juries. But what did the public think?,arts-culture,"  In order to earn your place at the top of the glittery Eurovision ladder, singers need to be popular with both the public and the professional juries which cast their vote to decide a winner. SPOILERS AHEAD: You have been warned! And Australia's Sheldon Riley was very popular with these professional juries, which are made up of participating countries that can vote for each other but not themselves. Riley received a respectable 123 points from these juries. But when those points were combined with the public vote, his overall score was 125. That's right – just two votes from the public. When that was announced, the room showed its support for Australia, which has been a participant in Eurovision since 2015 when it competed in the 60th anniversary of the song contest in what was meant to be a one-off affair. ""This has been the most incredible experience of my entire life,"" Riley said. ""It's all I ever wanted."" He went on to say he was told for a long time that dreaming of performing in Eurovision was futile. He was not too worried about where he placed. He was happy to have made it to the grand final. ""My performance was received so well by the room and it means the absolute world,"" Riley said. ""This is everything I could have dreamed of."" Riley was dressed in a flowing white outfit weighted in pearls and paired with a crystal mask when he took to the Eurovision stage to sing Not The Same. The 23-year-old from the Gold Coast mirrored his Australia Decides performance when he removed his mask towards the end of the song in a dramatic reveal — but he wasn't quite as overcome by emotion this time. Diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome at age six, the Filipino-Australian performer is best known for his work on reality TV shows such as The Voice and America's Got Talent. The Eurovision stage is the biggest one he's been on — it's the world's largest live music event. Australia finished in 15th place. Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra came out on top with the song Stefania, scoring a massive 430 points from televoters alone to take a total of 631 points. The United Kingdom, which typically doesn't place well in Eurovision, shot up to second place with Sam Ryder's SPACE MAN. The competition was this year held in Turin, Italy.

198,What tales do the ghost signs in your town tell?,arts-culture,"  Ghost signs of Australia's advertising past are more than faded memories Faded signs are the ghosts of advertisers past — once carefully hand-painted on billboards or business walls, then neglected and ignored for decades, they have become markers of our cultural history. These derelict advertisements are known as ""ghost signs"" and they attract a certain type of ghost hunter. Photographer Brady Michaels and partner and co-author Dale Campisi have toured Australia in an old mini-van to snap and catalogue the elusive phantoms. ""We call them ghost signs because they are ghosts of the past,"" Mr Michaels said. ""They are faded and have that ghostly appearance because they are faded, so the term really fits. ""Ghost signs generally refer to the hand-painted signs. My definition is a bit broader, because I will look at any old, faded sign."" Mr Michaels and Mr Campisi travelled about 40,000 kilometres on the way to producing their book, Signs of Australia. They are part of a serious and growing sign-hunting community. ""Their mission in life is to document these signs and to share them,"" Mr Michaels said. ""They're not all photographers, but I come at it from a more 'arty', photographic point of view."" The photo is only part of the joy of being a ""ghost hunter"". Much of the joy also comes from the hunt itself. ""It is definitely a treasure hunt, not knowing what you will find. It's a bit hit and miss,"" Mr Michaels said. ""I start with a search engine. You will find stuff there because there is already a community which includes ex-signwriters."" Mr Michaels said mining towns offer rich pickings as businesses there go through boom-and-bust cycles. Towns such as Broken Hill, Coober Pedy, Charters Towers, Clunes, and Ballarat are happy hunting grounds for ghost sign hunters. ""Different towns have different relationships with their old signs. Some towns painted over them with a view that old signs suggested towns that hadn't moved with the times,"" Mr Michaels said. ""Others have not been touched and are still there. But there are also old towns that recognise the appeal of these signs to draw people in."" Author and researcher Amy Tsilemanis tracked down and documented many old signs in and around Ballarat for a heritage project in 2015. ""I was asked to create a digital trail for Ballarat Heritage Weekend and that led to co-producing the website Ballarat Revealed,"" Dr Tsilemanis said. ""That site is still available for people to explore as they walk around the city. ""The first trail was about buildings and we created a slider function where you could see the site as it was in the past and what it looks like now. ""For the following year I worked on a second trail, with local historian and archivist Lauren Bourke, finding and photographing ghost signs around town and researching the stories behind them through local libraries and historical groups, Trove, and Public Records Office Victoria. ""It's always important when doing research like this to credit your sources because so much work goes into collating and maintaining historical information."" Dr Tsilemanis's research uncovered signs and stories of dentists, dressmakers, brewers, grocers, hoteliers, and more. ""As a lover of vintage advertising I was drawn to ones like Richards and Co photographers and the vivid descriptions of their wares, or really sweet ones like Jim and Marg Welsh's dance studio,"" Dr Tsilemanis said. ""Many people around town will still remember fondly learning to dance there. ""There's also the ones that reveal stories of immigration and how people made homes and formed communities in Ballarat."" Some ghost signs celebrate products which still exist. Others mark brands that have become ghosts themselves. Holden is as iconic as any Australian brand. The logos and signs that still mark former dealerships have become tourist destinations for Holden owners with a penchant for photography. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Ballarat's weekly email newsletter. ABC Ballarat's classic car correspondent John Emery said car lovers appreciated some of the old signs almost as much as their own old cars. ""These brands were a very big part of Australian history and that's why there is still so much affection for these signs,"" he said. ""There are no new Holdens anymore, so the signs don't really advertise anything now. But they are a visual reminder of that important history. ""It's not just car brands. Golden Fleece had service stations all over the place. Golden Fleece no longer exists as a brand but many of the signs are still there."" Some ghost signs maintain a presence even when they have completely faded or been painted over, Mr Emery said. ""There used to be a Peters Ice Cream sign at Sandown Raceway and that corner became known as Peters Corner,"" he said. ""The old signs have been painted over, but that corner will always be known as Peters Corner.""

199,'Giving the sad demise of majestic creatures another purpose': When it's your job to wade through dead whale blubber and guts ,arts-culture,"  Whale bone collector uncovering secrets of world's largest marine mammals David Stemmer's job as head of the SA Museum's cetacean collection sometimes has him knee-deep in tonnes of blood and offal to recover rotting carcasses of the largest mammals on earth, but he's happily turning the ugly into something beautiful for the world to see. The SA Museum has the largest and most comprehensive collection of cetacea in Australia attracting researchers from around the world. About 38 different species of whales, dolphins and porpoises are stored for research with the bulk of the 1,400 piece collection made up of 900 dolphin specimens. Mr Stemmer said the collection allowed research on population dynamics to help preserve the marine mammals by identifying and minimising human impact. But there are logistical considerations and limits on their ability to learn more about the largest cetaceans — some whales are very rarely sighted while others are too remote or bulky to be recovered. ""In general, the large whales are much, much harder to study because of their size,"" Mr Stemmer said. ""You can't have 20 blue whales in your collection because there's not a lot of room and that makes it a little bit harder to study. ""For some studies, you need lots of individuals to be able to get a good answer — the classic morphological study that is done on smaller animals can't be done."" Scientists used the smallest molecules to learn about the largest animals. ""A lot of the studies involve the molecular, looking at genetics,"" Mr Stemmer said. ""With the baleen whales, you can sample the baleen plates for isotopes. ""They grow a bit like hair, they're keratin, and they grow over time so you can sample them along the outer edge and extract the different isotope signatures from where they've been through their lives because different areas have different isotope signatures."" COVID travel restrictions have impacted research. ""Pre-COVID, we had visitors every now and again studying the collection because one of the other problems with cetaceans is they're too big to post around the world and the country,"" Mr Stemmer said. What happens when a whale dies at sea and is washed ashore? The team waited for a baleen whale researcher from the US to be able to travel and assist in dissecting a rare pygmy right whale that came from Port Lincoln. Mr Stemmer said the fishing industry helped collect and freeze the whale. ""They managed to collect that whole whale for use and put it in one of their bait freezers,"" he said. ""We kept it in the freezer until the US researcher could fly over to us to dissect that whale with us — it was quite exciting."" The pygmy right whale is in its own family and is one of the smallest whales at about 6 metres in length. ""There aren't many places in the world where they occur and Port Lincoln is a hot spot — most of our pygmy right whale specimens have come from  Port Lincoln,"" Mr Stemmer said. He said it was exciting when a stranding was discovered. ""We find out about whale strandings pretty quickly and with smartphones we get photos and we can decide whether to collect it if it's accessible,"" Mr Stemmer said. ""You will literally be knee deep in blood and guts when you collect large whales. ""And you have to be able to keep breathing until you don't notice the smell anymore. ""We actually had to hire a front end loader to move a whale further up the beach so we could collect it and sharks were feeding off it as well."" At other times, just a sample of the whale would be taken. ""There was a large male sperm whale and we couldn't collect the whole animal, that was just too much but the local park ranger used a chainsaw to cut the lower jaws off for us."" Smaller specimens are placed in a 2,500-litre maceration vat with heated water that rots the flesh from the bones — a process that takes several months. ""We also have a large concrete tank, swimming pool size, 35,000 litres, where we put large whales but that tank is not heated so we're relying on a nice warm summer for the animal to rot away,"" he said. Mr Stemmer enjoyed giving a second life to the whales. ""To go out on a beach and have this dead, stinking blob there, collect it and turn it into a beautiful skeleton for the collection — it gives the sad demise of one of these majestic creatures another purpose.""

200,"When Sarah's world began shrinking, she bought a drone ",arts-culture,"  The sun beats down on Sarah Jenkins' right shoulder as her daughter lifts her into a sling chair next to the pool. Her hands curl and grip the poles as she is hoisted into the air and swung around. Her toes find the water first, then her ankles, then all but her green eyes submerge below the surface. Except for the green noodle she uses to support her arms, Sarah swims unaided. It is the one time she can move alone. ""The most important thing I can do is swim every day ... I think swimming basically saved my life,"" she says. Sarah moves from one side of the pool to the other, each footstep slow but deliberate. She grabs the side for extra support. As she walks, she gets what feel like ""zaps"" up her leg. ""It doesn't happen for the majority of the day,"" she says. ""[Swimming] just gives me the most amazing feeling and sensation, because you're stimulating the nerves."" It's that feeling of freedom that led Sarah to find her new passion — drone photography — at the height of lockdown. ""What's funny is that I can't take a photo with any other apparatus,"" she says. ""I can't use a standard camera and I can't use a mobile phone — I can't hold it up."" Sarah lives with a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy called LGMD2i (also called FKRP-related LGMD R9), one of the world's rare diseases. It started to present itself in her late teens as her performance decreased when swimming. ""I thought, oh, it's just puberty, I'm just slowing down."" When Sarah started her nursing career, people would ask her why she was limping as she walked down the corridor. ""I would say I'm not limping ... people noticed it before I did,"" she says. ""When I was 30, I went to an aerobics class, and we all had to get on our tippy toes, and I couldn't. So I went, okay, this is weird... and that's when I started doing testing."" Only a few hundred or thousand people in Australia are thought to have LGMD2i. ""It affects your respiratory muscles, so your diaphragm and intercostal muscles that help your lungs expand and contract are weakened,"" Sarah says. ""So my breathing is affected and usually that is what ends a person's life with muscular dystrophy. It is respiratory or cardiac failure — or both."" After she was diagnosed, Sarah fell pregnant with her first daughter Lucy and a year later, her second daughter Tess. It was during this period of her life that she started to feel a decline in her condition. ""I remember when I used to sit on the grass for picnics. And I thought, one day I'm not going to be able to get up."" That moment came in 2016, when her dog Pippa ran underneath her legs in her narrow hallway, and she broke her leg. ""From that day on, I never stood up again. I never walked. I never drove a car ... my whole life changed dramatically."" Drones came into Sarah's life at a time when her world was shrinking, as COVID lockdowns were closing in. During Melbourne's long lockdown, her daughter Lucy came to live with her in Port Douglas and, together, they decided they would buy one. ""We just said, what are we going to do? We've got to do something. I couldn't really do anything in the community, because I was high risk to COVID, I was pretty much having to isolate from people,"" Sarah says. She admits she was initially terrified she would crash it and didn't want to fly it herself. ""I gradually built confidence flying it, and I just saw the Earth from a different perspective."" In November 2020, Sarah organised a photo shoot inspired by COVID lockdowns and a recent artwork she had painted. ""I just got this idea of using a basketball court, just down the road, and I thought, what if I put this girl in the middle of the court, reading a magazine, supposedly having a really nice time, in the midst of this chaos that was going on in the world, making compromises to still be happy and enjoy life?"" She went and bought a pool ring and borrowed a little bag. ""It was 10 o'clock in the morning, and it was so hot,"" Sarah recalls of the shoot. ""The poor girl had to sit on a towel underneath the pool ring, and we just had to measure out. She was in the middle of the court, and I put the drone up, and I just started shooting."" The Boston Drone Film Festival found Sarah and Lucy's picture on their Instagram page, Air Bare Studio, and asked them to enter it in their competition. To their delight, their image won the architecture category in 2021, less than a year after they began experimenting with the drone. ""We felt a little like we didn't deserve the award as we were so inexperienced... but it gave us the confidence to enter another competition, which was Capture Magazine's Australasia's Top Emerging Photographers,"" Sarah says. The same image took home that award in the Single Shot category. An international publishing company has recently chosen 16 of Sarah and Lucy's images for their new book on minimalism in photography. Sarah says picking up a drone has helped reignite her creativity through a new lens. She loved painting during school and her early adult years and has had a deep appreciation for art and design ever since. ""Photography is no different to creating a painting — it's all about composition, orientation, framing, colour and tone, and it should tell a story,"" she says. ""I really do love to look at things in a minimalist way... to zero in on a particular section of an image for things that are quirky and unique. ""You've got to look at things from so many different perspectives to understand the real meaning of it."" Still, she laughs: ""We don't always hit the mark."" Even though Lucy is back living in Melbourne, Sarah has continued to experiment and looks forward to studying an online photography course this year. ""Photography has just made me realise that it is something I can absolutely do,"" she says. ""The drone can take me to places that I can't physically get to and create images I ordinarily wouldn't be able to.""

202,Unpacking the cameos in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,arts-culture,"  What's with all the cameos in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness? Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has been attracting largely positive reviews from critics and is already the third biggest film of the year at the worldwide box office. It's also had fans cheering and applauding at the sight of its many multiversal cameos, some of which were signposted in the trailers, and others that were tightly guarded secrets. Who are these fan-familiar faces that have had diehard Marvel-heads in a frenzy, and what does it mean for the ever-expanding and seemingly endless Marvel cinematic universe (MCU)? Read on to find out more, but beware — here be spoilers. The bulk of the cool cameos that have fans spilling their popcorn and spit-taking their soft drink comes from a mid-film appearance by a group known as the Illuminati. Much like with the real-world conspiracy theory, the Illuminati of the Marvel comics is a secret cabal of some of the best and brightest who secretly run the world. The group was formed by Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) in the wake of an intergalactic battle that threatened Earth, after Stark realised several super-powered individuals had key information about the aliens involved but didn't share it with each other. The first version of the comic-book Illuminati featured Iron Man, Reed Richards (aka Mr Fantastic), Professor Charles Xavier of the X-Men, Black Bolt of the Inhumans, Black Panther of Wakanda, Sorcerer Supreme Dr Stephen Strange and Namor the Sub-Mariner of Atlantis. Over the years, the group has gathered in secret to discuss how to deal with major threats, including deciding to shoot the Hulk into space due to him proving too much of a danger to Earth (which totally backfired in the excellent World War Hulk comic series). They've also tackled Incursions, which are mentioned in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and occur when two neighbouring multiverses threaten to collide and destroy each other unless one can be destroyed. The Illuminati's members have changed over the years and the group has disbanded a couple of times, but their mission to save Earth remains a regular way for comic book writers to explore morality, sacrifice, philosophical ideas and the notion that even the smartest people can do incredibly stupid things. But what you really want to know is who's in the MCU version of the Illuminati? Here goes — last chance to bail before the spoilers. There's been talk of a Marvel reboot or crossover of the X-Men since Disney bought 20th Century Fox in a deal finalised in 2019. It's finally kinda sorta happened here with Professor X appearing as part of the Illuminati on Earth-838 (that's the number assigned to the Illuminati's multiverse). The OG Xavier, as played by Stewart for the eighth time, makes his appearance to the sound of the nostalgic theme from the '90s X-Men cartoon, not looking like he's aged a day since 2017's Logan. Stewart's cameo not only officially crosses the streams of the Fox X-Men movies and the MCU, but suggests there are other mutants in this universe and his School for Gifted Youngsters probably exists. Played by Miles Teller in 2015's Fantastic Four, Ioan Guffudd before that in 2005 and 2007, and Alex Hyde-White in the legendary unreleased 1994 version, Krasinski's iteration of Mr Fantastic got a lot of whoops and cheers in cinemas. A tightly kept secret, Krasinski as Reed Richards has been a dream fan casting, and the reaction to his appearance backs it up. While we don't see Richards use his ultra-stretchy limbs much before he meets a painful end, it's probably a safe bet to say this isn't the last time we'll see Krasinski's Mr Fantastic in the MCU, given his popular reception and the fact a Fantastic Four reboot is in development. But it begs the question: Will we get to see the equally popular fan casting of Krasinski's wife, Emily Blunt, as Richards' wife Sue Storm (aka the Invisible Woman) in the MCU? One of the best episodes of the animated Disney+ series What If introduced us to Captain Carter, the answer to the question: ""What if Peggy Carter received the super-soldier serum instead of Steve Rogers?"" The big-screen debut of Captain Carter gives Atwell the chance to put a new spin on the popular character of Peggy Carter, last seen slow-dancing with Captain America in the final moments of Avengers: Endgame. The live-action version of Captain Carter gives fans hope we'll see her again — while her Earth-838 version meets a grisly end via her own shield, she proves to be just as cool as her animated counterpart, or perhaps even cooler because she has a jet pack, and everyone knows jet packs make everything cooler. In the comics, there have been a number of Captain Marvels, including one named Monica Rambeau, who adopted the name before handing it back to Carol Danvers and becoming known as Photon, then Pulsar and eventually Spectrum — this kind of thing happens a lot in the comics. Monica Rambeau has appeared in the MCU previously; as a kid in 2019's Captain Marvel and as a grown-up government agent in the Disney+ series WandaVision. But it's her mother, Maria, as played by Lashana Lynch in Captain Marvel, that turns up here as the hyper-powered space warrior, suggesting an intriguing alternate path where Maria becomes Captain Marvel rather than her best friend and fellow fighter pilot Carol Danvers. This may be the last we see of Maria, but daughter Monica is appearing in the upcoming film The Marvels, fuelling speculation she'll become Photon — or is that Pulsar? Or Spectrum? Speaking of fuelling speculation, a split-second shot of Maria Rambeau in action in the trailer caused a frenzied online buzz that Tom Cruise would appear as an alternate multiverse Iron Man, but that wasn't to be. Take that as you will. It was a cameo that gave Scarlet Witch the best delivery of the best line in the film — ""What mouth?"" — and also one of the movie's most gruesome deaths. Black Bolt previously appeared in the TV series Inhumans, which lasted one season and received such bad reviews that only the most diehard of Marvel fans bothered to watch it. It's a shame it was so botched, because Black Bolt is a cool character — not that we get much of a chance to see it in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness before he inadvertently blows his own brains out using his super-powered voice. Given how poorly received Inhumans was, this could be the final appearance of Mount as Black Bolt. Of course, the deaths of all these characters doesn't necessarily preclude them from popping up in the MCU again in another film or their own spin-off TV shows – after all, this is the multiverse, so there are infinite versions of these superheroes populating an infinite number of universes. Theron took to social media recently to unveil her mid-credits appearance as Clea, a sorceress who magically appears in a New York street asking Dr Strange to follow her into the Dark Dimension to help prevent an Incursion. In the comics, Clea is the niece of Dormammu (the villain in the first Dr Strange film) and Strange's lover who joins him on a range of increasingly weird adventures. Given that Dormammu is still out there and Clea's appearance in the film is over as quickly as it begins, it's safe to say she'll play a substantial role in any future Dr Strange movies.

203,"Club celebrates 100 years of 'the thought sport', a nasty game for nice people",arts-culture,"  Nowra Croquet Club celebrates 100 years of playing 'the thought sport', a nasty game for nice people Those who play croquet say it is 15 per cent skill and 85 per cent psychology, an aggressive game played by nice people with a smile on their face. The nice people of Nowra Croquet Club celebrate a century of play this year, and today launch a book acknowledging and celebrating 100 years since the club's inception. Secretary of Nowra Croquet Club, Karen James, instigated the production of the book. It proudly highlights a unique feature of the club — being largely women-only for a majority of its history. But it is not a ladies club anymore. ""Our first male, as is shown in the book, did not become a member until 1982, so that's a long time of it being [only for] ladies, and of course they played in long skirts."" ""Ladies played to the side with their mallet because it was unseemly for a woman to push a mallet between her legs."" Patience, persistence, and a playful spirit is required for this hard-hitting game. ""It's called 'the thought sport' and that's particularly important for us older people,"" said 82-year-old player David Knott. The Nowra Croquet Club and members play a big role Mr Knott's life, who joined the club five years ago and plays frequently. ""It's a very strategic game and there is a lot of thought in it,"" Mr Knott said. ""You're looking to outsmart your opponent. You're looking for the position of their balls versus the position of your own balls. You have to assess what stroke you are going to make for the benefit of scoring that hoop. ""The art is moving the opponents' balls as far away as possible."" ""You have to think and you're exercising all the time. That's the important thing — you keep moving."" Pam Harrison started playing croquet when she was 89. She is now 91 and not only does she love it, according to club members she is also quite good. ""You can still play croquet with a walker, you just have to leave it there for a moment while you grab your mallet and hit the ball, then come back to your walker,"" Ms Harrison said. ""I love it. Anybody who has got a walker and thinks they should come, just come, because you'll be made very welcome."" Doug Cornish, vice-captain and grounds coordinator at the club, agrees the game employs something akin to war tactics. ""A lot of players will say it's an aggressive game played by nice people with a smile on their face,"" he said. Out on the lawn you have four options. ""It's all about deciding whether you can run a hoop, or whether you need to clear an opponent or block an opponent, or promote your partner ball,"" he said. However, Mr Cornish said a key ingredient to a good game was patience. ""Don't rush in. Look at what your options are, and then if you want to get really technical you'd look at what the percentage of performing a particular shot is,"" he said. Karen James believes that at their club, which supports over 60 members, players understand the importance of sport. ""People are realising, for longevity, the importance of sport,"" she said. ""[It is important] to keep going and to keep not only physically active but socially active, so you are interacting as well. ""This game is perfect for those people who can't run the marathon any more or swing a golf club or even bend down to bowl.""

205,New play dives into issues of grief and depression — but with light on the surface,arts-culture,"  New State Theatre Company play Cathedral dives into issues of grief and depression Ten-year-old Caleb Lewis sat with his sister on a jetty watching his dad sink below the water, unsure if he would ever come back. It was the mid-1990s on a family trip from Melbourne to Adelaide which had come to a temporary halt near Mount Gambier. ""Dad told us all about this place called Piccaninnie Ponds, where quite a few fatalities have occurred,"" Lewis vividly recalled. ""It's an exquisite ecosystem, but one that if you are inexperienced it can very quickly become dangerous. ""Dad told us about that as kids, then put his diving tanks on and we just sat on the jetty waiting for him to come back — just waiting — going: 'What happens if he doesn't come back? What happens if the bubbles stop?'"" Fast forward several decades and Lewis, now 44 and a writer, has continued that tradition after unveiling his latest play, Cathedral. It was a work State Theatre Company South Australia commissioned; originally to be about tuna fishermen and Port Lincoln, before a rethink saw it being based on the south-eastern city of Mount Gambier. The production tells the story of a diver who is suffering from nitrogen narcosis (a change in consciousness and neuromuscular function) while at the bottom of a flooded sinkhole, how he ended up down there and how he will get out, if at all. As he worked on the production, Lewis got in contact with Mount Gambier diver Josh Richards, before spending time with him on the Limestone Coast. Richards had his own story to tell which became part of Cathedral. ""There's a point in the play where someone escapes and there's a physical injury that's sustained during that escape,"" he said. ""That's drawn from a story I was involved in where I injured myself quite badly trying to squeeze out of a cave. ""Coming back out, I left one piece of equipment on, which was the one piece of equipment that stuck. ""I was halfway through this tight little hole and I couldn't go any further up or down and I wound up stuck there for six or seven minutes, which was pretty unpleasant,"" he remembered. It was these stories that added to Lewis's many experiences with the water. They included his dad being a diver who helped fish bodies out of the Yarra River, after people jumped off the West Gate Bridge in Melbourne. The now Queensland-based Lewis studied acting and playwriting at Flinders University. When he was 22, he visited his father who was working on an oil rig near Dubai. Lewis temporarily became a firefighting instructor, which included time undertaking training for search and rescue operations, and underwater helicopter escapes. That long history with water and survival stretched back to Lewis's grandfather, who was a bomber in World War II in Europe. His plane crashed into the Danube River and he was one of two crew who managed to swim out of the rapidly sinking plane, joining the ""goldfish club"" for airmen who survived crashes. It seemed fitting that water became that central theme when the State Theatre Company enlisted him to write Cathedral. But writing it became deeply personal at a time in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its worst and personal tragedies had hit Lewis. ""We suffered several deaths in my own family, in particular as a young boy, and I think part of the play was processing the grief — it's about a guy who wakes up in a dark hole and had to find his way out of it,"" he said. ""It's absolutely [got] autobiographical elements — I've suffered depression for years and I remember this incredible sense of release and relief when I was formerly diagnosed."" A critical factor in Lewis staying healthy is going on long-distance walks. ""That's made a profound difference, actually, and something I stumbled on,"" he said. ""There's a loosening up of the body and mind that came from ambling, of going for those long distance walks and you surrender yourself to the moment — you let go of all the anxiety."" Those walks included hiking Germany's Black Forest, fittingly where the Brothers Grimm gathered inspiration for their folktales. ""That was cool, that was a really terrific time,"" Lewis said. ""I brought a copy of the Brothers Grimm and I'd just pull up under a tree and read a couple of fairytales and wonder what might come walking down the path. ""I sprinkled plenty of breadcrumbs behind me so I didn't get lost on my way back,"" he laughed. That ongoing battle with depression has changed his hardline stance on avoiding ""escapist theatre"", allowing his dark-themed plays to end with some optimism. ""There's got to be hope — you have to be able to lead them out into the dawn — I think 20-year-old Caleb would have written Cathedral with a dark ending,"" he explained. ""I'm interested in helping people to see the world in a different way and perhaps to grow a little and heal a little."" Cathedral is playing at Adelaide's Space Theatre until May 21, with a tour of regional South Australia to follow.

206,World famous Australian contemporary composer collaborates with Alice chamber orchestra,arts-culture,"  Elena Kats-Chernin, Australia's world famous contemporary composer, working with Alice Springs orchestra Central Australia boasts spectacular sunrises and sunsets, dark enough skies to see the edge of the milky way and the harsh searing heat of the midday sun. All these elements are the inspiration for a brand new piece of work by one of Australia's most prolific and well-known composers and pianists, Elena Kats-Chernin, who boasts a catalogue of 300 pieces. The Red Centre Suite is in four movements and has been written specifically for the Alice Springs World Chamber Orchestra, thanks to a chance meeting three years ago. The meeting was with Markus Kuchenbuch, the Alice Springs World Chamber Orchestra's artistic director, at a music festival in NSW. It is thanks to his tenacity that Kats-Chernin has not only composed a piece about the region, but has also come to Alice Springs to work directly with the orchestra. ""You never really think it's going to happen because not everyone follows through,"" Kats-Chernin said. ""However, Markus is the kind of person who follows through."" The four movements are Night Stars, Dawn, Noon, and Sunset, and was written without ever seeing the landscape. ""I have very rarely written about a place,"" she said. ""It's always extremely special to actually be in the place I have written about, especially if I wrote [the piece] before I actually came here, which is kind of unusual."" Kats-Chernin said that after many decades of composing it was hard to pinpoint the moment the material crystallises. ""It's always a mystery how a piece gets born,"" she said. ""I have perfected a skill, which is to move myself into a zone, mentally, into a particular place. ""I can place myself internally anywhere — be it emotion, flavour, a state of being, or a place I can imagine myself there."" Kats-Chernin said she was impressed with the calibre of Alice Springs' musicians ""and the quality of their preparation"". ""In the first rehearsal of the piece [it] actually sounded really good already. II was just overjoyed how much the base of the piece was already there,"" she said. ""Once the piece is written it's in the hands of musicians who perform it."" Kats-Chernin said it was a joy to work directly with the musicians. ""To have this direct communication with musicians in the room [so that] we can shape it and mould it, so that it sounds better, so that it makes more sense,"" she said. ""I can [then] tell what's more important in the texture of things. So I can say 'this instrument a bit louder, maybe softer, maybe bring out a certain warmth of the instrument, maybe play it colder'. So it just depends."" ABC Classic invites you to get to know a little bit more about Australian composer Elena Kats-Chernin. Kuchenbuch said that the feedback from the orchestra was very positive, given they had been playing Kats-Chernin's pieces for several years. ""They feel like they have touched fame to have someone of Kats-Chernin's calibre not only write them a piece but to work with them, given that she is booked out until 2024,"" he said. ""For her to have so much time to rehearse with us is very special.""

207,This dilapidated old tower could become regional Victoria's newest tourist attraction,arts-culture,"  Victorian regional tourism could benefit from Maryborough's Bristol Hill Pioneer Memorial Tower refurbishment Maryborough residents have called for the historic Bristol Hill Pioneer Memorial Tower to be redeveloped into a premier tourism destination. The iconic site was built in 1933 during the Great Depression with material from the Old Maryborough Gaol. It was named after Bristol Reef, a seam of gold in the area which was mined from the late 1850s and stands to remember the European settlers of the region. Located at the edge of Bristol Hill Reserve, the tower provides views of the town and surrounding bushland, and links to several walking tracks in Bristol Hill Reserve. Maryborough Rotary president Garry Higgins said the most important thing was that the building was restored and protected. ""We want to make sure the history of the place is not lost,"" Mr Higgins said. ""Whether it be state government or local government [looking after it] doesn't really matter. ""As long as somebody does it because nobody has been doing it over the last several years."" The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) has been the interim manager of Bristol Hill Tower since 2007. It met with the Rotary Club and the Central Goldfields Shire Council earlier this month to discuss future management of the site. The department was now awaiting the results of an engineer's report on the structural integrity of the tower to determine what repairs were required for it to be opened to the general public. The tower has been closed since it was vandalised last year. ""While DELWP is the interim manager of this space, our aim is to find the best manager to take this space forward long-term,"" a DELWP spokesperson said. ""Nothing is off the table. ""Further discussions about the management of this asset will continue following the outcome of the structural engineer's report, in the coming months."" A Central Goldfields Shire councillor said she would like the council to take responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of the tower precinct. ""We haven't endorsed that we want to take ownership, but a few of the councillors believe that we should take responsibility for the ongoing maintenance,"" Grace Le Valla said. She said the shire was keen to listen to residents and turn the historic Bristol Hill Memorial Tower into something special. ""It hasn't been painted or anything since 1988. I believe it's been that long since anyone did anything to it,"" Ms Le Valla said. ""It looks terribly rundown."" Both state and local government authorities said they were keen to work with community groups on a redevelopment, despite who owned and managed the site. Mr Higgins said residents wanted to see the neglected structure brought back to life. ""The first thing is to just to make sure that the site is maintained as a significant historical site within our town,"" he said. The Rotary Club was just one community group the council planned to include in any future redevelopments. One suggestion was to turn it into a peace park. ""We want to look at how we can engage all elements of our community in developing a peace and harmony park,"" Mr Higgins said. ""We want to embrace all the different communities that have made Maryborough their own community. ""We want to put our arms around them and embrace them and make them feel part of our community."" Mr Higgins welcomed input from any community members who wanted to get involved in maintaining and revitalising the site.

208,analysis: Who are the top 10 chances for this year's Eurovision,arts-culture,"  We now have the final 25 songs that are vying to win the Eurovision Song Contest title in Turin. Australia's Sheldon Riley will be one of the performers with his big ballad Not the Same. If you want a bit of a form guide as to the likely winners, one option is the top 10 in the Eurovision winners' odds. Australia is just outside the top 10 but still primed for a good result. In a year when the common theme is a LOT of angsty ballads and dance numbers, there are a few stand-out upbeat songs … and one entry that could win this in a landslide — but could be nobbled by the juries. Let's check out the main chances! There's always room for a bit of performance art at Eurovision, and this striking performance from singer-songwriter Konstrakta (Ana Đurić)  has made an impression. The song, In Corpore Sano (In A Healthy Body), is a song about modern life, its focus on health and how to afford it. Her staging has Konstrakta seated on stage with a washing bowl in front of her, literally washing her hands during the performance, while her backing crew hand her towels. There are references to Meghan Markle, there's hand-clapping, it's all a bit hypnotic. The crowd loved it in the second semi-final. LYRICS: ""Oh, so how will they monitor me? In the name of health/And care about me? In the name of health/An artist (she) is invisible. In the name of health/You don't see me, it's magic. In the name of health"" This song also has a gun position in the draw. Just like last year's winners, Måneskin for Italy, Konstrakta will be performing in 24th place. S10 (Stien den Hollander) is a rising star on the local music scene — the 21-year-old indie pop/rap/dance artist sings in Dutch. Fitting in with the angst theme in 2022, her song, De Diepte (The Deep), is about a person who is lost and confused. It starts as a gentle guitar ballad, and then swells in the middle. The staging is spare and revolves around the singer and her emotional performance. LYRICS: ""Here in the deep I continue to hear your name/Ooh aha. Oh my love what do I do?/I am deep and I don’t want to let you go"" If you like your Eurovision entries with a healthy dose of bonkers, this one might be for you. The mystery group are dressed in suits with yellow-gold masks on, two of them come with wolf-like teeth. Behind them is a DJ dressed like an astronaut — who is supposedly last year's Norwegian entrant, TIX — on a sort of plinth above the stage. Their performance comes complete with a full dance routine, a driving beat, synthesisers and the kitchen sink (well, not quite). LYRICS: ""Is that saliva or blood dripping off your chin?/ If you don't like the name Keith, I'mma call you Jim/And before that wolf eats my grandma/Give that wolf a banana"" This should go down an absolute treat with the televoters, but the juries might be looking for something slightly less ""out there"" for their winner. In a year full of break-up and heartbreak songs, this one is possibly the starkest — just check out the title and the lyrics below. Sheldon Riley's Eurovision adventure has been a wild ride — from winning Australia Decides on the Gold Coast to losing his voice in London, practising his song while carrying sandbags and now the spotlight in Turin — on the eve of his contest debut, he tells the ABC how it's all come together. Amanda Georgiadi Tenfjord is a Greek-born singer of Greek and Norwegian parentage. She has a striking voice and this is a dramatic song, with the staging putting the spotlight on her. If you take your Eurovision history seriously, this is an omen pick for the win. The most successful positions in the Eurovision running list — to win the contest in the modern era since organisers began selecting the order — are 17th and 24th, both with three wins. Greece will perform in 17th on Sunday morning. LYRICS: ""But if we die together now/We will always have each other/I won't lose you for another/And if we die together now/I will hold you till forever"" Krystian Ochman is this year's performer for Poland. He's from the United States but won the Polish version of The Voice two years ago. As you might imagine, he has one of the best voices on show at this year's Eurovision, and he has chosen a big song to showcase it. River has a touch of the Hozier's about it. It's an emotional number that talks about letting go and has a water theme as the name suggests. The staging includes an effect that makes it look to the TV audience like there is water running down the camera lens. It's a dramatic performance, and should do well with the juries, but it may fall short with the public unless they fall in love with his voice. LYRICS: ""Bury all of my things/Bury me in my skin/All that I've done/ Oh Lord, I'm done/Who'd wanna be a king/Pulling too many strings"" The last time Spain won Eurovision was in 1968, with a song that had 123 la's in a song that was, unsurprisingly, called La, La, La. Indeed, the past decade or two at Eurovision has been pretty bleak for Spain, with a lot of poor finishes. A glance at the translated lyrics tells you where this one is going: ""I make all the daddies go crazy/I'm always first, never secondary/As soon as I make doom, doom with my boom, boom/And I got him making zoom, zoom/For my yummy"" This one is definitely going to pick up the same sort of vote that Cyprus got with Fuego a few years back — that came second — and so might this if it hoovers up enough public support. Hosting nations have not done well in recent years, perhaps because no one wants to repeat the Irish experience, when they won four times in five years in the 1990s, nearly bankrupting broadcaster RTE. Italy are the hosts this year, and they have a shot at going back-to-back with the pop-rap ballad Brividi (Shivers). Mahmood came second in 2019, singing Soldi. He and singer-rapper Blanco are two of Italy's top stars, and their duet is breaking new ground. Mahmood says it's not necessarily an LGBTQ love song, but it is an emotional performance from two male vocalists that has grabbed attention. LYRICS: ""And I would pay to go away/I would even accept a lie/And I want to love you, but I'm always wrong/And I get shivers, shivers, shivers"" Regular viewers of Eurovision will know that whatever song Sweden sends is rarely too far away from the pointy end of the contest come voting time. We're there again this year. Cornelia Jakobs was the winner of the Swedish song competition Melodifestivalen, which decides who goes to Eurovision. This well-written, well-performed heartbreaker is about saying goodbye to your lover after one more night. It's not the first Eurovision song to mine this territory, and it wouldn't be the first winner either — 35 years ago, Ireland's Johnny Logan won the contest and had a big hit with Hold Me Now. LYRICS: ""Hold me closer/Although you'll leave before the sunrise/Might be bleeding, but don't you mind, I'll be fine/Oh it kills me/I found the right one at the wrong time"" There's a bit of history on the line here as well — if Cornelia wins, it will be the seventh time that Sweden has been victorious, matching Ireland's record from the '70s, '80s and '90s. This is NOT a misprint! After years of a serious lack of love from the voters of Europe — including last year, where James Newman was very hard done by when he received the first ever double zero (no votes from the juries OR the televoters) for his song, Embers — the United Kingdom is back with a bang. Sam Ryder is a TikTok star who racked up 12 million followers during the pandemic with his fun (and excellent) covers of various hit songs. His followers include Sia, Alicia Keys and Justin Bieber. He has brought the same sense of fun — and knockout vocals — to this slice of British-sounding pop, combining an upbeat sound with more angsty lyrics. Ryder has an impressive upper register, and he gives it a workout in this song, while the staging has a sense of ""lift-off"". This has been going up in the odds all through the contest. LYRICS: ""I'm up in space, man/Up in space, man/I've searched around the universe/Been down some black holes/There's nothing but space, man/And I wanna go home."" If this was any other year, this would be an even bigger chance to take home the prize — the reason it's not is because of — Song-wise, there's a number of more-impressive entries in the final, although both the performance and the staging get the most out of this. Stefania was originally written for the grandmother of one of the members of Kalush Orchestra — but the song, which fuses folk and hip-hop, has since taken on a life of its own. One of the translated lyrics says:""I'll always find my way home/Even if all the roads are destroyed"" LYRICS: ""Stefania mother mother Stefania/The field is blooming, but her hair is turning grey/Mother, sing me the lullaby/I want to hear your native word"" The real issue is whether the people of Europe — and Australia — decide they want to show their support for Ukraine, given current events, by giving their vote to Kalush Orchestra. The spotlight at this year's Eurovision Song Contest is firmly on Ukraine's entry, with Kalush Orchestra strong favourites as their country continues to fight an invasion from Russia, so that raises the question of who will host the contest in 2023 if they win. Countries cannot vote for themselves, but there could still be 39 sets of 12 votes coming Ukraine's way if the public is of a similar mind. This won't do as well with the juries — but if it sweeps the board with the public that won't matter.

209,"Craig McLachlan denies throwing tantrums, calling co-stars 'ungrateful and untalented' in court",arts-culture,"  Craig McLachlan denies throwing tantrums, calling co-stars 'ungrateful and untalented' in court Actor Craig McLachlan has denied to his defamation trial that he frequently threw backstage tantrums during a production of The Rocky Horror Show and, on one occasion, called his co-stars ""ungrateful and untalented c***s"". The 56-year-old is suing the ABC and Nine Entertainment Co over stories published in 2018 which alleged he assaulted female cast members during a 2014 Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. He is also suing actor Christie Whelan Browne, who played the female lead in the show, and was interviewed by the news outlets. McLachlan denies all claims of sexual harassment and bullying in the stories and says they ruined his reputation and put an end to his acting career. On Friday, the media outlets' barrister, Michael Hodge QC, tried to depict McLachlan as a man with a temper who would take his frustrations out on his co-stars. He asserted that during one show on May 9, 2014, McLachlan was so angry about a scene that had not gone as planned he yelled and swore at his colleagues backstage before kicking a rubbish bin. ""You said 'you're a bunch of untalented, ungrateful c***s',"" Mr Hodge told the court. ""No I did not,"" McLachlan said. The actor also rejected claims he forcefully grabbed Whelan Browne's face on stage later that night and said he only found out she made a bullying complaint when he read the news reports four years later. McLachlan also rejected ""storming off"" after musical supervisor Tony Castro gave him singing advice and telling his co-stars that ""[Mr Castro] wouldn't like the food at Sydney Hospital"". Throughout the trial, McLachlan has maintained he enjoyed jovial relationships with many of his female co-stars and ""theatrical"" yet platonic hugs and kisses were common. On Friday, he told the court it was possible he sat on the lap of actor Erika Heynatz and kissed her neck backstage one day, but strongly denied putting his crotch in her lap or ever entering her dressing room without consent. The long-time performer repeatedly claimed he and Whelan Browne were good friends throughout the show, but on Friday the court was shown an email which McLachlan sent to production director calling Whelan Browne ""Lucifer"". The email read: ""I was privately celebrating London's directive that the perpetually problematic Whelan Browne be sent packing."" ""Lucifer is being given another chance next week. Really???? OMG. ""The princess wins again … we all continue to march to the sound of her selfish, delusional, disrespectful and frankly nasty drum."" McLachlan said those were only his ""professional"" views of Whelan Browne and ""friends call each other all sorts of things"". Eleven women will give evidence during the trial alleging McLachlan behaved inappropriately during various theatre and TV productions and will detail allegations of groping and indecent exposure. One actor also in The Rocky Horror Show, Angela Scundi, accused McLachlan of an unwanted kiss on stage in which he used his tongue, but on Friday McLachlan told the court it was a ""peck"". The jury were shown raw footage from McLachlan's interview with Channel Seven program Spotlight last year which showed he and his partner re-enacting the scene to try and prove a ""pash"" wasn't possible given the musical timing. McLachlan was also seen telling the Channel Seven interviewer that he was the ""star of the f****n show"" and he would never put the scene at risk by lingering for a kiss. The trial continues.

210,"$100,000 Archibald Prize goes to portrait of Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens by Blak Douglas",arts-culture,"  Archibald Prize won by Blak Douglas for portrait of artist Karla Dickens, the second time an Indigenous artist has won Dhungutti artist Blak Douglas (aka Adam Hill) has won the $100,000 Archibald Prize for his portrait of Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens — the second Indigenous artist to win the prize in its 101 years, following Western Arrernte artist Vincent Namatjira in 2020. This is Douglas's fifth time as an Archibald finalist, and accepting the prize at the Art Gallery of NSW ceremony, the self-taught painter said: ""This painting represents 20 years of taking the risk of pursuing a dream [and] surrendering normalised employment. And I'm sure many of my artist colleagues can relate to that."" Douglas painted Dickens, a friend and in his words ""legendary practitioner"", knee-deep in the muddy floodwaters of her hometown in Lismore, Bundjalung Country — holding a leaking pail of water in each hand, and looking grumpy. His painting reflects on the damage and after-effects of the devastating February and March floods in the Northern Rivers. ""I've been up there [to Bundjalung Country] several times; it's a war zone,"" Douglas told ABC News. ""And so to be able to further aid some of my dearest, closest friends up there, through this win — not only metaphorically, but also financially — it's a big plus."" The portrait, titled Moby Dickens, also speaks to Dickens's frustration with the government response to the February and March floods. Speaking to ABC Arts in April, she said: ""[I told Adam] 'As long as you make it grumpy. I want to be grumpy.'"" ""If [the painting] makes one more person aware of what's happened where I live, I'm really grateful for that,"" Dickens said. Speaking via live video link from her home, during the ceremony, Dickens said she was ""over the moon"", and thanked her friend for ""acknowledging everybody up here on Bundjalung Country that has gone through so much"". ""I'm so proud of you, Adam. Such a killer painting,"" she added. The judges also highly commended artist Jude Rae's portrait of Australian engineer and inventor Saul Griffith. The $40,000 Sulman Prize (for ""subject painting, genre painting or mural project""), meanwhile, was awarded to artist duo Claire Healy and Sean Cordeiro for their mixed-media painting Raiko and Shuten-dōji, depicting the fight between the warrior Raiko and the demon Shuten-dōji. The $50,000 Wynne Prize for landscape painting went to Nicholas Harding for his work Eora. Accepting the award, Douglas acknowledged his ancestors: ""My Irish Scot, German and English mob, as well as … the Dhungutti of mid-north coast New South Wales."" ""This is incredibly historic, given that I'm the first Koori to paint a Koori to win the Archibald Prize; the first First Nations New South Wales Aboriginal artist [to win]."" Douglas is a self-taught painter whose pop art aesthetic is informed by training in graphic design, illustration and photography. ""My dear family have been supportive all the way along through this career to get to this point,"" he told assembled onlookers. ""Particularly the matriarchs in my family; women are a very strong part of my family."" Speaking to ABC News afterwards, he described the path to his winning painting as ""a long haul"". ""It felt like building part of the Great Wall [of China] just painting this thing; it's quite a task to paint something that big."" It's Douglas's largest Archibald entry so far, and he said ""whilst Karla is physically diminutive in stature, it's important that we memorialised [her in this way]"". ""And that's what I try and do with my paintings often — because we need to memorialise First Nations people en masse."" Douglas was previously a finalist for the Archibald Prize in 2020 (with a portrait of young Arrernte and Garrwa activist Dujuan Hoosan), 2019 (with a portrait of Bidjigal artist Esme Timbery), 2018 (Wiradjuri artist Uncle Roy Kennedy) and 2015 (Budjedi elder and ""Aboriginal cultural entertainer"" Uncle Max Eulo). ""It's nice in any way to honour another artist,"" Douglas told ABC News last week. ""We are a minority in terms of vocations in this country."" At the award ceremony, he said he was ""proudly represent[ing] a legion of creatives consistently dealt the rough end of the stick, unfortunately … But that may change with a change of government, perhaps"". Exhibitions for the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes will open on Saturday May 14 at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Tops Arts & Culture headlines.

211,Adnate mural immortalises 'strong-willed' Yorta Yorta women,arts-culture,"  Matt Adnate immortalises two remarkable Yorta Yorta elders as part of Shepparton mural project Yorta Yorta elder Uncle Lance James feels fortunate to have up grown up alongside his 13 brothers and sisters during an era when many First Nations children were denied that right. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains images and names of people who have died. His late mother Aunty Mary James and another pioneering community leader the late Aunty Violet Harrison have been immortalised in a mural on the Goulburn Valley Water office in Shepparton. ""It's a great location for these two giants, who raised 27 children between them — amazing, isn't it?"" Uncle Lance said. ""Aunty Violet had 13 children, my mum had 14, so that speaks for itself, to raise all of us, not to be taken away back in the days of the Stolen Generations and the removal of children."" The work by mural artist Matt Adnate is his fourth as part of the Greater Shepparton City Council and Yorta Yorta Nation Aboriginal Corporation's Aboriginal Street Art Project. ""To have this sort of concentration in a city like this just goes to show that you can really transform the environment,"" Adnate said. ""There's a lot of depth and meaning behind the people that I'm painting. These are really important people to the local community and it's been an absolute honour to keep coming back over all these years."" Aunty Violet and Aunty Mary were heavily involved in supporting the local Aboriginal community. Aunty Mary was a founding member for the Shepparton Aboriginal Funeral Fund and worked with police, housing and social welfare organisations, advocating for First Nations people. Other Yorta Yorta leaders already painted as part of the project include Uncle William Cooper, Pastor Sir Douglas Nicholls, Aunty Margaret Tucker, Nora 'Nanny' Charles, Private Daniel Cooper, Aunty Geraldine Briggs and Aunty Elizabeth Morgan. Both Aunty Violet and Aunty Mary were born at the Cummergunja Mission,  in 1906 and 1913 respectively. The mission was an Aboriginal reserve beside a bend in the Murray River on Yorta Yorta country in New South Wales, near the Victorian town of Barmah. In 1939, the mission was the site of the Cummeragunja Walk Off, a nine-month protest against the living conditions and management of the site. The Walk Off is described as the first mass strike of Aboriginal people in Australia. After leaving Cummergunja and moving to the neighbouring towns of Mooroopna and Shepparton, Aunty Violet and Aunty Mary went on to become founding members of Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-Operative and the Shepparton Aboriginal Keeping Place. Artist Tom Day returns to Gunditjmara Country in south-west Victoria to help paint a 30-metre-high mural of his great-grandfather and great uncles, granting them the place in history they have long been due. They advocated for better housing for their community at The Flats, a stretch of land between Shepparton and Mooroopna where Aboriginal people lived in poor conditions until the late 1950s. When Queen Elizabeth visited Shepparton in 1954, the local government installed hessian bags and curtains to block The Flats from view. Uncle Lance remembers walking across the bridge between Shepparton and Mooroopna in protest as a schoolboy, alongside his mother, Aunty Violet and their families. ""We wanted better housing. We wanted housing like everyone else,"" he said. ""We were able to get 11 buildings put up where Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-Operative started [and] that made a big difference."" Aunty Violet Harrison was a formative figure in her grandson Gary Cooper's life and he's thrilled to see her celebrated in the mural. ""I can't tell you the words to explain how I feel,"" Mr Cooper said. ""She was a pioneer growing up, she fought for justice and now she's being rewarded for it,"" he said. ""She was terrific, Nan. She was only a little lady but she was very strong-willed and very strong in her ways. ""I suppose you had to be back then. ""I think we've learned a lot from her growing up and I probably wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for her.""

216,"live: NSW Now: State government urges rail unions against strikes, as talks hit a snag",arts-culture,"  Sydney News: Rail unions and state government in gridlock over new train rollout timeline Here's what you need to know this morning. Talks aimed to stop industrial action have hit a snag after five weeks of enterprise agreement negotiations between rail unions and the NSW government. Minister for Employee Relations Damian Tudehope wants the New Intercity Fleet (NIF) $2 billion intercity trains to be rolled out immediately. ""I urge the unions to consider their position carefully and not to resort to extreme industrial action while the government's offer for rail workers is finalised,"" he said. ""Today I advised the leadership of the union movement that I will not support any Rail, Tram and Bus Union demands that further delay the rollout of the New Intercity Fleet."" But the Rail Tram and Bus Union's spokesman, Alex Claassens, said such a move would be unsafe. ""We want to fix these trains, we want to fix our enterprise agreement, we want to get on with our jobs operating the system for the people of NSW,"" he said. Actor Craig McLachlan will be further cross-examined today in his defamation trial. McLachlan is suing the ABC, Nine newspapers and actor Christie Whelan Browne for defamation over stories published in 2018. The articles contained allegations he indecently assaulted, harassed, bullied and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. Yesterday he was accused of repeatedly lying in his trial, after giving contradictory evidence about on-stage kissing during The Rocky Horror Show. The actor denied the accusation. Two days ago, McLachlan said he never kissed any of his female co-stars below the shoulders or arms during a bedroom scene in the show. But yesterday he admitted he once kissed Whelan Browne on the hip. He said the only reason he did so was because he dropped a fake cigarette used as a prop and had to improvise while trying to retrieve it from the bed. An investigation is underway into whether a shipment of drugs into regional New South Wales is linked to Indonesia's biggest seizure of cocaine. Fifty-four kilograms of cocaine, worth $20 million, was found near the body of a professional diver in the Port of Newcastle on Monday. Investigators believe the original shipment into Newcastle weighed 300 kilograms, with a street value of  $120 million. Only about 100 kilograms made its way into Australian waters and on Sunday, 179 kilograms of the drug was found near Merak Port on Java. A superyacht operator who lives in Cairns is set to be extradited to Sydney today to face charges of supplying and importing a commercial quantity of drugs. James Blee, 62, was arrested trying to board a flight to Singapore on Wednesday. The winner of the $100,000 Archibald Prize for portrait painting will be revealed today at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Fifty-two finalists have already been selected and their works will be on display at the gallery from Friday. The Wynne prize will also be awarded for the best landscape painting along with the Sulman Prize for the best subject painting, genre painting or mural project. Sydney artist Claus Stangl's painting of Aotearoa New Zealand filmmaker, actor and comedian Taika Waititi won the Archibald Prize's Packing Room Prize — kicking off 'Archies season' in Sydney last week.

217,"Eight months after fleeing the Taliban, Afghan refugee Nazdana steps onto the runway at Australian Fashion Week ",arts-culture,"  Proud moment for fashion designer as Afghan refugee who fled the Taliban steps onto the runway at Australian Fashion Week Peeking out onto the runway from backstage at Australian Fashion Week, Australian-Afghan designer Mariam Seddiq could hardly believe what she was seeing. Modelling one of her looks under the glare of the lights was 24-year-old Nazdana Bakhtiari, who only eight months ago fled from Afghanistan with her mother, escaping the Taliban takeover. ""It was incredible. I was like, 'how is this happening?'"" the Western Sydney-born designer said. ""This time last year she was there (in Afghanistan). No way in hell would she have thought she'd be doing something like this. ""A woman can't even walk out of the front door at the moment."" The pair first met when Ms Seddiq was looking for women skilled in traditional Afghan beadwork, known as mora doozi, to use in her garments. A local contact from Fairfield in Sydney's west put her in touch with Ms Bakhtiari, her mother Zakia and a friend, who had only recently arrived in the country, after leaving Kabul airport on a military evacuation flight. ""I went to their apartment and I saw their work and I knew I had to include beadwork back into my designs, so they'd have work but in an arty way,"" she said. It was during their collaboration that the idea that Ms Bakhtiari might step out of the shadows to display her handiwork came about. ""When I dropped them home after work hand sewing, (Nazdana) mentioned she might want to model for me, so she's been practising for three weeks,"" Ms Seddiq said. ""It just seemed like a dream to take it one step further."" Ms Seddiq sees her designs, a mixture of couture gowns, suits, and jewellery as way to empower women. ""It's not just because of this Afghanistan thing. A lot of women forget how strong they are and what they're capable of. So that's really important to bring it out of all walks of life,"" she said. Her show at Australian Fashion Week in Sydney featured diverse models with a range of ages, sizes, genders and ethnic backgrounds. ""It just felt like more of a real show rather than a really curated show of skinny models,"" Ms Seddiq said. The former student of Bankstown Girls High School has gained a celebrity following, with her designs worn by Orange is the New Black actor Diane Guerrero, as well as Australian music stars Iggy Azalea and Delta Goodrem. Ms Seddiq said Australia had been slow to appreciate the work of its culturally diverse designers. ""I started in LA and was getting noticed in the US before I started getting any attention back home. ""It's about time Australia embraced its brown folk. And hopefully this leads to more women breadwinners, more women bosses because it's more than fashion.""

218,Keeping up with the Kardashians: Women turning to cosmetic surgery to be 'ethnic but not too ethnic',arts-culture,"  Why new cosmetic surgery trends that 'pick and choose' from cultures raise cultural appropriation concerns Who wins and who loses when beauty trends celebrate cosmetically altered looks that are ethnic — but 'not too ethnic'? Growing up in Sydney, Petronie was taught to be proud of her Blackness. The message was instilled in her by her mum and dad, who are from Zambia and the Republic of the Congo, respectively. ""They were always telling me that I'm Black and I'm beautiful, and just making sure I really believed that,"" Petronie says. Though it was powerful, it still couldn't shield the 26-year-old model and influencer from pervasive western beauty norms. In 2007, when US reality TV stars the Kardashians shot to fame, Petronie was one of the millions of people around the world who began noticing physical alterations in the sisters. In particular, she watched Kim Kardashian's ""nose changes over time"". And whenever Petronie used social media filters — which tweak facial features, often for comedic or beautifying effect — she noticed that some shrank the size of her nose. By the time she was 21, Petronie decided she wanted cosmetic surgery, too. ""I wanted my nose to be a bit thinner and pushed up,"" she says. But Petronie is acutely aware that while cosmetic surgery can erase some features like a non-Caucasian nose, it can also emphasise others, like big lips or almond-shaped eyes. That cosmetic procedures allow people to capitalise on the desirability of those cultural features — while removing others — is a pop culture paradox, and it's impacting the steadily growing number of Australians who are opting for cosmetic procedures. Many are weighing up the relationship between their culture and their appearance, in the face of trends that promote a look of ethnic — but, some argue, ""not too ethnic"" — ambiguity. Adria Goldman is assistant professor of communication and digital studies at the University of Mary Washington in the US. She says the term ""Blackfishing"" describes ""an act of cultural appropriation where someone non-Black tries to present themselves as Black"". That could be through darkening their skin, adopting an Afro-centric hairstyle, or getting a more voluptuous shape, through photo editing or even butt augmentation. ""Oftentimes [it's] for profit or some other personal gain,"" she says. Blackfishing is a criticism that's been levelled at the Kardashians, and other celebrities including Australian singer Iggy Azalea, British singer Rita Ora and American singer Ariana Grande. Some accused of Blackfishing or of cultural appropriation have counter argued that in fact they are enacting cultural ""appreciation"", Dr Goldman says. But, she argues, while intent is worth considering, ultimately it's not the point. ""A person can appropriate Black culture and say that their intention was not to do harm — but appropriating Black culture does do harm,"" she says. It can reinforce ""surface level"" or ""misinformed"" ideas about Black culture. ""It's commodifying this culture with no gain to Black people."" Like Petronie, social media consultant Natasha also watched the Kardashians' appearances morph over time. Natasha is Middle Eastern-Australian and was very insecure about her appearance when she was growing up. ""I never felt like I was the pretty girl, ever. And I think that was because … I was around mostly white people,"" she says. By the end of high school, she had endured years of teasing about her looks. Yet, at the same time, reality TV was demonstrating that appearance isn't fixed. ""I started realising, oh wow, things can be changed,"" Natasha says. So at 18 years of age, Natasha, who is now 26, began cosmetic enhancement — first lip filler, then rhinoplasty or a nose job — to alter what she calls her ""ethnic nose"". But she says that modifying her cultural features has come at a cost. While she publicly, and proudly, identifies as a woman of colour, she says she's been criticised online for having ""absolutely no features that correlate with a woman of colour"" and for being ""white passing"". For Natasha, such statements diminish her personal experience. ""They don't know the torment I went through growing up,"" she says. ""I start to think it's my fault because I've changed my ethnic features. ""But it's so wrong."" Natasha says the comments also diminish the discrimination faced by her Aramaean forebears. ""My people have gone through so much persecution … and even my parents, moving to Australia [have endured] so much hardship,"" she says. The criticism levelled at those who undergo cosmetic surgery to modify their cultural features is one that philosopher and physician Yves Saint James Aquino is familiar with. He has studied the ethics of cosmetic enhancement, specifically blepharoplasty or double eyelid surgery, a procedure that is most popular in South East Asia. Dr Aquino, who is also a research fellow with the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, says people who undergo this surgery are often criticised for ""betraying their heritage"" or being ""a race traitor"". He argues it's a reductive position to take. ""Heritage and culture is more than appearance,"" he says. Dr Aquino believes that people, women specifically, ""should be able to do whatever they want with their body"". But he also believes that ""choice"" to undergo body or face modification is a concept that ""we have to interrogate"" in the context of media, peer group and broader societal pressure. ""Even if no one's pointing a gun at your head, you live through all these pressures, all these directives … [so] is that an authentic choice?"" One of those pressures is social media. Dr Aquino knows of cosmetic surgeons who report that their clients want ""to change their face based on specific [social media] filters"". He says other clients want to alter their noses because the angle of a selfie gives the illusion of an increased nose size. ""So it's a very weird, perceptual thing that's influencing their self-image … it's the way they hold their phone,"" he says. The cosmetic enhancement industry in Australia is booming. We meet the people chasing their aesthetic ideal and those jumping off the cosmetic enhancement conveyor belt. Gemma Sharp has also noticed shifts in cosmetic surgery requests. A clinical psychologist and Senior Research Fellow in the Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre, Dr Sharp leads the Body Image Research Group. She says there's been a move away from a ""traditional facelift, which is used to 'rectify' ageing processes"". Rather, ""preventative"" procedures such as fillers are becoming more common among younger people. Dr Sharp says the expansion of the sorts of people having procedures is thanks to reduced costs, increased availability and the normalisation of cosmetic surgery through the media. ""People who tended to seek cosmetic procedures were more likely aged 30 and over in the past, but now we are seeing people seeking them as young as late teens and 20s."" In the last five years or so, there's been a sharp increase in the use of injectables (such as in wrinkle-reducing or lip-filling procedures) in Australia, and the Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) operation, which ""is the fastest growing cosmetic surgery in the world"", Dr Sharp says. At 2018, Australians were spending more per capita on cosmetic surgery than in the US, with anti-wrinkle (Botox) injections the most popular operation at the time. Cosmetic surgery wasn't on the mind of 14-year-old Kina when she started posting selfies on social media. For a long time, Kina, who has Indian heritage, only posted photos with filters applied to them. At first, the filters were ""cute hearts"" or ""a nice background"", she says. ""And I was like, that's lovely."" Then she realised the filters could also ""slim down my nose … make my nose look upturned … make my lips and eyes bigger [and] my face slimmer"" and ""significantly lighten my skin"". ""I looked like a white person,"" Kina says. It began to change the way she thought about herself. ""I was just like, am I not pretty otherwise? It came to the point where I could not take a photo without a filter because I would look at myself and find all these little faults."" Kina started to ask herself, ""Why can't my nose be slimmer? Why can't my lips be bigger? Why can't my face have more of a structure to it instead of being so round?"" She recognised the filters' ""toxic"" influence and today she tries to avoid them. But she's concerned that she and her peers are bombarded on social media with ideals about an ""unattainable body"". ""[The beauty ideal] is very much centred around white women having racially ambiguous features, like those big lips, the very Middle Eastern and South Asian brows and eyes, and Black bodies,"" Kina says. ""It's just very unsustainable because nobody actually looks like that."" And it sends a powerful message of inadequacy to teenagers online. ""If I went and asked younger girls around my age, 'Do you have insecurities? Do you hate anything about yourself?', so many girls will be like, 'I hate my body, I hate my face [or] how my lips look or [how] my eyes look,'"" Kina says. ""If you ask them, 'Do you want to get surgeries when you're older?' so many girls will say, 'Yes, I can't wait.'"" Kina says race, and racism, is front and centre of the problem. ""People will go, 'Oh, this part of your ethnic features? Ugly. But this part? I want this part so bad … Your nose is flat, that's gross; but your eyes, they're so pretty.'"" What do people of colour, who've often been racially vilified for their appearance, have to say about others cherry-picking their features? Dr Aquino describes this as a ""mixed race"" western beauty trend that privileges ""racial ambiguity"". ""All of a sudden, you're beautiful because you look ethnic, but not too ethnic',"" he says. ""There is a certain range where we find things to be acceptable."" Dr Goldman says there's a powerful marketing opportunity within that range. ""One of the things about the Kardashians and about racial ambiguity in general is that individuals have the ability to sit in the middle of this white and non-white [identity], reaping the benefits, while avoiding the costs."" Petronie has noticed an increase online in the presence of big hips, big lips and big bums in young women, including among white women. For her, it demonstrates an inescapable hypocrisy. ""I find it interesting because [white people] were teasing us before because Black people had big lips. ""And now that's what you want. ""When you're not Black and those are Black features — the lips and even the hair, like braids — it's cultural appropriation,"" she says. Petronie argues the act of assuming physical features or styles that are typical of a culture other than your own — full lips or full hips, or cornrows, for example — brings with it some responsibility. If you emulate Black culture, she says, ""then I want you to keep that same energy when it comes to issues that are happening within the Black community"". Stand with the Black Lives Matter movement, for example. ""Make sure that you're an ally. Don't just pick and choose what parts of our culture suit you, because Black culture is not a trend,"" Petronie says. Rokeshia Ashley, an assistant professor at Florida International University who specialises in body image and modification, wants to move on from talking about the Kardashians. She says plenty of Black women are now ""taking hold of this conversation"" and are ""also using their bodies as social capital"". She points to public figures such as model Blac Chyna, entrepreneur Jai Nice or influencer Eliza Reign as examples. Whether through modelling clothes or paid social media sponsorships, the women are creating revenue ""how they see fit"", she says. ""Although it may seem morally compromising to some, they are well within their right to govern their bodies autonomously."" Dr Ashley says rather than consider body modification — a term she uses to include cosmetic surgery as well as changes to hair or make-up — as inherently bad, we should be more ""receptive and supportive to what Black women want to do with their bodies"". Black women's bodies ""have always been governed"", whether by slavery or health institutions, or through other means, Dr Ashley says. ""Globally, with anti-Blackness, we didn't have the opportunity to be able to say, 'This is what I want to do with my body.'"" Whatever that choice is today, she supports it, so long as it can be done safely and with all the education and information at hand. Unlike some of her online critics, Natasha doesn't conflate her cosmetic procedures with her relationship to her cultural background. ""I'm very, very proud of being Middle Eastern,"" she says. And she's happy today with her slimmer nose and other cosmetic modifications, which she says have ""definitely made me more confident"". Petronie, on the other hand, decided against cosmetic surgery, and is also content with her decision. Her nose job idea was discouraged by her partner and, after considering it for a while, Petronie agreed she didn't need it. ""[I thought], you know what, I'm just going to embrace my culture [and] embrace my nose,"" she says. ""This is a Black person's nose. This is not every Black person's … but it's who I am. It's part of my history, my background. So I think I will be keeping it.""

219,"'Irreplaceable': Globally-renowned master of the yidaki, Mr Gurruwiwi, dies in Arnhem Land",arts-culture,"  Mr Gurruwiwi, globally-renowned master of the yidaki, dies in Arnhem Land Mr Gurruwiwi, a renowned and celebrated master of the yidaki, more commonly known as the didgeridoo, has died in Arnhem Land after a long battle with illness. He has long been considered the world’s foremost master of the yidaki, an instrument developed by the Yolngu people of north-east Arnhem Land, and a symbol of Aboriginal Australia. WARNING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised this article contains an image of a person who has died. Mr Gurruwiwi's family have given permission for his last name and image to be used. Mr Gurruwiwi's exact age at the time of his death was unknown, however it is believed he was in his late eighties. Zelda Gurruwiwi, Mr Gurruwiwi's daughter, said her family and the Galpu people were ""feeling sad and feeling proud"". ""He flew with the yidaki, he was travelling with the yidaki,"" she said. ""He shared that from his own heart to the world."" Ms Gurruwiwi said her father left a powerful legacy. ""We're proud of him. Outside, physical, we're sad. Inside, spiritually, bright,"" she said. ""Sharing culture, he was holding that culture, living with that culture and he was walking with it. ""It's all there, that life. You know what he said last minute to me? He said: 'My work is done.' ""He shared the love, kindness, happiness, laughter, joy, because he was living in a world that he came from."" A leader of the Dhuwa moiety Galpu clan of north-east Arnhem Land, Mr Gurruwiwi lived in Birritjimi on the Gove Peninsula, about 1,000 kilometres east of Darwin. There, in north-east Arnhem Land, Mr Gurruwiwi's father Monyu gave him the specific role as the primary custodian of the yidaki for his clan. Outside of his home, he took the yidaki, an instrument he called his ""whole life"", to the world. The sound of his yidakis has been described as being imbued with the power of lightning and thunder, and he became popularly known as a master of the instrument — a status burnished when Mr Gurruwiwi was chosen to make the yidakis for Yothu Yindi. His instruments toured with the band and have been heard in studio recordings played on mainstream radio all over the world. Mr Gurruwiwi was also known as a healer and a teacher, and those who came across him would often remark on his grand wisdom and wit, warmth and charisma, and larger than life presence. Describing him as ""irreplaceable"", Will Stubbs, the coordinator of the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Centre in north-east Arnhem Land, said Mr Gurruwiwi was a vital holder of knowledge. ""Mr Gurruwiwi was a true one-of-a-kind legend. He had international cult status within the world of didgeridoo players,"" he said. ""The yidaki or didgeridoo originates from here and the Galpu clan have primary responsibility for the songlines that detail that origin. As leader of that clan he vigorously promoted and defended that legacy. ""There are literally thousands of people from many overseas nations who have been welcomed into his modest family home to learn the intricacies of the instrument over the last 35 years. ""He is truly irreplaceable."" Until his death, Mr Gurruwiwi lived in dilapidated housing at Birritjimi, where homes were built in the 1970s to house the managers of a Rio Tinto mining operation. In 2020, he said his family's pleas for safer housing had gone unheard for years: ""We want people to start recognising us, hear our voices,"" he said. The year before, the Royal Australian Mint adopted a design by Mr Gurruwiwi for a $1 coin. Mr Gurruwiwi was the key consultant of the 'Yidaki: Didjeridu and the Sound of Australia' exhibition by the South Australian Museum, one of the most comprehensive projects to ever chronicle the instrument. The exhibition examined the instrument as both iconic yet, inexplicably, underappreciated by wider Australia. The South Australian Museum's head of humanities John Carty has said First Nations Australians steered the museum to Mr Gurruwiwi to advise on the exhibition. ""The only way that [the museum] could do this with any integrity was to work with the real experts, [Mr Gurruwiwi, his family]' and the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land],"" Mr Carty said in 2017. He said Mr Gurruwiwi changed the way the world saw his instrument and taught the nation more about the power and knowledge of his Yolngu people. ""[Mr Gurruwiwi] has been one of the men who has been really integral in the spread of the instrument, not only in Australia, but overseas,"" he said. ""He's more famous in Japan and Germany and overseas than he is in Australia, because he's spent his life taking the instrument ... around the world to share that knowledge and to use the instrument as a bridge between cultures."" Film-maker Ben Strunin, who made a biopic of Mr Gurruwiwi and toured with him through Europe, told The Guardian in 2017 that Mr Gurruwiwi ""deserves all the recognition of our most celebrated music stars"". The film made showcase of the yidaki master's friendship and work with Grammy award-winning musician Gotye, whose real name is Wally De Backer. Mr De Backer has paid tribute to the late clan elder, describing him to ABC Radio Darwin as ""a human of incredible spirit"". ""I feel fortunate to have spent some time with him and his family,"" he said. ""His deep commitment to music, healing and family will continue to be a source of inspiration to me, and I hope it may also be to others who look into his life and work."" Zelda Gurruwiwi said the yidaki was ""mystery, history"" to her father. ""It came itself, this nature, the instrument, and now we're living with that nature,"" she said. ""You can see trees coming, you can feel the breeze coming from north, east, west, south. ""That instrument took him far.""

221,"'The love, the hurt': What Johnny Cash sang about 'belongs to everyone'",arts-culture,"  Johnny Cash's life celebrated in Devonport premiere of musical Ring of Fire ""Hello … I'm not Johnny Cash"" drawls local theatre legend Sid Sidebottom as Wendy (from costume) passes him another black shirt in the backstage hallway. In a full dress rehearsal for Ring of Fire, The Music of Johnny Cash, the former federal member for Braddon demonstrates that he can deliver the deep and low tones of the legendary American singer. But this is not a tribute show. It's a journey through Cash's life and a genderless celebration of universally loved songs, hence the play on Cash's famous opening line. ""I'm not him. No-one is playing Johnny Cash, yet we all are,"" Mr Sidebottom says, reaching for what must be the last long, black trenchcoat available in Devonport. ""In this show, there are a number of classic Johnny Cash songs sung by females. I think people will be really excited by that and you do still feel that Johnny Cash is there. ""What Johnny Cash sang about, the love, the hurt, the causes — those things belong to everyone."" The cast of six singers are joined by a seven piece on-stage band — the Smokin' Locals —  led by co-director David Turner. The singers joining Mr Sidebottom are Annette Dawes, Zac Weeks, Laura Auton, Sherry Rand and Andrew Grey. Last year Mr Sidebottom directed the Devonport Choral Society's Buddy Holly story at the same venue: Devonport's Town Hall Theatre. That show was very much led by a star turn by young singer, guitarist and actor, Ezra Shelverton. For his energetic Buddy Holly, he won the Tasmanian Theatre Award prize for Outstanding Male Lead Performance. This year it's the newly formed Cradle Coast Theatre that is staging Ring of Fire. And the experience has been a baptism of fire. They chose a show that was flexible enough to get through a COVID period. ""We've been severely affected by the pandemic. We've had to postpone the show and a majority of this cast and the band have had COVID,"" Mr Sidebottom says. ""So, it's been a long journey. A bit like Johnny Cash's story I think."" Mr Sidebottom says there's a lot of darkness in Johnny Cash's music. ""Here's a man who had great faith but also sinned greatly. He hurt a lot of people, was hurt by a lot of people,"" he says. ""I think he was always seeking redemption."" Over where the band is warming up, drummer Pete Jermy points to the official musical notation on the stand that directs his drums on the classic song Jackson. It reads: ""s**t kickin"". ""It's an apt description of the relentless, big rhythm that's in so much of this music,"" the drummer says. The singers revel in it too, belting out 30 Cash greats across the two acts of the show, often in duet and with stunning six-part harmonies on the gospel numbers. Annette Dawes has been travelling 90 minutes each way from Irish Town — after work — for each rehearsal and will do it again for each of the 10 shows between May 13 and May 28. ""I've come to appreciate Johnny Cash even more through this experience,"" Ms Dawes says. ""I love the group songs, Five Foot High and Rising, Daddy Sang Bass. They're just a heap of fun."" Co-star Laura Orton concurs: ""I love Daddy Sang Bass, especially the a capella part at the start."" ""We're all facing each other and you can just feel the music. It's really beautiful."" The show is backed by a projection of archival images from Cash's earliest days as a poor kid on an Arkansas cotton farm through his early marriage to Vivian Liberto and on to the evolution of his great love with June Carter. The power of the show is in the greatness of the songs and in the fine cast of local singers who can all ""wear black"" with aplomb when called upon. Sherry Rand, Zac Weeks and Andrew Grey are all known for regular professional gigging along the coast and know how to own the stage. The premiere performance is at the Devonport Town Hall Theatre on Friday night.

222,Craig McLachlan accused of lying while giving evidence in defamation trial ,arts-culture,"  Craig McLachlan accused of lying while giving evidence in defamation trial Actor Craig McLachlan has been accused of repeatedly lying in his defamation trial, after giving contradictory evidence about on-stage kissing during a production of The Rocky Horror Show. McLachlan is suing the ABC and Nine Newspapers for defamation over stories from 2018 containing allegations he indecently assaulted, harassed, bullied and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. He is also suing actor Christie Whelan Browne, who made the allegations to the ABC's 7.30 program and the Sydney Morning Herald. Two days ago, McLachlan said he never kissed any of his female co-stars below the shoulders or arms during a bedroom scene in the show, but on Thursday admitted he once kissed Whelan Browne on the hip. He said the only reason he did so was because he dropped a fake cigarette used as a prop and had to improvise while trying to retrieve it from the bed. ""Because I dropped the e-cigarette and Christie saw it as well, so I jokingly kissed her on the hip while I scrambled to find the e-cigarette. It was quite a funny moment,"" he told the court. But the barrister representing the media outlets, Michael Hodge QC, argued McLachlan inappropriately touched and kissed not only Whelan Browne under the bed covers, but two other actors who were understudies during the tour. This is something McLachlan said was ""impossible"" as there wasn't enough time during the scene and he was too focused on putting the e-cigarette in a specially designed pocket under the covers. He also claimed some of the kissing sounds picked up by his microphone while under the covers were what he called ""air kisses"" and not actually on his co-star's body. ""You're making this up aren't you?"" Mr Hodge said. ""No I'm not Mr Hodge,"" McLachlan said. ""That's just a lie … a deliberate lie,"" Mr Hodge said. ""No it's not,"" McLachlan said. Later during cross-examination, the actor contradicted evidence he gave earlier this week in court about a conversation with a co-star in April 2014. On Tuesday, he denied telling the actor, who cannot be identified, that he ""couldn't wait for the bedroom scene"" while in her dressing room one night. But on Thursday, Mr Hodge showed McLachlan a 2018 affidavit he signed which stated he did say this. McLachlan then claimed he could recall mentioning the bed scene to the actor but that it was only in reference to ""corpsing"" — something which he described as actors intentionally trying to make each other laugh while on stage. ""We would routinely talk about making each other laugh or not laugh in the bed scene,"" McLachlan said. Mr Hodge then said McLachlan was just trying to ""spin"" evidence that didn't support his earlier claims. ""No I haven't,"" he said. The defamation trial is expected to run for around five weeks and will hear from 11 women who have accused McLachlan of inappropriate behaviour. All worked with him on Australian TV or theatre productions. McLachlan says the media reporting of such allegations damaged his reputation and caused him so much distress he had to be admitted into a mental health facility in 2018.

223,Designers bring lived experience to disability-friendly creations for Australian Fashion Week,arts-culture,"  Designers Carol Taylor and Jessie Sadler bring disability-friendly creations to runway for Australian Fashion Week For the first time in Australian Fashion Week history, a runway show has been created by and for people with disabilities, and modelled by people with disabilities. Award-winning Gold Coast artist Carol Taylor was one of two women who co-designed several ""adaptive clothing"" pieces for Fashion Week in Sydney, which were being showcased today. She and co-partner Jessie Sadler created the pieces for Brisbane-based label Christina Stephens, and the range includes clothing for people living with disabilities, spectrum disorders and who have difficulty dressing themselves. The pair said they hoped to make ""adaptive clothing"" mainstream and wanted to see the pieces displayed in major department stores. Former Sydney-based lawyer Carol Taylor was in a horrific car crash in the Blue Mountains in 2001 that severed her spinal cord and left her a quadriplegic. She said she had always been interested in fashion but after her injury, that passion turned to devastation when she could never find any clothing to suit her altered body. She decided to begin designing clothing for herself, which morphed into creating clothing for people with all kinds of disabilities and disorders. ""There are so many different considerations that adaptive clothing brings, there are so many misconceptions about designing in this space,"" she said. ""So if I'm designing for someone in a wheelchair, it's not just about designing for someone in the seated position, careful consideration has to be given to things like movement and dexterity issues. ""Temperature control, because the thermostat in the brain doesn't work the same anymore after spinal cord injury. ""Things like life-threatening pressure sores, it's also important to consider fabric type for those who suffer from arthritis or spectrum disorders because they can experience sensory issues, the list goes on."" Ms Taylor joined forces with brand founder Jessie Sadler, and together they have worked to create disability-friendly designs that can also be worn by able-bodied people. Together the pair were asked to create a number of pieces to open Australian Fashion Week on Thursday. ""It's more than just magnets and Velcro, and by showcasing at Australian Fashion Week, I believe we begin the journey of taking adapted fashion mainstream,"" Ms Taylor said. ""We want to show our designs that are thought provoking, provocative, luxurious, exciting, colourful. ""People with disabilities want to be included in the fashion conversation and have the same access to fun, colour and excitement as everybody else"" Ms Taylor said the runway collection showcased pieces close to her heart, including one item ""specifically designed for the girl that cannot stand"". ""But every other item has in-built features that are going to benefit someone with mobility, dexterity, disability issues, but could equally be worn by someone who is able-bodied."" She said another piece was prompted by wanting to give people with disabilities the same intimate moments as able-bodied people. ""Inspiration for this design came about when i was in an online conference and there was a young quadriplegic man that was to get married and his girlfriend was able bodied,"" she said. ""The boys at the end of the conference were having a bit of a laugh and joke about the wedding night coming up, and you could hear a pin drop. ""He said yeah you should know that I will never know what it's like to unwrap my bride, and for me that was a light-bulb moment. ""I thought oh my gosh, why should he be denied this intimacy, and I thought well that problem needs solving."" Ms Taylor said the clothing's point of difference was the designers having lived experience with disability themselves, with Carol a quadriplegic and Jessie's mother suffering an arm injury that led to her getting arthritis and having difficulty getting dressed. ""We are the only clothing label that has lived experience of disability at the design table,"" she said. ""There's absolutely no substitute, at the moment we have able-bodied people designing for people with disabilities. ""So this is the first time customers are going to have people with disabilities designing for people with disabilities and I think that's a critical point of difference.""

225,Bear essential: Treasured teddy rescued from outback after dad's travel photo blunder,arts-culture,"  Lost teddy bear 'Pooh' reunited with family after being lost in the outback A long-lost teddy has finally been reunited with his family months after being left behind in outback NSW. Gordon Wilson left his son's treasured bear 'Pooh' on a fence post along the Barrier Highway near Broken Hill in March while part way through a 5000km journey from Bowen in north Queensland to Perth in WA. Mr Wilson had been taking photos with the bear as a way of keeping himself and the family entertained. After being ""distracted by flies"" and driving off – it took hours for Mr Wilson to realise he'd left his son's prized possession more than 150km away. He decided against going back, and that's where the real adventure began. He and his wife Lois Wilson logged onto to social media and began posting on Broken Hill Facebook groups, asking if someone had seen or picked up the bear. What happened next came as a shock to the Wilsons. Their appeals for help were shared all over the internet. ""I was actually quite amazed by the reaction and how many people were following the story,"" Mr Wilson said. Grazier Mitch Rodgers was one of those interested onlookers. Determined to reunite the family with their beloved bear, he drove out from Comarto Station near Wilcannia to find Pooh where he had been left. While the plan had initially been to post him back in the mail, Mr Rodgers and Mr Wilson thought the adventure should continue. So they decided to harness the power of social media to find more people willing to travel with the bear across to the west coast. ""Mitch went to great trouble and started to share the story on social media with some great photos,"" Mr Wilson said. ""The story then took on a life of it's own and if it wasn't for Mitch it probably wouldn't have got off the ground like it did."" He said Pooh's journey garnered interested from as far afield as Scotland, where he had relatives. He said Pooh travelled 150km to Broken Hill and visited Silverton before heading south to Mildura in Victoria. ""He then received a lift from a couple to Adelaide and from there flew to Perth,"" he said. ""I'll tell you what it took off pretty quick,"" Mr Rodgers said. ""It was just good to hear that people were getting a bit of joy out of it."" 24-year-old Ben Wilson, who's had the bear since he was a baby, is still stunned that so many people dedicated their time and effort to make sure the teddy was returned. ""I thought that was it, and I was never going to get him back,"" he said. ""I'm grateful for Mitch, the Broken Hill community along with anyone and everyone who was involved,"" Ben said. Asked if Pooh would be having any more adventures anytime soon….the answer was ""unlikely"". ""He'll be staying with me until I have my first child and then when he or she gets old enough, I'll tell them the story of what happened here,"" Ben said. ""Because it's not something we're going to forget anytime soon.""

226,From Gold Coast to Turin — Sheldon Riley's Eurovision journey,arts-culture,"  Australia's Sheldon Riley may be Not The Same but his Eurovision dreams are finally coming true in Turin Just over two months ago, an emotional Sheldon Riley achieved his long-time dream — a trip to Italy to represent Australia at the Eurovision Song Contest. Amid cheering crowds at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre, Riley — a talented 23-year-old Filipino-Australian performer best known for his work on reality TV shows like The Voice and America's Got Talent — had earned top spot in Australia Decides with his power ballad Not The Same. And yet he quickly realised that while his dramatic, dark, industrial staging had worked on the Gold Coast, he would have to dream things up again if he wanted to make his mark at Eurovision in Turin. This week, all the thinking and planning since then comes to the moment of truth for his big Eurovision adventure, when Riley steps on stage at the PalaOlimpico and tries to qualify for the final of the global music extravaganza that is watched by up to 200 million people around the world every year. ""I won't say anything bad about Australia Decides, because I won. I could have been happier, but because of COVID there was a lot of setbacks, there was a lot of rehearsals we couldn't get to, and … just COVID-wise, it meant there was only so much creative control I was able to have,"" he told ABC before flying out for the contest. ""But the performance was too dark, it was too heavy. I learned a lot from Australia Decides, I realised my song isn't a sad song, it's not a negative song and it shouldn't be a song that's too heavy and emotionally driven in a negative sense. The song has a lot of light, it has a lot of hope. ""I think it shines really brightly for a lot of people who don't have a voice and I needed to present that on stage, and the whole dark thing, it's not the right staging for the song."" Riley calls Eurovision a ""juggernaut"" of a competition. It's the world's biggest live music event, and for competitors it's not just a case of winning their national final or being named as the performer of the song for Eurovision, then resting up before turning up in the host city to do the business. ""Eurovision season"" runs for months. Italy picks its winner after a huge music festival of their own, San Remo. Many of the songs are then tweaked between winning and the contest itself — sometimes to improve the arrangement, other times to get the length of the song down to three minutes. If they don't get to that time limit or under, it can't be performed at Eurovision. The other part is what could be termed the campaign element. There is no formal advertising for Eurovision, but performers do countless interviews in their own and other countries to raise the contest's profile. And then there are the ""pre-Eurovision parties"" that have become a big part of the lead-up, as various competitors go to places like London, Spain, the Netherlands and Israel to perform concert versions of their songs in front of tightly packed, noisy crowds in nightclubs or other venues. Riley went to two parties, in London and Tel Aviv — and it was an eye-opening experience for a number of reasons. ""It's still well and truly in the Eurovision bubble. Unfortunately I lost my voice in London, which really messed me up in London and Israel Calling, but I was still so happy to be there,"" he said. ""In the end you really don't know how big Eurovision is until you go to Europe and see how much people obsess over the whole thing. So it was nice to get an experience and a kind of taste test for what's coming."" The contest itself has changed markedly in recent years — with the proliferation of reality TV singing shows, a lot of entrants are either chosen via a reality show format, or are experienced in those type of shows. Among Australia's Eurovision entrants since 2015 have been inaugural Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian and 2006 runner-up Jessica Mauboy, and X-Factor winners Dami Im and Isaiah Firebrace. Now it's Riley, who has used shows in Australia and the United States to showcase his performing vision, which mixes big songs with a flamboyant image, striking fashion, jewellery and masks. He wrote his song for Eurovision years ago as a message to his younger self about the struggles of dealing with Asperger's Syndrome and feeling ""not the same"" in his appearance, his experience and how he related to the world. Riley's voice, both powerful and capable of fragility, has driven many a reality TV run, but on the Eurovision stage it packs a real punch. But is his grounding in reality TV on two continents an advantage for Eurovision? Not really, he says. ""I think a lot of people are comparing my experiences from The Voice — quite naturally — with all the reality TV I've done to Eurovision, [but] nothing quite has been able to prepare me for how big Eurovision actually is,"" he said. ""In some ways it's very similar to reality TV, but in most ways it's completely different. ""I mean, I've been prepping this for years and years — I've wanted this for such a long time. But this is the most unexpected show, you never know what is going to happen."" He describes Not the Same as ""the hardest song I've ever had to sing"", part of the reason he didn't want it as a Eurovision song in the first place. Eurovision was watched by 183 million viewers in 2021. Here's how you can watch it this year. ""I mean I've learned the song when I was 15, I feel like I know it, it hasn't really changed much since I wrote it. But it's also the hardest song I've ever had to sing — it's such a massive sing,"" he said. ""I think it's the only thing I'm kind of worried about, which is crazy because I've never had to worry about my voice — I've always just kind of trusted it would be OK. ""It's the only thing I'm really worried about, is getting the vocal perfect. It's not like the Eurovision we remember from five or 10 years ago, where it was all about how fun and exciting it was. ""[Now] everyone's a Eurovision expert, especially because of all these reality shows — everyone knows what good singing is, and everyone knows what a f***-up is. ""There's nowhere to hide on this stage, there's no autotune, there's no pre-record, it's just a massive song to sing."" Riley describes Not The Same as ""quite the storytelling song"". ""I wanted to capture little moments that people can rewatch and remember,"" he said. ""I don't want to do the same thing as everyone else. The outfit will be the statement piece of this performance in terms of what's visually happening. ""It's being made by Alin Le'Kal, who's a very incredible designer that I'm very honoured to work with. The dress weighs 40-plus kilos, the outfit … we're practising with sandbags to move around. ""I think it's about 180,000 crystals the outfit is covered in, and lots and lots of feathers."" Member of the Australian delegation — and director of SBS production partner Blink TV — Paul Clarke explains the challenges of a famous staging from 2019. ""When we first designed Kate Miller-Heidke's dress it looked beautiful, but it weighed about 25 kilograms and she couldn't climb the poles she was on in the dress. So it needed a major refurb,"" he said. ""We're not after quite as much [movement] of Sheldon, and he's actually quite a powerful young man — he's very strong."" Rehearsals at Eurovision are designed to get the artists used to the stage, and performing the song, but more to help coordinate movement on stage and the camera angles and effects used to create the visual performance. It's a reminder that although the contest has a live audience — which brings fans together from all around the world and is integral to the atmosphere of the occasion — this is, in the end, a very big TV show. Under a new agreement this year, first rehearsals at Eurovision are closed to press and fan media — causing some consternation — with exclusive clips and backstage chat released on TikTok. The first glimpse was frustratingly brief. There was the dress — white, not black, as at Australia Decides. There were steps of some sort and that was about all you could see. Backstage, Sheldon walked back afterwards, telling the camera: ""That was insane — I mean no-one should have to sing that song three times [in one rehearsal], right? Jesus."" ""I'm so grateful — I still can't believe I'm doing this."" Sacha Jean-Baptiste is the creative director for Australia's three-minute presentation to the world in Turin. She is something of a Eurovision-whisperer, having designed stagings for a number of big entries at the contest. Keep up with all the latest news from the Eurovision Song Contest, including: None of the entries she has worked on have yet won the contest, but that's not the point. She gets the vision part of Eurovision — and one of her creations from last year particularly caught the eye, and led to some ideas from Australia's organisers. ""When you think about what's possible there — Duncan [Laurence], the previous winner from the Netherlands, was literally sitting at a piano and he won Eurovision with just a huge orb behind him, an enormous light. Just the power of it and the simplicity of it worked,"" Clarke said. ""We've got a lot of lights at our disposal and I think one of the key performances for me, which was last year was Gjon's Tears from Switzerland [designed by Jean-Baptiste]. That was basically taking someone who was more introverted and taking them to a huge audience. ""Just the way that that was conceived was I thought really well done — it was like an internal monologue. I loved it, and there was a really simple set that went with that. ""In some ways, that's our model."" The accredited media have since seen the second rehearsals, and clips have gone up showing a bit more of the action. Despite what Clarke said about Riley's strength, there is a challenge here — the physical challenge of singing one of the two or three most demanding songs in the contest while walking at least 40 kilograms worth of outfit up a staircase. If he was emotionally drained after Australia Decides, Riley might be physically spent after three sets of rehearsals, last night's jury performance (which will determine the jury vote but won't be broadcast) and tomorrow's semi-final — and then if all goes well, a repeat of jury final, dress rehearsal and the grand final on Sunday morning our time. There is, of course, an elephant in the room in Turin — the presence of Ukraine and Kalush Orchestra with their entry, Stefania, which is the hot favourite to win for reasons including but not limited to the song and its performance. Eurovision is supposed to be non-political, all about the songs and the entertainment. But it's hard to avoid it in reality — when, for example, the Portuguese entry in 1974 was the signal for the beginning of a military coup. Even with previous Ukrainian entries — like Verka Serduchka's famous glam-stomp, Dancing Lasha Tumbai, which sounded suspiciously like ""Russia goodbye"" when sung; or 2016 winner 1944 by Jamala, a powerful vocal performance of a song about Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin's mass deportation in 1944 of the ethnic Tatar population from Crimea. The spotlight at this year's Eurovision Song Contest is firmly on Ukraine's entry, with Kalush Orchestra strong favourites as their country continues to fight an invasion from Russia, so that raises the question of who will host the contest in 2023 if they win. This year's song is a folk-rap number inspired by one of the band's grandmothers, but it will be performed as the eyes of the world and media are focused on their homeland, and its invasion by Russian forces. When Kalush Orchestra took to the stage for the first semi-final on Tuesday night local time, they received a standing ovation before and after their performance. Unsurprisingly, they qualified for the final. With half the scores for Sunday's final made up of the televote by the European — and Australian — public, it is not hard to imagine a big chunk of those votes being given to Ukraine as a show of support for the country and not just the song. And Sheldon Riley is OK with that — he would even welcome it. ""Eurovision completely saved my life, it was such a dark time for me, I think this contest brought me so much love and so much hope, I would love to see Ukraine win this competition, I think they deserve it, I think they need this hope,"" he told the gathered fan and legacy press in Turin. Although, he doesn't think the song is the best in the contest, stating his preference for Cornelia Jakobs's heartbreak hit Hold Me Closer for Sweden. Riley has been asked both before and after landing in Turin about the moment his emotions spilled over on stage at the Gold Coast for Australia Decides, and whether he thinks there could be a similar moment at the PalaOlimpico. ""The thing I think I really want to make clear to everybody is I am someone in Australia who has never been recognised or respected as a legitimate artist or a musician,"" he said. ""[But] in that moment I was performing to a room full of people that I didn't need to explain myself to, singing a song that I wrote very personally at 15 years old, in a very emotional sense of a competition I've wanted to do for years and years and years. ""At the actual Eurovision it will be emotionally driven, but I'm going to be really strong. I've realised that I've had my moment at Australia Decides that was so powerful for me, but this song isn't for me anymore, it's for other people as well. ""I'm excited to go out there and be strong for people who need to, or want to, hear my message."" Riley's big Eurovision adventure has taken him from reality TV to the ""Olympics of singing"". Regardless of the result, it's clear that it's lived up to his hopes. ""[What I'm hoping for], it's already happening, being able to speak about my music, about my fashion, about my art and have people see what I do,"" he said. And if he's the one who gets to stand on the stage and sing his song for a second time on Sunday morning Australian time, then everyone will get to see what he does.

227,Colin Firth stars in a straightforward retelling of a real military strategy involving a dead body,arts-culture,"  Operation Mincemeat stars Colin Firth in a straightforward retelling of a WWII strategy to trick Nazis with a decoy corpse It might sound like the title for a gory, straight-to-video action movie, but Operation Mincemeat was a real World War II strategy – a secret Allied scheme to deceive the Nazis by dropping a corpse carrying fake military plans into enemy terrain, in the hopes that it might divert Hitler's forces from the real invasion planned for Sicily. Despite the absurdist potential of a story involving a reluctantly heroic stiff, this version of the event, from British filmmaker John Madden (The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel; Shakespeare in Love), is an earnest and tastefully mounted dramatic thriller starring a cast of plummy thespians, including not one but two erstwhile Mr Darcys, in Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen (Pride and Prejudice). At this point, these movies are starting to feel suspiciously like parodies of cinema for an older audience. It's 1943 and – for those who haven't been paying attention for the last 75 years – the war is at a stalemate. Allied forces are plotting a crucial invasion of Sicily, but in order to divert attention from the operation and give their troops the best chance at success, they're determined to leak information to Nazi intelligence about a bogus campaign launching in Greece. The plan is the remit of the Twenty Committee, a secret cabal of British intelligence strategists dominated by the steely John Godfrey (Jason Isaacs), who run a hidden war in the shadows where – as the film's narrator hilariously informs us – ""the truth is protected by a bodyguard of lies"". The Committee's ranks include one Ian Fleming (Emma.'s Johnny Flynn, yet another Austen movie alumni), a young naval intelligence officer who refers to Godfrey as 'M' because he reminds him of his mother's authority. Among the other starchy, stiff-upper-lip caricatures, there's an officer named Bentley Purchase (Paul Ritter). Presumably, Basil Exposition is somewhere just out of frame. The corpse drop is the brainchild of Firth's intelligence officer Ewen Montagu, a middle-aged judge who family and friends believe to be serving as a naval commander. His plan has committee support in Macfadyen's agent Charles Cholmondeley, wily administrator Hester Leggett (Penelope Wilton), and ambitious secretary Jean Leslie (Kelly Macdonald), who agrees to pose as the dead man's sweetheart in exchange for a seat at the table. Together they set out to find a cadaver that might convincingly pass as a deceased Royal Air Force pilot. It's a plan that just might be crazy enough to work: the corpse will wash ashore in Spain carrying not-so-secret plans concerning an Allied attack on Greece, while a network of double agents will ensure the fake intel finds its way to Berlin. Not since Weekend at Bernie's has a stiff played such a pivotal role in the outcome of history. In Madden's version of the story, the committee selects the corpse of a vagrant (portrayed in flashback by Lorne MacFadyen) who drank himself to death on rat poison. There's debate about the real-life identity of the body the British used: some accounts suggest it was a deceased navy man, while Montagu himself said the corpse was ""a bit of a ne'er-do-well, and that the only worthwhile thing that he ever did, he did after his death"". Charming. Grisly as the scenario is, the film's most lively moments arrive via a brief passage of pitch-black humour, as photographers attempt to pose the dead body for an ID photo – with predictably unsuccessful results. Made up to look like a freshly drowned pilot, the newly monikered Acting Major William ""Bill"" Martin is packed on ice, bound for the Spanish coast. As Fleming would later put it: you only live twice. In order to tease this out to feature length, Madden and screenwriter Michelle Ashford (Masters of Sex), adapting the book by historian Ben Macintyre, fashion a tale of mild dramatic intrigue, with details of the characters' personal lives supplying emotional texture while the fate of the military operation hangs in the balance. (Seven-decade-old spoiler alert: it was a success.) There's some enjoyable attention to detail in the elaborate fabrication of the pilot's identity, with a running gag about the overripe dialogue in the soldier's fake letters that plays off the idea that everyone on the intelligence staff appears to be writing a spy novel. ""My God, who isn't writing a novel?"" says an exasperated Montagu, after yet another spook declares his intention to turn his exploits into fiction. And that's even before we get to Fleming, for whom the movie at times resembles an origin story: a visit to the intelligence department's 'Q' branch, for example, sees the future Bond scribe marvelling at a military issue wristwatch equipped with a miniature buzz-saw – catnip for 007 fans familiar with the author's war history. Operation Mincemeat is polite and polished stuff, content to stick to a predictable narrative and let history's stranger-than-fiction details supply the personality. Madden and cinematographer Sebastian Blenkov (Their Finest) shoot in anamorphic wide-screen for that old-school feel, delivering the kind of war movie your grandpa would love (that's a compliment, especially in an era where too many films resemble over-lit television shows). The film is stacked with fascinating details, but Madden can't always overcome the predictability of a narrative that might have come alive in the hands of a more daring filmmaker. A romantic triangle between Macfadyen, Firth and Macdonald, meanwhile, doesn't catch fire despite the actors' charms – and Firth, reliable as ever, and Macdonald, a long-underrated trouper, are both very good here. Given the premise, the movie could have been a little more strange, even funny: in one scene, a British officer mentions German General Jodl – pronounced ""yodel"" – and the moment practically begs for a cameo by Mel Brooks in full Sound of Music regalia. Comic treatment of the material isn't unprecedented either: back in the 50s, Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe's BBC radio troupe The Goon Show staged a parodic account of Operation Mincemeat in The Man Who Never Was, based on the book of the same name that also inspired the 1956 movie version (that film's deadpan line, ""Every body belongs to somebody,"" goes unmatched here). If Operation Mincemeat was already grist for the satirical mill in 1953, less than a decade after the war, it begs the reasonable question as to why this straightforward adaptation needs to exist at all, all these years later. The answer, of course, is obvious. Movies about quirky, feel-good episodes or stirring, patriotic victories in Britain's past are uncomplicated by the nation's more chequered 20th-century history, not to mention its Brexit-addled present; they're perfect for aging audiences who don't want to feel challenged or uncomfortable in the cinema. The fact that these audiences are now baby boomers looking back to their parents' stories of unambiguous heroism points to a curious retreat into familiarity. Maybe this is how nostalgia wins. Operation Mincemeat is in cinemas now. We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

228,"A woman shopping for a gun, a doctor doing the unthinkable: The thrillers broaching a dark topic",arts-culture,"  Debra Oswald, Jane Caro and Robert Lukins explore extreme responses to domestic abuse in new thrillers Jane Caro's new book begins with a woman shopping for a gun. In The Mother, Caro's first novel for adults, we meet 50-something-year-old Miriam Duffy, a successful real estate business owner and grandmother of two. Miriam, recently widowed, is not someone you'd expect to find contemplating a glass cabinet full of lethal weapons. At first, she tells the man behind the counter that she's ""just looking"", but the licence in her handbag reveals a different story — she's here to buy. This moment finds an echo in a handful of new novels in which women are faced with equally stark choices. In Debra Oswald's book, The Family Doctor, a woman stands staring at a syringe whose contents could kill the patient she is attending to. In Robert Lukins' Loveland, a woman watches a man pick up a knife, and knows how it will end. Compulsively readable yet unsettling, they raise a difficult question: what happens when the law fails to protect women from violent men? ""It's always interesting to see new trends emerge in writing, and these Australian authors certainly seem to have revenge on their minds right now,"" says Claire Nichols, host of ABC RN's The Book Show. ""These books forced me to consider what I would do in a hopeless situation. There's a vicarious thrill in seeing these women take matters into their own hands, but their actions obviously throw up a whole new set of ethical questions for the reader to consider."" When Caro decided to write The Mother, she turned to Annabelle Daniel, the CEO of Women's Community Shelters, for advice. Daniel sent her the transcript of the judgement of Simon Gittany, convicted for the horrific murder of his partner, Lisa Harnum, in 2013. Daniel had told Caro that this was the best summing up of coercive control she had ever read. ""The judge really talked about how the violence escalates, how the abuse escalated,"" Caro told The Book Show. ""It gave me a trajectory of how to do the drip, drip, drip, that builds the tension; that mounting fear that both Miriam and the reader, hopefully, feel."" In The Mother's opening pages, Miriam buys a Smith and Wesson nine-millimetre gun, and Caro spends the first half of her book showing us why. We are introduced to Miriam's youngest daughter, Ali, as ""the difficult one"". When Ali marries Nick, Miriam is initially relieved — her new son-in-law seems to dote on his wife. But then Ali begins to withdraw from her family and career, and Miriam, still grieving the loss of her husband Pete, can't quite put her finger on why. Caro drew on extensive research to paint a compelling and subtle portrait of coercive control as it develops. Nick doesn't turn violent right away, but the psychological and emotional manipulation he deploys is almost more terrifying because it causes Ali, and then Miriam, to doubt their own judgement. ""It's undetectable, hard to explain,"" says Caro. ""When you tell someone what happens, it either sounds ridiculous, like you must be exaggerating, or not bad enough to be a problem."" Caro wanted to convey how this can lead victims to remain silent. Especially if they discover their partner is surveilling them, and many do, it only ratchets up the fear and isolation. ""When it's most likely to escalate into violence is in fact when the women try to escape or make attempts to reinstate some sort of independence and freedom. That's when coercive control can become something deadly."" Without lived experience of such a situation, Caro was careful about whose perspective she presented. She wanted ""someone who was observing this happening, rather than someone to whom it was happening"". ""I wanted [Miriam], in a way, to represent us, because most of us, fortunately, we're not necessarily in a relationship like that, but we may watch it from outside, even if all we do is read the headlines … ""I wanted her feelings, terrors, dilemmas, struggles with both disbelief and belief, to mirror ours, so we could experience it vicariously through the novel and through her."" Debra Oswald too chose to centre the perspective of a bystander in The Family Doctor. Her opening pages could have come from a newspaper article, a scene in which a woman and her children have been murdered by her estranged partner. Stacey's body and those of her children are discovered by her oldest friend, Paula. They've been living with Paula for six months, hiding from Stacey's abusive ex, Matt. It is Paula, the family doctor of the title, who witnesses Matt kill himself after having murdered his family. Long after her home became a crime scene, Paula keeps circling that moment, wondering what signs she missed, and what she might have done to prevent the tragedy. ""It's a pang of responsibility that many of us feel about friends we know who've been in bad situations,"" says Oswald. ""Both Paula and Anita, her friend, feel this. They spend a lot of time after the deaths thinking, 'Should we have known? Should we have intervened?'"" When Paula encounters another woman who is clearly being abused by her partner, the question goes from hypothetical to practical. And in answering the question, Oswald manages to subvert notions of what a thriller can be. ""It's not a puzzle book. It's not a mystery to be solved,"" Oswald told The Book Show. Instead, her novel's relentless pace comes from the suspense of whether Paula and Anita will do the unthinkable, and how their own relationship will hold up under the strain of those choices. ""I kind of enjoyed the idea of the challenge – can I hold people with a forward momentum rather than a puzzle?"" ""They're just human beings with flaws and beauty inside them, who are stumbling around in the world, trying to do the right thing, and sometimes making a mess of it."" Robert Lukins wasn't thinking of plot points or big reveals when he started writing the manuscript that would become Loveland. In fact, it was never intended to be a novel — instead he described it as an ""elongated thought exercise"" and a ""solo counselling session"". ""I talked to my male friends, and everyone shakes their heads and talks about how terrible [toxic masculinity and gendered violence] is, but it's always something that is happening somewhere else; it's other men, it's imagined men, somewhere in society that we don't know anything about. It's never us, it's never our friends, it's never our family — but it is. This is us,"" says Lukins. The first version of Loveland was a story in which he interrogated his male characters. He wrote about their upbringing, the family relationships, the lives they lead, anything that could explain why they became violent and controlling. Then he got to the end and, unconvinced, started over again … and again. After six drafts, Lukins realised he couldn't make it work. ""I hit this brick wall because in the end with these men, I found plenty of reasons and plenty of excuses, but no justification obviously,"" Lukins told The Bookshelf. Having lived with these characters for so long, he started to reconsider his role as the author and whose voice and perspective he was privileging. When he chose to centre his story on grandmother and granddaughter May and Casey, he found a way to tell a story about how women live with — and survive — abusive men. ""It became a conscious, punitive act by me to push these men's experiences outside the sphere of the novel,"" says Lukins. ""The men in this story are present through their actions and present through their culpability. But ultimately, this is a novel of the experiences of these women and how they exist."" Kate Evans, co-host of The Bookshelf found herself thinking about how crime fiction can act as commentary on violence, justice and the law. ""It also has a reputation for providing resolution of some sort, if only narrative resolution,"" she says. ""But these novels are interesting in their discomfort: what does it mean to add vigilantism to the mix, especially if it seems justified? Where does it place us as readers, if we thrill to the idea of social-justice revenge? Are we then reading with one eye closed, squinting?"" In each of the novels, the women reach a point where there's seemingly nowhere left to run, and have to consider meeting violence with violence. As a doctor, Paula sees it as her job to ""protect the vulnerable little bodies of the children and women who come seeking her help"", says Oswald. Haunted still by the murder of her friend Stacey, Paula sees few other options. ""I hasten to add, I'm not advocating murder as a kind of transgressive daydream, that moment to channel our rage momentarily into 'What if we just killed one of these guys before he could hurt anybody?' Instead, I think it's about playing 'What if?' with that idea,"" she adds. ""That's what fiction can do, that non-fiction can't do … It's a way of saying, this is the level of desperation we are talking about, that under the right circumstances, a kind of perfect storm of trauma, a sequence of events might push a person who would normally never cross the line to cross the line."" For Lukins, it was never about writing revenge fiction. ""Revenge implies a choice. These are specific acts of survival. These characters have been placed in situations where all of their choices have been taken from them,"" he says. Connecting generations by structuring the novel around parallel timelines – May in the present and Casey in the 1950s – Lukins is also able to chart the cost of violence, which he describes as causing ""damage in all directions"". ""When the characters of my novel are forced to take action, it takes a huge toll on them, and it's one that they might never recover from."" Caro doesn't offer easy solutions — she says she has none. But that isn't why she wrote this book. ""I think that fiction takes the reader into compassion rather than judgement,"" she says. ""I really wanted us to stop having cliched judgements and views about women who find themselves in these terribly abusive relationships."" Caro is referring to questions she's heard when a domestic abuse news story breaks, questions like, ""Why didn't she just leave? Why did she keep the children from him? Why was she attracted to a man like that?"" ""I think novels take us out of our head and into our heart and our gut, so we don't judge Miriam and Alison, instead we feel [for them],"" says Caro. For Oswald, writing The Family Doctor was a way to transmute some of the deep anger she felt as she read story after story in the news about women and their children being assaulted. ""I wanted to wield that rage to other more positive, beautiful things, like the urge to protect people and the power of female friendship, and find a way to tell a story that would harness both those sorts of powerful forces."" Lukins, who set out to confront his own culpability, says writing the novel left him in no doubt that he — and everyone else — was complicit in gendered violence. He wants to see ""real-world change"" — significant legal reforms and improved financial support for survivors — and he's wary of anything less tangible. ""Maybe it's comforting in a way to read an article or a novel and then you feel like you've sort of reached a place of better understanding, but if nothing changes, then ultimately it's just an exercise in making ourselves feel better,"" he says. ""I suppose there's nothing wrong with starting a conversation, but if that conversation never goes anywhere, then I think it can do more harm than good.""

229,analysis: Do those viral '36 questions' actually lead to finding love?,arts-culture,"  Do those viral '36 questions' actually lead to finding love? The ""36 questions of love"" have taken the dating world by storm. First published in 1997 as part of scientific research into relationships, the 36 questions of love gained global popularity through Mandy Len Catron's viral 2015 New York Times essay ""To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This"". In that essay, she outlines how she used the 36 questions with a university acquaintance on a casual night out. The result was the two fell in love, not dissimilar to two research participants who took part in the study back in 1997. In the publishing of that essay, a phenomenon was born. Social media, dating websites, dating coaches and bloggers were posting, writing or discussing the 36 questions of love — often framing these questions as a surefire method to find love — backed by science. As people attempted the 36 questions of love during dates, it became clear the 36 questions typically did not result in people falling in love. The 36 questions are three sets of 12 questions. Each set is designed to increase the amount of information a person discloses about themselves to a stranger. Not only does each set of questions increase the amount each person must disclose, but within each set, the questions increase the level of disclosure as they progress. For example, one question in the first set includes ""For what in your life do you feel most grateful?"" The second set includes questions such as ""What is your most treasured memory?"" The final set, which requires the greatest disclosure, includes questions such as ""When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?"". To answer this, one needs to go back to the original paper published by well-known relationships researcher Arthur Aron and colleagues. The research aim was to determine if progressively increasing disclosure increases closeness between two strangers. The research was not designed to test whether the questions lead to love. Instead of upskilling women to cope with the harm they risk in dating men, the self-help industry should focus on male behaviour. Across three studies, Aron and colleagues found support for the idea that a gradual increase in disclosure between strangers is related to an increase in closeness immediately after the experiment. The original research never measured whether people developed feelings of love directly after the experiment or in the future. However, the final study did a brief follow-up with most matched pairs of participants. Seven weeks after participating in the study, it was found 57 per cent of the matched pairs had a follow-up conversation, 35 per cent did something together (no more details were provided), and 37 per cent went on to sit together in class. But again, none of these findings have anything to do with people finding love and going on to have a long-term relationship. If indeed the 36 questions helped Mandy Len Canton find love, that is a positive thing. However, for the dating world to generalise about the love-generating properties of the 36 questions on the basis of one popularised case speaks to how pop culture can heavily misconstrue science. Those of us who study how people fall in love and what makes for a lasting relationship know there are many ingredients that go into making a relationship work. Some of these include: the importance people place on what they want in the ideal partner people's similarities and differences people's history of past relationships styles of dealing with conflict ability to support and respond to a partner in stressful times the alignment of partners' beliefs, values and goals each person's level of commitment and the ability to regulate emotions (and these are just some of the factors). The point of the research conducted by Aron and his colleagues is self-disclosure and enhancing closeness are two factors that matter within the larger scheme of factors. The other important point is the 36 questions provide a structured way to engage in self-disclosure. Research has shown relationships can falter when people disclose too much about themselves early on in the dating process. When people do not know each other well, it can be overwhelming for a person to hear very intimate and personal details about another. They may not know how to respond to the disclosure, or feel uncomfortable themselves. This can result in the person who disclosed coming away from the interaction feeling invalidated and vulnerable. On the other hand, when a person feels their partner responds to their disclosures and vulnerabilities, relationship intimacy is enhanced. But it is a high bar to set early in a relationship to expect a partner to respond appropriately to another who discloses highly personal information about oneself. Generally speaking, over-disclosure in the early stages of relationships can be problematic, especially for those who are anxious about their relationships. So taking a gradual and measured approach to self-disclosure and ensuring each partner has the opportunity to disclose at a comfortable pace is very important. The 36 questions are unlikely to be a ""surefire"" way to find love, but they can help people understand the importance of taking a gradual approach to self-disclosure. Finding love doesn't have to be a race. Gery Karantzas is an associate professor in social psychology / relationship science at Deakin University. This piece first appeared on The Conversation.

230,Craig McLachlan admits in court kissing actor who later accused him of sexual harassment,arts-culture,"  Craig McLachlan admits in court kissing actor who later accused him of sexual harassment Actor Craig McLachlan has told a Sydney court that while backstage during a 2014 theatre production he kissed an actor who has since accused him of sexual harassment. McLachlan made the admission during cross-examination in his defamation trial against the ABC and Fairfax Media over stories published in 2018. The stories contained allegations he indecently assaulted, bullied and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 tour of The Rocky Horror Show. McLachlan is also suing actor Christie Whelan Browne who made the allegations to the ABC's 7.30 program and the Sydney Morning Herald, which is now owned by Nine Entertainment Co. He has so far denied all allegations in court but on Wednesday under questioning by the media organisation's barrister, Michael Hodge QC, he accepted he did kiss actor Erika Heynatz in her dressing room before a show in Melbourne. He said he had been in his own dressing room with his long-time partner Vanessa Scammell before he told her he was going to ""check up on Erika"". He said he knocked on Heynatz's door, she told him to come in and he then told her to ""look at me"". ""She did and I kissed her."" ""I said words to the effect of 'I can't stop thinking about you' .... I spun back on my heel... and said 'I think I might be falling love with you'."" Earlier on Wednesday McLachlan broke down on the stand and revealed he was admitted to a mental health facility after the stories were published. McLachlan, who has enjoyed a long and successful acting career in Australia, told the court the reports damaged his reputation and caused him so much social anxiety he feared ever leaving his house. He said for a long time his only social activity was shopping for his elderly mother while wearing a disguise. ""You are fearful to ever step outside … you feel absolutely powerless against it,"" he said. ""I have been to a restaurant once in four and a half years."" He said on one occasion when he was wearing a disguise while shopping in Coles his hat fell off and a nearby customer recoiled in fear when she identified him. ""[The] woman grabbed her children and reigned them in … looking at me in disgust, it was very, very difficult to reconcile,"" the 56-year-old said. McLachlan gave evidence that immediately after the stories were aired on January 8, 2018 his cousin came and stayed with him as he was worried he would ""do something stupid"" and by the end of the year the actor had to be admitted into a mental health facility. He also explained it was too upsetting to read and watch the stories when they went live and Ms Scammell had to read them to him days later. The Sydney Morning Herald put McLachlan on the front cover of their January 8 edition and a double-page spread led with the headline: ""Manipulative, a predator: McLachlan stands accused"", the court heard. ""When the news broke … and it was revealed to me that these allegations had been made by my friends, it was just too difficult quite frankly to read the article on the day,"" he said. ""The realisation that my friends who 'goosed me', poked me, laughed with me and sat on my lap for almost eight months, [who] stuck their fingers up my nose, shared their lives with me, were making these allegations …"" McLachlan said before breaking down. On Tuesday the former Neighbours star told the jury the cast of the Rocky Horror Show often played gags or ""schticks"" on each other and said Whelan Browne often 'goosed' people – which he described as someone using their fingers to poke someone else between the buttocks. The trial is expected to hear from 11 women who worked with McLachlan on the Rocky Horror Show and TV shows including The Doctor Blake Mysteries about inappropriate touching or comments by the actor. On Wednesday morning his lawyer Kieran Smark SC outlined the dozens of allegations made by the women, all of which McLachlan emphatically denied. Some accusations include that he touched the genitals of Whelan Browne during a bedroom scene in the Rocky Horror Show, he exposed himself to many of the cast members and he threatened to ""end"" one actor who complained about him kissing her without consent.

231,Eurovision 2022 has kicked off. Here's who is competing and how to watch in Australia,arts-culture,"  Eurovision 2022 has kicked off with Ukraine tipped to win. Here's who is competing and how to watch in Australia Eurovision Song Contest semi-finals kicked off early on Wednesday morning, and there's still an entire weekend filled with musical extravaganza ahead of us. With last year's event attracting the eyeballs of 183 million viewers, the world's largest live music event is set to make some big waves this year. To help you brush up on the facts: here's everything you need to know about Eurovision 2022. SBS will broadcast Eurovision. The network will exclusively cover the events on SBS and SBS On Demand from May 11 to 15. Prime-time broadcasts will air on Friday May 13 and Saturday May 14 at 8:30pm, and Sunday May 15 at 7:30pm. The ABC will be live blogging the grand final on Sunday from 4:30am AEST. Sheldon Riley will fly the flag for Australia this year. The 23-year-old, who grew up on the Gold Coast, sealed his spot on the plane to Turin with his ballad Not the Same. Riley has developed a large following through performances on The Voice in 2018 and 2019 and America's Got Talent in 2020. To qualify for the Eurovision song competition, you have to be part of the EBU. SBS is part of the EBU and has been broadcasting the show since 1983. Australia made its Eurovision debut in 2015 when, as part of celebrations for the contest's 60th anniversary, it was invited to enter the competition. For now, the country has secured a Eurovision spot until 2023. The country with the most votes wins the competition and gets to host it the next year. Because of the time difference, if Australia wins, then it must nominate a European co-host which will stage the competition on its behalf. Last year, Italian rock group Måneskin was crowned the Eurovision winner in Rotterdam with their song Zitti E Buoni, which in English translates to Shut Up and Behave. The Italian band won the Eurovision Song Contest with 524 points, 25 points ahead of runners-up from France. Australia's Montaigne finished 14th in last year's semi-final. For obvious reasons the EBU in February announced that no Russian act would participate in this year's contest. Ukraine's act, folk rap group Kalush Orchestra, is overwhelmingly tipped to win, rising to the top of the winning odds following Russia's invasion earlier this year. The six members of the musical act have received special permission to leave Ukraine during the conflict in their country. Most Ukrainian men of military age are currently required to stay in order to help defend their nation. Kalush Orchestra's song, Stefania, will be sung in Ukrainian. The translated lyrics include the line: ""I'll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed."" Ukraine is the favourite to win this year's contest but Italy, the United Kingdom and Sweden are in second, third and fourth place, respectively. It's a glitzy, sometimes eccentric, often weird and wonderful song competition organised annually by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Keep up with all the latest news from the Eurovision Song Contest, including: The participants are predominantly European, but this year, 40 countries across the globe have entered the international song contest. Eurovision has public broadcasters from each country send a representative to perform an original song to compete for the coveted title of Eurovision champion. It kicked off in 1956 as the brainchild of Marcel Bezençon of the EBU, in part as an attempt to unite Europeans following World War II, and it was also designed to test the limits of live television broadcast technology. In 2020, the competition was cancelled for the first time in its more-than-60-year history due to the pandemic. However, it's been recognised by Guinness World Records as one of the longest-running annual TV music competitions in the world. And this year the Italian city of Turin is hosting. Pop group ABBA claimed victory for Sweden in 1974. Celine Dion claimed the title for Switzerland in 1988. Yes, she's from Canada and, no, singers don't have to be from the country they're representing. Yeah, it doesn't really make sense. But just go with it. Famous Australian Olivia Newton-John was chosen as the United Kingdom’s singer in 1974, finishing in fourth place. Ireland takes the Eurovision crown, with seven wins. Coming in second, is Sweden which has won Eurovision six times, while the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France, and the Netherlands have won five times. ABBA's legendary hit Waterloo. The 1974 global hit, which rocketed the band to stardom, was recently named the greatest Eurovision song of all time by BBC viewers.

232,"There used to be hundreds of 'uniquely Australian' B&S balls across the country, but they're vanishing. Here's why",arts-culture,"  B&S balls in decline as liquor licensing and safety regulations increase costs for organisers Ask anyone who has ever been to a Bachelors and Spinsters Ball (B&S) and a few images that may come to mind include getting dressed up, getting drunk, dancing, getting dirty and maybe waking up in an unusual situation. Records show that B&S balls were being organised as far back as 1861. The original B&S balls were organised for men and women who worked and lived on remote properties. The idea was that they would come to town in their Sunday best, have a dance in the local shire hall, and hopefully meet a potential partner. These days B&S balls are more about alcohol, loud music and perhaps a sly pash. But with the increasing demands of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) laws, B&S balls have been struggling to remain operational and relevant. Andrew Greenwood is co-owner of the BNS Balls Australia website and Facebook group, which promotes B&S balls and offered consultancy to charity groups looking to put one on. He said the balls were becoming a rarity. ""Back in the 1990’s there was about 400 balls a year,"" Mr Greenwood said. ""There used to be at least a couple of B&S balls in Australia every weekend. ""Now there's only about 18 balls still going."" From the end of the 2000s, Mr Greenwood said there was an increase in pricing and ""governance of liquor licensing and insurance"". ""This meant a lot of the smaller balls and charity groups couldn't afford to run the events,"" he said. Mr Greenwood said liquor licensing had become even tougher in recent years. After more than 100 years of history, there are fears B&S balls might become a casualty of tightening liquor licensing laws. ""The way liquor licensing is today, it means that there's no money to be made by the charities and groups who used to run them,"" he said. ""They struggle to meet all the requirements. ""It's the same with insurance; there's so many restrictions that organisers can't run the balls anymore."" Another nail in the coffin for B&S balls has been COVID-19. ""Balls had capped numbers, which meant a lot of people couldn't attend,"" Mr Greenwood said. ""There's been a lot more restrictions as to what people can do at balls due to COVID. ""A lot of balls were community-funded and for some rural charities, the B&S ball was their main money raiser for the year and now they are now longer profitable."" Richmond Spouse Hunters Ball treasurer Lorrae Johnston said they had not held an event since 2019 due to several factors. ""We have had dwindling numbers for the past two to three years,"" she said. ""We have tried numerous things to encourage more patrons to attend and we have also had to cancel for the past few years due to COVID. ""We are hoping that 2023 will be our year."" The last post on The Toowoomba Hay Runners B&S ball Facebook page was in January 2019, which read: ""We regret to inform. But due to REDTAPE, Council Restrictions & Denied activity Applications. The Toowoomba Hay Runners B&S will be postponed at this stage. All ticket holders will be contacted in the next few days and a FULL REFUND issued."" In 2016, Swedish photographer Ingvar Kenne was working on a book about drunk Australia and, after photographing his first B&S ball, decided the book would be solely dedicated to the events. ""When I visited my first B&S ball at Goondiwindi, it was real eye opener, as the B&S ball is a uniquely Australian event,"" he said. ""I also learnt that there's a lot of friendly young people who work hard in the bush and, like all of us, they need an outlet to kick up some dust. ""They work long hard days in remote places far from people and when they do get a chance to meet up, they party quite hard."" Mr Kenne photographed 10 B&S balls between 2016 and 2018 and said that police and security had started to clamp down on B&S balls back then. ""There was talk that in the past B&S balls were even wilder, and that they were less regulated,"" he said. ""I've also heard of a few accidents where people were asleep in their swags and were driven over or there were accidents with utes doing burnouts. ""These days security and insurance have increased to point where the balls are no longer viable.""

233,Once bitten: Amy Shark calls for more protections for musicians and artists as she prepares for huge tour,arts-culture,"  ARIA award-winning singer Amy Shark is about to embark on a 60-date national tour, after COVID forced many artists to take a two-year hiatus. The tour, which starts in Western Australia this week, will take her to every state and territory, including to rural towns she has never been to and ""can't pronounce"". The Gold Coast artist said it was a welcome relief to be touring again after musicians were forced to quit gigging altogether during the pandemic, with forced closures and cancellations across the entire music and arts scene. She has called on the government ""to learn from what's happened"" and put safeguards in place to protect artists and prevent similar happenings again. ""I feel like it's coming to an end, but it's so uncertain,"" she said. ""We don't know, but I would hope that the powers that be would have learnt from what we've been through and try and get somewhat prepared. ""In case this does happen again, what are the procedures? ""How can we keep Australian music alive?"" While Shark was fortunate enough to play at a handful of COVID-safe events last year, she said many artists were forced to give up on their music careers entirely because of the financial stress of not performing throughout the pandemic. ""So, so many artists I know have just quit, they just can't financially do it anymore. ""And it's so sad, touring is the main source of income for many bands and artists and it was just taken away."" Shark said playing live music and being able to travel interstate and internationally for events is the entire premise of her line of work, and she was thrilled to see borders open again. She said after being forced into a live music and arts drought, she hoped the community might take the industry more seriously and understand it's ""real work"". ""Music just gets treated like its a pastime, even my family don't see it as work,"" she said. ""I'll get back from tour and they'll be like, 'how was your holiday?' ""I just feel like music it should be taken seriously a little more."" Shark has lived in Sydney for the past two years but said she had plans to move back home to the Gold Coast in Queensland, in between her busy schedule and upcoming mega-tour. ""I've obviously had to spend a lot of time abroad and in Sydney for the next wave of music and over COVID I just really missed home,"" she said. ""This is always going to be home to me. ""But yeah I'm really excited because I love going and finding these little gems here and there and I'm going to find some wacky, wonderful places, I'm not going to look at [my schedule] too intently because I just want to get on the bus and go, just arrive in a town. ""There are a few places here and there that we want to find some cool stuff to do, but I'm just going to get in the zone and make sure I'm putting on a good show each night, a balance of staying healthy and enjoying it as well.""

234,Meet the children's author better known as a Super Netball star,arts-culture," Sport Super Netball and NSW Swifts star Maddy Proud releases second children's book in Grace on the Court series NSW Swifts co-captain Maddy Proud plays netball the same way she talks. Fast and frenetic, jumping from left to right, before making sense of her zig-zag route to the point. After the first eight rounds of Super Netball this year, Proud leads the competition for feeds (353) and goal assists (207). To some, it may look like a headless chook running around in a red and blue Swifts dress, but seasoned fans will know there is method behind the madness. It probably comes as no surprise that Proud writes in the same manner, thrashing the keyboard on her computer and throwing herself headfirst into the process. See, the reigning premiership winner is also an author and has just released her second book in the Grace on the Court series, targeting young girls and adolescents. ""I've found that my writing style is very much like the way I talk, and so I'll sit down and write thousands of words non-stop when I'm feeling inspired,"" Proud told The Netty Life podcast. ""Don't get me wrong, there are some days where I can't get anything out, so it is very much all or nothing with me in a lot of ways."" The narratives in Proud's books centre around the life of 13-year-old Grace Parker as she navigates her first years at high school and trialling in the junior netball pathways. The first edition was an instant hit with fans when it was published in 2018 and has become an ongoing source of inspiration for book week school outfits. Although Proud has taken four years to write the next, she's had a lot on her plate – rupturing her ACL, completing the gruelling rehab and helping the Swifts lift two Super Netball trophies. During the most recent grand final in 2021, she played with a broken rib. She has also completed a masters course in creative writing at Macquarie University, hoping to see her beloved pastime evolve into a legitimate career path. ""When I wrote the first book off the back of a World Youth Cup over 10 years ago, I did it with absolutely no expectations to publish and as something I just loved doing to escape,"" Proud said. ""It was a time in my life where I didn't have a lot going on other than netball, so it was almost therapeutic, and it wasn't until much further down the road that I realised it was something I wanted to get out into the world. ""So with this second book, I was a bit worried thinking, 'was it all a fluke?' ""If I'm going to call myself an author, then I should probably make sure I learn the craft. ""The course was a real eye-opener and an unreal experience: my lecturer became my mentor and it helped so much."" As a respected leader in the sport and with form that has seen her on the fringe of the Australian Diamonds squad, Proud is a popular figure within the netball community. Her down-to-earth personality means she doesn't take life too seriously, often poking fun at herself for regularly falling over on the netball court, and openly talking about her love of pop culture — especially singer Harry Styles. These characteristics, as well as the fact that Proud is unashamedly herself, make her especially relatable for young girls. It's something Proud cites as an important theme in her writing, too. ""The protagonist in my stories is quite relatable, she goes through experiences that most teenagers do during that transition from primary to high school, which is a really critical time. ""I tried to keep the story true with the problems and challenges that arise around balancing sport, friends and maybe love interests. ""I hope it helps readers deal with these things, whether they learn from her doing the right thing or sometimes making a mistake."" We're reached the halfway point of the 2022 Super Netball competition. Here are our picks for Team of the Season so far. In her main career as an elite netballer, Proud is often spoken about as being a role model. Now it seems her second job involves the same purpose: to set a good example. ""I love hearing parents say, 'my daughter loves reading and she never liked sport, but after reading your book she's trialling for the school team.' ""Or, 'my daughter loves netball and she wanted to read the book because you'd written it and although she'd never finished one before, she read yours cover to cover.' ""For me, sport was the saving grace that kept me focused and helped me enjoy school. ""I wouldn't be the person I am today without it, so if I can encourage one girl or boy to pick up a book or try sport, then that's my job done.""

236,"How subscription streaming killed this Victorian video store, one of the last ones left",arts-culture,"  It's closing credits for Colac Video, south-west Victoria's last video hire shop South-west Victoria's last video rental shop will close at the end of the month after Colac Video owner Joe Argento decided it was time to hit the ""stop"" button. The store survived as part of the Colac streetscape into the 2020s as other video hire stores disappeared in surrounding Ballarat, Geelong and Warrnambool. However, as the trickle of customers to streaming services became a flood during the height of the pandemic, Mr Argento said he was forced to admit the day of the video store was over. ""It's finally caught up with us,"" he said. ""It's because of all the streaming services, and COVID just added to it. ""The way the technology is, though, I think it was inevitable. Year on year, it was a trend that was downhill and then there was COVID and people weren't able to come in. According to a 2021 Media Content Consumption Survey by the Social Research Centre, 79 per cent of Australian households have at least one subscription video-on-demand service. Mr Argento said that being in a small town has meant that his customers have been loyal. ""It is sad. We had really loyal, regular customers. They are all disappointed,"" he said. ""We have a lot from the Otways, too. Maybe the reception [for streaming] is still not very good there. ""We're only a small town and I was wondering how to keep it going, but Ballarat and Warrnambool – with much larger populations – their video shops closed a long time ago."" Colac Video was comparatively late to the video craze, opening about 22 years ago. Mr Argento said he took over the shop about 2011, then three years ago moved the store to a smaller location in an effort to reduce costs. In that time, south-west Victoria's final video shop became something of a curiosity. ""We had quite a few people from Melbourne wander past. They'd go into the shop with their kids to say this is what we used to do when we were your age,"" he said. ""I'd imagine there would be some kids who will never experience [going into a video shop]. ""We were still mainly hiring out the videos. We only started a little retail to see what we could do. For Mr Argento, the decision to close was a weighty one, but one he has not regretted. ""It was stressful and sad making the decision [to close] but, now it's been made, I do feel some relief,"" he said. ""I'm 72 so I've quite a lot of work to do at home that I haven't done because of the shop, and I need to catch up with the grandkids. Mr Argento said that in his experience, the Marvel superhero films continued to be the most popular films even as overall video hire declined. The store will remain open until the end of May. ""We're just hiring out the new releases,"" Mr Argento said. ""The weekly ones are actually cheaper to buy than to hire.""

237,Teenager stuns fashion legends with wool design,arts-culture,"  Runway success as designers weave merino wool into diverse range of garments for Fleece to Fashion Awards Wool has been taken off the sheep's back and woven into everything from sportswear to wedding gowns for the annual Fleece to Fashion Awards in the New England region of New South Wales on the weekend. It was a chance for the industry to promote its product through fashion, and after a two-year hiatus due to COVID, the event was bigger than ever, with guests filling Uralla's historic Deargee Woolshed on Saturday night. With eight categories to enter, a stand-out category this year was a new addition called Diversity in Wool, where entrants could celebrate their culture through their designs. Prominent Australian designer Johnathan Ward was one of the judges and said he was impressed by the broad range of fashions on display in that section of the awards. ""Incredible ... it was probably one of our biggest entries and there was a lot of diversity and interest,"" he said. ""What can be done with [wool] ... that category I was particularly interested in."" Mr Ward found the calibre of designs across all categories outstanding and the future of the design industry promising. ""All the judges had to really sit and look at each other and go back and go, 'OK, how do we stop fighting and decide who gets first and second in this category?'"" A 15-year-old Uralla Central School student won the MJ Bale Supreme Award, with Dechen Kandroher taking out the top prize for her design. The pantsuit, cape and clouche hat ensemble was made entirely from merino wool. Fleece to Fashion board director and wool grower Liz Foster said the design was outstanding. ""The judges were blown away by Dechen's entry – not only was it a stunning outfit, [but by] the fact it was made by a young student who started sewing at the age of nine to improve her skills and has been taking sewing classes with a professional dressmaker locally,"" Mrs Foster said. Dechen was also awarded the Winterbourne Pastoral Company Secondary School Award. She said merino wool was a special fibre to work with. ""I took my inspiration for the pantsuit from Chanel but I wanted to make something than could be dressed up for a special occasion or be worn on an everyday basis,"" she said. ""I also included a felt hat, which is something I had never designed or made before, which was a lot of fun."" Local wool grower Lachlan Fulloon is the chairman of Fleece to Fashion. He said the event was an important way to showcase the diversity of the fibre. ""Wool is a fibre that is very unique in its qualities,"" he said. ""For the local wool growers and growers throughout Australia and the world it's a good opportunity to see the fruits of our labour. ""It's quite amazing to see the designs that can come from that.""

238,'No limits': How poet Ellen van Neerven is queering sports writing,arts-culture," Sport 'No limits': How non-binary First Nations poet Ellen van Neerven is queering sports writing It's difficult to know exactly how to categorise Ellen van Neerven's story No Limits. Part creative memoir, part reportage, part theoretical essay and part history lesson, the story weaves anecdotes of the poet's own childhood playing football with conversations between three friends – Maddee, Zaky and Louis – as they meditate on their own experiences as trans and gender-diverse people who participate in community sport. The genre of the piece is hard to pin down. It's broken up into uneven, non-chronological segments with sub-headings like ""SOVEREIGN GENDERS"", ""DIFFICULT JOY"" and ""POWER"". It easily slides between lyrical, descriptive first-person and objective, academic third-person. It dedicates entire sections to the interviewees' transcribed voices. It plucks phrases from writers and athletes like Siufung Law, Jaiyah Saelua and Essa May Ranapiri and it draws upon First Nations cultural knowledge, history and language while critiquing Western patriarchal conceptions of gender and sexuality. Of course, the difficulty — not knowing exactly where this piece fits within the broader web of Australian writing — is the point. Just as its title suggests, No Limits defies and complicates (or ""queers"") literary genres and forms in order to emphasise the radical nature of its subject matter: how trans and gender-diverse people challenge the traditional stereotypes and assumptions around gender and bodies that structure our everyday lives. For van Neerven, there are few better prisms through which to triangulate this conversation than through the complex, yet rigid, space of sport. ""I remember wanting to write something that was experimental and blurred the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction, and was something that didn't shy away from discussing sexuality or gender identity,"" van Neerven told the ABC. ""When I was growing up, sexuality was really repressed. The environment that I was in was a really suppressed kind of environment, so me writing about sexuality, sex and gender identity is pushing back against all of the suppression that I had when I was growing up. ""There were really strong stereotypes of what a queer person was or would look like or how they'd act. Lots of homophobic and transphobic slurs, racist slurs, coming left, right and centre. ""One of them was that if you play soccer, you're a lesbian. A lot of the girls I played with, they really pushed hard against that. If they were gay, they hid it. If they weren't, they were still affected by it because they created a hyper-hetero-feminine presentation in how they acted and dressed to fit in. ""People would ask me when I was 13 or 14: 'are you gay? Are you this? Are you that?' People would ask me, 'are you a boy or a girl?' All this stuff. I didn't really have any answers. ""Space politics is something I'm really interested in and that I try to represent in my work about sport. You're growing up and you're just trying to fit in and find your belonging: it's a really ripe subject matter to write about."" No Limits forms part of a larger collection of work that van Neerven is compiling into a book titled Personal Score, recently acquired by University of Queensland Press. When released, it will be one of the only collections of non-academic Australian sports writing told from the perspective of a queer, non-binary, First Nations writer, which also gives voice to some of the most marginalised communities within sport. It follows a small, if growing, trend of life writing in women's sport that examines the tensions of culture, gender and sexuality, including USA footballer Megan Rapinoe's One Life and Australian cricketer Alex Blackwell's Fair Game. ""With the incredible upsurge in the popularity of women's sport comes the potential to reshape the narratives around sport and culture,"" the press release reads. ""As Personal Score examines, many athletes challenge mainstream views of gender and sexuality and use sport and their role within it to effect change not only in their own sporting realm but more broadly in the wider culture and society. ABCQueer has compiled this list of national and state-based support services relevant to LGBTQI+ people, their families and friends. ""Moreover, van Neerven interrogates the implications of playing sport on stolen land and how this complicates questions of identity around sport, who plays it, and where. ""Thus, Personal Score is also a meditation on Indigenous connections to place and land, examining the earliest sports played here and paying tribute to influential First Nations sportspeople."" It's a particularly timely work in light of recent discourses around the inclusion of trans women in Australian sport. In No Limits, van Neerven hands the microphone to the LGBTQIA+ people that recent debate has talked largely around, but rarely to, about their experiences — a majority of whom participate and will be affected at the community level. Like the author, each of the interviewees reflects on their childhoods and the role of sport in their social, physical and psychological lives. Maddee played basketball and netball. Zaky was a state representative in badminton. Louis played Aussie rules and became a national champion futsal goalkeeper. But as each of them — including van Neerven — grew older and came to consciousness of their gender identities, some of them undertaking the extensive process of hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgery, their relationship with sport and its communities changed. As strict gender binaries were more heavily enforced, and as cultures of homophobia and transphobia began to manifest in more blatant (and dangerous) ways, they all had times where they quit sport altogether. ""Fewer than 20 per cent of trans people play sport in Australia and even fewer participate in team sport,"" van Neerven writes. ""Often, LGBTIQSB+ children grow up feeling like they don't have a place in sport where they can authentically be themselves without fear of judgement, harassment, abuse, or violence. ""When TGD [trans and gender-diverse] people are denied sport, they miss out on enduring friendships that often transcend many divides. They don't pose a threat to sport, but they are the survivors of vicious transphobic campaigns to exclude them from what is a fundamental human right. ""Colonial gender binaries hold up the Western patriarchy. TGD identities – including sistergirls and brotherboys, pan-First Nations terms that describe some TGD people in Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander communities — don't fit into the rigid colonial understandings of gender. Sistergirls, brotherboys and gender-diverse Aboriginal Australians from around the country have come together in Melbourne to share stories of culture, identity and struggle. ""I have never felt like a girl or a woman. I feel masculine in some ways and feminine in others, as if there are two spirits living within me, harmoniously. ""If sport is 'sex-segregated', heteronormative and explicitly trans-exclusionary, what kind of world is created, violently policed, and upheld? ""These spaces are forceful dystopias, complete departures from the liberated lives our ancestors had."" One of the effects of No Limits, and by extension Personal Score, is that it helps rewrite wider narratives around the realities of trans and gender-diverse people participating in sport. By engaging wholeheartedly with the tangle of the personal and the political, and by giving voice and agency to the most marginalised in the community, van Neerven's writing combats the arguments and assumptions put forward by louder voices elsewhere that contribute to discrimination towards people who sit outside essentialist framings of gender. ""There's so many transphobic pieces in The Australian every month, and they're just about the most marginalised group wanting to participate in sport, but instead they get all this propaganda and there's not much reporting at all on the people who are actually playing the sport,"" van Neerven said. ""The reporting is about whether they should play sport. That's a huge problem. ""We need to reframe this stuff and actually ask athletes themselves what they want to talk about. We never ask sportspeople what narratives they want to tell about themselves; what narratives they want to tell about their broader worlds, you know? ""So when you have journalists and politicians acting in a certain way — that don't bother exploring the nuances or different experiences of something — it's so defeating. ""That's the interesting stuff we've missed out on: people talking about their lives in interesting ways and not further perpetuating stereotypes. ""Australia really uses sport as a propaganda machine to say, 'we're a white nation, we're a patriarchal nation, we're the land of the underdog, the battlers, this and that.' It's really hard to push up against it, but we have to try."" As van Neerven's interviewees explain, gender-non-conforming people and sport do not have to be mutually exclusive. Louis dreams of returning to play futsal in a mixed team after top surgery. Maddee has become a competitive powerlifter. Zaky, for now, simply walks while reflecting on his position on and relationship with Wurundjeri land. It is sport itself, then, that must acknowledge and adapt to the changing face of Australia's communities: to open up, to adjust or to collapse entirely its rigid binary categories in order to become a genuinely diverse, inclusive place. Importantly, No Limits closes with all four voices reflecting on their versions of sport utopias, where ""utopia"" functions as a way of critiquing the current state of things. Despite what feels like insurmountable challenges, there remains a kindling of hope that sport is not so set in its ways that it is incapable of imagining alternatives to the way things have always been. ""[Utopia] would just be where trans people are free to play as the gender that they want to,"" Louis says. ""I don't know whether that means we abolish the gender segregation of sports […] It would just be that women are encouraged to play sport at an early age in the same way men are."" ""Every time you create a gendered structure around the sport, it's going to affect the way that people see themselves and engage in the sport,"" Maddee says. ""They are trying to design a perfect system that works for everyone … that doesn't work because the whole idea of sports being fair in the first place isn't real. ""Most of the time, trans people just want to get out there and exist in a sport and enjoy training. If you can't pause and exist in a moment, there's no point."" Perhaps the most radical and profound sports utopia is the one imagined by Zaky — one in which gender no longer exists. A place of no limits. ""My utopia isn't a trans utopia,"" he says. ""My utopia is a utopia where everyone gets to find pleasure and joy in moving their body, be aggressive and be strong and be together in that space, despite their gender. Which in itself is a trans utopia. It's my utopia and I happen to be trans. This is what I hope for the future."" As van Neerven concludes: ""My utopia looks for a day when TGD people's inclusion in sport is not news and not up for debate, when no one has to fight to have a space and when we move on from reports of inclusion to reports of playing. ""Playing — and living: I insist on doing both.""

""With much sadness, I can confirm that my son, Jethro, has passed away,"" Cave said in a statement. ""We would be grateful for family privacy at this time."" Jethro Lazenby, aged in his 30s, was a model and photographer and had acted in two films in 2007 and 2011. He was Cave's son with model Beau Lazenby.

Susie Cave posted a tribute to Jethro on her Instagram account shortly after the news of his death was made public, simply writing ""Darling Jethro"". In a 2018 letter to a fan, Cave wrote about the grief he felt after Arthur's death. ""I feel the presence of my son, all around, but he may not be there.

240,HOTA's 'surreal' first year in challenging times,arts-culture,"  Gold Coast's HOTA gallery's first year was 'tough' but arts precinct attracts patrons amid council review It has been a ""tough"" and ""surreal"" 12 months for the Gold Coast's Home of the Arts, but the $60.5 million art gallery has experienced a record number of monthly visitors, according to its chief executive. The art gallery, funded by the Gold Coast City Council, is the largest outside of a capital city in Australia. The chief executive of Home of the Arts (HOTA), Criena Gehrke, said opening the gallery in the middle of a pandemic ""was surreal"". ""Behind the scenes it was pretty tough going,"" she said. ""During that period of time there was a great stand-down of our staff because of COVID. ""We were operating on about 10 per cent of the workforce; we had to keep the planning going, there were issues with supply chain, with freight, with getting things into the gallery."" While HOTA's financial performance will break even or see ""a little bit of an operating deficit"" this year, Ms Gehrke says April's visitation numbers reflect the precinct's potential. More than 180,000 people visited the HOTA gallery in the past 12 months, about 31,000 of which attended in April. Last month 8,450 patrons attended HOTA's cinema and almost 15,000 attended live events, including 11,418 at three sold-out concerts at the outdoor stage. While about 14,000 patrons dined at the precinct's hospitality venues, 5,476 people attended HOTA's shop and more than 10,000 visited the markets. ""It was like that moment of, 'Oh, there it is',"" Ms Gehrke said. ""It's been such a tough two-and-a-half years, and this is what this precinct is and can be. ""I think it was pretty well unprecedented anywhere else in Australia that an institution was opening a major cultural asset at that time."" Ms Gehrke said April's visitation numbers aligned with projections made when planning for the gallery began four years ago but that ""it's still been up and down with our visitation over the past 12 months"". ""Over summer with Omicron, we couldn't get artists here; there was a whole range of impacts with our staff getting sick,"" she said. ""We opened Lyrical Landscapes which was the beautiful William Robinson collection of works in August and we were open for a day and then closed down again for two weeks [due to lockdown]."" HOTA has forecast it will end this financial year with a total revenue of $26 million. ""There's a high degree of investment by the City of Gold Coast and the fine ratepayers of the Gold Coast in that,"" Ms Gehrke said. The Gold Coast City Council provided $15.9 million towards operating costs this financial year, according to a HOTA spokesperson. About $10 million in revenue has been raised through ticket sales, fundraising and food and beverage sales. The City of Gold Coast has spent $135 million in capital expenditure for the entire precinct, including the $19.5 million Green Bridge connecting HOTA to Chevon Island. In November, the council resolved to review HOTA after Mayor Tom Tate suggested the management of its $37 million outdoor stage could be outsourced to an external operator, amid concerns it had been under-utilised. ""There's some complexity around an external operator coming in,"" Ms Gehrke said. ""If that was the approach that was decided on, in terms of how you operate a precinct with the gallery going full ball, with the theatres full, with the car parking, with the operational overlay"". ""When you think about the last two years ... it just hasn't been possible to have that level of gigs,"" she said. ""But when you think back to April, we've had three sold-out gigs; we've got pencil bookings for gigs coming up right through the year. ""I do think that space is well utilised but, as I say, we welcome any alternate options because all we're interested in is the success of HOTA."" Council considered phase one of the confidential review during a closed meeting last week. It resolved that ""the City chief executive officer be approved to engage a consultant (if required) to provide further advice"" on the future operating model of HOTA, ""with the outcomes of any consultancy to be considered at a future council meeting"". Councillors also resolved that HOTA funding requests for capital works or exhibitions be submitted via a new licence agreement ""which includes the submission of a full business case"". Mr Tate says while ""they've [HOTA] gone from nothing in the same time of having COVID inhibit all gatherings"", his main concern ""is where do we go from here?"". ""How do we encourage HOTA to be a bit more evolved as far as exhibitions [are] concerned?"" he said. ""The numbers show that people are coming, especially locals.

241,Indigenous sisters' fashion dreams come true with Vogue feature and runway plans,arts-culture,"  Indigenous sisters' dreams come true with Myrrdah label launch, Vogue feature, and Fashion Week plans Being on the cover of Vogue magazine has always been the dream for Kalkadoon sisters Dale Bruce, Cheryl Perez, Glenda McCulloch and Jaunita Doyle. ""There was an Instagram filter where you could put yourself on the cover of Vogue and we would always play around with it and joke,"" Glenda said. ""Since forever — that's how long it's been our dream. We've always wanted to do something with clothes."" Just months after launching their fashion label Myrrdah, the sisters pried open the glossy pages of Vogue's 2022 May issue to see their designs featured in the main spread. ""I just think it's ridiculous,"" Glenda said. ""We can't believe how quickly this has all happened. This is our first crack at anything fashion and to start off our label by featuring in one of the biggest fashion magazines in the country … it's mind blowing."" The sisters' success didn't stop there. This week, they will watch their designs walk down the runway at Australian Fashion Week in Sydney. ""I mean, we must be doing something right,"" Glenda said. ""I just can't believe how far we've come."" As descendants of the Kalkatunga tribe, the red-dirt land of Mount Isa, Queensland, has always been an important part of the sisters' lives and something that feeds their creativity. Their journey to fashion design began with their love of art. In 2019, Glenda founded Cungelella Art to share her culture with the rest of the world. ""We've always painted. Our parents, our uncles and aunties always went bush and painted artefacts,"" she said. ""When the Black Lives Matter movement reached Australia, the interest in our art just skyrocketed."" It was their mum who inspired them to make the leap into fashion. ""Our mum is our biggest advocate. She was always telling us we could do the fashion thing if we tried and she was a really good seamstress, so she was always helping us,"" Glenda said. ""She showed us how to pick which artworks would do well on fabric."" So in 2020, the sisters launched Myrrdah, named in honour of their great great grandmother of the same name. Starting a fashion label during a lockdown wasn't easy, the sisters said. ""We couldn't actually visit Melbourne where our designs were being processed onto fabric, so we had to collaborate through Pinterest boards and text messages to actually produce the pieces for Vogue and [fashion week],"" Jaunita said. Some preconceived assumptions about the glamour of the fashion world were certainly quashed. ""If anyone's seen our set-ups, they wouldn't believe we're fashion designers,"" Jaunita laughed. ""We're usually working at 11 o'clock at night. The kids are still awake running around, fighting around us as we're drinking tea."" When they watch their custom pieces float down the runway this week, it will be the first time they will see their work up close. ""We haven't actually touched the fabric yet,"" Jaunita said. Regardless, the sisters aren't letting anything stop them from launching their debut collection this month. But they say customers will have to beat their mum to some of the prized pieces. ""We've told her the collection is quite limited but she's already claimed she's getting her hands on some of the pieces, so good luck to anyone going up against her,"" Jaunita laughed. Glenda said it would be an emotional experience. ""All our pieces are a representation of Mount Isa and our homeland. It's the story of the country out here,"" she said. ""We're lost for words at the chance to share our culture with the rest of the country."" ABC North West Qld will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday.

243,Tasmania's modernist architecture captured by photographer,arts-culture,"  Tasmania's Art Deco, modernist architecture captured by photographer Thomas Ryan Tasmania's modern architecture is often overlooked, but one man has spent the past 20 years taking a step back and appreciating it. From the brutalism of buildings like Launceston's Henty House and Hobart's former Murray Street offices to quirky suburban Art Deco, Thomas Ryan has been capturing the art movement of modernism through his lens. The visual artist and architectural photographer documents everyday modernism and tells the stories behind the buildings. ""I'm trying to create a human angle that people can connect to,"" Mr Ryan said. ""I often think a photo can't save a building but it's a driving obsession and it becomes a visual memory of place."" He interviews people who have connections with buildings and has befriended some of the architects behind them, like the late Dirk Bolt who designed Hobart's 10 Murray Street government offices He also befriended the foreman of the demolition project. ""I got inside when they were literally ripping it to shreds,"" Mr Ryan said. Mr Ryan aims to tell all angles of a building's story and wants to celebrate and protect the era of design through his project Tasmanian Modernism. ""Tasmania is associated with its rich trove of heritage buildings and history but there is a long way to go in terms of protecting these buildings for future generations,"" he said. ""There is a larger appreciation and protection of Art Deco buildings now, but modernist designs throughout Tasmania are lacking in listing and are at risk of being lost."" Mr Ryan said it wasn't long ago that Art Deco buildings weren't in vogue and were threatened with demolition. ""Modernism now faces many of these same historical issues that buildings of the past faced,"" he said. ""What we see today as history and heritage will change over time so it’s important to see heritage as more than just sandstone."" Mr Ryan's project includes the Art Deco movement, which in Tasmania represents the period of design between 1930 and 1945, which was later than the European movement. Modernism is the period after World War II and continued well into the 1980s. ""Within modernism, there are all kinds of different styles like mid-century modern, brutalism; they all sit within that context,"" Mr Ryan said. ""The Art Deco movement focused on decoration and ornamental qualities such as the former Hydro Electric Commission headquarters and the modernist movement stripped decoration from buildings."" The modernism design principle was ""form follows function"", Mr Ryan said. He said there were many excellent examples of Art Deco in Tasmania, pointing to Holyman House in Launceston and the Colonial Mutual Life building with its gargoyles and terracotta detailing in Hobart's CBD. ""Modernist examples include the State Library in Hobart from the 1960s with its glass curtain wall panels,"" he said. ""The latter part of the 20th century witnessed design influences shift to experimenting with concrete."" Examples include buildings such as the Lands Building in Hobart, Don College in Devonport and Henty House in Launceston. ""Henty House is still one of my favourite buildings; it's so sculptural, it's like abstract art,"" Mr Ryan said. The Supreme Court in Hobart was designed by the same Tasmanian architect, Peter Partridge. Mr Ryan has been working on the modernism project for 20 years and aims to have his work made into a book. He thinks his passion for the era stems from growing up in Far North Queensland before moving to Tasmania. ""Looking back, I was probably homesick, and you familiarise yourself with what you remember and know, and a lot of those kind of buildings were in north Queensland,"" he said. It wasn't Tasmania's historic sandstone buildings that caught his eye. ""A lot was done of that earlier architecture period, but I grew up with this other period of architecture and it's part of my story,"" Mr Ryan said. ""The more you looked into it historically, it was such a boom period. ""It all really took off post war and with immigration and it's a unique story to be told and it hasn't been looked at much before."" Mr Ryan said the 1936 Star Theatre in Launceston was a great example of streamline Art Deco. ""It had a relatively short life as a cinema, closing its doors in 1969 just 33 years after it started showing its first movies,"" he said. ""Many cinemas struggled to stay open due to the advent of television."" He said Launceston lost a grand Art Deco theatre to the wrecking ball in the 1960s, and many others around Australia met with the same fate. ""The Star operated as a charity shop for decades afterwards until in 2018 it was reopened as a cinema again,"" Mr Ryan said. ""With its recent reopening as a cinema, it's a case of back to the future for the Star.""

244,"Richard Connolly, who composed the Play School theme song, dies aged 94",arts-culture,"  Richard Connolly, who composed the Play School theme song, dies aged 94 Richard Connolly, one of Australia's most prolific composers, has died aged 94. Connolly is best known for writing the theme song for the children's show Play School, as well as an internationally renowned collection of hymns. His iconic tune to the long-running series was written overnight while Connolly was working for ABC Education. Connolly's version, in which he also sang the lyrics by early childhood educator Dr Rosemary Milne, debuted on July 18, 1966. There's a Bear in There has been re-recorded several times, most recently in 2016 as part of a triple j competition to mark the TV show's 50th anniversary. But Connolly's original tune remains at the heart of the song, making it one of Australia's best known anthems. Born on November 10, 1927 in the Western Sydney suburb of Granville, Connolly was the eldest of eight children. A talented young boy who spoke Latin, he was earmarked early on to become a Catholic priest. In 1946, he left the shores of New South Wales to study at the prestigious seminary Propaganda Fide in Rome. He returned four years later unordained, instead choosing to study arts at the University of Sydney. Connolly's passion for theology led him to his career at the ABC, where he started work in religious broadcasts in 1956. There he became a go-to man for music, composing extensively for radio and TV programs, as well as Australian documentaries and film. His daughter, Polly Connolly, said one afternoon he was asked to write the theme song for a new kids TV show, Play School. ""He basically came home and banged it out and had to record it the next day,"" she told the ABC. ""When I was a little girl, my mum would call me and my little sister inside and say 'come and listen to daddy sing'."" Play School debuted on ABC TV on the morning of Monday, July 18, 1966 with presenters Alister Smart and Diane Dorgan. The show has outlived the BBC version it was based on, and is now the second-longest-running English-language children's show worldwide. Dr Milne, the lyricist for There's a Bear in There, also wrote the show's first scripts. She died of cancer in 2010 aged 83. Her and Connolly's song was inducted into the National Film and Sound Archive Sounds of Australia collection in 2017. The collection represents audio that has ""cultural, historical and aesthetic significance and relevance, which inform or reflect life in Australia"". Connolly last performed the song for ABC TV show Gruen in 2020. Libbie Doherty, ABC Head of Children's Production, said Connolly left behind a legacy ""like no other"". ""Over the past 57 years, countless generations of Australian children have heard and sung Connolly's Play School theme song There's a Bear in There that continues to inspire preschoolers for years to come,"" Doherty said. Despite its notoriety, the Play School theme was not the music Connolly was most proud of creating. In the late 1950s, Connolly partnered with Tasmanian poet James McAuley to create a collection of hymns in English. At the time, the Catholic church was struggling to transition away from singing exclusively in Latin as the new music did not sit well with parishioners. ""There was literally, for about 20 years, a worldwide shortage of suitable music for the Catholic mass,"" said Noel Debien, family friend and ABC Religion and Ethics senior specialist producer. ""It was pop music basically, and there were a lot of people who didn't want pop music in church, they thought that belonged in concerts. ""And Richard and James gave them a way to have something that was in English — they could go to the new music, but the new music was quality."" The songs, which went on to be sold as the Living Parish Hymn Book, took off across the country and overseas. ""Anywhere English is spoken, you'll find Richard's hymns,"" Mr Debien said. Daughter Polly said other than his nine children, her father felt the hymns were his greatest work. ""Anybody who went to Catholic school in the 70s, 80s, 90s, has sung dad's hymns,"" she said. ""There are many of dad's kids that aren't practising Catholics anymore, but we're so proud of his music; some of them are really beautiful."" Connolly also composed the music for the 1970 visit of Pope Paul VI, the first Pope to visit Australia, and again for the visit of Pope Benedict XVI in 2008. The Catholic church was not the only institution Connolly helped navigate through difficult times. In 1967, he joined Radio Drama and Features at the ABC at a time when audiences were switching off. Having studied broadcasters in France, Italy and Germany as part of the Churchill Fellowship in 1971, Connolly returned to transform the department into a ""creative powerhouse"", friend and former colleague Roz Cheney said. ""One of Dick's great legacies is that he turned ABC Radio, at that time, towards Europe and away from the Anglo-domination of the BBC,"" she said. ""New ways were found to broadcast wonderful programs that acknowledged other languages and other cultures. ""We were hired by Dick to go into the future."" As head of the department, Connolly oversaw the broadcast of radio plays and book reviews, as well as the reading of epic poems including Aeneid and Beowulf. ""There was not the dead hand of serious dullness on them — they were very lively and energetic,"" Ms Cheney said. ""He was an inspiring producer."" Polly said her father ""lived and breathed the ABC"" — and rugby league team the Western Suburbs Magpies. ""It really was an amazing thing to be at Lidcombe Oval with my dad in the '70s, all us kids, while he'd be roaring for the Magpies,"" she said. ""Literally the next week he'd be in the old radio Forbes Street studios recording the finest international radio programs in Latin."" Connolly retired in 1988 and spent the last few years of his life at Alexander Aged Care in Brookvale, NSW. He died on May 4, and is survived by his wife Cynthia and his nine children. His funeral will be held at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney on May 19.

245,'He's always changing': Nick Cave and Warren Ellis are subjects of joyous new music documentary,arts-culture,"  Nick Cave and Warren Ellis documentary This Much I Know to Be True reunites Bad Seeds collaborators with director Andrew Dominik There is a scene in the new documentary about Nick Cave that neatly sums up the artist's outlook on life. Prevented from touring while in lockdown in Brighton, England, Cave embraced a new-found pastime after the British government obtusely pushed artists to retrain. ""I took the government's advice. I've retrained as a ceramicist, because it's no longer viable to be a touring artist,"" Cave quips to camera. Cut to the musician, author, occasional actor and now-ceramicist's studio, featuring his latest creation: a series of figures suitably dark and foreboding, which he christened The Life of the Devil. Cutting humour aside, the man we see in Andrew Dominik's new film, This Much I Know to Be True, is a radically different beast to the tortured soul of One More Time with Feeling – the director's haunting 2016 document of Cave trying to navigate his way through immense grief in the wake of his son Arthur's sudden, shocking death. Insisting on completing a then-new album with his band of nearly 40 years, the Bad Seeds, Cave seemed like an artist hanging by a thread. Although Dominik's direction in 2022 isn't radically different – both films were shot in the round with a circular dolly track following the musicians as they perform – this new documentary is awash with colour (rather than its predecessor's stark black and white palette). It is often joyous, laced with wit. Only one figure from the Bad Seeds, Warren Ellis, is present, together with an array of supporting figures, the most notable of which is a brief appearance from guest performer Marianne Faithfull. ""For me, it was about the songs,"" Dominik says of his film. This Much I Know to Be True showcases Cave's most recent music (2019 Bad Seeds record Ghosteen and Cave and Ellis's 2021 album Carnage), which is carefully rehearsed, performed and expounded upon in the film. The concert-without-an-audience is presented in a bespoke, cinematic setting – a deserted performance space in Battersea in south London – with 7.1 surround sound. The cumulative effect is breathtaking, with a stripped-down sense of purpose that belies a quietly assured and apt grandiosity. ""I've been there when the songs were created and they meant something to me,"" Dominik says. ""So when they were due to go out on tour, I said, 'Let's shoot a live show. Get the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, lots of screens.' They were going to have 12 backup singers."" That tour was cancelled — no guesses why. ""And then Nick just asked me [to film]. He just needed to do something during the pandemic, basically. That was the sort of impetus – the main motive, really."" The tour that Cave and Ellis conceived last year did eventually appear, albeit in a somewhat scaled-down form, playing to rave notices across Europe and the US – and soon, Australia – making Dominik's film timelier than he may have foreseen. Not that any of the key players have had much time to pause between gigs. Dominik's next dramatic film, the much-anticipated Netflix biopic Blonde, which stars Cuban actor Ana de Armas as screen goddess Marilyn Monroe, is also due to finally appear later in the year, with an original score by Cave and Ellis. What makes the pair's working relationship so unique? Each has a vastly different approach, Dominik says. Cave's precision is matched by Ellis's seemingly random, endless, stream-of-consciousness output. Together, it works remarkably well. ""It's a lot about Nick trying to get Warren's attention. That's what Nick describes it as,"" Dominik says. ""Warren's very good with Nick. I don't know if Warren makes music every day, but he makes so much [of it]. And he just keeps going, you know. It really forces you to be there in a way where you get lost in it."" Dominik's working relationship with the pair dates back to his 2007 revisionist western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (a three-hour director's cut of which is also expected to emerge at some point). By then, Cave and Ellis had expanded their repertoire to become full-blown film composers for hire, and Dominik has evidently grown closer to them both in the years since, particularly in the wake of the tumultuous events of the last seven years. The Cave he now knows is drastically different from the man he met in the late 80s when they were both part of the Melbourne arts scene. ""The first time I met Nick was at a drug dealer's. I was just an innocent private school boy trying to get a heroin habit,"" Dominik says with a wry smile. ""It was around [the Bad Seeds' album] Tender Prey [in 1988]. I walk in and the Prince of Darkness was sitting on the couch, watching a documentary about earthworms. And I ask him, 'What are you watching?' And he just turned around and bared his teeth at me, with his wild hair and crazy eyes, and growled. He's changed incredibly, from the guy on the couch to who he is today."" Cave has also moved on considerably from their last documentary encounter in 2016 – something Dominik wanted to capture on film. Looking remarkably well-preserved, Cave is more holistic about his place in the world. ""He's the only person who's had a career like this, right?"" Dominik muses. ""At 60-whatever-he-is, he's more successful now than he's ever been – like every record sells double the previous record. ""I think he's got a lot of good attitudes about stuff. He's honest and he's always changing. I'm sure he goes through periods when he gets a bit calcified or something, but something will happen to move him out of it. He always seems to be evolving. And everything he says is incredibly sane. Like, really sane."" This Much I Know to Be True is in cinemas from May 11. Tops Arts & Culture headlines.

247,Mystery behind the political names on this 113yo tea cloth,arts-culture,"  Queensland Museum gifted tea cloth signed by prominent federal, state politicians A tea cloth embroidered with the signatures of more than 60 politicians from the early 1900s has prompted a nationwide search for the people and history behind the names. Complete with mended holes and small kitchen stains, historians believe the 113-year-old linen tea cloth shows the names of both federal and state members stitched around the signature of former Labor prime minister Andrew Fisher. The years ""1909"" and ""1915"" have been embroidered on either side – the years Mr Fisher was in government. Queensland Museum curator Judith Hickson hopes the public can help them unearth the stories behind the tea cloth puzzle, especially four signatures on the towel yet to be identified. ""Even the ones we've deciphered have been very tricky, it's been luck and searching through lists of parliamentary names,"" she says. ""We have two J Macdonalds, but the only J Macdonald we can currently identify is a JV Macdonald who was a former senator at the time. ""The other we think reads JS Macdonald but we're not sure and we can't find anything on this J Macdonald in the parliamentary records, so we don't know who he is."" The other mystery signature is Mr John Christie, who could have had one of three occupations. ""The only records we can find on him are those of a journalist, detective or a murderer — he could have been all three,"" Ms Hickson says. ""We would really love it if someone could shed some light on that as well."" With the help of some budding investigators from the public, the museum recently resolved the signatures of WJ Henry and NX Henry to be William James and Nora Xavier Henry. ""Apparently William James was a police sergeant and a member of the Queensland Police Union at the time and there are records of him and his wife Nora being buried in the Toowong Cemetery,"" Ms Hickson says. The cloth was embroidered by Beatrice Ferricks in the early 1900s; her husband Myles was a Labor party member at the time. ""It's been well used, mended, slightly stained and worn from use before being folded and put away in the cupboard — it's certainly had a place in the home,"" Ms Hickson says. ""It's the size of a card table and I imagine it would have been a great point of discussion for visitors to the Ferricks home."" The tea cloth was recently donated to the Queensland Museum by Beatrice's granddaughter Ruth, along with a black lace dress the family believes she wore to political functions as it was her only ""good dress"". ""Ruth received the items from her mother Dr Ellen Fraser who became very well known as a medical doctor and passed the items onto her when she passed away,"" Ms Hickson says. ""We know very little about Beatrice, but we do think this shows she was politically engaged and supportive of her husband. ""We often know little about the wives of male politicians; they were very much in the background of their public lives, and it was like this for Beatrice."" Ms Hickson believes the cloth would not have been preserved without the women and wants to pay tribute to them for preserving the story. ""Really it's a women's story as the cloth has been passed down by these women and we wouldn't have this story without them, it's allowed us to see these stories with fresh eyes,"" she says. ""It's been so interesting going back and looking at the members of the time and what they were known for – hopefully we'll be able to solve the mystery of the remaining names.""

249,How people like 101-year-old Effie helped make Victoria 'the heart' of the Greek-Australian community,arts-culture,"  Melbourne Museum celebrates Victoria's rich Hellenic heritage with new exhibition After almost 80 years, a blanket handmade by a then-teenage Effie Spiropoulos still looks as bright as ever. It's a good thing — creating the masterpiece was arduous work, carried out by the light of an oil lamp in a small village in Greece. Effie's daughter Stavroula Spiropoulos said the wool was spun locally, and the dyes dependent on what was at hand, including ""beetroot, onion or walnut husk"". If Effie wanted a particular colour she couldn't make herself, she might make the three-hour walk to the nearest town to try and source it. Only able to weave a piece of cloth as wide as the loom it was on, Effie made two pieces before carefully stitching them together as part of her dowry. When the family of nine migrated to Australia in the 1960s and settled in the Melbourne suburb of Fawkner, the priceless family heirloom came with them. Stavroula, one of Effie's seven children, said it had been carefully looked after ever since. ""Every year with my mum and my sisters we'd air it out and we'd look at it and we'd wonder how this lovely lady with hardly anything from the shops created this,' she said. ""Our precious blanket means so much because it reminds us of my mum and the youth that she had which was filled with difficulty, poverty and hard times and yet she was still able to create and make something beautiful."" A photo of Effie holding the vivid red covering in her Fawkner garden is now on display as part of the museum's Open Horizons exhibition, and the blanket itself has been donated to the museum as well. More than 40 ancient Greek sculptures, bronzes and other precious items — such as a 2,500-year-old sphinx which had never before left Greece, and a colossal head of Zeus standing three-quarters of a metre high — are on show, highlighting themes of culture and connection. Organisers said the exhibition was scheduled for last year to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the Greek War of Independence, but COVID saw those plans scrapped. Now that it's open, they are hopeful that by looking to the past, people can have a better understanding of the present. ""There's a lot of connection that can be found between people, whether that's 50 years ago, or whether that's 3,000 years ago,"" Museums Victoria director of exhibitions and audience experiences Linda Sproul said. Greece's National Archaeology Museum's director Anna Vasiliki Karapanagiotou said the works ""tell us many short histories about ancient Greek journeys around the Mediterranean world"", as well as demonstrating the influence they have had on the country's culture. Dr Vasiliki Karapanagiotou said Victoria's large Greek population made it the natural home for the exhibition. ""[The] Melbourne community is a very Greek community, a very vibrant community, and Victoria is the heart of the Greek-Australian community,"" she said. Australia has the third-largest Greek diaspora in the world, with half of the country's close to 100,000 Greek-born residents calling Victoria home. And when officials put a call-out to the local community for photos depicting their own journeys across continents and generations, more than 200 images were sent in. ""We were amazed,"" Ms Sproul said. ""We've got a multimedia display at the end of the exhibition where people have submitted images, and we have themed them across the areas of love, life and work."" Now nearing 102, Effie's life has spanned multiple wars, pandemics and the Great Depression. Stavroula said she would often ask her mother to tell her about her youth, ""and she'd go 'Stavroula, all I remember is work. From the moment we get up to the moment we sleep … it was work, work, work'."" She credited Melbourne's burgeoning Greek community with helping to give her and her siblings a place to belong after arriving from Greece in 1964. ""At school … they couldn't say my name, Stavroula Spiropoulos, it was all Jones and Smith, they tried to change my name,"" she said. ""We stuck together because we couldn't understand … we had a wonderful community."" Despite the difficulties, Stavroula said her mother thrived in her new life -- without forgetting where she came from. ""Even to this day she says Australia is paradise and the best country in the world. But she did also say that Greece is in our heart, and in every fibre of our being,"" she said. ""She's got 22 grandchildren and 30 great-grandchildren and they all call Fawkner home because that is the heart that draws us there. ""As long as mum is there, that's where we all go."" The Spiropoulos family said they were proud to contribute their own piece of very personal Greek-Australian history, donating their mother's blanket to the Melbourne Museum's collection. ""It's survived because when you have very little you treasure what you have,"" she said. ""It gave me great joy that I could share it with the world and mum's legacy could live on.""

253,"After 89 years, it's hoped this worn out yellow Caterpillar can be brought back to life   ",arts-culture,"  Rare K'gari (Fraser Island) relic returns to mainland 89 years after production One of K'gari's (Fraser Island's) iconic relics has been returned to the mainland and put on display at its new home in Hervey Bay. The 89-year-old Caterpillar Diesel Thirty-Five crawler tractor was unveiled at the Hervey Bay Historical Village and Museum today. Only 1,999 of the Cat 35s were manufactured in the early 1930s. At the time of production, it was the first machine to don the iconic 'caterpillar high-way yellow' paint schemes and it's believed to have been the second diesel offering from the manufacturer. President Greg Jacobsen said the machine would become a showpiece at the village. ""It spent all its life hauling logs from Urang Creek to Garry's Anchorage area,"" he said. ""It was retired in 1964 and after a restoration it was handed over to the forestry department in 1994. ""It's been on display up until recently at Central Station."" All five tonnes of the Cat 35 were floated up to K'gari from Brisbane by Richard Smith in 1935, where he began logging trees with his employee and eventual successor Andrew Postan, Senior, who bought the business in 1940. Mr Postan became the sole logging contractor on the Island and continued harvesting trees with the Cat 35. Nearly 90 years on, volunteers at the Historical Village and Museum say the piece of machinery holds significant heritage value. Mr Jacobsen said they were very fortunate to become the beneficiary and custodian of the machine. ""At the time of production, it was probably a step up from the alternative which was probably ox wagons or logging trucks,"" ""They would have thought that it was very innovative in the 30s and being a Caterpillar, it's just gone on and on. ""Our aim is to bring that back up to working condition. We're critically short on two major components – magneto and a carby off the little pilot motor that goes on the machine to start the big diesel motor. ""But we will source those and once we do we'll have that machine up and running. ""It will be a little project but we're determined to get it up and running."" Historical Village and the Museum volunteer Dennis Ross-Jones said the restoration of the machine could take time. ""It was used for logging up until 1964 when logging seized on K'gari,"" he said. ""The trouble is it's been sitting there for 40-odd years and it's starting to rust and falling apart. ""One of the things that was happening was the creek water went into it and there is a lot of sand in the creek water, ""There is fine sand that's in the motor so we've got to flush all that out. ""Queensland Parks and Wildlife have given it to us with the idea that we will get it going and keep it going. ""It was a struggle to get it across from the Island without damaging anything. ""At least its here now and we can look after it and keep it for future generations.""

""I wanted to give something to the town that would give me a lot of peace and happiness,"" Mr Wright says, becoming emotional as he recalls the debate. ""And I don't think everyone wanted to accept the gift."" The controversial Water Cloud sculpture has been installed in the main street of the NSW Mid North Coast town after more than eight years of planning. West Australian sculptor Stuart Green designed the work to reflect the essence of the town that has an average annual rainfall of 2,000 millimetres and is known for its World Heritage-listed national parks, rolling waterfalls and lush dairy pastures. The aluminium curves form the shape of a never-ending stream of water that lights up as the sun sets. In 2014 the local council adopted a community public art plan to ""enliven"" towns across the Bellingen Shire, prompting Mr Wright, 82, a local for 20 years, to donate the $300,000 sculpture as a way of giving back to the community. ""I lived on the northern side of town. Whenever I came in, I'd have to cross the bridge and look at the park down along the bank and thought, 'Wouldn't it be nice to see a sculpture there?'"" Mr Wright says. But Mr Wright would soon find out how art can divide opinion. The proposal garnered plenty of debate: from talk in the town to online chatter in community groups. Local Kerry Miller says the artwork has ""ripped the town in half"". ""There are people who are disgusted, you've got people on Facebook yelling at each other. The comments are endless,"" she says. ""Really, more options should have been explored before we made a firm decision. ""My husband drives a truck. He often carts heavy machinery and was able to use this street before, but now with this sculpture in the way, he's not able to access the street anymore."" When Bellingen Shire Council ran a poll during the initial community consultation, nearly 80 per cent of responses were against its installation. Some of the feedback was that the art would be an ""eyesore"" and ""impractical"" for the main strip. Many residents also said it did not reflect the nature of the town. But after it was revealed the initial online portal had received responses from people who didn't live in Dorrigo, the council asked Mr Wright to conduct a second survey himself. That survey returned 177 votes for the artwork and 174 against. Mayor Steve Allan maintains the work went through extensive processes before final approval. ""It is fair to say with any piece of public art, it would have its opposition, but when you think about it, it really does speak to the beautiful natural attributes that Dorrigo is known for including our beautiful waterfalls,"" Mr Allan says. Despite the controversy, some locals believe the sculpture will encourage tourists to stay longer when visiting the town. Rowan Holden, who has lived in Dorrigo for the past 30 years, was initially hesitant about the work, but says he is ""trying to keep an open mind"". ""I didn't think it followed the character of the town but we'll see now it's going up, how it looks,"" he says. ""I'm not sure about the lighting aspect of it."" Sara Hankin, on the other hand, believes the new landmark adds a spark to the town. ""I think it's fantastic! It's an old town, has been old for a very long time, so it's just the change that we need."" Sculptor Stuart Green emphasises the positives. ""I know change is always a bit scary and not everyone is in favour of it, but when you see it in actuality, it is this exciting and different focal point in the centre of town"", he said. ""Nick has given something to the community that is, in its essence, trying to help the town, and that's something positive."" The sculpture has been installed this week, and visitors may now make their own judgement. Mr Wright hopes the town will grow to accept his gift. ""I now think that probably the majority of the town want it, I hope they do,"" he says. ""There are some that don't. Some for good reasons and they're entitled to that.""
