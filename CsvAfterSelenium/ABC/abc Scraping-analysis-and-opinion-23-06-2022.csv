0,"analysis: America is standing on the precipice of monumental change, and there are fears it could lead to violence",analysis-and-opinion,"  The US Supreme Court's monumental decisions loom over America this June. Will it lead to violence? As the weather warms up in the United States with the arrival of summer, the relentless grind of school and work slows down. The gentler pace of June also affects the business of government. Congress will soon take a month-long break, with even President Joe Biden expected to spend occasional long weekends at his beach house in Delaware. But as many Americans plan holidays and barbecues, some feel an impending sense of doom. The US Supreme Court, on deadline to get 13 decisions off its docket before breaking for the season, is poised to dramatically reshape American life, potentially for decades. Two decisions in particular — one on the future of abortion access and the other on gun rights — are being keenly watched. Meanwhile, a House committee investigating the January 6 riot is putting pressure on the Department of Justice to potentially charge Donald Trump with a crime. But even that may not stop the former US president from announcing another bid for the White House within weeks. Whether Trump runs again or not, he has already left an indelible mark on American society. His legacy in the Supreme Court could soon be felt. And, as temperatures rise in America's capital, so too do political tensions. This series of fraught decisions and announcements could be enough to unleash another summer of violence and dissent. The US Supreme Court has been sitting for more than two centuries, retaining its quaint traditions and its cloak of secrecy. When the justices meet at the bench to hear a case, they begin their day with what's called a ""judicial handshake"" — a symbol of their unity, even when they disagree on points of law. While that tradition might continue, the court itself has never seemed so divided and its standing with part of the American community so uneasy. During his time in the White House, Mr Trump was able to install three judges to the nine-person bench, dramatically shifting the ideological balance of the highest court in the land. Now that conservative super-majority will determine the fate of two of the most vexing issues in American life: abortion and guns. As soon as tomorrow, the court could strike down a century-old restriction on carrying concealed firearms in New York. Depending on the reasoning underpinning the decision, it could mean that states can only restrict gun ownership in the most limited of cases. At the same time, the Senate is making headway on negotiations to strengthen federal gun-safety laws. The bill could be knocked out even before it reaches a vote. Since an extraordinary leak of a Supreme Court draft decision in May, the most highly — or fearfully — anticipated ruling is on abortion access. Here's what we know about a leaked bombshell document about the US Supreme Court's plans for America's abortion law. Unless multiple justices have had a major change of heart, they are expected to overturn decades of precedent by arguing there is no constitutional right to an abortion. If that happens, the court will return to the states the power to determine whether — and under what circumstances — abortion should or should not be legal. For some Americans, such as those in the anti-abortion movement, the possibility of such colossal social change is cause for celebration. But for others, it represents a devastating backslide into an earlier, more dangerous era. Support for abortion in the US varies from state to state. But at a national level, a 61 per cent majority of American adults say it should be legal in all or most cases. The position that Americans take on gun regulation is far murkier: Polls show a majority of adults support some tighter measures, but the percentage has fallen since the early 1990s, despite an increasing number of mass shootings. It's clear that, after the recent massacre at a Texas primary school — which left 19 children and two teachers dead — Americans are currently ready for change. On face value, the two decisions appear contradictory. If, as expected, the court overturns the earlier Roe v Wade abortion ruling, it will effectively be saying abortion rights can be determined by individual states, passing more power back to state-level officials. But in the New York gun case — which comes soon after another recent mass shooting in the state's city of Buffalo — the court may well strip states of the power to limit gun ownership, finding that such laws run afoul of the Second Amendment. The consistency is ideological, however. Through a conservative lens, the right to bear arms is explicitly stated in the constitution, whereas the right to an abortion is based on an implied right to privacy, as interpreted by a progressive slate of justices in the 1970s. If the current justices claim their predecessors erred, thereby toppling nearly 50 years of abortion access, it may raise questions about the court's authority. The Supreme Court is not an elected body. It is meant to sit above the chaos of Congress and the White House, and act as a custodian of the Bill of Rights. But as late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg often said: ""The Court should never be influenced by the weather of the day, but inevitably they will be influenced by the climate of the era."" The US political system is meant to allow people to elect representatives who best represent their values when deciding laws. Supreme Court justices are then appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to set the framework in which those laws operate. But the system is imperfect, with the makeup of the electoral college often determining who becomes President, sometimes without a majority of the overall votes. Mr Trump was able to choose three members of the current nine-member court, despite receiving fewer votes than Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. His lifelong appointments were approved by senators who, at that time, represented less than half the country's population. As it currently stands, the Senate is split 50-50, with Democrats representing 41.5 million more people than their Republican colleagues. Mr Trump was not the first Republican president to understand the transformative power of selecting Supreme Court justices aligned with his worldview. Former president Richard Nixon nominated six justices during his time in office, four of whom were confirmed in the Senate. He arguably fulfilled his campaign promise to fill the bench with ""caretakers of the constitution and servants of the people, not super-legislators"". But the project he started, carried on by his party over decades, didn't reach fruition until Justice Ginsburg's death and the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett just weeks before a new president entered the Oval Office. The fourth of Trump's picks, rushed through in the upheaval of an election campaign, cemented the court's current ideological bent. It also led to accusations from Democrats and others that the court has been unfairly stacked with conservatives who don't represent the will of the people. Far from being an impartial caretaker, the Supreme Court is now more often seen as a powerful political tool to be won and wielded. It is also the battleground for many of America's most-heated debates. When the draft ruling overturning Roe v Wade was leaked, those for and against abortion rights quickly gathered outside the court, where barriers were erected within minutes. The protests were rowdy but, for the most part, peaceful. But elsewhere some have already taken their dismay in a more dangerous direction. The organisation Ruth Sent Us — which has been criticised for taking Justice Ginsburg's name — posted the addresses of the current justices online, making them open targets for harassment. Earlier this month, a 26-year-old Californian man was arrested close to the Maryland home of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. When arrested, he was carrying a Glock pistol, zip ties, pepper spray and a tactical knife. He has since been charged with attempted murder. The case is emblematic of the deep distrust and anger building towards the Supreme Court for decisions it has made or will likely make soon. High fences around the building provide a neat metaphor for the growing chasm between the institution and those whose rights it is meant to protect. All nine justices have received beefed-up security as they clear a backlog of cases in a final flurry before the summer break. And the decisions will not be handed down in a vacuum. The House committee investigating the January 6 riot at the Capitol is currently holding a series of public hearings, reminding Americans how close violence came to the heart of their democracy only slightly more than a year ago. It was the culmination of an attempt to overturn a legal election, fuelled by the falsehood of widespread election fraud. The fury of the mob was fomented by someone who told them power was being stolen from them. Right now, some Americans believe their rights are being taken from them.

2,"analysis: Why it's time for Samoa, rugby league's sleeping giant, to awaken from its slumber",analysis-and-opinion," Sport As Samoa looks to begin again, it's time for rugby league's sleeping giant to awaken The return of international rugby league after almost three years lost to COVID-19 has given everybody a fresh start, and nobody needs one more than the proud men from Samoa. On a weekend where their Pacific rivals Tonga will take on New Zealand in Auckland in what is a true clash of two Test footy titans, Samoa will once again be trying to start something up when they face the Cook Islands on Saturday in Campbelltown. There is a path where Samoa end up joining Tonga alongside Australia, New Zealand and England as one of the sport's top level sides – but for it to happen, rugby league's sleeping giant will need to awaken. And with Samoa playing host nation England in the World Cup opener at season's end, there is no better time than right now for the tide to turn. ""You just have to see what the Tongans have done for their team to see what footy means in the Pacific. We want to do the jersey proud, Samoa is a proud nation and we want to play well for them,"" said halfback Anthony Milford. ""It's a special week. I'm always honoured to put the jersey on and I'm always grateful for the opportunity given to me by (coach) Matty Parish and the coaching staff. I can't wait to represent my people and my family."" Tonga is blessed with an extraordinary crop of talent, headed by Jason Taumalolo. But how does international rugby league's newest powerhouse turn that into a sustainable future? The pandemic years have not been easy for Samoan rugby league, and nor were the seasons that came beforehand. As Tonga shot ahead in the pecking order, the Samoans stagnated. They've won just one of their last nine matches, the last time they troubled one of the big three was back in the 2014 Four Nations, and their last showing was a disaster, a 44-18 belting at the hands of Fiji in November 2019. Over the past few years there's also been bitter backroom infighting with long-time coach Parish coming under fire from players past and present. But Parish, who has coached the side since 2013, survived and has been blessed with a strong crop of up-and-coming talent, even though Samoa is yet to enjoy a Jason Taumalolo-style wave of defections. For Milford, Samoa's longest-serving player after he debuted as an 18-year old nine years ago, this is the biggest change he's seen during his time with the island nation. ""When I first came through I was the youngest, now I'm the last one left from that 2013 World Cup,"" said Milford. ""There's good times ahead, a lot of youth who are putting guys on their toes. It's a luxury, to have that competition and Matty can pick so many top players. ""It makes our nation stronger and harder to play against."" A host of debutants, led by a Penrith contingent of Charlie Staines, Taylan May, Izack Tago and Spencer Leniu, as well as Manly backrower Josh Schuster, can bring about a new dawn for Samoa, who are heavily favoured to dispatch the Cook Islands in quick time. A thumping, feel-good win could be just what the side needs for a reboot, which could make the call of home and history, of family and heritage almost impossible to ignore for some of the game's biggest names. Because it will be away from Campbelltown, across the desert in Perth and over the sea in Auckland, where the best Samoan players in the world will be plying their trade this weekend. Brian To'o, Jarome Luai, Tino Fa'asuamaleaui, Josh Papalii and Junior Paulo, who have all worn Samoan blue before, will play Origin on Sunday night. So will Stephen Crichton and Payne Haas, who are eligible, as is rising star Joseph Suaalii who forms part of the extended New South Wales squad. In Auckland, Samoan graduates Isaiah Papali'i, Ronaldo Mulitalo and Moses Leota will wear the black and white of New Zealand, and so will man mountain Nelson Asofa-Solomona, another player of Samoan descent. It's asking a lot, for them to give up Origin jerseys and Kangaroo and Kiwis spots - landing all of them for the World Cup is unrealistic in the extreme, and Milford says that's not what Samoa are expecting. They'll back their people no matter what they choose. ""It can be hard, but a lot of those boys have been in camp before and know what it's like. I know they enjoyed being here,"" Milford said. ""It's up to them, whatever they choose, we'll support them, If they pick Australia, good on them, if they pick Samoa we'll always have a place for them."" But just imagine, for a moment, what it could be like if Samoa just landed a couple of them. They just need a few, because once they get one then more will follow. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Imagine if Suaalii, who is living up to his reputation as the game's best young player, plays for the land of his fathers, or if Luai and To'o join their Penrith brothers and ramp the Panthers vibe up another notch, or if Haas and Paulo trade one blue jersey for another and give Samoa a pack that can match anybody in the world. It's a lot to give up, and Samoa can be competitive regardless of landing those players or not. But they can aim higher than just competitive. There can be greatness in this team and in this jersey. There is a future where everybody comes home and Samoa like their chances against anybody, any time, anywhere. They just need something they can come back to. Something that Tonga has found but Samoa is still looking for. It won't happen overnight, but it can happen – and if it does, it can start against the Cook Islands on Saturday.

3,"analysis: How going without a ruck is helping Port move the ball, and why it might impact the rest of the league",analysis-and-opinion," Sport Inside the game: How Port Adelaide's could change the game with their no-ruck approach Heading into Round 12 Port Adelaide was at a crossroads. A top four fancy at the start of the year, and minor premiers just two years ago, the Power were stuck in the lower ranges of the ladder and struggled to both effectively win the ball, and move it when they had it in hand. They had also been caught out by Essendon in the wet the week before. Before the team selections were made, coach Ken Hinkley hinted to the media that they would play smaller rather than taller, with a wry grin on his face. By that stage, Hinkley had decided to go into the game without a true ruck. Instead, forwards Jeremy Finlayson, Charlie Dixon and midfielder Sam Powell-Pepper shouldered the load against Richmond. While they lost the game, they did win the clearance battle in the middle. Port's ruckless experiment is far from the first foray into this space. Sydney legend Adam Goodes won a Brownlow Medal in the ruck, but in practice operated more like a supersized midfielder, beating lumbering bigs on the ground. At 191cm he tended to lose the hitout battle, but outworked his direct opponent around the ground. But using an undersized second ruck option is different to being completely undersized. So how can teams get away without picking a true ruck? Going small when others go tall isn't unique to footy. In fact, the world just got a reminder of the most prominent current version when the Golden State Warriors took their fourth NBA title in eight years, thanks in part to their ""death lineup"". The death lineup features the 6'6"" defensive maestro Draymond Green at centre, running his far taller opponents off the floor while protecting the paint. In the AFL the theory is similar. Going small gives you a speed advantage, at the expense of potency in the air. It's what Hinkley hinted at when he suggested playing without a ruck against Richmond. ""We're really pleased with the end result. To be fair, we ended up winning clearances so it's a pretty good performance by our midfield group collectively to be able to,"" Hinkley told reporters after the game. ""Because we got beat in hitouts — which we knew that was going to be on the cards with us. So we managed that really well I thought."" Port managed just 18 hitouts to 41 from the Toby Nankervis led Richmond across the game. Crucially, Port was able to win the clearance battle, reading the hitouts more effectively than their counterparts. Port's makeshift rucks fought hard to limit where Richmond could effectively direct hitouts. Port's rucks used their body positioning to effectively deny easy access to the ball. Around the ground, Port looked more attacking than they had in weeks, speeding the game up. While they narrowly lost, they looked re-energised. Last week against Sydney, Port shifted up a step further. After an injury to first game ruck Brynn Teakle early in the game, the Power were forced to go ruckless again. The move helped take the game away from the Swans. The ability for the Power rucks to contest and compete around the ground frustrated Sydney ruck Peter Ladhams, with the Swans' big lashing out during the game. The extra mobility of the Power presented open taller targets around the ground, critical against a Swans side that can be left exposed on the counter attacks. Despite giving up raw height to Sydney, they gained in being able to use what height they had. For most of the year, Port has been the worst team in the league in terms of centre clearance scoring differential. However, when they went ruckless the Power were able to largely nullify their opponents from the middle, and broke even in the contests. Hinkley's decision to shift to a ruckless strategy wasn't without precedent. In 2018, an early injury crisis at the club left it without any fit and mature rucks. That spell of ruckless play saw them win three of five games, likely helping Port's ability to adapt and Hinkley's willingness to experiment. The Power aren't the only side who have had to resort to going ruck free this year, and aren't the only side to succeed while doing so. When both Rowan Marshall and Jack Hayes were injured late in the game against GWS on the big stage of Friday night footy in Canberra, the Saints' narrow 15 point lead looked vulnerable against the two headed ruck hydra of Matt Flynn and Braydon Pruess. For a side looking to prove itself worthy of the top four, holding the ground in the middle would be key to winning the game. In the last quarter the Giants were able to win 31 of 32 hitouts largely through Pruess. Normally, this would indicate that GWS would be able to dominate first possession, and the rest of the contest. Instead, St Kilda won first disposal 17 times of those 32, effectively limiting their biggest advantage. ""It's interesting around the ball sometimes. Sometimes when you actually lose the hitouts by that much you're not worrying about your bloke,"" St Kilda coach Brett Ratten told the ABC after the game. ""You're not watching what your bloke's doing. You're just watching the opposition. So we have then three onballers and other players around who are just scanning him and what he does so they're not getting caught up in this 'we win one, they win one'. So it's all the focus on just watching their ruckman."" With Pruess playing just his third game at the Giants, that important ruck-midfield combination was absent when it was needed most. Late in the game Pruess and Flynn were relying on taps to the feet of the contest or big punches forward, often with little variation. Some clubs utilise calls to specific players in stoppages, others to zones. Whatever method GWS used on that Friday night, St Kilda decoded it easily. The Saints set up well on the defensive side of the stoppage, limiting the damage that the Giants could do even if they got a touch on the ball first. The mobile St Kilda bigs were also able to outwork the taller Pruess around the ground, and at the foot of the contest. Ratten commended Josh Battle and his ability to outwork the Giants' bigs at ground level after the game. Despite losing the battle in the air, Battle won the war on the ground — and more importantly the Saints won the game. Generally speaking, winning the hitouts does not particularly suggest winning the match. Since the introduction of ruck nominations in 2017, winning a lot of hitouts has often been as useful as winning very few of them. Teams have become better at knowing how to compete despite losing the aerial battle. Winning clearances, however, has a more considerable impact. The first touch in the ruck is far less useful than the first real use of the ball, which often dictates the pace and direction of play. It may be widely understood that raw hitouts don't represent the midfield battle, but even an edge in hitouts to advantage in a match has only a loose relationship with clearance effectiveness. Winning hitouts and clearances don't always go hand in hand, but a good ruck and midfield group have some small edge in turning the former into the latter. Some sides base significant parts of their game around winning the contest. Last year the Suns were without captain Jarrod Witts for most of the season, robbing the team of a big part of their identity. While the Suns had some strong weeks, they largely struggled without their talisman. Melbourne, absent Max Gawn in the coming weeks, faces a similar challenge. Going ruckless seems to work best in a few situations. It seems to work well as a surprise tactic, especially in wetter conditions. This surprise factor can also help a makeshift ruck after an in-game injury. Ruckless sides seem to have a real mobility advantage against slower primary rucks, and where they have ample other tall targets around the ground. The best tap rucks present the biggest challenge to the strategy, as do the most mobile traditional rucks. If Port continues to experiment in the ruck, and keeps rising up the ladder, a new approach to rucking in the AFL could be on the horizon.

4,analysis: The science of silliness: How psychology won the Socceroos a World Cup spot,analysis-and-opinion,"  How Socceroos goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne used psychology to secure Australia's spot at the 2022 World Cup In last week's 2022 World Cup qualifying play-off between the Socceroos and Peru, there were two different games being played. The first began at the opening whistle and lasted for 119 minutes: a tense, physical battle between two uncertain sides that ultimately ended 0-0. The second game started a minute later. Because that's when Australia's head coach Graham Arnold made an unexpected (and risky) substitution, bringing off veteran goalkeeper and captain Mat Ryan for 33-year-old Andrew Redmayne. The initial reaction from Socceroos fans was one of disbelief. Ryan, who plays for Real Sociedad in Spain's La Liga, was a veteran of two World Cups and one of the team's most consistent and dependable players throughout Australia's 1,008-day-long qualifying campaign. Redmayne, on the other hand, had just two appearances for Australia to his name, and was even struggling to maintain his starting spot with Sydney FC in Australia's A-League Men. But Australian fans weren't the only ones who were baffled by the switch. Peru's players were, too. And that, according to Socceroos goalkeeper coach John Crawley — one of the only people 'in' on the plan — was the entire point. ""We always knew we had Redmayne up our sleeve,"" Crawley told the ABC. ""We planned for that. We did a couple of sessions throughout the window where we did some specific stuff on penalties. But we didn't need to tell anyone [in the team] as long as we knew the plan ourselves. ""I think you just have to do something different to disrupt the penalty-taker's routine. ""They'd played against Maty [Ryan] for the whole game and knew what he was about, so when they saw Redmayne coming on, they maybe thought, 'who's this guy?' ""Even just that bit of doubt can make a difference."" Redmayne's substitution was just the start of the psychological game that began to unfold after the final whistle of extra-time blew. As the nerve-biting penalty shoot-out got underway, there were other, subtler strategies the bearded shot-stopper performed to give his team the edge. The first was handing the ball to each of his team-mates; a tactic that was popularised by England at the 2018 World Cup and carried on by a number of goalkeepers at club level, including Liverpool's Alisson. According to Geir Jordet, a professor of sports psychology at the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences who wrote a tweet thread breaking down Redmayne's tactics, these gestures were important in fortifying the psychology of Australia's penalty-takers. However, it was what Redmayne did after each hand-off that was most interesting. ""In a penalty shoot-out, you want to make events as predictable and safe as possible for your team-mates,"" Jordet said. ""The way Redmayne helped his team-mates was spot-on: first, by handing them the ball between every shot, giving them a familiar way to start their pre-shot routine [and] a friendly word of support or encouragement. That beats getting the ball from the opponent or having to go get it yourself. ""But what I have not seen before is what he did after handing off the ball. ""He looks up at the opponent goalkeeper and saw that he was maybe trying to get into the penalty-taker's head, so [Redmayne] basically takes on the role as a bodyguard, where he lets [Gallese] know to back down and step away. He puts himself in the middle between the penalty-taker and the goalkeeper like a barrier. ""I've not seen this in a penalty shoot-out before, so this was maybe the biggest innovation for me: how he took that role of a bodyguard. That's quite unique."" Another piece of psychological warfare was barely captured on camera, but arguably had one of the biggest impacts. After Redmayne noticed one of Gallese's water-bottles had notes on Australia's penalty-takers wrapped around it — containing details on who they were and which way they would likely shoot — the Socceroos keeper picked it up and threw the bottle over the advertising boards. For Jorbet, this act didn't just deny Gallese crucial information; it also acted as an intimidation tactic, a violation of the Peruvian's property and his space. ""It's disruptive on a few levels,"" he said. ""Of course, it takes away information that he probably relied on. We don't know the extent to which he had memorised these things anyway, but it was on the bottle for a reason. ""But then there's the added aspect of it being a very hostile act. It's intimidating. It's not friendly in any way; it's leaving the goalkeeper feeling very unprotected, very attacked in this very indirect kind of way [with] someone stealing your stuff. ""You can imagine coming home and someone has been in your place and stolen things. People who've been robbed talk about how it's not just that they lost a computer or whatever, but that some stranger was in my home. So to instil that in this situation is quite extraordinary. Socceroos substitute goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne danced his way into national folklore this morning – and the internet went a wild emotional rollercoaster ride with him. ""This may be stepping over the line and taking it too far, though. I wouldn't be comfortable telling my team that [stealing] is something you should do. But if a player decides to do it on their own, that's a different thing. ""And there's the other intimidation tactic where [Redmayne] was invited to hand the ball over to one of the opponents, and then just let it go and kicked it away. It's a clear demonstration of gamesmanship: 'I don't respect you.' It's a clear, explicit mind-game."" Crawley admitted that he had prepared a similar water-bottle with notes on Peru's penalty-takers, but that Redmayne was confident enough that he wouldn't need them. ""We discussed it together probably two weeks out from the Peru game,"" Crawley said. ""And I said, 'mate, in the event that we lose our bottle — it gets thrown into the crowd or something — we've still got our signals. ""And, as it turned out, when I gave Andrew the bottle right before [the shoot-out], he said, 'mate, don't worry about the bottle. We've done the signals before with success. You hold the bottle.' ""So he's gone in there without the bottle and we just did our signals. But I actually didn't realise he took advantage of Gallese's notes being there and that he's then thrown his bottle [away]. ""But again, it's whatever it takes. We certainly had a Plan A and a Plan B, but I think Redders may have taken that to another level. And thank goodness he did."" And then, of course, there's the iconic ""Wiggles"" dance. While it looked silly and unorthodox, Jordet said there was a clear rationale behind Redmayne's flailing limbs and jittery style. ""A lot of goalkeepers do things on the line to try and distract; to try to disturb,"" he said. ""What Redmayne did was follow that principle that it needs to be unpredictable, it needs to be a little erratic, it needs to have some variation. ""Because if all you do on the line is go from left to right, from right to left, it doesn't have any impact; it's very easy for the taker to block out. So it needs to be different. ""I've watched thousands of penalty shoot-out shots over the years, and this definitely ranks in the top five with respect to unpredictability in his behaviour, which I love. ""It takes me back to football history: Liverpool in the Champions League with Dudek back in 2005 and Grobbelaar in 1984 and '85. This one fits nicely with them because it's so weird, it's so strange. And what could be more impactful than that?"" However, while it may have worked for Redmayne this time, such unusual goalkeeping tactics are still so rare in professional football that there is only a small amount of evidence to suggest it's more effective at stopping penalties than any other method. The key, Jorbet says, is the overall distraction — the psychology of the moment. ""There is research on when the goalkeepers are trying to do something to distract the shooter — no matter what it is — and that history directly reduces the chance of the shooter scoring by about 10 per cent. ""Research that I've done also looked at whether goalkeepers were able to take so much time that the penalty taker had to stand there and wait. I looked at every single penalty shot in the World Cup, the European Championships, and the Champions League and the difference there, with the shooter having to wait [for the goalkeeper] versus the shooter not waiting, was more than 20 per cent. ""So there are different ways a goalkeeper can be disruptive and there is some research to suggest it works. ""But it's always difficult to go from documenting what has happened to predicting what will happen. The point is that these are not absolute discoveries; these are trends based on history that might indicate something about probabilities going forward."" For Crawley, who Redmayne credits as introducing the idea to him when they worked together at Sydney FC, the same principle of unpredictability — as well as bravery to do something different — is what made the difference against Peru. ""Whether it's a Wiggles dance, or you turn your back on the player, or you say something to them, or you move to one side of the goal; whatever it takes, you're disrupting that routine,"" Crawley said. ""If you're a player and you're stepping up to practice a penalty, you put the ball down, you walk back, you turn around, you will always see a goalkeeper in the middle of the goal. That's routine for hundreds and hundreds of practice takes. ""So what would happen if you saw a dancing Wiggle there? Automatically, you start to win the psychological game. Andrew understands this and he's willing to make a fool of himself to get that edge. From A-League journeymen to first-generation migrants to young players moving abroad, the Socceroos' ""Aussie DNA"" is more than just mongrel and mateship. ""It's all about disrupting the routine. I don't think Redders really has a great save ratio with penalties, but we all know what he can do and what he can bring. It comes down to that intangible thing in the moment."" And that intangible thing, for Jordet, is why goalkeeping is the most 'human' position in football: so much of a goalkeeper's job happens off the ball and away from cameras. Their power lies largely within the invisible, but very real, dynamics they create between themselves and others on the field. ""This is such a personal type of strategy,"" he said. ""It's something where you have to use yourself more than other parts of the game where you can just do your job. ""There's something very human about this that transcends the game itself, in a way. You have to be able to put yourself out there in a moment like this, do something that others might not. ""These are the intangible human parts of football that are so fascinating. It's something that's very hard to measure; it's something that's hard to quantify. And that's exactly what is so wonderful about it.""

5,"analysis: The RBA boss has a message, but you might not like it if you have a job",analysis-and-opinion,"  The RBA boss wants you to follow his path away from recession — even if that means more real wage cuts for workers ""We are not on a preset path,"" Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe observed on Tuesday, in the economic understatement of the week. Indeed, the path ahead looks no more predetermined than it has for the past two-and-a-half years. Since COVID came along, followed by the war in Ukraine, no official forecast has survived more than a few months. The outlook remains uncertain, but Lowe is trying his best to show the way — the path he would like everyone to stick to. The RBA Governor sees the inflation wave cresting at 7 per cent by year's end, before gently easing in the new year after a further series of interest rate rises. A recession will be avoided and employment will remain strong. That's the plan. It involves some pain for mortgage holders along the way, but no economic crisis. Don't panic. And definitely don't do anything unnecessary that could drive inflation even higher and send the economy onto an entirely different path. Lowe has publicly outlined this preferred path scenario twice in two weeks. He's keen to get the message out. Last week he appeared on the ABC's 7:30 program to talk about his chosen course. This week he delivered a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia. He wants everyone to know about the planned path. He is showing the way. And he's warning of the dangers involved if we veer off course and end up somewhere else entirely. To stay on the path, Lowe wants everyone to do their bit. This includes workers who might have hoped for some real wage growth after the election of a Labor government, which campaigned successfully with an argument about ""everything going up except your wages"". Minimum wage earners will see an increase of 5.2 per cent after a decision by the independent umpire last week, something the newly elected government was quick to welcome. This is what life looks like for people in some of the world's most expensive cities where inflation surges are taking hold. The RBA boss, however, doesn't want that repeated across the workforce. Inflation might be headed to 7 per cent, but Lowe is advocating a wage rise of half that amount. ""Three-and-a-half per cent is kind of the anchoring point that I want people to keep in mind,"" he says. In other words, it's a continued real wage cut for most workers in the short term — if we're to stay on Lowe's preferred path. Labor isn't exactly celebrating that suggestion of only modest wage growth, but nor is it disputing the logic of avoiding a wage-price spiral. That would be far worse economically and politically for the Albanese government. But wages aren't the only threat that could see us veer off the path. Government spending is the other risk. So far Treasurer Jim Chalmers appears to be heeding the warnings from the RBA. From July 1, more than $12 billion will be pumped into the economy in the form of turbo-charged Low and Middle Income Tax Offset payments, announced before the election by the Morrison government and promptly backed in by Labor. Beyond that, Chalmers has resisted calls for additional cost of living relief. In fact, he's begun laying the groundwork for cuts, telling the Australian Financial Review on the weekend there was ""a case for a more substantial look"" at spending in his October budget. State governments, however, appear to have missed the memo. On the very day Lowe delivered his speech about the path ahead and repeated his warnings about veering off course, two state Treasurers announced big spending budgets. In NSW, the Coalition government is boosting spending by more than $24 billion over the next four years. Almost half of that, or $10 billion, will flow in the coming 12 months, when the government just happens to be facing an election. The spending, to be clear, is not all bad or necessarily inflationary. New childcare centres, an extra year of pre-kindergarten education and tentative steps towards replacing an inefficient stamp duty with land tax, should all have a productive benefit. They're all aimed at growing the economic pie. Less productive is the $7.2 billion in ""cost-of-living"" measures announced by the NSW Treasurer to help with everything from road tolls, school costs, and energy bills. Similarly, the Queensland budget wasn't all bad. A big boost in health funding should ease pressures on the system. The multi-pronged cost of living crisis has spared few Australians from increased financial stress. In response, cash-strapped households have been forced to find new ways to cut back. But an extra $6.8 billion to help Queenslanders with ""cost of living pressures"" is again pumping more money and stimulus into the economy — just as inflation climbs higher. The temptation for politicians to pump cost of living relief into voters' pockets is understandable. Whether it wins votes is debatable, as the recent federal election showed. Whether it further fuels inflation and drives us off Lowe's path, we're about to see. ""It's a fairly narrow path,"" Lowe said in his speech on Tuesday. ""It's highly unlikely that we'll get it exactly right. We'll make mistakes. I hope the mistakes are not too large and we can self-correct."" Nothing is preset.

6,analysis: The NRLW is expanding at breakneck speed. Will women's rugby league be ready for the future?,analysis-and-opinion," Sport The NRLW is set to radically expand in the next 12 months. But is women's rugby league ready for such rapid growth? The world of women's rugby league is changing faster and faster all the time. That's the thing about progress – it's a path that leads down a hill, so the further things go, the faster they get there. And women's rugby league is hurtling down the hill. Friday night will be the last time the State of Origin series is contested in a single match before it expands to two next year. After three new clubs joined the NRLW for 2022's first season the league, flush with success, fast-tracked expansion from two new teams for 2023 to four new sides, meaning the competition will have more than doubled in size in less than three years. Growing Origin is a no-brainer, but flooding the NRLW with new clubs is a more complex discussion, with some of the game's biggest names split on whether the league is ready for ten teams. ""It's nearly doubled with what we've got at the moment and we're already struggling to fill up those last few spots on the teams as is,"" Newcastle and New South Wales prop Millie Boyle said. ""I know the game is growing, I'm not sure if it's growing at the pace where they can put in those new teams."" Boyle, a member of the Rugby League Players Association women's advisory group, also takes issue with what she believes to be a lack of consultation from the NRL on the viability of such radical expansion. ""We're on there, but they're going to make their own decisions. I guess they'll say we're whinging whatever happens – 'they say we're not big enough, they say there's not enough teams, they say there's too many',"" Boyle said. ""We'll never be able to make everyone happy. They make the rules and you can't grow unless you grow. I thought it would be two teams, but it's not up to me. ""Four teams will be a big jump, I guess with the new marquee spots and the new CBA we'll spread girls out again and get them to new areas all over the country, especially down in Canberra and up in North Queensland."" When Sam Bremner announced she would take time away from rugby league to start a family, people treated it like a retirement. Now she's making her return to State of Origin after a four-year absence. The NRLW took four years to expand following it's launch in 2018, a slow-burn approach which ensured there was always enough elite-level talent to fill out the existing teams. It meant that when the league finally pulled the trigger on growing the game, they were able to spread out enough star players to ensure the new teams were competitive. Things didn't work out perfectly – Newcastle were winless in their first campaign – but every other team won at least two games and for the most part, matches were closely fought and competitive. Providing new avenues and pathways and growing the sport is important, but so is producing a high-quality product on the field. If the quality of play rises, as it did this year, it means better ratings, stronger crowds and increased interest from fans both old and new. It's easier to sell, which means more people will buy it. If there is more teams than there is talent there's a danger of scores blowing out and the competition losing it's lustre as the snake starts to eat it's tail. Given Canberra, Cronulla, North Queensland and Wests Tigers must all find enough players to fill out a competitive roster and given there was a winless side in a six-team league it's a fair question to ask if that will be possible. What will help matters is that each of the four clubs has a strong grassroots program – Cronulla and the Tigers have fielded teams in the NSW Women's Premiership since 2019, the Raiders have a Tarsha Gale Cup (Under 18s) side and the North Queensland Gold Stars, who will presumably provide many of the Cowboys players, won the Queensland Women's Premiership grand final earlier this month. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter And, as Blues veteran Sam Bremner points out, if there are more spots available it creates more opportunities for players to fill those spots, which should help grow participation. Bremner, who has played at the top level of women's rugby league since 2012 and has witnessed the game's transformation over the past decade first-hand, knows the old ""you can't be what you can't see"" adage still rings true. ""It is a really big jump, but the best thing that ever happened to women's rugby league was that we exposed it,"" Bremner said. ""I remember going to a school after we won the World Cup and they asked the kids 'hands up if you've ever heard of the Jillaroos' and one boy stood up and said 'yeah, I know them, they play hockey'. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""From then, we started exposing women's rugby league and all these girls started playing and I think having more opportunities are going to make girls think it's possible for them, and then the depth continues to grow. ""It is a really big leap, but I have faith we can fill those spots. It's an exciting time for women's rugby league. ""Girls can see us on TV and we say it all the time but it's true, you can't be what you can't see."" Regardless of how this new round of expansion goes, it's unlikely the NRLW will be slowing down. The NRL already wants to expand again - South Sydney want in for the 2024 season and Penrith are keen to field a team as soon as possible. Unless the four new sides are an unmitigated disaster, the game will keep flying down the hill until it either levels out or topples over. The careful, slow approach is over. Sometimes, if you wait until you're ready you never get ready at all, and the NRL has decided the future is coming and it's coming fast.

7,analysis: Why does everyone seem to have food intolerances these days?,analysis-and-opinion,"  Are food intolerances to lactose, gluten and FODMAPs on the rise? Most of you will have noticed hosting a dinner party is harder than it used to be. One friend is gluten-free, another is dairy-free, one can't eat onion and two more are vegetarian. Are food intolerances increasing? Or do we just hear more about them now? Food intolerances are reactions to eating foods, in normal quantities, that do not involve the immune system. They are very different to food allergies which is when the body mounts an immune response to a food that is either ingested or even touches the skin. This immune response is very quick (within 20 minutes to two hours) and releases chemicals that can affect the person's breathing, gastrointestinal tract and heart. Common food allergies include eggs, peanuts, wheat and shellfish. Allergies differ from intolerances in that the most severe allergies cause anaphylaxis: severe allergic reactions that are life-threatening. The mechanisms behind food intolerances can vary greatly. One common mechanism is when people lack enzymes that are needed for breaking down nutrients. In one of the most common food intolerances, lactose intolerance, people lack the enzyme ""lactase"" which is used to break down this carbohydrate naturally found in milk and some other dairy products. Lactose is broken down into glucose and galactose in the small intestine, and then absorbed. Without lactase, lactose stays in the intestine, where it draws water in from the blood supply to dilute the amount of lactose. Initially this leads to diarrhoea, and then as the lactose enters the large intestine it is fermented by the bacteria in our gut, which results in gas causing abdominal bloating, pain and discomfort. Other food intolerances due to the lack of enzymes include intolerances to histamine and caffeine. Some people are unable to break down histamine, which is found in red wine, strong and blue cheeses, tuna, tomatoes and pork products. This can lead to symptoms such as itching, red flushing on the skin, abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, headaches and migraines. Similarly, people can also have a sensitivity to caffeine (found in coffee and cocoa). Food intolerances are also different from auto-immune responses, such as in coeliac disease. In this case, people develop an auto-immune response in the small intestine to a protein in wheat called gluten. The auto-immune response also damages the villi, the small finger-like structures that absorb all the nutrients. Many people who experience gastrointestinal symptoms in reaction to wheat products assume they have coeliac disease. However, they may have a sensitivity to fructan, a type of carbohydrate in wheat. Fructan is a naturally fermentable carbohydrate and a ""FODMAP"" – which stands for Fermentable Oligo- Di- Monosacharides and Polyols, a group of nutrients that can cause sensitivity. Like in the case of lactose (which is also a FODMAP carbohydrate), some people are unable to absorb large amounts of fructans (also present in onions and garlic). Like lactose, this causes diarrhoea, and then the bacteria in the large intestine ferment the fructan, producing gas, abdominal pain and discomfort. While it may seem as if food intolerances are increasing, we have no good evidence this is really the case. Data is lacking on actual numbers, perhaps as food intolerances generally do not lead to the requirement to take medications or seek urgent medical treatment. A 2009 report suggests about 20 per cent of the population has one or more food intolerances, with no apparent change since 1994. A more recent survey from 2020 of self-reported intolerances in internet users indicated about 25 per cent of the population. The perceived increase may reflect many other factors. Some people may self-diagnose a food intolerance from well-intended but misleading health advice from family and friends. Additionally, people may incorrectly attribute medical symptoms to foods they have eaten. We also have an increased ability to self-diagnose, thanks to Dr Google. In other cases dietary requests may reflect ethical choices about food. We all know from attending social events with food how often we need to provide our dietary requirements. This is also contributing to normalising food intolerances, compared to even a decade ago. Previously people would have suffered in silence or simply avoided consuming their problematic trigger foods at events. Another factor could be the greater proportion of people of different ethnicities living in Australia, some of whom are genetically more likely to have an intolerance. If you suspect you have a food intolerance it's best to get diagnosed by a doctor, to ensure you are not overlooking a potentially concerning medical problem. Also you may be needlessly avoiding a particular food group and missing out on essential nutrients required for optimal health.

8,analysis: I'm on Putin's naughty list for my work — and I couldn't be prouder,analysis-and-opinion,"  I woke up on Friday morning a pawn in a Kafka-esque story. Except I hadn't been transformed into a chess piece but was a diplomatic pawn, a small player in a much larger international story. I read the news that I and 119 other ""prominent"" Australians were banned from travelling to Russia ""indefinitely"". The Russian sanctions were a response to Western sanctions and the ""spreading of false information about Russia"". The Russian Foreign Ministry announced 121 people had been sanctioned but, in a beautifully Russian bureaucratic bungle, Air Vice-Marshal Darren Goldie was banned twice, making it just 120 of us on the list. As usual, I was the second person in my family to know. My wife had woken before me and was listening to the news. ""Russia has banned a bunch more Australians,"" she told me. ""Bet you're on the list."" The rest of the list was made up of journalists, business people, army officials, politicians and the odd academic like myself. What unites us is our outspoken criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. This is one club of which I am proud to be a member. And rather than silence the critics, Russia's actions only give our concerns more exposure. After all, you wouldn't be reading this if Russia hadn't banned me. I have a number of Russian friends and colleagues that I am saddened now not to be able to visit. I was at a conference in Moscow a few years ago and had a great time. I promised then to return to see the delights of St Petersburg. And I always imagined one day I'd follow Paul Theroux's footsteps on the trans-Siberian express. But it seems I will now only ever read about such adventures from the comfort of my armchair. This brings me to my outspoken criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. At the start of last week, I had the pleasure to speak about artificial intelligence (AI) at DevFest Ukraine, an online charity event put on by the tech community that raised more than US$100,000 ($143,500) for those impacted by Russia's invasion. And, in acknowledging the ownership of the land on which I was speaking, I acknowledged the ownership of all lands illegally occupied, including those in Ukraine. Among the sanctioned individuals are journalists from ABC News, Sydney Morning Herald and Sky News, as well as various defence officials. But I am sure it was another act that was the cause of my sanction: casting doubt on Russia's claims about AI. In April, I was interviewed for a story about Russian weaponry in The Australian — and as the author is the only tech journalist who made the Russian list, I'm confident that article is to blame. I can just imagine the Russian official in some non-descript office in bowels of the Foreign Ministry reading The Australian and pulling out the file to which my name was added. The article reported my significant concerns about Russia's use of the ""smart"" AI-enabled POM-3 anti-personnel mine in Ukraine. Such mines are banned by the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines (informally known as the Ottawa Treaty or the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention). Russia is not a party to this treaty but 164 states are parties to it, including Australia and every country in Europe including Ukraine. The POM-3 is a particularly barbaric mine, designed to cause maximum damage to humans. It's a descendant of the German Bouncing Betty mine used in World War II. When the mine is triggered, an expelling charge projects the warhead roughly one metre above ground level, at which point the warhead detonates. The warhead is packed with toothed rings designed to harm vital organs in a target's body many metres away. The mine is triggered by a seismic sensor that detects approaching footsteps. Russia claims the mine is equipped with AI that can recognise friendly soldiers, thus minimising the risk of collateral damage. This is an absurd claim. The footsteps of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers will produce the same seismic footprint. No AI can tell them apart. Russia's wild claim illustrates a worrying trend where states will say weapons use ""AI"" to target combatants rather than civilians. Handing over battlefield decision-making to AI is a hugely dangerous proposition. And this is just one the many dangers of AI in warfare. Others include the lowering of the barriers to war, and the development of new weapons of mass destruction. Ukrainian forces pushed out Vladimir Putin's men from the eastern region of Kharkiv but, in the Russian military's wake, they found explosives hidden everywhere, from fields to a child's bedroom. Fortunately, it's not too late to regulate this space. Indeed, the increasing use of hi-tech drones in the conflict in Ukraine has been a wake-up call to militaries around the world that technologies like this are fundamentally changing how we fight wars. Discussions are moving slowly at the United Nations to limit the use of lethal autonomous weapons. Australia has an opportunity to take leadership in this area. Australia has long been at the forefront of international efforts to combat the spread of chemical and biological weapons but has taken a back seat in the diplomatic efforts around autonomous weapons. It's time we took up the cause of regulating weapons that use AI to identify, track and target humans. I could then get back to reading about the wonderful history of Russia from my armchair.

9,analysis: The West must not forget the 20th century's hard-learned lessons of war,analysis-and-opinion,"  A large-scale, brutal conflict of the kind that many assumed lay in the past but no longer in the future has been witnessed by governments, military organisations and the public at large in the 116 days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is important to learn from this because it is possible that other massed attrition-style wars may occur in our near future. This is something that democracies have dealt with before yet we have, unfortunately, forgotten many of the hard-learned lessons of the 20th century. Perhaps one of the most important lessons to have been forgotten is that a vital part of any national deterrent is the capacity to design and produce the artefacts of war – weapons, ammunition and trained humans – in large quantities. In the wake of the Cold War, and the draw down on military spending, military forces were downsized (reducing demand), and militaries engaged in operations that only had short periods of high intensity combat. As a consequence, most military organisations lost the institutional memory of industrial scale activities. In an essay this week, former US Army officer Alex Vershinin explored the issue of ammunition shortages, particularly for artillery, in the Russo-Ukraine War. His findings make sobering reading. This isn't just because of the huge increase in artillery ammunition that will be needed for the Ukrainians to sustain their defence against Russia. It is because this is also an issue that applies to many other aspects of contemporary military institutions beyond ammunition production. There are three key aspects requiring attention to ensure countries like Australia, the United States and others are able to sustain their militaries in wars that may last more than several days. One area is equipment. As seen in Ukraine, war is expensive in consuming equipment. In war, tanks, trucks, artillery, weapons and even personal protective equipment are destroyed by the enemy, in accidents or it just wears out. This can occur in large quantities — and it has in Ukraine. Even if the Ukrainian updates on Russian losses overestimate the destruction of Russian equipment by 100 per cent, that is still 700 tanks and more than 1000 other armoured vehicles destroyed in four months. Contrast this with the US tank production which currently sits at about 130 per year. Despite the barbarity of the Russians and the suffering of the Ukrainian people, the war has been a tragic opportunity for governments and military institutions to learn crucial lessons. The most heartbreaking of all is that theories about the decline of war are obsolete. Therefore, an important component of strategies that prepare military forces for 21st century conflict must be the scaling up national capacity to build large numbers of complex modern weapon systems. Tanks and trucks, artillery and helicopters are expensive and are currently produced in limited numbers. The problem is magnified for ships and aircraft which are produced at a limited number of shipyards and factories. Because of the huge cost and time in building these systems, we will see the greater use of smaller, cheaper autonomous systems. Necessity will drive this in even the most conservative and risk adverse military cultures. But they cannot fully replace tanks, ships and aircraft. We will still need to produce these as well. A second area requiring attention to build more sustainable forces is infrastructure. This is an often-overlooked element of building military capability. Militaries need infrastructure such as bases (where they live and store equipment), jetties and ports, airfields and fuel farms, logistics bases, transport hubs, and training areas. Currently, most western military forces have scaled their infrastructure for their ""force in being"". Bases are sized and supported for a known number of occupants, with minimal expansion capacity. Consequently, any expansion to larger military forces for a large-scale future threat must consider expanded infrastructure. Finally, Western military institutions must review their personnel policies. The central capability of any good military institution is its people. This includes recruiting (or conscription), training, education, experience, leadership, personnel policies, pay and conditions. Unfortunately, wars are expensive in people. Since the end of the Cold War, most military institutions have moved to smaller all-volunteer forces. These smaller forces are trained and educated to a very high level, regardless of their speciality. However, the exquisite training and education systems we have developed in the last three decades are unlikely to scale up if we need to undertake a significant expansion in the size of military forces. The throughput of current training institutions is designed to fill the force in being, not a much larger institution. And systems such as Australia's would not cope with the need to replace hundreds of casualties each day. Additionally, the length of many military courses, which is suitable for peace time, will be too long for expanded organisations. A shift to industrial scale warfare requires a different approach to training and education. One that has a massively increased throughput capacity, and one that focuses just on combat needs. A key trend in 21st century conflict is that ""mass is back"". As I wrote in my book War Transformed, this ""involves large-scale conventional forces, the massed use of autonomous systems, and the wide-scale use of the tools of influence, including sophisticated algorithms."" We are seeing this play out daily in Ukraine. As Vershinin describes, there is much we can learn from the war in Ukraine. But to demonstrate we have learned about war on the industrial scale, Western military institutions will also have to act. They will need to convince their civilian masters of the need to invest in the capacity to build military forces and employ them at industrial scale. Mick Ryan is a strategist and recently retired Australian Army major general. He served in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan, and as a strategist on the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff.

10,"analysis: Zed Seselja didn't lose the election, David Pocock won. This is why",analysis-and-opinion," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Which Canberrans voted for David Pocock, and what does this mean for the Liberals' future? Last month, David Pocock became the first Independent senator to represent the ACT. His victory was improbable but not entirely unexpected: the former rugby union star has an international profile and many Canberrans volunteered to help him. In the weeks before his election, his main opponents showed signs they were nervous about his growing support. Labor invested significantly more effort (and money) than it usually does to rally support for its senator, Katy Gallagher. Advance Australia, a Liberal-aligned lobby group, spent even more — it told Canberrans repeatedly that Senator Pocock was an extremist who was disguising his Greens sympathies. Look back at how the 2022 Australian federal election unfolded Ultimately, Senator Gallagher was re-elected but with Labor's lowest-ever vote in the ACT. And the Liberals' Zed Seselja became Australia's first territory senator to lose their seat at an election. The ABC has analysed every ballot cast in the ACT Senate race. There were some surprising results — and not just Senator Pocock's victory. It took three-and-a-half weeks to formally declare the ACT Senate results, but the outcome was obvious on election night. While Senator Pocock's party had significantly fewer first-preference votes than the Liberals (21.1 per cent to 24.8 per cent), his victory was a fait accompli. Below is a simplified view of how the votes flowed, over dozens of preference distributions, to elect two senators. Collectively, Labor's two candidates had more votes than the quota required for election in the ACT, which is one third of all votes plus one (or about 33.3 per cent). However, Senator Gallagher fell 313 votes short. For the first time, an ACT Labor candidate needed to rely on preferences to be elected. Mr Seselja's vote also dropped to a record low. And, as expected, only a trickle of preferences from minor parties went to the Liberals. Senator Pocock's first-preference haul was not unprecedented: the Greens have done better twice (Kerry Tucker in 2007 and Lin Hatfield-Dodds in 2010). The difference this time was that other challengers — the Greens' Tjanara Goreng Goreng and independent Kim Rubenstein — also polled well. Ultimately, Senator Pocock won easily as he was the preferred choice of minor-party voters, who were more influential this election than in any other. Senator Pocock was always seen to be targeting Mr Seselja's seat rather than Senator Gallagher's. So it was a surprise when ACT Labor became so spooked by Senator Pocock's campaign that it significantly ramped up efforts to secure votes. While Labor was never close to losing, perhaps its fear was reasonable. This chart shows that the vast majority of Senator Pocock's supporters, when pressed to choose a major party, opted for Labor or the Greens rather than the Liberals. Only one in six preferenced Mr Seselja above Senator Gallagher and Dr Goreng Goreng. This suggests Senator Pocock convinced more Labor voters to switch to him than Liberal voters. There may be other explanations — for example, he might have attracted large numbers of ""tactical"" voters, whose loyalty is still with Labor. Either way, Senator Pocock's supporters are generally progressive rather than conservative. Similarly, Professor Rubenstein — who, like Senator Pocock, had the support of the Climate 200 advocacy group — was of almost no interest to conservative voters. Professor Rubenstein's ""Kim for Canberra"" campaign attracted a not-insignificant 4.4 per cent of first preference votes. Analysis of those ballot papers suggests only one in eight of them supported the Liberals. The 2022 election was a clear success for left-of-centre candidates. But while the progressive vote expanded, it also fractured. Senator Pocock's election — and the rise of minor parties more broadly — poses electoral challenges for Labor and the Greens. How? That's best explained by looking at a hypothetical election in which Senator Pocock did not stand. This year's federal election was always going to be difficult for the Canberra Liberals. The Morrison government tanked across the country (except in Tasmania), and local debate centred on Mr Seselja's unpopular opposition to territory rights. Yet while federal Greens leader Adam Bandt called the national outcome a ""greenslide"", this was untrue of the ACT. This chart maps which major parties Canberrans preferred in 2019 and 2022. Underlying support for the ACT Greens did not budge at all, despite the ""greenslide"", Mr Seselja's unpopularity and a deep swing against the Coalition nationally. In fact, Mr Seselja would likely have beaten Dr Goreng Goreng to the second Senate seat had Senator Pocock pulled out of the campaign. How do we know? The ABC re-ran the ACT Senate election, using Canberrans' ballots as a guide but filtering out preferences for Senator Pocock's party. Senator Gallagher coasted in, and Mr Seselja pipped Dr Goreng Goreng for the final seat (34 per cent to 30.5 per cent). Of course, there are limits to this hypothetical exercise: Canberrans might have voted very differently in a campaign with different candidates. But the results suggest that Mr Seselja didn't lose the election — Senator Pocock won it. If Senator Pocock fares poorly over the next three years, or decides against running for re-election, the Canberra Liberals will be very well placed to regain a senator. The question for them now — and all other Liberal branches — is: what kind of Liberal do Canberra voters want? The ACT Greens, meanwhile, face their own challenge. How do they mobilise the kind of support that Senator Pocock did?

11,analysis: Why superannuation losses will be worse than we think,analysis-and-opinion,"  Why superannuation losses are likely to be worse than we think after horror year on global markets Even before last week's market conflagration, the scene was looking ugly. While it may have come as a shock to many, superannuation balances — which ballooned last year through the worst recession in more than a century — had already dipped into the red by late last month just as the financial year was drawing to a close. After last week's gravity pull from rising interest rates, the rout on global stock markets has turned that bleak prospect into a painful reality. Best now to mentally prepare for a significant decline in your retirement savings when that June 30 statement hits the inbox. Even those who have erred on the side of caution — with a more-conservative superannuation option — are likely to see significant declines. The only ones who will be spared are those with the foresight — or good luck — to switch to cash at the beginning of the year. Until last week, it somehow had appeared that global monetary authorities had managed to engineer a major downturn on financial markets — without the usual accompaniment of panic and despair. No more. A mood of despondency has settled over financial markets and — unlike previous downturns — there appears to be little room to hide. Everything of late has been falling. That's made life extremely difficult for investors, home-spun and professional alike. And it's likely to continue. After more than 30 years of declining interest rates and minimal inflation, the world seems poised to enter a new era — or maybe re-enter an old one — of sluggish growth, escalating costs and more expensive capital. It's a world that many investors have never before experienced. Australia has been an outlier on the global stage this year. While Wall Street has been grinding lower since January, higher commodity prices — courtesy of Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine — have kept financial markets news off the front pages here. Until now. After Australians collectively took a bath in the wash-up from the global financial crisis, our big superannuation funds reviewed their investment strategies. Most figured out they had way too much invested in Australian shares, that their portfolios were too closely tied to the local stock market. So, they actively diversified into offshore shares, property, infrastructure, bonds and other alternative assets in a bid to reduce the volatility of your fund's performance. The idea was that, if the bottom falls out of one asset class, it should be offset by others that perform well. Even after that realignment, however, a normal balanced fund would have about 20 per cent of your savings invested in the local market. Luckily, that bias was working well until April because our stock market was shrugging off the global woes. Most other assets, however, were doing rather badly and, unusually, all at once. The sudden re-emergence of inflation — and the drastic rate hikes from central bankers to tame it — temporarily junked the theory around diversification. And, now, local stocks have joined the plunge. International shares, which make up about 30 per cent of most superannuation portfolios, have been on the slide since Christmas. If you've been stunned by the sudden drop in our market last week — which has helped shave 15 per cent from April's peak — consider this. Wall Street is down 23 per cent since January. The technology-heavy Nasdaq, which has driven the stellar performance on Wall Street for more than a decade, is off 32 per cent. As for cryptocurrency, well, don't even go there. At last glance, the entire market was in chaos, with overall losses now more than 70 per cent from the peak. This may come as a shock, but the driving force behind all investments is not the stock market. It is bond markets. Essentially, bonds are IOUs. Both governments and corporations issue them when they raise debt, usually with the promise of a set interest or coupon rate for a given period of time, say 10 years. Once issued, they are traded on open markets that dwarf stock markets. Vast trillions of dollars are invested in them, and the sheer weight of that money makes them the foundation, the bedrock that dictates performance in everything, from interest rates to property, stocks and currencies. In fact, Bill Clinton's advisor, James Carville — the man who famously coined the phrase ""It's the economy, stupid"" — is just as famous for this line: ""I used to think that, if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the President or the Pope. But now I want to be the bond market because you can intimidate everybody."" The past year has been truly intimidating. It has been the worst year on record for US government bonds, with losses of 12 per cent. To put that into context, the second-worst year was 1984, when they shed 2.9 per cent. Because governments rarely default, bonds are considered to be risk-free. That's why they attract so much money and so much attention. For the past 40 years, as interest rates have declined, they have delivered huge gains. Being risk-free, however, doesn't mean you can't lose money on them as many big professional funds managers suddenly have discovered. There's an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices. If punters think rates will fall, they bid up bond prices. And that's been the one-way bet for more than 40 years. Suddenly, however, everything has been thrown into reverse. So, what does this have to do with you? You've got US bonds in your superannuation fund portfolio. In any balanced fund, about 10 per cent of your savings are in what's known as fixed-interest investments. Because they are — or at least were —considered to be relatively safe, there are fewer of them in higher-risk options such as growth funds. But, if you have opted for safer alternatives such as a stable or conservative option, around a quarter of your investment is sitting in bonds … which have been shaken and stirred. Ask five different economists and you'll get 10 different answers. On the one hand … However, it is difficult to see any quick market recovery any time soon. The surge in stock prices that rapidly followed the crash in February 2020 came about because central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, not only slashed interest rates to zero, they also printed money like there was no tomorrow. Global financial markets have taken a hit lately, and super has been caught up in the turmoil. Should you be worried? They'd been doing it for a decade — ever since the GFC wreaked havoc — and it hadn't even looked like firing-up inflation. So, during the pandemic, central banks — including our very own RBA — jumped in on the action. In the past few years, each time the Fed tried to withdraw some of that printed cash, stocks tanked and the Fed nervously retreated. Now, with inflation on the march, it has no option. It is going to start aggressively pulling that cash back out to take the heat out of the economy. And, since the pandemic pump, it now has an eye-watering $US9 trillion ($13 trillion) to retrieve. That, effectively, will amplify the impact of rate hikes. Instead of buying up US government bonds — as it was doing during the GFC and pandemic — it will be selling them, mopping up cash and pushing interest rates higher. Mounting deficits, a mountain of debt, an overstimulated economy and ill-disciplined spending all await incoming prime minister Anthony Albanese, writes Ian Verrender. That will also cause bond prices to continue tanking, which will continue to weigh on all asset markets and on your superannuation fund. Until last week — when the US Fed rammed through a triple rate hike in one go — it seemed as if the retreat on financial and property markets would be relatively orderly. However, with another triple hike expected next month — followed by doubles in September and November and singles in December, January and March — orderly isn't the adjective that readily springs to mind. The only thing that might cause the Fed to back off and chill out a little is the prospect of recession, which is not really a comforting scenario.

12,analysis: AFL Round-Up: Top-eight chaos as season sits perfectly poised for the run home,analysis-and-opinion," Sport AFL Round-Up: Top-eight chaos as 2022 season sits perfectly poised for the run home It was a week of upsets and top-eight movement, setting the table for the home stretch of an enthralling season. Welcome to the Round-Up, where we digest the week that was. Of all of the three bye weeks, this one felt the most bye week-ish. The big dogs at the top of the ladder had a week off, so attentions were turned a little lower down. Luckily the goings on down there — and by that we mean from about fourth to 12th — is pretty compelling. In fact we've got one of the craziest finals races in recent memory brewing here. The big movers this week were Richmond, whose win over Carlton both went some way to re-establishing the old order and brought the Tigers back into flag consideration. Such is the evenness of this season across the board, Richmond's experience on the biggest stage and in the biggest games will become an asset. The same could be said for Geelong, who have once again quietly been sucked in by the gravitational pull of the top four. We've said all year there is likely to be one vacant spot in the top four and any number of teams capable of taking it. Right now, the smart money would be on one of Geelong or Richmond making it their own by the end of the season. Perhaps that is overreacting to one round, but it's hard to get too hyped about Sydney or St Kilda after their massively disappointing showings this weekend. Both were smacked by teams well below them on the ladder, mustering little fight and showing little resolve once their attacking instincts were headed off. The Swans in particular have been wildly unpredictable this year, their best just about untouchable and their worst barely worth registering. Collingwood, Gold Coast and the Western Bulldogs are lurking just outside that top eight now. Sporadic brilliance might not be enough to cut it in the race for the eight this year. We normally try not to get too ahead of ourselves in the Round-Up, but it's hard not to look at next week and not get excited. It's as if these three bye weeks were all just to set us up for round 15, when the 2022 season moves into its glorious home stretch with everything still up for grabs. Check out these fixtures: It's probably good that Richmond publicly told Shai Bolton off for his showboating, but internally I hope they were far less critical. He is a special player whose flair and showmanship should be protected at all costs. West Coast produced their best performance of the year this week, and Geelong one of their more timid. In a weird win-win, the Eagles would have been happy with their intent and performance and the Cats simply happy to get out of there with the points. We put a line through Port Adelaide last week here. Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. As long as there is a mathematical chance, any team with those key-position weapons can't be completely discounted. It was hard to know where to look during the Giants' and Bulldogs' 80s throwback game, but it was very easy to know where not to look. Cody Weightman's elbow. Returning to play after that might go some way to killing off some of the chatter around the young gun and ""the way he goes about it"". Good for Essendon. It would have been pretty easy to shut up shop in the third quarter after St Kilda basically erased the deficit in about five minutes, but to find the willingness to go again shows there is still something about this team. The Dons can really underline the point with a win over West Coast next week. Wil Powell's injury was the sort of one that can rattle teammates so thoroughly they struggle to see out the game. The Suns couldn't afford that and did well to finish the job. But holy cannoli, poor Wil Powell. Here we take stock of who is leading the race for the season's individual awards. A slow week in the Rising Star race with many of the frontrunners sitting out, but Nic Martin gave a timely reminder of his credentials. We've still got Nick Daicos in front for now, but it's going to be genuinely exciting to see which of the chief contenders — Daicos, Martin, Jai Newcombe and Sam De Koning — run away with this thing. Sam Draper can take home mark of the week honours with this solid entry. Not nearly enough to trouble Cam Zuurhar's lead though. Slim pickings on the goal front his week too, so we'll chuck it to Jack Billings for this one from the same game. Ed Langdon's grip on the GOTY title remains.

13,"analysis: Five words set NSW on the path to spend billions on women's inequality, but is the government too late?",analysis-and-opinion,"  How five words set NSW on the path to spend billions on women's inequality, but is the government too late? When prominent businesswoman Sam Mostyn walked to the podium at the National Press Club in Canberra last year, few who followed NSW politics could have anticipated the impact it would have on policy in this state. She declared ""we need wholesale immediate change"" to increase female workforce participation and ensure respect for women overall. The date was November 24 and the freshly minted Treasurer Matt Kean was watching her speech on television from his office in Sydney and afterwards decided to call her. It set off a chain of events, that led to about $12 billion being committed in funding in the lead-up to Tuesday's budget directly targeting female inequality. The funding addresses three areas: economic opportunities, safety and health. The biggest spend by far— more than $10 billion — has been on improving affordability and accessibility of child care, and an overhaul of the preschool system, with the aim of making it more financially viable for women to get back in the workforce. The government wanted to ensure its plans did not go unnoticed, with the week leading up to the budget almost exclusively devoted to women's announcements. Days out from the budget, the billions committed to social issues is the Premier learning from the federal poll, expert says. There were three days of major childcare commitments as well as initiatives to get more women working in construction, and changes to parental leave for the public sector, entitling fathers to 14 weeks. Then there has been $100 million offered for domestic violence support services and anti-street harassment initiatives, both designed to address the safety aspect of the women's package. And there had already been health commitments around funding for IVF and menopause hubs. Many of these funding commitments are in direct response to findings from the government's Women Economic Opportunities Review, which was set up in February and chaired by Ms Mostyn. Last year, Mr Kean had been looking for a way for the state government to combat the growing wave of anger among female voters sweeping the nation and after watching Ms Mostyn's National Press Club address thought she could have the answers. He was one of the few government MPs who attended the women's March4Justice protest in Sydney in 2021, and unlike many of his Liberal colleagues in Canberra and NSW, decided it was a ""politically defining moment"". So, after speaking to Ms Mostyn eight months later, he set up the women's review with her as the head, insisted the findings would be the centrepiece of his budget and established a women's panel within the Treasury department to make it happen. And Premier Dominic Perrottet has been on board. Their determination to deliver the women-focused budget only deepened after the results of the federal election. Mr Kean's first budget as Treasurer is as much strategic as it is practical, it's sending a signal to women voters that they've been heard, finally. And voters might be forgiven for being sceptical about the pre-election epiphany of a government that's been in power for 11 years, almost five of which under the leadership of a female premier. In the 2019 state election, Gladys Berejiklian's appeal to women in the 30 to 50 age bracket was crucial to her success, and her connection to that voter group endured through her time in the top job. But without a woman at the helm, the government was left exposed to having low female representation within the Liberal Party as well as a lack of policies directed to women. There's also a personal side to the change of direction. Both the Treasurer and Premier are living the working family, juggle with young children. And Mr Kean concedes it's opened his eyes to the challenges facing many families. But while the Treasurer and Premier are positioning themselves as modern men based on their family home, not much is changing within the house on Macquarie Street. In February's by-election, the Liberals ran Tim James to replace Ms Berejiklian, the Premier appointed seven women to his 26-minister cabinet — just one more than under Ms Berejiklian's leadership. And in the past 13 months, when two Liberal positions became available in the Upper House, men were picked to replace the vacating male MLCs. Change obviously takes time and while the Coalition has been in power for more than a decade in NSW, it appears to be listening to women now. The question is: have female voters stopped listening to the Coalition nine months out from a state election?

14,analysis: That selfie you posted can be used to train machines — which might not be a bad thing,analysis-and-opinion,"  That selfie you posted can be used to train machines — which might not be a bad thing Did you hear the one about the person who shared a smoking-hot selfie on social media? It got plenty of likes, but the biggest was from the tech companies who used it to train their artificial intelligence systems. This week, consumer group CHOICE revealed retail giants Kmart, Bunnings and The Good Guys have been using facial recognition technology to capture the biometric data of consumers in some of their stores. Bunnings told CHOICE it was used to ""identify persons of interest who have previously been involved in incidents of concern in our stores"". Kmart and The Good Guys did not respond to the ABC's requests for comment. As part of its investigation, CHOICE asked more than 1,000 people what they thought about this technology – 65 per cent said it was concerning and some described it as ""creepy and invasive"". You may agree, but it's worth considering how this kind of surveillance stacks up with the decisions we make every day to give our personal data and images away willingly. Sharing selfies on social media platforms, using a streaming service or loyalty card all divulge more personal information than the facial recognition technology CHOICE was probing. Although Meta, the global behemoth that owns Facebook and Instagram, stopped using the tech last year, that doesn’t mean your pictures aren't still harvested by companies who build searchable databases of faces. That might be news to many people, and it may even prompt some to delete their accounts. Most won't. ""The algorithms will interpret these photos and use those results to better identify the individual captured in the surveillance image,"" said Dennis B Desmond, an expert in cyberintelligence at the University of the Sunshine Coast. And it doesn't matter if they are high- or low-quality images. ""Bad or blurry images are also useful in training the algorithm, since surveillance imagery is not always full face, front-facing, or clear and non-pixelated,"" he said. Dr Desmond said many people don't understand what they can obtain in exchange for giving up a certain level of privacy. In Osaka, Japan facial-recognition tech is used at some train stations to let people pass through turnstiles without having to get out their travel card. Retailers rely on it to reduce shoplifting. They can be notified if someone who has stolen from the store before enters it again. Law enforcement agencies across Australia use it to disrupt serious and violent crime, as well as identity theft. Dr Desmond said if people heard more about these tangible benefits, they might have a different attitude. ""People see a lot about the collection, but they rarely hear about the use of this data for interdiction or prevention,"" he said. But our feelings towards this technology, which was first conceived in the 1960s in the US, likely won't change until there's more transparency. Online, people can somewhat restrict what data is stored by changing their cookie preferences. But, short of wearing a disguise, we can't opt in or out of facial recognition when it's used in settings like retail. In fact, there's no right to personal privacy in Australia, and no dedicated laws about how data obtained through facial recognition can be used, unless you live in the ACT. Sarah Moulds, a senior law lecturer at the University of South Australia, doesn't believe facial recognition is inherently bad, but said three crucial elements need clearing up: consent, quality and third-party use. If people haven’t consented to surveillance, if they can’t trust the vision is high quality and if they don’t know who the data is being shared with, they have a right to be concerned, Dr Moulds said. High-quality imaging is of particular importance to reduce racial biases, as the technology is most accurate at identifying white men. Because of this, Australia's Human Rights Commission has warned against using facial-recognition images in ""high-risk circumstances"". “We should not be relying on this technology when it comes to things like proving the innocence of someone or determining someone's refugee status or something like that,” Dr Moulds said. For a lot of people, it won’t really matter if their face is scanned in certain settings. Things become more complicated if that biometric information is combined with other data, like their financial or health records. Experts say from that combination, someone could infer things like how much you earn, what your educational level is and what you get up to on the weekend. It could also help companies make decisions on whether to give you credit, insurance, a job. The list goes on. “It becomes kind of like the Minority Report … people worry companies are going to make decisions on my health care based on the fact that I'm buying chocolate every week,"" Dr Desmond said. But the reality is, this kind of data is already available through our online activities, which have been harvested and sold for years. Notwithstanding that, Dr Desmond said lawmakers need to take a more proactive approach to regulating facial recognition. ""I think there absolutely needs to be more government regulation and control over the technologies that are employed in the commercial sector when they involve the privacy and the rights of individuals,"" he said. Dr Moulds said tougher laws are also imperative if vulnerable people — such as those without formal identification documents — are to be protected from the potential misuse of artificial intelligence. And, ultimately, there will always be people who just want to enjoy the freedom to be forgotten when they walk out of a supermarket. ""[Because] as we have seen, neither the government nor the private sector have very good records of keeping our data safe from loss misuse,"" Dr Desmond said.

15,analysis: Another energy crisis suggests little was learned from SA's infamous state-wide blackout,analysis-and-opinion,"  South Australia has already had an energy crisis like this, but it seems there are still lessons to be learned A suspended electricity spot market, rolling blackouts because of supply shortages, a ""botched transition"" to renewable energy – these terms were all used to describe the state's energy crisis of 2016/17, long before the troubles of today. But has anyone learned from SA's hard lessons in those difficult months for the state's energy sector? The situations have many parallels. As Australia sizzled in the heatwaves of the 2017 summer, the country's energy market was in crisis. In SA, demand exceeded supply and 90,000 homes and businesses in Adelaide were cut off from power. New South Wales faced a similar situation two days later. Months earlier, SA had gone through its infamous 2016 blackout, a cascading failure of infrastructure and systems that sent shock waves through the electricity sector. Now, energy companies are again considering cutting customers off from electricity, not because they can't generate enough, but because there isn't enough to buy. Both crises are very similar, said Danny Price, the managing director of Frontier Economics, who was hired to advise the SA government after the blackout. ""We saw the same thing in South Australia and we're seeing it again now six years later,"" he told the ABC. Mr Price blames the Australian Energy Market Operator, AEMO, for the problems. ""This is a systems operator failure,"" Mr Price said. The agency's job is to manage the National Energy Market and ensure there is enough supply of electricity and gas. It can influence or control what energy companies do, what they pay for gas, and what they are paid for electricity. In 2016 and 2017, AEMO was criticised for failing to ask electricity generators to ""spin up"" reserve power ahead of the one-in-50-year storm that triggered the statewide blackout. Although the question of who was to blame for the multiple failures that led to SA's ""Black System"" remains contentious. Generators who were paid to provide ""black start"" capacity in the event of a system failure were not able to do so when everything went dark. After power was restored, AEMO then suspended the electricity spot market in SA for two weeks. Today, with ageing coal generators failing and the price of gas skyrocketing, Mr Price said AEMO had not reassured electricity companies they would make enough money if they bought more gas to generate extra power. ""This is another failure by AEMO… to convey how people should respond to administrative pricing versus directions,"" he said in reference to the AEMO decision to suspend the national electricity spot market. Electricity generators had been withdrawing capacity from the market after AEMO imposed price caps, for fear they could not cover their costs, forcing the operator to direct them to supply electricity and triggering compensation arrangements. ""The real evil out of this is because it then generates this belief in politicians and regulators that the generators are doing something wrong, so the public has been turned against the generators and it's not their fault,"" Mr Price said. ""They're just responding to the incentives and directions they've been given."" In 2017, Mr Price helped the then-Labor state government lease and install emergency power stations to ensure the state wasn't left short again. But those generators were never used and were later privatised by the subsequent Liberal government. Mr Price said states should consider doing the same thing again to ensure there is adequate generation capacity as coal power stations age. ""They should take their own actions,"" he said. ""I would encourage every state to think about exiting the national electricity market arrangements, just get out of it. They don't need to be in it. ""It's not necessary to stay in the national electricity market to keep the lights on this, it is just a completely broken heap of rubbish. ""States need to take back control themselves because nothing nationally is going to happen which is going to be in their interest."" AEMO said the current problems are due to planned and unplanned outages at power stations, an early start to winter, low output from wind and solar farms and planned outages in transmission infrastructure. It declined to comment on Mr Price's criticisms and referred questions about its management of the energy sector to its statement on the suspension of the National Electricity Market. ""We are confident (these) actions will deliver the best outcomes for Australian consumers, and as we return to normal conditions, the market based system will once again deliver value to homes and businesses,"" that statement said. But Mr Price said the reliance on ageing coal power stations to cover peak demand periods in winter and summer while the grid transitions to renewables was going to make things worse in the future. ""If anyone thinks this is going to go away, it's not, because every day that these generators are run and run harder because of the requirement to do so to meet demand, they get more and more worn out,"" he said. ""They don't get fresher over time. They get more worn out over time. So this problem only gets worse."" The director of the energy program at the Grattan Institute, Tony Wood, said AEMO was not to blame for the problems. ""I think there was just enormous frustration on both sides with the situation, I think the market had failed, the market wasn't responding to the way markets work and therefore you had to admit, the market had failed and implement what they've done and when they fix the physical system, normal service will be returned."" He also urged states not to consider leaving the National Electricity Market (NEM). ""I think all the states benefit,"" he said. ""Now, whether or not there are things about the NEM that are not by any means perfect, and all the work to sort out the capacity mechanism and the way interstate generation gets built, and so on, is a work in progress that hasn't been done as quickly as should have been."" ""(But) South Australia at times benefits by sending electricity to the other states, because generators get paid for that. ""When you've got more than we need, and you benefit by getting electricity from the other side. And all the states benefit from that.""

16,analysis: Rebel Wilson scooping a newspaper columnist was entirely predictable. What came next wasn't ,analysis-and-opinion,"  The Rebel Wilson affair reveals how inadequate the humble columnist is in the new empire of the celebrity god ""Watching every little mannerism, jotting down notes on how we sit, stand, talk, and even move. And all in that horrible, snide, corkscrew English."" — Tracey Lord, The Philadelphia Story A confession: I love a good gossip columnist. I was trained as a reporter among the best of them, and they horrified and enthralled me in equal measure. The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald housed an impressive salon of witheringly unkind scribes, whose name alone could chill a room colder than the imported fizz they preferred. There was Lawrence Money, who tormented the socialite hairdresser Lillian Frank with the moniker ""celebrity barber""; and Chris Webb, one of the strangest cats you could ever meet, who wrote a cool, arch dissection of the business world. There was Peter Smark, whose capacity for bitchiness was breathtaking and was the writer everyone feared; and the delightfully wicked Richard Ackland, who gossiped on the slightly higher plane of the legal world, a place no less naughty or appalling than any of the others. What these brash and shameless writers taught me was you had to have a hell of a hide and not give one single damn about what anyone might think of you. You had to choose to live in discomfort and opprobrium — and be at peace with making some people's lives hell every time they opened their paper with trembling hands. The tone could indeed be snide, as Tracey Lord reminds us, but the English was often quite brilliant. So, to get to the point. It was perfectly clear that the Sydney Morning Herald and gossip columnist Andrew Hornery wanted the scoop — a massive celebrity reveal of someone's sexuality — when he forewarned actor Rebel Wilson he was onto news of her first open relationship with another woman. Actress Rebel Wilson has responded to claims that she revealed her relationship with a woman because an Australian newspaper was going to ""out"" her. If you're in the celebrity gossip game, of course you would want it. And you would push hard to get it first and to get it to yourself. But whereas my esteemed peers in the gossip game of years gone by knew there was only one way out of the corner once a columnist with a pointed pen had backed you in — and that was either out through their paper or through the competitor's paper, on whatever terms you could negotiate — this world is very, very different. The ethics of outing won't take long to discuss: don't do it, or if you choose to do it, cop the backlash that comes with it and shut up — easy. But I think what Hornery and the paper failed to take account of was a power exchange between media and celebrity that is now not so much complete as absolute. Forget the old adage about not picking a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel: the celebrities own the means of reproduction now, and they do so to the power of numbers you can't even imagine. When Justin Bieber wanted to inform the world that he'd been struck down by a virus that has paralysed one side of his face, he posted a video on Instagram. He has more than 240 million followers. (The Saturday edition of the Herald, in which the Hornery column appears, has on average 489,000 readers.) Bieber probably won't give an interview about it, nor will he when he returns. He'll just tell his fans, they'll amplify it via their social media and within 24 hours billions around the world will know. If he did want to talk about it, then it might be with Oprah — and she owns the entire network and distribution via which we'd hear it. The Kardashians have set the benchmark in this self-defined and self-owned information world, being not only the subjects, the producers and the distributors of their content, but also both the source and reporters of news about their content — which is themselves. It's like a hall of mirrors, each reflection more unreal and a little more ghastly than the one before. So when Wilson beat the Sydney Morning Herald to the punch by revealing her new paramour herself, it was not only entirely to be expected but showed up how woefully inadequate the humble newspaper columnist is in this new Roman empire of the celebrity god. Am I sad about this? I don't know. Frankly, we in the media haven't done ourselves any favours over the past couple of decades with a lack of accountability, opacity about sources and conflicts, and an unwillingness to own errors that have disillusioned the millions of viewers and readers we once had. Country music singer songwriter Beccy Cole says people should be left to unveil their relationship status on their own terms, revealing the time she was almost outed. Like any other consumer, I also quite like having what seems like direct access to the stars I admire. When one of these stars is willing, however, to sit down with a journalist of insight and wit and style, then that's something else. The interview or the article can still be a thing of wonder: another eternal wrestle between subject and interlocutor that reveals so much beyond the filters. For mine, the most egregious aspect of this entire affair was the peevish and complaining article that revealed the failed gotcha in the first place, and the palpable outrage of a writer being got. Now that really was something else, and it belled the cat on how some aspects of the old media still don't get it — the celebrities own the presses now, we in the media just get the notifications. This weekend we have great news about dementia research, going off-grid, and you can spend time learning about the songlines of the wonderful Leah Purcell. Have a safe and happy weekend, and do you remember me sharing with you that wonderfully defiant song from Gamilaraay woman Thelma Plum, Better in Blak? Well, this is her new one. If you love a driving song, roll down the windows and crank this. She has a perfect pop sensibility and I love it. Go well.

17,"analysis: After Peru, it's back to the drawing board for Socceroos boss Graham Arnold",analysis-and-opinion,"  After the Socceroos' gruelling World Cup qualification, it's back to the drawing board for head coach Graham Arnold Just for a moment, Graham Arnold can take a breather. There is relief all around now that the Socceroos have qualified for the FIFA World Cup. He held his head in his hands during the penalty shootout against Peru; unable to bring himself to watch, he relied instead on the reaction of the players and staff around him to know whether Australia was going through or whether his job finished there and then, on the sidelines of Khalifa International Stadium. But if you thought the road to qualification was dramatic, that's not the half of it. Off the pitch, Arnold has had to be many things, from psychologist to politician, navigating COVID-19 challenges, player crises, and more, with the tenacity of a world-class boxer mixed with the strategic mindset of a chess grand master. Now, 1,008 gruelling days after this qualification period began, he has a brief moment to sit and reflect on the journey so far. What comes to mind, at first, is something Justin Langer once said. ""I read this great article Justin Langer wrote when he was Australian cricket coach, talking about how lonely coaching the national team is, and it resonated very much with me,"" Arnold told The Ticket. The Socceroos coach is quick to point out he has ""great staff"" around him which, ""especially during COVID, was very special"". But despite their unflinching support, not a single one of them can know the extent of the constant stomach churn and inner debate a head coach must wrestle with incessantly. Building a team culture that unites a group of journeymen in order to achieve something greater than their individual talents is a 24/seven mission. All the while, the loneliness of a head coach knows the media will be quick to doubt you, seizing on any perceived weakness. Their words impact those closest to you like poisonous darts finding their target, sometimes sowing the seeds of discontent in the minds of some of those watching on from head office. A head coach accepts the position with the sword of Damocles hovering overhead. ""That's something that's never bothered me because you can only focus on what we can do, and I'm just here to help the players,"" he said. ""Coaching has changed so much over time… the generation of people and the players. ""Just being there to support the players, more than being a 'dictating' coach, which I probably was when I was younger. ""Now it's more about the players taking ownership, and caring for the players, and making sure that they're mentally right and you're showing that type of support. ""These boys, they've been through a lot over the last year and a half with COVID, not being able to get back to Australia. ""Some of these boys had long COVID and missed a couple of camps, and then we lost players due to COVID. I missed two camps with COVID as well, and so it's been tough. But when you stick at it [and] really make those sacrifices, then everything is possible and achievable."" While COVID has been the great disruptor to many people's lives over the past two years, one gets the sense it has become a blanket of sorts, masking many other personal crises that players have gone through and which Arnold has had to deal with. What the world sees when the team plays a game is like the serving of a meal: those who consume it are oblivious to what happened during its lengthy preparation. ""What you get on the field is what you actually do off the field,"" Arnold said. ""If, off the field, you build a great culture, a family culture where people care for each other, and people are prepared to work for each other, and people are loyal to each other, then you get the result on the field. ""At the end of the day, the game is only 90 minutes, but if the players don't go out on the pitch and be prepared to give everything they've got for each other, then you're never going to be successful. ""One of the most important things in coaching is making sure you get that right."" Arnold's journey to this year's World Cup has been 40 years or more in the making. As a kid, he played rugby league at school and soccer on weekends. He was coached throughout his junior years by his dad in an era when well-being meant nothing and toughening up was all that mattered. For more than a decade, Arnold was a Socceroos striker in a national team that came agonisingly close to breaking the team's decades-long World Cup drought, but it wasn't to be. Destiny sometimes arrives through a different door than the one we walk through. ""It has been a long journey,"" Arnold said. ""But I just have the passion for Australian football. I just want to help kids and help the players fulfil their dreams, because I feel very blessed and privileged that I've had the life that I've had in Australian football. If everyone could have a life like I've had, I'd be very happy."" So, what's it going to take for the Socceroos to win a World Cup? ""I don't think I'll be alive when that happens, but the game in Australia — the growth in the game — means the Socceroos are only as strong as the development system. ""People talk about the golden generation and all those players, and they're all in the Premier League and all that… and that's all around the development system. ""We have to get the game right at junior level because there's so many different things that are happening that shouldn't be happening for the kids."" Expense being one of them. The cost of tapping into development football has shut out large sections of the Australian community. With many families priced out of junior football, one club in Perth has waived fees and signalled a new direction for grassroots sport, writes Samantha Lewis. ""One hundred per cent. Most people that are successful in life are the ones that have been brought up the hard way, and they can't afford to play the game."" Does that description fit with Arnold's own childhood experiences? ""Yes,"" he says. ""I lived in my grandmother's garage for 24 years. That's where I grew up. ""My mum and dad had no money. My dad was a cab driver. My mum died when I was 18 or 19. ""I learned the hard way. And living in the garage was probably not the greatest upbringing, but I had a fantastic family around me… my brother was a fantastic support for me over all these years. ""When you get bought up the hard way, that's when you appreciate things more in life."" The greatest players of all time have emerged from the struggles Arnold describes: Those who develop their skills in bare feet or on dirt roads are those who know they must fight to survive. Nothing is handed to them. It is no surprise they also have a love affair with the game: they play with a different kind of passion. There are plenty of Australians who love the international game but are priced out of the pathway system that leads to the national team. Arnold can't fix that. Football Australia can. The Moriarty Football Foundation is one that is knocking on the door with a huge, mostly untapped cohort of young First Nations players that are talented but raw; hungry for the same opportunities others are handed. Arnold's mission now is to work on a few more surprise moves, like this week's goalkeeper substitution, replacing Socceroos captain Mat Ryan with Andrew Redmayne, leaving Peruvian penalty takers perplexed. That psychological ploy was likely the difference in getting Australia to the World Cup while Peru has to wait four more years. ""I need a break for a bit,"" Arnold says. ""I've been away for seven weeks already now and managing fifty-odd people every day, it gets quite fatiguing. ""But the most important thing is they are happy and the staff and the players have an integrated mindset. ""I will have a break and the boys all go back to their clubs and today there's a clean sheet of paper again. Those boys, the ones who qualified us, it's not automatic that those 23 are selected (for the World Cup). ""They've got to go back to their clubs and work hard and perform well because to play for your nation we need the elite. ""I'll be watching them… sitting back and enjoying watching them play."" Arnold is reminded there are only 23 Wednesdays until Australia plays France in its opening match in Qatar. ""Is that right? I haven't even thought about it,"" he laughs. The time for reflection is over. It's back to the drawing board for Graham Arnold, only the third Australian in history charged with guiding the Socceroos through a World Cup campaign.

18,analysis: No let-up to share market sell-off as recession fears build,analysis-and-opinion,"  No let-up to share market sell-off as recession fears build There are some heavy emotions attached to the share market, aren't there? Emotions like greed and fear, and the anxiety attached to uncertainty. This week has seen the Australian Securities Exchange swiped sideways by heavy selling. The benchmark ASX200 index closed Friday's session down 116 points, or 1.7 per cent, to 6,474 points. So, from its all-time high set in August last year, the Australian share market is now down 15 per cent. To be classed as a ""bear"" market, it will need to fall at least a further 5 per cent. So will it? And then what happens? Let's take a look. Global shares are down around 6 per cent, and Australian shares are down by around 7 per cent (as of Friday afternoon) on the week. Stock falls have been led by technology stocks and resources (miners), retailers and financials (banks). There are fears we could be on the verge of another global recession and investors are spooked. From their all-time highs last year or early this year, US shares have now fallen 24 per cent, and global shares have fallen 21 per cent. So, what's going on? It's actually painfully simple: global inflation is on the march up. In response, central banks around the world have raised interest rates. The US Federal Reserve decided to be quite aggressive on that front, raising its ""Fed Funds"" rate — equivalent to the RBA's cash rate target — by 0.75 per cent. It was the sharpest increase in its benchmark rate since 1994. Economists say the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates and that has the potential to push the economy into a recession. ""I now foresee a US recession within the next 12 months,"" BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese said. What about Australia? Well, National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster mentioned in a podcast this week he saw the chances of Australia entering a recession now at 30 per cent. But some, like AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver, think it's more likely than that ""We remain of the view that a global recession can be avoided, but with central banks now hiking rates aggressively, the risks have increased to the point that it's now close to 50/50,"" he said. Dr Oliver has seen his fair share of financial market movements. In his previous role as head of investment strategy at AMP Capital, he also oversaw over $1 billion in managed funds. He said it's too early to call an end to the current wave of selling. ""It's still too early to say that shares have bottomed,"" Dr Oliver wrote. Why? Here's the crucial point. Financial markets are speculating right now about how much damage rising rates will do to business bottom lines and therefore the health of the economy. We simply won't know how much damage rising rates have done, or will do, until companies announce their annual profits later in the year, or other official data is released. Until then, economists and market analysts will look for evidence, and any evidence they find that's not encouraging about the economy, will likely send shares lower still. There's a lot of emotional energy attached to these market movements too (worn by the traders), so the volatility we've seen in recent months is likely to remain. Not to mention the sheer volume of money being carried through the financial markets, and the stress attached to that. There's a lot a stake.

19,analysis: Albanese is quickly realising Keating wasn't joking — you should never get between a premier and a bucket of money,analysis-and-opinion,"  Anthony Albanese is fast realising Paul Keating wasn't joking when he warned that you should ""never get between a premier and a bucket of money"". He's also quickly realising state parochialism trumps party loyalty. ""I will not settle for this Commonwealth government proceeding with Scott Morrison's cutbacks,"" Victorian Premier Dan Andrews warned ahead of yesterday's national cabinet meeting — Albanese's first as prime minister. The meeting took place as the bulk of the nation faced ongoing uncertainty about whether it will be able to turn the heating on at night. The energy grid is failing and requiring extraordinary intervention to keep the lights in the most populous cities. But the premiers and chief ministers had other thoughts on their mind when they travelled to Canberra to meet the new prime minister. Their hospitals are being overwhelmed with COVID patients. Hospital beds are full and the public system is buckling under the pressure. Whether Liberal or Labor, the leaders arrived united in wanting a pandemic-funding agreement to continue. That health is on their minds is also a reminder that there is no easy fix to the energy crisis that's engulfing everywhere except Western Australia. Getting a health cheque from the feds is much easier to resolve. The pandemic might have changed health funding, forcing the Commonwealth to contribute more to the states, but it also changed how premiers and chief ministers behave. They've been emboldened and rewarded by voters for putting their state's interests above the nation. The creation of national cabinet, a Scott Morrison invention to overhaul the former Council of Australian Governments, put the premiers on the same platform as the prime minister and they haven't looked back since. The Albanese government is blaming the energy crisis engulfing eastern Australia on the Coalition’s failure to put in place policy to ensure adequate and timely investment in renewables. That’s correct, but it’s not the whole story. National cabinet was born as Australia was facing an uncertain future. The Victorian and News South Wales premiers used it to force the nation into shutdown in those dark days of March 2020. It formed the basis for new-found agreement between the states and the Commonwealth and did what COAG so often struggled to do — achieve something. Albanese has made no secret of his dislike of national cabinet. It wasn't that long ago Labor was demanding a seat for the Opposition Leader in national cabinet. Peter Dutton need not wait by the phone, though — those calls seem to have died now Labor is in power. Albanese thinks local governments should have a seat at the table. He also thinks national cabinet has lost COAG's ability to streamline regulations, prevent duplication and establish nationally-consistent rules. It's no surprise Albanese rates these aspects of COAG. A career-politician, he's made a virtue out of following proper processes. Others argue COAG was where good ideas went to die, a bureaucratic quagmire of policy documents that achieve little more than gathering dust. The 2.0 version, national cabinet, all but sidelines the boffins and puts the leaders at a table. It essentially forces them to thrash out the issues facing the nation. But the empowered pandemic premiers — all Labor leaders who have sat at national cabinet since its inception — showed no signs of wanting to back Albanese's push for an overhaul. ""National cabinet worked well. It got us through a one-in-100 year event ... so national cabinet was always about getting things done,"" Andrews said ahead of the meeting. ""In terms of what I wanted ahead of the election, I wanted a new person chairing national cabinet and that is what we've got,"" he said. In the end, the premiers got their way in the meeting. National cabinet survives and will meet at least four times a year. Albanese got one concession, with the nation's Bob Jellys getting an invite once a year to advocate for local government. The new prime minister often talks about his desire for federation reform. It's not sexy, but Albanese argues it can drive productivity. On paper, now is his best chance at delivering on the changes he wants. Freshly elected and with political capital to burn, he benefits from having Labor counterparts in every jurisdiction except Tasmania and NSW. And with only a couple of elections on the horizon, the political landscape looks like to stay Labor-dominated for some time. But as recent days have shown, being from the same side of politics only goes some way to getting what you want out of the states. Victoria and NSW, despite being of different political stripes, regularly show how well they work together — most recently announcing a joint overhaul of preschool education. Their leaders' time in power leaves Albanese the chairman of national cabinet but one of the most inexperienced at navigating it. If this week is anything to go by, he's going to have to find a way to get WA, Victoria and NSW on board if he wants to achieve national reforms. Those states wanted their health money and they got it — at least until the end of the year. Albanese says the Commonwealth can't afford to keep paying it and will resist calls to make the funding arrangement permanent. Keating might do well to send Albanese a flak jacket. If he holds that line, he's going to find himself standing perilously between premiers and a bucket of money.

20,analysis: A mob got just 12 metres from a cowering Pence. But only one man can decide if Trump committed a crime,analysis-and-opinion,"  Will the January 6 hearings lead to an indictment of Donald Trump? It could be one man's decision As he desperately searched for a way to cling to power after losing the 2020 election, then-US president Donald Trump started piling the pressure on his running mate. It was Mike Pence's ceremonial duty as vice-president to certify the results of the election in the US Senate on January 6, 2021. In a private call that morning, witnessed by Trump's staff, he berated his deputy, calling him a ""wimp'"" and threatening they wouldn't be friends if Pence went through with it. In something of a pincer move, he also went public with his disapproval. Facing an unruly crowd gathered near the White House, Trump claimed Pence could ""stop the steal"" and prove his loyalty by ignoring the lawful votes. That mob then worked its way down the National Mall, before breaking into the US Capitol. Many protesters were calling for Pence's death, and cries of ""hang Mike Pence"" rang out as the crowd worked its way past security. They came within 12 metres of the vice-president who took shelter in a bunker below the Capitol. The allegations being raised before the US House committee investigating the Capitol riot have played out in dramatic fashion. With its slickly produced video evidence and star witnesses, the committee is hoping these hearings are as compelling as a punchy political thriller, in order to win over a distracted American people beset by serious economic woes. But the question now is whether Trump's behaviour crossed a legal threshold. Could these hearings actually lead to a former president being charged? If the committee maintains its momentum — and its audience — over the coming weeks, it could shift public opinion and, perhaps more importantly, lead to the US Department of Justice (DOJ) pursuing criminal charges. But only one potential viewer can deliver that knockout blow: the US Attorney-General, Merrick Garland. And, so far, he has stayed out of the spotlight. The question of how to achieve accountability for the violence of January 6 has hung over President Joe Biden's administration for more than 15 months. Whatever the committee finds, it does not have the power to indict Trump — that lies with the DOJ. It has also faced accusations of partisanship from Republicans, which make up only two of the committee's nine members. A plan for an independent commission, modelled on the one that investigated the 9/11 terror attacks comprised of five Democratic and five Republican commissioners, was rejected by Senate Republicans. The committee can, however, pass on the evidence it gathers to federal prosecutors, along with a non-binding criminal referral. Such a recommendation is not necessary for the DOJ to proceed with an investigation or indictment, which would be a calculated risk. In general, prosecutors like to be sure they have an airtight case before trying to convince a grand jury of criminal wrongdoing. ""I am watching and I will be watching all the hearings, although I may not be able to watch all of it live,"" Garland told reporters after the second hearing. ""I can assure you the January 6 prosecutors are watching all of the hearings, as well."" It's a rare public statement from the Attorney-General, who has faced increasing pressure to make his move. It followed an earlier admission that the Justice Department was undertaking ""one of the largest investigations in our history to hold accountable everyone who was criminally responsible for the January 6 assault on our democracy"". ""We will follow the facts wherever they lead,"" he said. The first hearing delivered damning testimonies from some of Trump's closest advisers, including his daughter Ivanka and former attorney-general William Barr. A testifying Capitol police officer gave a harrowing account of clashing with rioters and slipping in blood. All of that was woven together with previously unseen footage of the riot, at one point overlaid by audio of Trump describing ""the love in the air"" as the scene unfolded. The second hearing returned to election night, when an ""apparently inebriated"" Rudy Giuliani, then the president's lawyer, told his boss to claim victory despite numerous warnings from credible sources it was rapidly slipping away. But it was the final of the three, focused squarely on the plot to force Pence to block the peaceful transfer of power, which could prove the most consequential. In the days between election night and January 6, a behind-the-scenes tug of war took place after Trump learned Pence had a crucial constitutional role to play in certifying the election, multiple witnesses said. Trump allegedly launched a relentless campaign to force his long-time loyal deputy to reject the lawful votes of electors during a joint session of Congress, thereby blocking Joe Biden's win. ""President Trump was told repeatedly that Mike Pence lacks the constitutional and legal authority to do what Trump was demanding he do,"" committee member Liz Cheney said. ""Vice-president Pence understood that his oath of office was more important than his loyalty to Donald Trump. He did his duty. President Trump unequivocally did not."" But Trump continued to push, even when his supporters swarmed the building in which Pence stood. ""[Trump] knew that there was violence and he still tweeted the vice-president didn't have the courage to do what was necessary,"" Democratic congressman Pete Aguilar said. Aguilar also read a court filing citing a confidential FBI informant who said: ""The Proud Boys would have killed Mike Pence if given a chance."" The plot to stop the count was allegedly concocted by Trump and one of his then-lawyers, John Eastman, both of whom were repeatedly warned it had no legal basis. In video testimony, Eric Herschmann, a Trump White House lawyer, confirmed he told Eastman the scheme was unconstitutional. ""I said, 'You're going to cause riots in the streets,'"" he said. ""And he said words to the effect of, 'There's been violence in the history of our country, Eric, in order to protect the democracy or protect the republic.'"" Following the second hearing, Thompson ruled out making criminal referrals to the DOJ. ""No, that's not our job,"" he told reporters, when quizzed. ""Our job is to look at the facts and circumstances around January 6 — what caused it — and make recommendations after that."" Just hours later, however, Cheney refused to rule it out. ""We will announce a decision on that at an appropriate time,"" she said. Both Thompson and Cheney are former US attorneys, so whatever conclusion they reach is likely to resonate within the department, but several criminal offences could be on the table. The committee's dozens of investigators are scrutinising fundraising efforts that leveraged the power of the ""Big Lie"", and whether the plot to stop certification of electoral votes amounted to an obstruction of an official proceeding. It could also pursue charges against witnesses for lying under oath or stonewalling subpoenas in contempt of Congress. But one possible criminal charge on the cards for Trump and his allies could be ""conspiracy to defraud the United States"" by interfering with ""the proper transfer of presidential power"", one legal expert told the New Yorker. Despite his bookish demeanour, Garland is no stranger to political drama. He gained national prominence during one of the most contentious judicial battles in recent history, when he missed out on a plum posting on the US Supreme Court. The then-Judge Garland was former president Barack Obama's pick to fill a vacancy created by the death of conservative Antonin Scalia in 2016. But despite having more experience on the federal court than any previous nominee, among other impressive credentials, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell refused to consider the nomination during an election year. Eventually, it fell to Trump to fill the seat, along with two others. In January 2021, Biden tapped Garland for another coveted role: The nation's chief law-enforcement officer. The committee plans to collate its evidence into a comprehensive final report, due to be released in September. Although its investigation is ongoing, its deadline is tied to the midterm elections in early November, during which the Democrats may well lose their razor-thin majorities in the House and Senate. Any criminal referral could reinforce Trump's rhetoric that he is the victim of a political witch-hunt. In theory, the independent DOJ should be not influenced by elections. But Garland is likely acutely aware of the political fallout from former FBI director James Comey's decision to publicise an investigation into then-presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. During his 2016 election campaign, Trump famously declared he could shoot somebody on New York's Fifth Avenue and not lose any votes. The statement was crass but the message was clear: He knew behaviour that would sink his opponents rarely sticks to him. Despite being the only US president to be impeached twice in the House, he then shook off impeachment in the Senate. Notably, prior to these hearings, an increasing number of Americans said Trump bore no responsibility for the events of January 6. If the committee succeeds in wresting back the narrative, accountability may still prove elusive. But a DOJ indictment is not the only legal path forward. Trump is already embroiled in multiple legal battles. He is being sued by injured police officers, and members of Congress who say he conspired to incite the violence. He is also the subject of a separate criminal investigation in Georgia. Perhaps the most pressing of his legal woes, however, is a New York fraud investigation in which he will soon be forced to testify. Trump continues to be an influential figure in the Republican Party, still dangling the possibility of running for president in 2024. But his decades of good fortune may soon turn. Either way, it might be wise to heed the advice Herschmann said he gave Eastman: ""Get a great f***ing criminal defence lawyer.""
