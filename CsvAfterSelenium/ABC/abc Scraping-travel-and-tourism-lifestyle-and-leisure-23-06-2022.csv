Back to ruffle some feathers, the satirists from Shit Towns of Australia have put it to a vote and compiled a shortlist of what people believe are the most unusual or underwhelming ""big things"". Some people reckon the ""shittest"" poll is a bit of fun that helps draw attention to their towns; others take exception to being spoken about in such unflattering terms. The city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder is well known by some of the 560,000 followers of Shit Towns of Australia's Facebook page, where polls are conducted to decide which town is the nation's worst. The competition caused division in the Goldfields city in 2019 when it was in the running to take the national title of ""Shit town of the Year"". A group of local residents saw the competition as an opportunity to attract tourism and campaigned for people to vote for Kalgoorlie-Boulder. However, the city's mayor, John Bowler, was concerned the attention would deter people from moving to the town amid a worker shortage and asked people not to engage with the competition. The 2019 title was taken out by Logan in Queensland, but Kalgoorlie has been named ""WA's Shittest Town"" for the past three years. It's now in the running for ""Australia's Shittest Big Things"" after thousands nominated  its self-proclaimed World's Tallest Bin, which sits at the top of the main street on a patch of red dirt known as World's Tallest Bin Park. The bin is a long piece of pipe standing eight metres tall. According to local historian Tim Moore, it was installed in the early 1980s during a campaign to clean up Australia. While he remembered throwing cans into it as a kid, Mr Moore said there was not much else to it. Like the bin, Geoff Rissole — who co-created the ""shittest"" competitions with Rick Furphy — also has a self-appointed title as an expert in sociology, travel and culture, which he claimed after the pair's Shit Towns books, blogs and social media page took off. Mr Rissole is from New Zealand but said he and Mr Furphy had lived and travelled extensively in Australia. ""[We] found that Aussies and Kiwis share a similar self-deprecating sense of humour,"" he said. He draws inspiration from his hometown across the pond, which he declined to name due to the backlash from fellow residents. ""We periodically receive death threats from humourless man-babies, plus locals have begged us not to tell anyone because they don't want to be associated with us,"" he said. Mr Rissole said his top pick for the new category was the Big Merino in Goulburn, New South Wales, but it failed to make the final cut. ""It's supposed to be a giant ram but it doesn't really look like a sheep,"" he said. ""It looks like it was designed by someone who's had a sheep described to them over the phone, rather than ever actually having any interactions with the animal itself."" Mr Rissole said he was surprised the bin was in the top four but appreciated the lack of consideration into what it represented. ""Most big things will be promoting some aspects of the town, like an industry or some sort of tourist attraction. ""Kalgoorlie has gone, 'Nup! Just a giant bin, that's what we're about'."" He said the big bin was tracking well among voters, alongside the controversial ""Nazi-saluting"" Captain James Cook which stood a whopping eight metres high in the tropical Queensland city of Cairns for 50 years. The statue was considered offensive and was sold for $1 to a private buyer who relocated it to their property in Mount Molloy this year. Mr Rissole said another semi-finalist, the Big Potato, had a less political and more unhygienic kind of controversy surrounding it. ""You used to be able to go inside it, but they had to shut it recently because people were using it as a bathroom,"" he said. ""I don't know whether that's going to propel it to the top, but it's pretty bad."" While Mr Rissole said the competition was intended to be a bit of a laugh, the owner of the Giant Koala, Patricia Crute, did not think it was funny. Ms Crute's daughter made her aware of the fact the koala, which is actually a gift shop along the Western Highway in Dadswells Bridge in western Victoria, had made the shortlist. She said she was offended by the caption which depicts the koala as ""a gigantic red-eyed, hairy-eared replica of the only creature with more chlamydia than a local youth"". ""I was a bit disgusted actually by the comments that were put on there, because it's not like that at all,"" Ms Crute said. ""It's a tourist attraction that everybody admires."" Ms Crute said there was a boost in visitors to the koala after it was voted ""Australia's Best Big Thing"" in another online competition a few years ago. From giant bananas to huge prawns, there are more than 150 ""big things"" scattered across Australia and, perhaps surprisingly, some small towns are still building them. But she wasn't sure winning the title of ""Australia's Shittest Big Thing"" would have the same impact. ""Whether they come to make fun of our koala, I don't know,"" she said. But like Kalgoorlie locals a few years back, Grampians Tourism chief executive Mark Sleeman believes the light-hearted competition is a good thing for the region. ""This is a whole lot of fun and just helps profile our region and get our destination front of mind,"" he said. ""We've got the koala and I'm happy to stand by that. ""Whether it's the shittiest, the biggest or the loudest, we'll own it as it gets people talking about our region.""

1,Rex pilots to take industrial action that may affect passengers with 'minor changes' as pay negotiations fail,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Rex Regional Express pilots vote to take industrial action after pay negotiations fail Regional Express Airlines (Rex) pilots have voted to take industrial action over a pay dispute that could affect passengers from Carnarvon to Coffs Harbour and Coober Pedy. In the past week, 230 of Rex's SAAB-340 pilots took part in an online ballot to determine the extent of action against their employer. That ballot concluded on Wednesday. More than 90 per cent of the regional carrier's union member pilots who participated in the vote decided to take action. In response to the decision, Rex said it had ""put in place mitigating measures to ensure our services operate normally."" It followed a breakdown in pay negotiations, during which the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) claimed it had received a deal that was ""worse than previous offers"". That was refuted by a spokesperson for the regional carrier, who labelled the decision to knock back the pay deal as ""beyond belief"". The Rex spokesperson said it offered the pilots a 5 per cent pay increase now, and an additional 8 per cent when the company became profitable. AFAP confirmed they will start taking protected industrial action with three initial work actions, effective from Tuesday June 28. This includes not wearing some, or all, of the uniform. ""In addition to action concerning the wearing of uniforms, pilots will adopt a ban on loading extra fuel prior to flights, where the primary purpose for loading the extra fuel is to negate the need to refuel at the destination airport,"" an AFAP spokesperson said. ""The AFAP remains committed to reaching an agreement and is disappointed that we have had to take this action."" More than 95 per cent of pilots voted to ban working without at least 10 hours break between shifts while away from their home base, and 12 hours when at their home airport. The Rex spokesperson said it was working towards the same goal as AFAP. ""The union and the company are aligned in our desire to not have the travelling public impacted,"" the spokesperson said. ""Especially not during the school holidays when airports are expecting massive delays."" Want more local news? Sign up to the weekly ABC Broken Hill email newsletter The Fair Work Commission has approved eight different industrial actions, all of which were approved by a least a 90 per cent majority of union members. For regional customers worried they might be impacted, law dictates that the AFAP and pilots must provide Rex Regional Express with five days notice of any possible strike action. The Rex spokesperson said passengers could expect ""minor changes to our service delivery, for example the uniform worn may not be the standard one"", as well as the potential for four-hour-long work strikes. There is no date set for when pilots could walk off the job.

3,Beers flow again after iconic outback pub rebuilds after 'traumatic' fire,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tibooburra's iconic two-storey pub rises from the ashes after fire An Irish woman walks into a bar. The 140-year-old sandstone building smells of fresh paint and two flags fly above the spirits cabinet — one Irish, the other Australian. There's no punchline. The place just feels like home to bartender and backpacker Leona Keane. But 15 months ago Tibooburra's iconic two-storey pub was almost unrecognisable after a devastating fire. The building built from local sandstone in 1882 was a shell filled with ash and debris. The town of less than 150 people is located in the remote far north-west corner of New South Wales, more than 1,200 kilometres from Sydney and Brisbane, and almost 900 kilometres from Adelaide. According to Ms Keane, its isolation is its strength. ""The warmness and the kindness of people … I just fell in love with the place, the people, the outback, everything,"" she said. And from the ashes, hope has blossomed. With the beer flowing and the kitchen cooking meals again, Tibooburra Hotel owner Tracey Hotchin says the spirits of many in town are high. ""I can't thank everybody enough for what they did in trying to save the pub,"" she said. ""We've just received so much support throughout the journey."" As one of two pubs in town and the only two-storey building within at least a 300-kilometre radius, the fire was a huge blow to the community. ""It was a shock, everybody was just in shock, they couldn't believe it,"" Ms Keane said. For the owners it was a cruel blow, having poured their time, money and souls into the building. The cause of the fire was believed to be an electrical fault. ""It was a devastating couple of days just trying to take it in and work out what we were going to do with it,"" Ms Hotchin said. ""We'd renovated the hotel and spent a lot of money doing it up, and we were just in the process of starting to do our motel rooms down the back and beer garden."" John Ainsworth was the Tibooburra Fire Brigade captain at the time of the incident. He along with two other firefighters were seriously injured when a large gas bottle exploded. He said at the time there was a somewhat reckless and utterly selfless desire by residents to help bring the blaze under control. ""It was fairly traumatic for everybody and people were doing their best to help out,"" he said. ""They weren't caring about their own safety, they just wanted to get the fire out."" More than a year after the fire, and despite renovations and reopening being partially delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the pub now has dozens of customers through the doors each day. Ms Hothcin says it's hard to believe how far she and the business have come since the crushing devastation she felt in February last year. ""Some days it's overwhelming and you just sit back and think about where you come and we've come a long way,"" she said. ""We've got our motel rooms up and running now."" While the total cost of rebuilding may not be known for three or four years, there's little time to sit and wonder 'what if'. ""You've got to move on, you can't think about it,"" Ms Hotchin said. ""It doesn't do you any good if you're trying to think why, how, if or when."" While the fire was a devastating blow for the outback town, its resurrection from the ashes has strengthened the bond of many in the community. Residents, tourists and Leona Keane alike are hoping that the only way from here is up. ""Everybody is just amazed at the work that's gone on and how we're back open and how we've gotten back to this point,"" she said. ""There's a sense of happiness and obviously joy that we're getting through it,"" ABC Broken Hill will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Friday.

4,Australian Muslims 'devastated' by Saudi Arabia's new Hajj pilgrimage lottery,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Australian Muslims 'devastated' by Saudi Arabia's new Hajj pilgrimage lottery As 1 million Muslims have been preparing to make the journey of a lifetime to Islam's holiest sites, the Saudi government has made a surprise announcement that has devastated Islamic communities across Australia and the Western world. Muslims from Australia, New Zealand, the UK, North America and Europe initially rejoiced when Saudi Arabia announced in April that it would open its borders to allow foreigners in for the Hajj pilgrimage. Pilgrimages to the holy sites of Mecca and Madinah had been closed for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But once the jubilation subsided, questions from both communities and travel operators arose as the Saudi Ministry of Hajj made no further announcements. One travel operator from Melbourne, who spoke to the ABC anonymously for fear of repercussions from the Gulf nation, said he and others in the industry were not given any clear answers. ""They said they'll confirm before Ramadan and we waited. Eid came and nothing happened,"" he said. On June 6, the Saudi government made a surprise announcement: Muslims from Western countries were told to immediately cancel any existing flights and hotel bookings. It said anyone who wanted to go this year needed to apply through a randomised lottery system on the newly launched Motawif website — and they only had a four-day window to put in a bid. The change of rules has shocked Muslim communities across the West. Each country is assigned an allotment of places every year. Lottery systems exist in Muslim-majority countries to cope with population and religious demands, and they are government run. But the new lottery system limits the number of places to 1 million, whereas previously Muslims from Western countries could claim their own places through travel agencies and Hajj tours. And there are other restrictions on who is eligible to apply. Eligible candidates are those who are under 65, have up-to-date documentation, and are double-vaccinated against COVID-19. People making the pilgrimage for the first time will be placed in priority queues. Australia was allotted just over 2,000 spots for Hajj. Feroz from Sydney was one of the lucky few who got the green light, but he said the approval had just complicated his situation further. ""Racing through my head was my work commitments,"" he said. ""My leave request is yet to be approved and submitted. ""And the challenge is that you need to pay for your package within 48 hours or else you lose your spot. ""You don't have any specific dates at the point of EOI (expression of interest). You don't have any details about how long you'll be allowed to stay. ""Irrespective of whether I got approved or not, having that information beforehand would have made things easier."" The Hajj pilgrimage is a foundational pillar of Islam. Only 60,000 vaccinated pilgrims within Saudi Arabia will be allowed to participate in this year's hajj, as local authorities introduce tough measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It is compulsory for all Muslims of age to travel to holy sites in Mecca at least once in their life. The pilgrimage takes place over days during the month of Dhul Hijjah in the Islamic calendar and honours rituals of both the Prophet Abraham and the Prophet Mohammed that exist in Islamic theology. Thousands of Australian Muslims had been waiting since 2019 for the chance to go this year, ready to use their life savings to secure a spot. The Saudi government's decision has left another travel agent from Melbourne blindsided and reeling. ""It's completely devastated the whole market, not just from the travel agents' point of view, but for the pilgrims,"" the travel agent said. ""Not everybody is familiar with the internet. There are senior citizens who are unfamiliar with the processes online, who don't even have credit cards. ""So it's just a complete mess, to be totally frank with you."" In a statement, Saudi officials said the online lottery portal was introduced to crack down on Hajj-related scams run by fraudulent agents. There have been anecdotal reports of elderly Muslims being defrauded of thousands of dollars by thieves posing as Hajj tourism operators. But the ACCC said in a statement it was unable to provide any statistics on complaints relating to Hajj scams. Another Australian travel operator who wanted to remain anonymous said he was told an entirely different story. ""They announced [the new] system because the travel agent is the intermediary between the ministry of Hajj and the client, and they need to get the intermediary out to reduce the cost,"" they said. Numerous agents have made deposits from their own funds to secure spots in Saudi hotels and on flights in the hope of kickstarting their businesses after a two-year drought. ""There are companies that were completely relying on the Hajj business, it was their only source of income… and now they're being left completely out of the loop,"" the travel operator said. When Fatima, an Australian Muslim from Sydney who wanted to remain anonymous, heard about the new system she was supportive. ""I thought, 'Great! We were cutting out the middleman,'"" she said. ""There were rumours about how much agents were making, and so we thought Saudi was coming through for us."" Typical Hajj packages range from $9,000 to $15,000 and include a month's worth of flights and five-star accommodation in multiple cities, visas, transport and food. With inflation impacting all travel costs after a two-year hiatus, there was speculation that the cost of basic packages could be as high as $20,000. What Motawif was advertising during its short application stage were packages that included flights starting as low as $6,000. ""I got the email that said, 'Congratulations Fatima you've been approved,' and my heart was overjoyed,"" Fatima said. ""I thought, 'I'm going to Hajj for $6,000. What a bargain.' ""But when I logged into pay, the cheapest package was $11,000 and it didn't include flights."" Fatima is now looking at paying up to $18,500 in total for her Hajj pilgrimage. ""This is a trip that we need to do,"" she said. ""It's not a trip to an island in the Maldives … why is it costing us this much? Why was it left to the last minute?"" ""When flights are through the roof, like $6,000 from Sydney to Saudi Arabia on an economy fare, it's ridiculous!"" She has now begun a Facebook support group for Australian pilgrims who have not been able to get any answers through Motawif. And hundreds have joined already. ""No-one's answering our questions, there's no human contact,"" she said. ""And that's when everyone ate their words because we realised what the agents used to do for us. You can't put a price on it."" For Feroz, there are bigger problems with the way Hajj will be spiritually run. ""One of the greatest concerns is not having access to a scholar or a guide that you can resonate with,"" he said. ""There are different levels of religiosity, so you have some people who are well versed in the processes of Hajj, and others who aren't comfortable at all and need someone to hold their hand.""

5,Geraldton bears brunt of cancelled Qantas flights,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Qantas Perth to Geraldton flights cut in move expected to affect Midwest businesses Qantas' decision to target the Geraldton to Perth flight route for cutbacks has been criticised by the Midwest Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The airline announced last week it would cut a number of flights in regional WA over the next month to manage the impact of COVID-19 on staffing levels and reduce the number of last-minute cancellations. Fifteen of those flights are between Geraldton and Perth. A Qantas spokeswoman said a figure of 19 planned cancellations was incorrect but did not respond to a request for the total number of planned cancellations in regional WA. Midwest Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Joanne Fabling said Geraldton was shouldering much of the burden from the decision. ""Geraldton unfortunately being a 45-50-minute flight is probably not the most profitable of Qantas' flights,"" she said. ""That's where our concerns are because the loyalty that Qantas has in the regions is strong and we'd like to continue that. ""We would ask [for] a fairer loading across the regional networks when they're cancelling flights."" Ms Fabling said the reduced schedule would affect local traders and that the bulk of local air travel was for business. ""A lot of our flights because they leave Perth early in the morning are good for Perth people to come up and do business in Geraldton,"" she said. ""For Geraldton businesses, a lot of them will travel in the afternoon and come back the next day. She said there was a lot of business travel, fly-in, fly-out travel and leisure travel. However, she said she was aware the airline had more impacts from the pandemic than current isolation requirements. ""They were running a fairly lean staffing as they powered up to come back online to 100 per cent staff for flights in the regions,"" she said. ""We also need to be mindful that this airline was grounded for a long time ... they're bringing on a new workforce. ""At the end of the day, we want to fly safely."" Want more local news? Sign up for the weekly ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt email newsletter A Qantas spokeswoman said the company was doing the pre-emptive cancellations to help manage ongoing COVID-related absences. ""We apologise to our customers for the inconvenience,"" the spokeswoman said. ""By making these changes in advance we are better able to prevent last-minute cancellations which are more disruptive for travellers. ""We thank for Geraldton community for their understanding.""

6,"'Qantas's brand is very, very tarnished': Travellers suffering through disruptions as industry scrambles to find workers",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Australian air travellers have been warned to expect more disruptions over the next 12 months, as the industry scrambles to fill critical worker shortages ahead of the July school holidays. It's been a torrid few months for passengers, who have faced delays, cancellations and missing luggage over the recent Easter break and the Queen's Birthday long weekend. Employers are rushing to fill 5,000 job vacancies around the Sydney Airport precinct, which shed 15,000 jobs during the border shutdown. Chief executive of Sydney Airport Geoff Culbert told 7.30 airports would continue to struggle to recruit enough workers in time for peak periods. ""I'm not going to sugar-coat it,"" Mr Culbert said. ""It's going to be challenging. We're still going to have staff shortages in the June-July school holidays. We're throwing everything we possibly can at it. ""I think you're going to see airports struggling for staffing and recruitment for the next 12 months."" Sydney Airport is urging domestic travellers to arrive two hours before their flight, and international travellers to arrive three hours ahead, to allow for delays. Across the world, airports are struggling to deal with the resurgence of travellers. Customers have vented their frustrations with Australian airlines on social media, complaining of flight delays, cancellations, missing baggage, hours-long queues at airports, inability to reach call centre staff, and accusations of unfair terms and conditions on flight credits. ABC's 7.30 has spoken to Qantas and Virgin passengers, whose luggage has been missing since April. ""I followed up with Virgin multiple times and was just told the same story: 'The bag's coming' … but it just never came,"" traveller Clinton Press said. Mr Press said he was unsatisfied with the amount Virgin had offered in compensation. Virgin declined to be interviewed but said it was working around the clock to help their customers. Long-time Qantas customer Kevin Burke travelled from Darwin to London on a series of connecting flights. He told ABC's 7.30 the trip was plagued with problems. ""I think Qantas' brand is very, very tarnished. The service is not up to scratch,"" he said. ""When we arrived at Heathrow, the pilot told us that the entire plane's luggage had been left in Australia to make room for fuel."" Mr Burke's luggage arrived three days later. Last Thursday, a Qantas flight from Dallas to Sydney was cancelled at 2am, due to an engineering issue, leaving many to sleep on the airport's floor, including some of the Gaudin family. ""No one was telling us what was going on,"" traveller Kat Gaudin said. ""When the [kids] woke up, they were cranky, hungry, a little bit confused."" The mother of four said she felt ""let down"" by the national carrier. Qantas has apologised for the inconvenience caused to passengers on the flight. The company's chief executive, Alan Joyce, has shifted his language after he faced a customer backlash over his comments that passengers were not ""match fit"" over Easter, conceding the industry was ""rusty"" as it got back up and running. Mr Joyce declined to speak to ABC's 7.30, but told reporters in Doha on Sunday night, ""there are blocks in the chain all the way through"". In a statement, Qantas said it was ""working hard to fix the problems we have"" and has apologised to customers who have had their baggage delayed. ""We've got a lot of confidence leading in to the school holidays [that] we'll see a different outcome."" The Transport Workers' Union argues Qantas's outsourcing of workers in 2020 has led to the current problems. ""This is about a fundamental structural problem within aviation that has been deliberately created by Qantas over the course of the Joyce administration,"" TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said. The Federal Court later found the sackings were illegal and the airline now plans to appeal to the High Court. A TWU survey of 1,100 former Qantas workers outsourced in 2020 found that, while the majority have found new jobs, 70 per cent say they are worse off. And 71 per cent say they have experienced financial hardship, while 30 per cent have developed depression or anxiety. Qantas denies the union's claims on outsourcing.

7,Qantas to land a full-time engineer at Broome International Airport to overcome cancellations,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Qantas to overcome Broome International Airport flight disruptions with full-time engineer Qantas is set to base a full-time aircraft engineer in Broome to alleviate flight cancellations that are forcing locals to house stranded passengers who cannot find accommodation. The cancellations are affecting the Western Australian tourism hotspot at the busiest time of the year, as accommodation prices soar and rooms book out months in advance. Qantas, which has seen a raft of cancellations at Broome International Airport over the past two months, said the disruptions had been driven by ""COVID-related staff challenges"" and ""engineering requirements"". The airline confirmed to the ABC that it had sent a full-time engineer to service flights at the town's airport to tackle technical issues. ""We now have a full-time engineer based in Broome and [are] working to build up our local engineering capabilities to minimise the risk of cancellations,"" a spokesperson said. Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association (ALAEA) federal secretary Steve Purvinas said the move followed cuts to permanent staff in the state's north west. He said two engineers based at Karratha Airport prior to the pandemic were regularly transported to airports around the north-west to service Qantas aircraft. Mr Purvinas said that changed after the pandemic hit, with the airline pulling a flight engineer out of Karratha Airport who serviced many communities in the Pilbara region. ""This wasn't a one-off COVID event. It was a permanent de-manning of that port,"" he said. ""The [engineering] problems that have happened in Broome this year are not because someone was sick from COVID. ""Broome hasn't been manned [by a full-time engineer] for 20 years."" He said the airline had now ""thrown a QantasLink bloke permanently into Broome, which we think is a better option"". ""The steps are positive, but it can't undo the delays that passengers have suffered up until now,"" Mr Purvinas said. Residents and business operators in Broome were frustrated by the flight cancellations, which they said had left the town to deal with the consequences. Repeated cancellations by both Virgin and Qantas at the eleventh hour are leaving tourists struggling to find last minute accommodation in Broome Shire of Broome president Harold Tracey said the ""disappointing"" situation may have left tourists with a bad feeling after their holiday. ""When you're stuck at an airport waiting to get back home, it doesn't matter where you are,"" he said. ""It's not going to leave you with the most endearing memory."" Passenger Anthony Hinkley was frustrated by a cancellation two weeks ago but was astounded by the kindness of locals who housed him after Qantas staff could not find accommodation. ""I saw people just turn up at the airport, ladies, gentleman, all sorts of different people, [and say], 'I've got a room. Who would like to come?', and, bang, they would just go,"" he said. ""So my experience in Broome was: Love the people, loved everything I did up there. ""Would I come again? Yes, but I'll fly with Virgin next time."" Virgin Australia has also cancelled several flights at Broome International Airport. Delays and cancellations have become the new normal at airports around Australia, which have experienced a surge in flights after COVID-19 restrictions eased, but without enough staff to service them. Last week Qantas announced it would cut the number of flights in regional WA over the next month to manage the impact of COVID-19 on staffing levels.

When it opened 30 years ago this week, thousands of balloons were released, colouring the sky above an excited crowd, in what an ABC News report at the time described as the biggest celebration since Expo 88. Donna Smith was there. She was 16 and working in her father's lolly shop, which opened at South Bank the same day. ""I remember it being extremely busy. And lots and lots of people coming in and out of the store and even lining up to get in. It was crazy,"" Ms Smith said. Three decades on, Ms Smith now owns and runs the business with her husband. They have kept things pretty much the same – even the striped uniform. ""We've done very minimal renovations to keep that magic alive. ""[People who visited as children] come in now and it still looks the same and they can't believe it's still here."" However, much has changed. Gone is the butterfly house and a tourist attraction called Gondwana Land in the original precinct. ""You'd pay an entry fee to go in and walk along the boardwalk. And there'd be all these different spots where you'd see a crocodile. And there'd be all sorts of native animals,"" Ms Smith said. As well as the man-made beach, there was an artificial canal, complete with boats. ""You could hop on it on one end and you could ride the boat right down to the other end of the parkland,"" she said. Research librarian Christina Ealing-Godbold, from the State Library of Queensland, said it felt like a theme park. ""I don't know why they decided to take it away, it could have been expense,"" Ms Ealing-Godbold said. ""But I do know there was a distinct feeling among Brisbane people these were very kitsch elements."" As part of a redevelopment from 1997 to 2001, the boat canal was replaced with a 1-kilometre-long bougainvillea lined arbour. Initially, people were up in arms about the arbour. ""Without the bougainvillea growing all over it, it looked quite weird. This strange metal structure being put through this parkland in the middle of our city,"" Ms Smith said. ""It's just incredible that there were so many people that didn't like the beginning, but now it's just incredible. ""I'm sure there's photos of people standing under it all over the world."" Following World Expo 88, the site was cleared, except for three heritage buildings. The Queensland government planned to sell the 17-hectare precinct for commercial development, according to the South Bank Corporation's website. ""There was some fear of that. How well-founded it was I'm not sure,"" Ms Ealing-Godbold said. In a 1988 newspaper article, then lord mayor Sallyanne Atkinson was quoted as saying the precinct could be used for ""prestigious apartments, showrooms, offices, public and private housing and entertainment along the river bank"". While she also told the paper the site should feature a ""continuous park network"", there were concerns about the space ending up in private hands. ""Brisbane people had so much loved having the expo site as a public space,"" Ms Ealing-Godbold said. ""I don't think they really wanted to see it go back to prestigious apartments. ""I think people were really frightened it might return to an industrial wasteland or an apartment slumland. They didn't want to lose it after it was used so wonderfully as a public place."" The late Sir Llew Edwards, a deputy premier in the Bjelke-Petersen Government and the Expo Authority chairman, outlined plans for a rainforest, concert areas and sculpture park to ""recapture the atmosphere of Expo"". In 1989, the government set up the South Bank Corporation to develop and manage the area. The South Bank Corporation's website says 6.3 million people visited in its first year. The renewal continued with the construction of the Queensland Conservatorium of Music, Griffith University, the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre, as well as apartments and a hotel. Over the years, the parklands have endured natural and economic disaster. ""COVID stopped a lot of tourists,"" Ms Smith said. Major clean ups were needed after the 2011 and 2022 floods. ""A lot of the businesses are only just recovering from flood damage. ""[A whole strip] had no electricity for quite a while. ""The car park, of course, that got inundated again. ""We've certainly seen a lot of ups and downs. We've all been through a lot together at South Bank."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. South Bank's transformation continues, with the Neville Bonner Bridge now reaching halfway across the river. The pedestrian bridge will connect the parklands to the Queens Wharf development and is due to open in the first half of 2023. A new theatre is also under construction on Grey Street, at the eastern end of the Queensland Performing Arts Centre. It will have at least 1,500 seats and is scheduled to be finished by the end of the year. South Bank said the food precinct is being refurbished but tenancies are yet to be announced.

10,Winter hiking safety warning for WA after series of mountain rescues,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Winter hiking safety warning for WA after series of mountain rescues Authorities are urging bushwalkers and hikers to prepare properly for hiking in winter with concerns of hypothermia and increasing pressure on responders after recent rescues. The Great Southern region has some of WA's most popular hikes, particular during winter with snow possible on peaks in the Stirling Range. The Bluff Knoll summit hike is one of the most visited in WA, offering stunning views from the 1090m summit. But a number of people have needed rescuing from the peak in recent months. Department of Fire and Emergency Services Great Southern officer Wayne Green said it could be more challenging to rescue people in winter due to the elements and conditions. ""We've had a situation where not only our crew on the ground, but also our staff that crew the rescue helicopters have been put at risk whilst trying to rescue people from Bluff Knoll in particular where wind has had a big impact on the safety of the aircraft,"" Superintendent Green said. (Source: Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions) He said emergency services had to try multiple times to rescue a man who fell from Bluff Knoll due to wind and rain. ""Weather conditions don't just put our responders on the ground, but also our responders in the air at risk,"" he said. ""We're not saying don't go out and explore our beautiful landscapes, especially across the Great Southern, but just make sure you're mindful of those risks and you're prepared for them, this will help reduce the impact on emergency responders."" Gnowangerup State Emergency Service manager Carli Rooney said winter conditions made rescues a lot harder for their members. She said hypothermia was one of the biggest issues in the calls for help they received during winter. Some trails in Western Australia's south can experience large puddles and flooding too. HikeWest president Dave Osbourne said parts of the Bibbulum track were susceptible and there was an area around the Pingerup Plains which got quite swamped. ""You can be wading thigh deep through water in mid-winter to get through that area,"" he said. ABC Great Southern will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday.

11,'I just hope we can make this normal': Supercars hit the track in Darwin with inaugural Indigenous Round,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Young Indigenous racers take the track for Supercars' inaugural Indigenous Round in Darwin's Hidden Valley Ryan Jenyns has loved motor racing for as long as he can remember. The event is the inaugural Indigenous round for Supercars The Racing Together team is training young Indigenous motorists as a pathway into the sport The team has plans for expansion into the Northern Territory in coming years He's always wanted to be part of a racing team, but while he was growing up, there were no Indigenous role models in the sport for him to look up to. ""We've definitely been treated a bit differently and looked down on a little bit. But I definitely think we can make a change,"" he said. The change Jenyns is hoping to usher in has its roots in his team, Racing Together, which travelled from Queensland to be part of the Supercars Darwin Triple Crown. The team is full of First Nations youths looking to make their mark in the sport. From Friday and across the weekend, they are taking part the inaugural Indigenous Round of Supercars. Braedyn Cidoni is the driver of the team's prized Hyundai Excel, which is competing in the combined sedans category. He said having an Indigenous round was a good initiative. ""It's good to see them actually making a difference,"" he said. ""Seeing all the Indigenous liveries has been massive."" While the team want to increase First Nations representation in Australian motorsports, they say they are focused on the job at hand. ""I just hope we can make this just normal, because it hasn't been normal,"" Jenyns said. Brimming with confidence, team manager Tristin Mitchell-Delaney said the team was loving both the weather in Darwin and its chances at winning the category. ""It's a good atmosphere … I think we have a pretty high chance. We're already in the top four without being able to get into fifth gear,"" he said. Garry Connelly and wife Monique are the team behind Racing Together. Before starting the team, Mr Connelly said he spotted a gap in representation in Australian motorsports. ""We looked at the Australian motorsport scene and there's something like 30,000 people employed, and there were no Indigenous people,"" he said. ""I think ultimately what we're doing is setting an example."" The team trains young First Nations people in the sport in the hopes to secure full-time jobs in the sector. So far, the plan appears to be working. ""We've had three of our first intake of 10 already get full-time jobs in motorsport-related industries,"" Mr Connelly said. Mr Connelly said the achievements of the team so far were only the beginning. ""What we'd like to do is to expand into Townsville later this year, and then hopefully our next step after that will be Darwin,"" he said. ""I think it'd be great for the for the Indigenous kids up here to have something like this to get involved in.""

12,Inside the coastal defences of Australia's wartime past,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  WWII history kept alive at heritage-listed Fortress Fremantle's Leighton Battery, a window on wartime Perth Australia's coastline is dotted with defence structures in various states of repair, a vivid testament to the threat of foreign attack at home during World War II. From 1939 until 1945, Australia was at war with the Axis powers. According to historians and available public records, in Western Australia alone, 645 defensive sites were placed strategically all over the state. In Perth, Fortress Fremantle, as it is dubbed by the military, was an assortment of reinforced structures built along the coast to protect the vital deep-water port and citizens from any threat. The history of these WWII structures is being preserved to remind us how close Western Australia came to war in its own backyard. One of the groups endeavouring to maintain this heritage is The Royal Australian Artillery Historical Society of Western Australia (RAAHS WA), formed in 1988. RAAHS WA president David Carter and vice president Graham McKenzie-Smith said one of the society's long-term projects had been to restore and maintain the Leighton Battery Heritage Site and its command structures, just north of Fremantle. ""All this stuff doesn't come cheap, but it's all very carefully thought out,"" Mr McKenzie-Smith said. ""We've followed Museums Australia practice very closely so that now we've got displays in the rooms which reflect their original intent."" As a result, the Leighton Battery, part of Fortress Fremantle, is a heritage-listed site from Australia's wartime past. Built into a limestone hill, the Leighton Battery hosts munitions stores, secret command bunkers, and 360-degree artillery batteries with large-calibre guns on 70-tonne turntables to defend against any sea, air, and land attacks. Those guns never had to see major action and the invasion never came. Mr Carter said the WWII coastal defences had been worked on since about 1985, were ""cleaned laboriously"" and revived to offer the public an invaluable insight into our past. ""We even managed to source a blast shield for the restored 6-inch guns from HMAS Sydney which was installed in 2015,"" Mr McKenzie-Smith said. The Sydney was notoriously sunk off the WA coast in 1941 near Carnarvon by the disguised German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran — a reminder of how close the enemy was to West Australian shores. ""The society was formed with the principal aim to preserve the artillery heritage of Western Australia and this is our prime asset. So, we're the curators on behalf of the Town of Mosman Park,"" Mr Carter said. With preservation in mind, Mr Carter said they were particularly careful about how they gave the public access to the site. ""We've put 55,000 people through in quite small penny packets because the rooms don't lend themselves to masses of busloads of tourists,"" Mr Carter said. ""You just can't put them through, this unique site is much more intimate than that."" And it has a broad appeal for all sorts of people. ""We have school groups, private groups, Cub Scouts, 'paranormals' [enthusiasts], they love the place as well,"" Mr Carter said. ""They're repeat customers, our 'paranormals'."" Many visitors seem to appreciate the opportunity to see a window on life in wartime Perth. ""I am surprised that it's actually here. The facilities were really very interesting and worth coming to see,"" said tour-goer Serena after being shown around the site. When asked about the vastness of infrastructure that still exists, another member of the public said, ""I had no idea"". One of the most robust operational coastal defences in Australia at the time, the Leighton Battery was in service until 1963 when the Coast Artillery Branch of the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery was disbanded. The site remained in the possession of the Army and the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) trained in the tunnels to prepare for missions during the Vietnam War with a visible splatter of bullet holes still scarring one of the walls. In 1979, the tunnels were handed back to the Western Australian government. For years the site was left open to the elements and then mostly backfilled and closed to the public. When urban development in the late 1980s could have seen it buried forever, passionate citizens appealed to the state government's Planning Department to save the site. ""The original plan was to have … [housing] lots scattered throughout the complex, which would have meant that they would have built over this area completely,"" Mr McKenzie-Smith said. ""But a structural engineer apparently got access into the tunnels in the early 1980s and found that they were structurally sound. ""So, I went back to the board and convinced them that the tunnels could be an asset worth preserving."" Mr McKenzie-Smith said they were able to convince the state government to consolidate the development into one area, leaving the rest of the site as public open space. ""And that's what we're standing on now. This public open space has some of the best views seawards. ""But it is now under the National Heritage Register — state and federal — so it can't be built on any longer. This forms part of what was called the Fortress Fremantle Defences."" The site became a museum and memorial that was opened in 1997. Mr Carter said for all the work they had done, the site still had mysteries to reveal. As the refurbishment continued, they were still finding things, with the recent discovery of another gun pit and surrounding tunnels that were yet to be uncovered. ""We don't know in what condition it's in. It could have been completely filled in with rubble to the very top. It could be echoing empty,"" Mr Carter said. ""It's a prime archaeological dig one day.""

13,Why Kiwis love the Gold Coast and play an important part in the city's tourism recovery,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Kiwis driving the tourism bounce-back on the Gold Coast with additional direct flights returning The Gold Coast tourism industry is bouncing back and travellers from New Zealand are playing a big part in the recovery. The Coast has always been a popular holiday destination, but Kiwis have been travelling across the ditch in droves since borders opened earlier this year. More holiday-makers could be on the way, with additional direct flights returning and New Zealand easing its COVID testing regulations. Julia Bozich from New Zealand travel agency House of Travel said she had been ""overwhelmed"" by the number of Kiwis wanting to travel to the Gold Coast. ""It's been a phenomenal few months, huge interest, lots and lots of pent up demand,"" Ms Bozich said. ""The Gold Coast is the number one destination we're getting enquiries about. ""We just need more flights. We're running out of seats on planes, that's how popular it has been. It's a busy, busy time."" Trans-Tasman flights kicked off again on March 2 and there are currently 15 weekly return flights connecting the Gold Coast with Auckland, Wellington, and Queenstown. More are returning soon, with flights to Christchurch back on Jetstar from June 25, followed by Air New Zealand on July 3. Before the pandemic, 550,000 people travelled between Gold Coast Airport and New Zealand annually. Destination Gold Coast data shows pre-COVID more than a quarter of all Kiwi holiday-makers to Australia came to the Coast, injecting about $200 million into the local economy. On Thursday, the New Zealand government announced pre-departure testing to enter the country would be ditched from Tuesday. ""We're expecting another surge of enquiries once that's gone,"" Ms Bozich said. ""Families had been hit with an extra cost needed to do that [pre-departure testing] so we're anticipating that we'll see a big surge in the family market wanting to book their Gold Coast holidays."" Mick Stephens from The Breakers Apartments in Surfers Paradise said Kiwis currently made up 65 per cent of his occupancy. ""Once the Kiwis were allowed to travel they started booking. We've got bookings up to August-September from the Kiwi market,"" Mr Stephens said. He said the bounce-back of the tourism industry was unbelievable. ""We had the best April that we've had in eight to 10 years,"" he said. ""We haven't had a weekend spare for the last 12 weekends. We've been booked out every weekend, no vacancy."" Mr Stephens is part of a group of representatives from the tourism industry currently in New Zealand meeting with travel trade partners for the first time in more than two years. ""I've been doing this for 21 years and I've never presented in front of so many travel agents as I did last night in Auckland,"" he said.

14,Caretakers give up the ghost on crumbling Gladstone Gaol and its spooky overnight stays,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Gladstone Gaol caretakers hang up their keys as 'haunted' building succumbs to lack of volunteers and visitors Historical Gladstone Gaol temporarily closed its doors this week after the caretakers decided to hang up the keys due to personal reasons and lack of support. Former caretakers Debbie Piller and Rose Robinson have worked there for more than 12 years and took over as primary caretakers in 2017. Ms Piller said they hardly got any volunteers to help run tours after the pandemic. ""There used to be a handful of volunteers that we did have and they were absolutely awesome,"" Ms Piller said. ""COVID has really stopped people coming in. ""No one really backed us."" Visitor numbers picked up in the past seven months but health reasons and a lack of volunteers meant Ms Piller and Ms Robinson couldn't run the overnight stays that are a major attraction at the gaol. Ms Robinson said they were running tours and maintaining the gaol before they took over as caretakers. ""We've met a lot of interesting people, a lot of characters,"" Ms Robinson said. ""We've made quite a lot of friends over the years that have come back time and time again. ""Ex-wardens and past inmates would come back to see their old hunting grounds and they would tell us stories about things that would happen there and what cell they were in."" Gladstone Gaol is promoted as one of the most haunted places in the country and the two former caretakers say they are practising mediums who built spiritual bonds with the deceased that purportedly roam the cells. Ms Robinson said unexplained happenings were not unusual. ""We’ve had doors opening and closing and we hear a lot of whispering and giggling,"" Ms Robinson said. She said it was a sad moment for the pair when they locked up for the last time on Wednesday. ""It's been very hard to lock up. We’ve loved the place from day one and we always will,"" Ms Robinson said. The Department for Environment and Water’s general manager for the Crown lands program, Piers Brissenden, said the gaol's roof and gutters would be refurbished during the shutdown. “While future management options are being considered and the gaol is closed to the public key maintenance work will be carried out,"" he said. ""It’s important to stress that it is the government’s intention that the site reopens to the public. ""We just want to look at all options available to ensure this important heritage site continues to be enjoyed by locals and tourists for many years."" Ms Piller and Ms Robinson said much more money should go to the gaol restoration. ""The walls are just falling apart, chunks are just falling off,"" Ms Robinson said. “Apart from that, we’ve always been battling pigeons, bees and termites. “You can still run tours but having people staying overnight is very doubtful because it's in such bad condition."" The former caretakers have left pages of researched history for the next caretakers so the long tradition of haunting tours can continue for generations.

15,Kardashian cafe claim revealed as fake news but Davidson shows fans he's the real deal,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  SNL star Pete Davidson thrills fans in FNQ but Kim Kardashian cafe claim is fake news False claims that reality TV star Kim Kardashian was holidaying in far north Queensland have been revealed as a promotional stunt. The ABC reported the fabricated story by a Cairns café owner after he posted a comment on social media claiming Ms Kardashian and her actor and comedian boyfriend Pete Davidson had dined in his establishment. Café owner Matt Black was interviewed by ABC radio but later admitted the story was untrue. Comedian and Saturday Night Live star Davidson is in far north Queensland ahead of filming for comedy film Wizards! expected to start next week. Photos of Davidson posing with fans have been posted on social media. In the recorded interview run on ABC radio, Mr Black claimed he'd initially been approached by the couple's security. Then, he said, ""Sure enough, in walked bloody Kimmy K and Pete Davidson"". After the ABC aired the interview and published an online story, doubts about the claims emerged. A spokesperson for the Wizards! film production team later confirmed Ms Kardashian was not in Cairns. Mr Black told the ABC he'd made the comments as a joke and thought it would be ""a small, unharmful piece of promo"" for his café. ""The small, little story was to get people having a little excitement about celebs being around town,"" he said. Pictures of the couple holidaying in a tropical destination, published by the ABC, were reportedly taken in Tahiti, while Ms Kardashian was photographed in Los Angeles earlier this week. Editor's note (17/6/2022): The ABC has updated this story from an earlier version which stated that Kim Kardashian had visited a Cairns cafe and been photographed on a Queensland beach.

16,Rex pilots start voting on strike action that could cut regional flights by 90 per cent,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Rex pilots begin voting on strike action that could cut regional flights by 90pc Airline passengers travelling to or from parts of regional Australia could face significant delays if a pay dispute between Rex and the pilots' union isn't settled soon. Regional Express Airlines pilots have begun voting to decide if they will take protected industrial action. Over the next six days more than 250 pilots who fly the Saab 340 fleet will take part in a ballot, approved by the Fair Work Commission last week. The independently monitored vote will run until midday (AEST) on June 22. The ballot follows a breakdown in negotiations between the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and Rex. A union spokesperson said that the recent pay deal was ""worse than previous offers"". However, the spokesperson said, union members were still interested in avoiding industrial action if possible. ""The AFAP remains willing to continue negotiations with Rex to try and finalise the current enterprise agreement negotiations that have been ongoing for more than four years,"" the spokesperson said. ""Any productive negotiations would be welcomed by our members, who pride themselves on providing a valuable service to regional Australia."" The union will vote on a number of actions, including a possible four-hour work stoppage and bans on pilots signing on for work if their next shift is less than 10 hours after their previous one. Regional cities, such as Broken Hill, could see the number of flights in and out of their local airport slashed by more than 90 per cent if Rex pilots go on strike. Until recently Rex operated a monopoly in areas like far western NSW for most of the past two decades. For cities like Broken Hill and Mount Gambier, Qantaslink's expansion will prevent the potential for a complete halt in flights, if a full strike by Rex pilots takes place.

17,"Consumers likely to share the pain of minimum wage rise, Queensland businesses say",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Fears minimum wage increase will up the stress on Far North Queensland's hospitality, tourism sectors The Cairns business community is concerned an increase to the minimum wage could add pressure to Far North Queensland's struggling tourism and hospitality sectors. Queensland Hotels Association chief executive Bernie Hogan said the Fair Work Commission's ruling to increase the minimum wage by 5.2 per cent had not come as a surprise. But he said that did not necessarily soften the blow for small business owners. ""You've got to look after your staff,"" Mr Hogan said. ""You've got to have well-paid staff otherwise you don't have a business, and we understand that. ""Unfortunately those costs – all costs, whether it's energy, rent or costs of staff – are passed on to consumers eventually. ""If they don't pass them on then margins start to disappear and, particularly for small businesses, this will put them under great duress."" Cairns nightclub owner Dominic Davies said he already paid many of his staff more than the award, but an increase at the bottom line would naturally push his wages higher. He said higher wages meant higher costs for revellers. ""In any hospitality business your labour cost runs at a percentage of your sales and your costs of goods sold runs at another percentage, and you review your prices regularly to reflect that,"" Mr Davies said. ""Otherwise, if you don't make money, you're going to go out of business."" Cairns Chamber of Commerce chief executive Patricia O'Neil said the wage increase had come at a time when businesses already faced increased costs. ""Cost of living is affecting business owners as much as it's affecting employees, because the cost of doing business has absolutely skyrocketed,"" Ms O'Neil said. She said tourism and hospitality businesses in the Far North were ""quietly confident"" that the affects of the pandemic were over. ""They're enjoying a little bit of a catch-up from the losses that they've experienced over the last two years — it's certainly isn't back to the gravy train that it was previously,"" she said. ""There might be more transactions going through the till, but the costs of the bottom line of doing business are crippling, absolutely crippling."" Low-wage earners are going backwards. Here's why they deserve an increase in the minimum wage by $1 an hour from July 1. Mr Davies fears further price increases across the region's tourism and hospitality sectors could drive more Australians to holiday overseas, where they may get more for their money. ""Whilst wages go up, and understandably so, all the naysayers will be flying straight over our heads to Thailand, Bali, Fiji, to take advantage of the cheap wages over there, which they'd probably call slave labour in Australia,"" she said. ""The high cost of doing business in Australia, with labour being a major component, doesn't help us being competitive."" Mr Hogan disagreed that the minimum wage increase would have any impact on competition between Queensland and South-East Asian or Pacific holiday destinations. ""That competition has been well and truly established for many years and we've all known there are cheaper options offshore,"" he said. ""We would like to think, though, that what people get when they holiday in Queensland is superior. ""With that additional cost they do get an additional service and certainty of where they're travelling.""

19,Qantas to suspend flights from Alice Springs to Perth from July,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Qantas to suspend flights from Alice Springs to Perth from July Qantas will suspend direct flights from Alice Springs to Perth from July 1 due to low passenger numbers. The national carrier said it would continue to offer connections to Western Australia via Adelaide and Darwin. Tourism Central Australia chief executive Danial Rochford said the move by Qantas was ""not good news."" ""To have that connection through to Perth was not only good for tourism, but it's also good for us living here locally to be able to connect to other parts of the country, which for a remote community is really important,"" he said. ""The ability for people living here to be able to get in and out is really critical for the future sustainability of our community."" Mr Rochford acknowledged there was ""no doubt"" the aviation industry had been under immense pressure as a result of the pandemic. ""That said, what we need from our carrier at the moment is to be backing remote Australia, not pulling out of remote Australia,"" he said. ""There is a community service obligation almost enshrined in much of the work our national carrier does, especially in remote and regional Australia."" In November 2018, Qantas announced it would cut its daily flights between Alice Springs and Perth to two per week. Mr Rochford said the route was commonly used for corporate trips and would particularly affect some Central Australian organisations that conducted work over the border. He said the tourism industry needed to support other airlines such as Rex, Bonza and Virgin as they increased their profiles across the country. ""We certainly [also] need the government's support here — often many of these airlines ask for some level of support to add a new route,"" Mr Rochford said. He encouraged Central Australians who would be impacted by the loss of the Alice Springs to Perth Qantas route to contact the Northern Territory Tourism Minister to advocate for its continuation. Mr Rochford said he was not concerned about the suspension or cancellation of other routes in and out of Alice Springs.

20,"Aussies are heading back overseas, but numbers are still a long way behind pre-pandemic levels",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  New Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data released on Wednesday shows the number of trips in and out of Australia has almost doubled since March. However, despite a promising rebound, the overall number of trips in and out of the country was still well below the pre-pandemic peak of late 2019, driven by a dramatic reduction in short-term visitors. In May this year, the ABS recorded 651,060 arrivals into Australia and 663,970 departures as easing travel restrictions resulted in a return to trips overseas for many. That was a dramatic increase from March, which saw 374,630 arrivals and 335,240 departures. The March data showed a more than tenfold increase from six months prior, during the height of Australia's border restrictions. In October 2021, just 16,630 arrivals were recorded into Australia. There was a year-low of just 30,330 departures in September 2021. These numbers relate to individual border crossings, not necessarily individual people, who may have made multiple trips. Since that low point, the number of trips has been trending upward, but there is a long way to go before pre-pandemic levels will be achieved again. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia recorded a high of 2.26 million arrivals (January 2020) and 2.24 million departures (December 2019) as part of the annual peak either side of Christmas. Within three months though, arrivals had plummeted to around 20,000 and departures to roughly 30,000. The total number of arrivals in April 2022 was less than a third of the number in 2019 — 573,930 compared to 1.67 million. The one demographic that registered an overall increase from its pre-pandemic levels was long-term Australian resident returns, from 10,740 in 2019 to 18,460 — almost double — in 2022. Permanent arrivals also rebounded to pre-pandemic levels (7,780 in 2019 to 8,010 in 2022), but all other groups were down. The biggest impact was on short-term arrivals — both Australian residents and overseas visitors. From a peak of 1.077 million arrivals in December 2019, the number of arrivals plummeted to just 2,250 by the time border closures were in full force in April 2020. For the first time in almost two years — 704 days — Australia’s borders will open to all fully-vaccinated travellers next week. But for many, the ordeal is far from over. The Australian government's COVID-19 travel restrictions first came into effect on February 1, 2020, with all overseas travel banned on March 20. The ABS noted: ""The pandemic has continued to disrupt international travel with volumes at a record low in 2021."" The 300,840 resident trips overseas in 2021 were down 89.4 per cent from the previous year, making it the lowest annual number of resident trips in a calendar year on record. The ABS noted that the numbers of Australian residents travelling overseas had steadily increased for decades, although major events had an impact on the number of trips taken, such as September 11, the 2003 SARS outbreak and COVID-19. The travel corridor between Australia and New Zealand opened in April 2021, which was reflected in a jump in the number of short-term arrivals entering the country. International travel was permitted for fully vaccinated Australians in states that had an 80 per cent vaccination rate in October. The border was fully reopened to all states in February this year. A requirement to demonstrate a negative pre-departure COVID test for visitors to Australia was removed on April 17. Tourism and health experts agree it could be better to delay overseas travel if you can, with the industry not expected to bounce back for at least two years. In April 2021, 16,320 New Zealanders arrived in Australia, compared to just 660 from the UK, 880 from the USA and a handful of other countries. There were 235,460 trips in April 2022, an increase of over 212,000 from the previous year. However, that was still 66.4 per cent fewer arrivals than in April 2019. Travel restrictions were eased in stages from November 1, 2021, with the data showing a steady climb from that point.

21,Concerns after sinkhole closes 'new' Sunshine Coast runway,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Sinkhole closes 'new' Sunshine Coast Airport runway, amid calls for old airstrip to remain open An aviation operator says he will continue to fight for the old Sunshine Coast Airport runway to reopen after the new international airstrip had to be closed for emergency repairs. Sunshine Coast Airport issued a Notice to Airmen early yesterday after damage was discovered on the two-year-old $334-million runway. Airport management said no passenger or emergency flights were affected and the closure was revoked around 10am. But Machjet Aviation's managing director, Simon McDermott, said two of its private flights were cancelled as a result of what it believed was a sinkhole. ""Our operations team had given us a call and notified us that the runway was currently closed because of a sinkhole that had appeared down on the western end of the runway,"" Mr McDermott said. Mr McDermott said the situation could have been avoided if the old airport runway was still open. ""We could have been operating off that old runway with no dramas at all,"" Mr McDermott said. The old 18/36 runway was decommissioned in 2020 when the north-west/south-east runway project was completed. Mr McDermott said airport operators were led to believe the runway would remain open. ""We've been very vocal from the very start when this whole master plan and runway construction had started,"" he said. ""We always thought, 'Geez, hang on, we all agreed on two runways' and that's what we were sold."" Mr McDermott said the incident was proof of why the airport needed a second runway as a back-up. ""A single runway orientation really leaves you with nothing up your sleeve for an instance like this,"" he said. ""So it certainly raises the risk for us as an operator, but also the uncertainty for us as a local operator in the future."" Mr McDermott said his aviation operation often performed medical missions to transport organ donations where time was of the essence. ""We do a lot of work for Organs for Life, so that's basically moving organs from a donor to a recipient,"" he said. ""Most of the time we're sitting on about a 15-minute window to depart to meet time frames for those organs to still be viable. ""So we certainly can't operate with the unknown."" Palisade Investment Partners signed a $605 million deal with Sunshine Coast Council in 2017 for a 99-year lease of Sunshine Coast Airport. Sunshine Coast Airport management said the old runway was decommissioned by Sunshine Coast Council as part of the runway project. ""Council confirmed that wide-bodied aircraft parking would need to be located to the eastern side of the terminal to meet airspace protection requirements,"" the airport statement said. ""This meant that important safety standards could not be maintained on runway 18/36 and therefore it was decommissioned. ""The southern 1,000 metres of the existing runway has been repurposed as a taxiway."" Mr McDermott said he was concerned about the new runway already showing cracks. ""This is a visionary project and supposed to be serving us through to 2040,"" he said. ""It's got another 20-odd years to run and we're already seeing holes being patched. Not very good."" Sunshine Coast Airport said it became aware of pavement repairs on the shoulder of the northern end of the runway early on Tuesday. ""Operational staff have been onsite assessing the area in accordance with the necessary pavement and maintenance procedures,"" the statement said. Mr McDermott said he would continue pushing for the old runway to reopen, believing it was in the best interests of the airport's future. ""We're still being very vocal and we are still working very hard to keep that asset open and alive,"" he said. ""It is owned by the community, so it should stay with the community and benefit the industry. ""It really will start choking the aviation industry more than what it's done if it does remain closed.""

22,Relatives of World War II diggers given insight into Atherton Tablelands' military past as new tour launches,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tablelands World War II tour established by National Servicemen's Association, Rotary club The Atherton Tablelands west of Cairns played an important military role during World War II. Between 1942 and 1945 the region was home to the largest medical field hospital in the southern hemisphere, with about 60,000 patients cared for by more than 2,000 staff. In addition to this, more than 100,000 troops, primarily of the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions (2nd Australian Imperial Force), completed their jungle warfare training between Mareeba and Atherton. History buffs, amateur historians and relatives of World War II diggers can now retrace the steps of their forefathers with a new tour that visits military sites of significance on the Tablelands. The four-hour tour is run by volunteers in conjunction with National Servicemen's Association of Australia (NSAA) Tablelands branch and the Rotary Club of Atherton. The tour takes in the third-largest military cemetery in Queensland as well as the Tolga Museum, the Rocky Creek War Memorial, the hospital ruins and the so-called Igloo, which was used as an entertainment complex for servicemen and women. Nicole Smith from the Atherton Tablelands Information Centre said the idea for the tour came after NSAA Tablelands branch president John Hardy took a few of the volunteers from the centre on an informal tour around local military sites. ""John has so much local knowledge, so we put our heads together and we came up with an organised tour,"" she said. ""The tour starts in Atherton behind the officers' quarters and visits some of the most important military sites in North Queensland. ""The last place we visit is the war cemetery where we hold a commemorative service."" Proceeds from the tours go to the NSAA Tablelands branch, the Rocky Creek Rotary Igloo Restoration Project, the Rocky Creek War Memorial Park and the Tolga Museum. Ms Smith said the tour was important to keep the memories alive of people who served and trained in Far North Queensland 'We ask people before they go on the tour about their family history, and we often find that their relatives did spend time here,"" she said. ""We also often find photos of their family members in our albums, which is pretty rewarding,"" Field Marshall Sir Thomas Blamey selected the Tablelands area in 1942 as an ideal staging post for the war in the south-west Pacific against the advancing Imperial Japanese Army. The climate, location, terrain and proximity to resupply lines and battlefronts all played a part in his decision. Mr Hardy said a lot of history was being forgotten when it came to North Queensland's involvement in World War II. ""People don't realise just how many servicemen and women were here. We had over 600 units stationed here during World War II,"" Mr Hardy said. He said they started the tour last year just ""as a trial"". ""Now that we've started the tour again, it has stepped up another level and we are getting bookings well into the future,"" Mr Hardy said. ""Primarily we are getting baby boomers on the tour who are retracing their parents or distant relatives' footsteps."" Brian Bromfield from Bathurst decided to do the tour after researching his family's military history. ""Nicole did some research and we found out that, not only was my uncle sent to Tobruk, but he was actually here on the Tablelands in 1943 and then again in 1945,"" he said. ""By being at the same spot and knowing that they were here and the effort that is put into this tour, to try and put you in their shoes has been very touching. ""The tour has made me realise just how hard it must have been for them. There were no frills and you just got through as best you could.""

23,The Gold Coast seaside suburbs with properties under $1 million,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Gold Coast cheapest seaside suburbs include Labrador, Southport, Tugun, Bilinga Those who hold on to the dream of living by the ocean may be in luck as Gold Coast property data shows there are still suburbs where houses can be bought for a reasonable price. Property analytics website RP Data shows there are six Gold Coast seaside suburbs where you can buy a house for less than $1 million. According to the most recent data, which shows the sales of homes and units from February last year to February this year, units are not the only way to live beachside, with some homes still within reach for the average earner. Labrador had the cheapest median house price of seaside suburbs with $590,000, followed by Southport at $750,000 and Biggera Waters at $840,000. Hollywell was also just under $1 million. Meanwhile, Tugun and Bilinga recorded the most affordable median house prices at the southern end of the Gold Coast at just over $1 million. Median prices shown. 1,000=1k, 1,000,000=1m.

Meanwhile, he said newly developed suburbs such as Mermaid Beach and Palm Beach, where it was common to see only beachside mansions, would sit at a higher median price. So the key: old is gold. ""Also those northern suburbs – Hollywell, Biggera Waters, Labrador – they're located on the broadwater, not a surf beach, but you can still get your toes in some water,"" he said. ""It's got good infrastructure, transport, so depending on your hobbies, those areas will appeal to different people, perhaps people with boats who want to be on the waterfront."" He said Labrador and Southport had a good mixture of housing from original timber cottages to large mansions. ""It does surprise me that somewhere like Labrador – which offers real convenience to the broadwater, convenience to transport, convenience to places such as hospitals and universities – that it is such a good entry price point for somebody to purchase a house,"" he said. Mr Henderson said the placement of the Coolangatta Airport could be impacting prices in Tugun and Bilinga. He said those suburbs also held some older, more attainable homes. ""Tugun and Bilinga they do again offer significantly better value than others have like Currumbin when you're looking at those median sale prices,"" he said. ""So really, if you are looking to get near the beach, they probably do offer a great entry point or a starting point to be able to get into those suburbs and still be a very quick walk to the beach."" He said the data showed that it paid to do solid research before purchasing a home as prices could vary by hundreds of thousands dollars just a suburb or two away. ""So I would say get out there and maybe look a few suburbs on from where you're concentrating your search and you might just find that right property just in that neighbouring suburb that still offers very much the similar infrastructure or hobbies or good schools that you may be looking for,"" he said. ""There's a few where you can still get an older house, and that's where the value sits. He said areas such as Palm Beach and Currumbin had experienced a lot of gentrification through new housing. ""Somewhere like Currumbin for example, it would be very hard to find an original house. There's been so much built in,"" he said. ""Mermaid Beach is also probably one of those areas where it's getting very difficult to find an original cottage nowadays."" Mr Henderson said people hoping to jag a reasonable price needed to act sooner rather than later. ""I would say that those days are numbered, so it's got to be on the radar of people that are looking to rebuild or do significant renovation, as those suburbs will probably catch up in no time at all,"" he said. ""Real estate's a bit of a funny thing, sometimes you'll hear all about the southern beach or Palm Beach is always in the media, but then you can get some great value pretty well just down the road in Tugun and Bilinga which is quite surprising to a lot of people.""

24,"Airport mask mandate can go, health chiefs say",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Travellers could be able to roam within Australian airports mask-free from Friday after the nation's top health officials recommended ditching one of the few remaining mask mandates. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) — which comprises all the nation's state and territory chief health officers — advised on Tuesday that it was no longer necessary to keep forcing travellers and terminal workers to mask up, given face-covering mandates had been dropped in almost all indoor settings. ""The AHPPC notes that all states and territories have relaxed mask mandates in most settings within the community and considers that it is no longer proportionate to mandate mask use in airport terminals,"" a statement from the committee said. Individual states can now drop the mandate as early as Friday, at midnight. The federal government said it was likely states will implement the advice soon. ""We anticipate the travelling public will notice this change in the days following Friday as individual state and territory jurisdictions make the necessary changes to their public health orders,"" a joint statement from Health Minister Mark Butler and Transport Minister Catherine King said. ""This changed advice comes after the AHPPC has reviewed the current COVID-19 situation in Australia and considers it no longer proportionate to mandate mask-wearing in the terminals. It has also noted all states and territories have relaxed mask mandates in most community settings."" Canberrans will not be required to wear face masks in most indoor settings from 6pm tomorrow, but for local businesses that means making some decisions. The government also noted the strong recommendation that Australians continue to wear masks as a key measure to help minimise the spread of COVID-19 and influenza. The European Union stopped recommending mask-wearing in airports in May. The loosening of rules will be welcome news for airport bosses in Australia who have been calling for the mandate to be removed. The AHPPC still recommends the wearing of masks on planes. Despite the new freedoms in Australia's travel hubs, the nation's covid cases continue to rise, with 25,622 cases recorded on Tuesday.

25,'Fantastic to be able to race hard': Speeds high but injuries down in record-breaking Finke Desert Race,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Injury numbers down during record-breaking year for cars and bikes at NT's Finke Desert Race Records were broken in the car and bike categories of the iconic Finke Desert Race in Central Australia, held over the long weekend. The Finke Desert Race is a two-day annual event which sees hundreds of bikes and cars race from Alice Springs to the remote community Apatula (Finke) and back, on what is billed as the most challenging off-road course in the country. International motorsport champion Toby Price claimed his eighth King of the Desert title, setting a new record for fastest time on four wheels in the two-day event. Price, alongside navigator Jason Duncan, completed the race with an overall time of three hours, 21 minutes and 46 seconds. Price has previously conquered the race — billed as the most challenging off-road event in Australia — six times on a bike and one other time in a truck. ""If you'd [told] me back in 2010 that I would have won this event eight times [by now], I would have probably laughed at everyone,"" Price said. ""It's crazy. To get that second win in the truck now and actually have everybody here at the event and at the race, it actually does mean something and does count and we're stoked with that."" The pair competed together in 2018 and 2019 but did not finish the race. ""Third time's a charm. Here we are, we had some fun and no issues,"" Duncan said. Solo competitor Aaron James came in second, followed by Brent Martin and Ben Dawson in third. Alice Springs rider David Walsh also made record time, winning his third King of the Desert title in the bike category with an overall race time of three hours, 35 minutes and 45 seconds. Walsh beat the bike race record set by Toby Price in 2016 by 11 minutes. 'It feels amazing just to be at the front like this. It's an honour for me,"" he said. ""It's not something I thought I'd ever do watching it as a kid. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunities this race has given me."" New South Wales rider Jacob Smith took second place on the podium in his 13th Finke race, with West Australian Jack Simpson, just 43 seconds behind, coming in third. Spectators were directed to stand at least 20 metres back from the track this year in response to a fatal crash during last year's race when a vehicle veered off the track and into a group of onlookers, killing 60-year-old Nigel Harris. Race organisers warned the event would not continue beyond 2022 if there was another serious accident involving a spectator. ""Spectators have done a fantastic job adhering to the conditions,"" second-place car winner Aaron James said. ""The race committee have done a fantastic job at addressing the issue and as a racer it's fantastic to be able to race hard without any concern."" Walsh and Price both commented that the new rules gave them peace of mind while racing. St John's Director of Ambulance Services Andrew Thomas said the number of injuries during the event was down on previous years, and congratulated race organisers for enforcing new safety standards. ""Unfortunately there are going to be some people that flout the rules at times which is disappointing, cause those measures are there for their safety as well as the safety of the competitors,"" he said. ""But all in all, from our perspective it was a really good event."" Mr Thomas said St John's Ambulance staff treated about 30 people during the event. He said none of the competitors had serious head, neck or back injuries. ""Most of the injuries were limb injuries and unfortunately a couple of fractures,"" he said. Close to 60 St John's Ambulance staff were on hand at the start and finish lines, along the length of the track, and in helicopters during the weekend. Unrelated to the race, a nine-year-old girl received serious injuries when she was hit by a car driving on a track near where the event was taking place on Sunday afternoon. Mr Thomas said the girl had suffered injuries to her head and pelvis, and a fractured femur. She was transported to Alice Springs Hospital where she was in a stable condition in ICU on Tuesday. Northern Territory police said the driver, a 32 year old man, was not a competitor in the Finke Desert Race and was assisting police with inquiries. On Saturday morning, one man was flown to hospital in Adelaide in a critical condition and another left with a serious jaw injury following a head-on collision between the two motorbike riders who were not involved in the Finke Desert Race. The crash happened off the Maryvale Road, near Finke.

26,Tourists become cane toad collectors after holiday plans washed away,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Cane toads collected, bagged, frozen for university by inquisitive Kimberley holidaymakers ""Squeals of delight and disgust"" is how Bungle Bungle Savannah Lodge manager Natasha Faithfull described the most recent toad busting expedition, collecting specimens for a New Zealand university for dissection. A group of Kimberley travellers managed to snag more than 240 cane toads after their original plans for the day were washed away by rain. The toads were part of a group of 500 frozen Kimberley specimens to be shipped off across the ditch to New Zealand. Cane toads have been spreading fast across northern Australia with the latest front line reaching 40 kilometres east of Derby. While most people would rather not have any toads in their freezer, researchers from the Massey University in New Zealand have been joyously accepting the Kimberley cane toads into theirs. ""These toads are going to be used for dissection purposes for our students,"" the university's Odette Howarth said. ""They'll get them in the lab and have a look at some comparative anatomy across phyla … basically for them to learn how animals work. ""Our native frogs are critically endangered, or under threat, so there's no capability for us to use them. That's why we decided on cane toads because they are a pest species and and we can get a good supply of them."" The arrangement first started in 2014 and it is going strong, with the next batch of cane toads ready to set to be sent over soon. Since 2004, more than 2.4 million cane toads have been collected by grassroots organisation Kimberley Toad Busters, and some of the toads have ended up in New Zealand. It is a long journey to send the amphibians over, one that Kimberley toad buster Lee Scott-Virtue is all too familiar with. ""Every toad has to be frozen and then bagged in a single Ziplock bag, then placed in a freezer … for at least seven to 10 days before we actually then start processing them,"" Ms Scott-Virtue said. Once the toads leave the Kimberley they are sent to a Brisbane university where they need to be irradiated to make sure they are not carrying harmful pests or bacteria into New Zealand. ""When we get [the toads] in Auckland we'll look and clean, and we'll make sure that they're not secreting toxin any longer,"" Ms Howarth said. She said due to the rigorous cleaning schedule, the toads were not as smelly as you would expect on the cutting block. The 500-head supply of cane toads should sustain the university for the next two years. ""We'll probably be getting through them a lot faster now that we're sharing them with another of our campuses down in Palmerston North,"" Ms Howarth said. Ms Scott-Virtue said it was interesting to see little demand from Australian educational facilities for the toads. ""We've had no requests from any of the high schools around Australia, or the universities, for our frozen toads,"" she said. But the NZ university hoped for more Kimberley toads in the coming years. ""We'll go back to Lee and in a couple of years' time we'll get another shipment over,"" Ms Howarth said. The 500 frozen toads will start their long journey to New Zealand next week, starting with irradiation in Brisbane.

27,Pride of the Murray makes emotional journey to new home in Longreach,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  After an epic 2300-kilometre journey from country Victoria, an historic paddle wheeler is starting a new life in outback Queensland. Pride of the Murray, a 98-year-old paddle steamer, has been relocated 2,300 kilometres across the outback It will start its new life in Longreach this week Tours on the boat have been booked out for a month despite a slow start to the outback tourist season The week-long operation to move the 100-tonne, delicate and ageing Pride of the Murray was made possible by a team of more than 40 people, a police escort and nerves of steel. Outback Pioneers founder Richard Kinnon said while he was excited to see it arrive safely at its new home on the Thomson River, it'd been an emotional ride. He bought the vessel after it was put on the market recently. ""When we were leaving the Murray River down there (Victoria) and the Emmylou went past for the last time, she blew her horn and said goodbye to her sister,"" Mr Kinnon said. ""It was very heart-felt and very sad for me to see her leaving her mates and leaving that part of the world."" Mr Kinnon said it would be the last time the vessel could survive a relocation on such a large scale, but it had arrived in ""great shape"". Originally concerned about the final leg through an infamous, oblong roundabout in Longreach, the team were surprised that the boat ""breezed"" through without a hiccup. ""Looking at it in hindsight, the last bridge coming over the Murray River at Tocumwal was probably the biggest challenge,"" Mr Kinnon said. A truck driver guided the mammoth vessel through 12 kilometres of railing leading up to and across the bridge with just 50 millimetres to spare either side. As the word got round that the piece of pioneering history was on the move, the crowds came in droves to cheer it on. Charleville local Karen Tully rode the Pride of the Murray in 1985 and was overcome by nostalgia watching the convoy. ""Despite the cold, there was no hardship involved in rugging up and welcoming the Pride of the Murray on her outback odyssey,"" Ms Tully said. Mr Kinnon said the boat, originally built in 1924 to move wool down the Murray River, had a special connection to the bush. He said it only seemed fitting the boat would now make Longreach home, in the merino wool capital of the world. ""It makes you nearly cry when you look up inside of there and you can see the wear marks of the skippers of 100 years [ago],"" Mr Kinnon said. ""You see where the chains at the back pulled the rudder from either side ... the stories that that rudder could tell. ""She's got a real spirit about her this old girl."" Mr Kinnon said the Pride of the Murray had done over a million kilometres in the Murray River in its time. The upper deck of the boat that was dissembled in order for it to be transported safely to Longreach. It would be reassembled this week. Longreach Regional Council said a slow start to the tourist season had been reported after a once-in-a-decade rain event caused road closures for weeks at a time. Mayor Tony Rayner said numbers were returning to normal, but it wasn't clear if the outback would reach the record-breaking numbers it saw during 2020 and 2021. ""Realistically, they were probably a couple of exceptional years for clear reasons because people couldn't travel out of Australia and therefore, they travelled within Australia,"" Cr Rayner said. He said the kind of tourism experience the Pride of the Murray could bring would be a boost to the region and added to the town's pioneering story. ""It's very early days yet but we are looking at the possibility of a sister river association with two famous rivers in Australia,"" Cr Raynor said. Longreach local Doug Allpass said the boat was a major drawcard for the region which had endured prolonged drought before recent rain events. ""It's caught people's imagination, it's unreal,"" Mr Allpass said. ""If there's a drought on or things are a bit tight in other areas, you know that tourists come out here to spend a few dollars, so we've gotta look after them."" Mr Kinnon said the first cruise was scheduled for Saturday and Pride of the Murray cruises had already been booked out online for a month.

28,'Why work hard all your life to retire and drop dead?': Young nomads sell up and hit the road in off-grid caravan,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Young nomads sell up in north-west Victoria and hit the road with daughters in off-grid caravan After 24 years on her feet, hairdresser Tamara Clark and her partner, Joey Wright, who has spent the past 20 years working 12-hour shifts at a winery, knew there was more to life. ""We just needed to make a change … a big, brave move,"" Tamara said. So they did what lots of retirees do. They decided to hit the road — even if it was a few decades earlier than most of the nomads travelling Australia. The couple sold their home in the picturesque Murray River hamlet of Nichols Point, just south of Mildura in north-west Victoria, and pulled their daughters — nine-year-old Suri and eight-year-old Meadow — out of school. After spending more than 12 months designing the perfect off-grid caravan, they set off. But moving a family of four from a large home into a caravan has its challenges — Joey standing at 2 metres tall being just one of them. So far the family, each of whom have only packed the bare essentials, is learning to live a far simpler existence. The family's caravan was specifically designed to meet the family's needs and took more than 12 months to be built. Upgrades include raising the roof by five centimetres to allow Joey to stand at his full height, and off-grid elements that provide 600 hours of battery power from roof-mounted solar panels. ""We thought through every detail in the design. We wanted to make it our home and as comfortable as possible,"" Tamara said. ""It's the little things that make the most difference, with extra-thick mattresses, interior styling, full bathroom facilities. ""They were at the top of our list. We needed to be comfortable."" The solar-powered lithium battery system runs their full-size fridge, electric outdoor kitchen, and mini washing machine. ""There's a place for everything,"" Tamara said. ""Our USB chargers are strategically placed for easy access to pouches for our laptops and camping guides."" Going off-road is not an issue with a hydraulic, raised suspension system that is lowered and levelled for camping. Even outback dusty roads have been considered with a positive-pressurised cabin system to prevent dust getting into their off-road home. The caravan also extends into an enviable outdoor kitchen with both gas BBQs and electric cookers on offer, leaving plenty of bench space inside for the microwave and cafe-style coffee machine. Tamara says the difficult decision to take her children out of school and away from their friends and home was an emotional rollercoaster. But she adds there is no turning back. ""I can't wait to rip off my beanie and head off to the warmer weather … to really get this family bond happening and explore this amazing country that we live in,"" Tamara said. The decision to sell their home and travel was easier for Joey. ""I've worked with a lot of older men throughout the years who talked about travelling after they retired, but by the time they stopped work, they got sick and they never got to hit the road,"" he said. ""You just don't know what tomorrow's going to bring, so why work hard all your life to retire and drop dead?"" Despite their initial concerns about taking Suri and Meadow out of school, the couple feel confident that the benefits of their adventure will far outweigh the drawbacks. Joey has taken on the role of teacher while the girls are homeschooled during the trip. ""The kids will learn heaps of life skills,"" he said. ""If we just keep up the reading, writing and maths, they'll go back to school in the future, but with the life skills that they'll pick up on the way. ""It's something that will stay with them forever."" The cost of towing a massive caravan is a concern for the couple. But Joey says being able to survive completely off-grid will give them the freedom to live inexpensively and find work if necessary. ""Being fully off-grid, we can pull up anywhere really … so if fuel prices go up to five bucks, we'll be right, I've got a fishing rod,"" he said. After working 12-hour shifts in the wine industry for more than 20 years, Joey is ready for a change and plans to use the time to complete online tertiary study with the aim of landing a more senior role when he eventually returns to full-time work. ""I'm studying project management [and] compared to what I usually do, it's a whole new ball game,"" he said. ""I'm hoping this opportunity to study will let me step up a few more notches in the industry."" The family's caravan is gaining quite the following with other nomads and caravaners dropping by to take photos and have a peek inside. ""People are stopping by for a chat and to take photos of our set-up,"" Joey said. ""They are full of questions about the towing modifications to our LandCruiser right down to the Lovells GVM 4.2 tonne towing upgrade. They're so interested."" Fellow caravanner Ken, who is based in Melbourne but is a veteran nomad of 40 years, was impressed by the amount of thought that went into the design of Tamara and Joey's caravan. ""This is every off-grid traveller's dream to travel in this level of comfort,"" Ken said. Despite their initial fears, Joey and Tamara say they are now able to breathe and cannot wait to head north to Darwin and enjoy some warmer weather. ""It is scary. We're leaving our friends, family, our safety net, but life is really short,"" Tamara said. ""Sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith. ""It has been an emotional roller coaster — definitely not easy [but] I know it's definitely right."" ABC Mildura Swan Hill will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Wednesday.

30,"5,330km, four horses and one big adventure. Is this the ultimate gap year?",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Gap year in the saddle for horse rider Libby Wylie, 18, who dreams of completing Bicentennial National Trail Many 18-year-olds taking a gap year after finishing school may have kicked off their newfound freedom with Schoolies Week or partying with friends. But Libby Wylie, from Tea Gardens in New South Wales, had a different adventure in mind. The teenager has just embarked on her dream of completing the Bicentennial National Trail on horseback. Stretching from Cooktown in Far North Queensland to Healesville in Victoria, the 5,330-kilometre trail was officially opened as part of Australia's bicentenary in 1988. Known as the BNT, the national trail or simply ""the trail"", it follows the foothills of the Great Dividing Range and the eastern escarpment. To date fewer than 60 people have completed the entire trail. Libby, who started her journey only weeks after turning 18 in April, was inspired by her parents' romantic stories. ""My mum had come out from Ireland to attempt the trail and she met Dad and he said he would like to accompany her on her quest,"" she said. ""They originally did Cooktown to northern New South Wales, they fell in love on horseback and that is where my love of horses comes from."" Libby originally wanted to start the trail when she was only 16, but her dad Rob Wylie suggested she wait until she was 18. ""Libby has spent the last two years saving for this and after she turned 18 this year, we decided to give it a crack,"" Mr Wylie said. ""It's great to be doing this with her as this is how I met my wife and her mum."" The trail passes through some of the most remote and inaccessible parts of Queensland and New South Wales. Mr Wylie has started the journey with his daughter, and will later hand over to others. ""I will eventually need to get back to work, and when I am not with her, Libby will be accompanied by friends for parts of the journey,"" he said. ""I hope to be able to pass on some skills and help her on her way and hopefully I can join her at the end of the journey."" While Libby is accompanied by other riders, she also has with her two riding horses and two pack horses. ""We do about 20km a day on the horses, and we often get off and walk to give the horses a break,"" she said. ""I've always loved being on horses and going on adventures and being in the outdoors. ""This is the big adventure that I have always wanted to do."" Without mobile phones, TV, social media or the internet, Libby says one of the hardest parts of her journey is the social isolation. ""Sometimes it has been days before we see another human being, we get excited when we see a road or a house,"" she said. ""It's very different to what I am used to, I'm used to seeing or chatting with people every day. ""Whereas now it's all about being independent and finding my own way with no technology. ""We have been lost a few times over the past couple of weeks, but we eventually find our way."" Mr Wylie said the highlight so far had been meeting the locals. ""I've always told Libby that the people of North Queensland are phenomenal, they have been so friendly and welcoming and supportive,"" he said. ""We are constantly overwhelmed by people's hospitality, so many people just want to stop us on the side of the road for a chat. ""The highlight really is the people that you meet along the way."" While the whole journey could take as long as 18 months, Libby says there's no timetable, and she is happy to go at the horse's pace. ""We like to give the horses decent breaks, if they are in good spirits we keep going,"" she said. ""There are too many variables to have a timetable, it's all about the horses.""

31,Funding promise for fast rail set to cut Central Coast to Sydney trip to 25 minutes,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  NSW matches Commonwealth's $500 million pledge for fast rail link construction Rail travel between Sydney and Gosford on the Central Coast will be reduced to 25 minutes on a fast-rail link between the two cities, under funding pledged by the NSW and Commonwealth governments. NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet today announced $500 million for a fast rail upgrade to the Sydney-Central Coast train line would be part of this month's state budget. The promise is conditional on the new federal government's election campaign pledge of $500 million in its first budget for corridor acquisition, planning and early works for fast rail between Newcastle and Sydney. Mr Perrottet said the total $1 billion investment by the federal and state governments would make the upgrade a reality, and commuters would eventually see considerable reductions in travel time. ""Once this becomes a reality we will be seeing travel times between Sydney and Newcastle [reduced] from two and a half hours down to one hour, Sydney to Gosford in 25 minutes, then Sydney to Wollongong in 45 minutes,"" he said. ""Today's half a billion dollars will make that vision come to life."" Parliamentary secretary for the Central Coast Adam Crouch also announced funding for a new University of Newcastle campus to be built in Gosford. ""This is a very historic day for our region — a half a billion dollars into our rail network and another additional $18 million going into providing the delivery of a University of Newcastle campus right here in Gosford,"" Mr Crouch said. The NSW funding for the Gosford university campus also matches Commonwealth investment. Mr Perrottet said the rail upgrades were an essential step in delivering his government's six cities vision, by improving accessibility between the state's major centres. ""You can't build great cities without building significant transport infrastructure, and … this billion dollars from the state and federal government will lay that foundation and set up further investments as we move forward,"" he said. The funding will allow construction to begin on the first stage of the Northern Corridor, including two new electrified rail tracks between south of Tuggerah and north of Wyatt, new platforms and station upgrades at Wyong and Tuggerah, and new bridges. Committee for Sydney CEO Gabriel Metcalf said the combined government funding would help deliver a ""transformative"" fast rail project. ""Getting on a trip from Gosford to the city in 25 minutes and Newcastle under an hour will be a game changer for commuters, students and many others,"" he said. ""It will reshape the geography of our city. ""Better connections across this region, south to Wollongong, north to the Central Coast and Newcastle, and linking into Sydney's west, means we will effectively work like a bigger global city, with more economic gravitational pull.""

32,Driving force: High fuel prices and wet roads not enough to dampen tourists' enthusiasm in outback SA ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Easing of COVID restrictions helps fuel rise in tourism in outback South Australia Outback traders in South Australia's remote north are experiencing a bumper season of trade as tourists hit the road after an easing of COVID restrictions. Despite continuous rain soaking roads across the region, cars are waiting bumper to bumper to fill their tanks at William Creek near Lake Eyre. ""The amount of tourists coming through is up dramatically,"" hotel owner Trevor Wright said. ""We've got a queue of 10 vehicles to get fuel. Our biggest issue is running out of fuel because of how busy it's been; we need another tanker. ""It's erratic because people are worried about roads because of rain, so I think we need to have people become a bit more confident when [the roads] are open and also [have] a better system of dissemination of information as far as the condition for these roads."" Garry Anesbury has been running the Maree Hotel while the owners are away and has been dealing with a visitor influx. ""Marree ran out of fuel on Tuesday but the petrol tanker was here the next day and it's all go again,"" Gerry said. ""I think it was only the second time in 15 years that the servo actually ran out of fuel. ""There's a lot of camping here, it's busy in the bar and restaurant and defying the trend."" Terry Brennan-Kuss from the Coober Pedy Retail, Business & Tourism Association said although high fuel prices may have affected tourists' spending power, business was still booming. ""It was a bit slow starting after the lockdowns but since April it's been going gangbusters,"" he said. ""I don't think there's one business I've spoken to in the last couple of weeks that isn't saying business is good."" Mr Brennan-Kuss, who runs a kangaroo orphanage in the town said many Coober Pedy businesses benefited from owning their own properties. ""Most of our businesses in town are well established so they've been able to ride the storm,"" he said. ""I think that's the strength of Coober Pedy whereas other places have such high rents, they couldn't keep trading. ""We're very happy, we just hope it continues."" Hawker Motors and Visitors Information Centre manager John Teague started working in the shop with his father in 1961 and said travel through the town had been consistently busy. ""There have been a lot of people and I don't know that the petrol prices have actually affected them that much,"" Mr Teague said. ""When the tanker drivers drop fuel off, they tell you how busy other places are, not just here. The price isn't affecting the amount of fuel they buy. ""It's been busy in this area around Hawker, Rawnsley Park Station has been booked out and even up to Leigh Creek and Arkaroola have been busy."" Further up the road at Wilpena Pound, resort manager Mitchell Gawthorn said expected drops in visitor numbers from fuel prices and weather conditions had not materialised. ""Over the Easter long weekend, we were at full capacity,"" Mr Gawthorne said. ""Since then we're still tracking very well. We expected some downturn but that has not been evident throughout the business."" Construction on a joint $3 million upgrade to the resort's facilities between the state government and Indigenous Business Australia began this week. ""Everything we are doing is building on the World Heritage Listing for the Flinders Ranges bid and getting it up to that level."" Jo Fort owns and operates the Innamincka Hotel at the end of the Strzelecki Track and said resilience was part of the success being experienced by outback businesses. ""I think that old-fashioned hospitality is really our point of difference,"" Ms Fort said. ""After the last two years, I think we can handle anything. ""I've lived and worked in the outback for 40-odd years and I know that what worries me today, I'm not even going to remember it next year."" Ms Fort said the busy season was in part due to tourists embracing a sense of rediscovery after the pandemic. ""People are looking to reconnect with the land and I think it has made us understand a little bit more about ourselves,"" she said. ""There's a greater appreciation and curiosity about the outback and there is such an awakening about the traditional owners and their stories. ""I'm hearing that a lot now and I'm excited about the future of Indigenous tourism and excited to become more involved in the stories they might want to share in the future.""

36,Crowds at Melbourne and Sydney airports return to pre-pandemic levels ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Melbourne and Sydney airport crowds return to pre-pandemic levels on busy Queen's Birthday long weekend Crowds at Sydney and Melbourne airports have returned to pre-pandemic levels as travellers celebrate the Queen's Birthday long weekend. New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, Northern Territory, South Australia and Tasmania will all mark the day on Monday, June 13, giving many a three-day weekend. Airports in Sydney and Melbourne saw long queues on Friday morning, but the situation later calmed down. As the south-east shivers through a colder-than-average winter, travellers in Victoria appear to be heading north for warmer weather. Melbourne Airport said it was expecting about 97,000 travellers to pass through its terminals on Friday alone —  its busiest day since the pandemic hit. That's more than the 90,000 passengers who passed through on Good Friday, a day of travel chaos for the country. Melbourne Airport spokesperson Andrew Lund said travellers should make sure to arrive on time. ""Certainly some check-in areas have been quite busy this morning,"" he said about 8am. ""We're advising people to arrive between one and two hours ahead of a domestic flight and two to three hours ahead of international flights."" The airport said travellers should not arrive any earlier, as check-in would not be open. Road traffic into the airport was also heavy on Friday morning. In Sydney, traffic had already banked up by 6am, with queues snaking through the entire building. At one terminal, the security screening line wrapped around outside. About 80,000 travellers are expected to pass through the Sydney building on Friday, back to what would be expected on an average long weekend before the pandemic struck. Some travellers told the ABC they had missed their flights, despite arriving on time. Nearly 8 per cent of flights departing both Melbourne and Sydney airports up until 10:30am were cancelled, according to the airports' departure trackers. Airport authorities are hoping it is not a repeat of the Easter weekend, which saw protracted delays, cancelled flights and missing luggage amid widespread staff shortages across the country. Daily COVID-19 cases have dropped since the Easter peak, and close contact rules have been relaxed, freeing up more staff. But Sydney Airport currently has job vacancies for about 5,000 people across about 800 organisations. Its CEO says about 15,000 jobs were lost when the pandemic first hit. It will host a ""jobs fair"" from next week in a bid to fill the roles and avoid chaos during the upcoming school holidays. Melbourne Airport is also facing staff shortages, particularly in baggage handling. Unions have said the pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities in the aviation sector and have called for more security for workers.

38,Night curfew and dog supervision: some of Australia's strictest holiday home laws enforced,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Strict Airbnb, holiday home laws now enforced in Busselton, Dunsborough, Yallingup Some of Australia's strictest laws for Airbnb and holiday home users have been approved in one of the country's busiest tourism and wine regions. The local laws passed by the City of Busselton in Western Australia's south-west holiday hotspot region impose a night curfew on guests and require pet dogs to never be left unattended. It's part of the second stage of regulatory changes that give the city, which includes the popular tourist regions of Dunsborough, Yallingup, and parts of Margaret River, the power to deregister holiday homes not adhering to the new code of conduct. It also mandates property managers to respond to queries from the public within 12 hours. Busselton Mayor Grant Henley said the new regulations meant short-term rental managers were now on notice. ""It certainly gives us a mechanism and a trigger to potentially deregister and to not re-register some businesses if they're doing the wrong thing,"" Mr Henley said. ""There have been issues of a small number of operators of commercial holiday homes, who haven't behaved in a neighbourly manner. ""It's been built up over a number of years that they just get these repeat bad visitors who impact on the local community and the managers don't seem to be taking seriously those concerns."" The code of conduct for holiday home visitors was finalised in April and included a limit on the number of guests past 10pm. It also mandated that owners display a sign with the manager's contact details visible from the street. People renting short-term accommodation will also be forbidden from leaving their dogs unattended at the property at any time. The changes due to come into effect in September also include: Local operators previously supported the move, claiming it levels the playing field between them and the big online providers like Airbnb and Stayz. John Ryall owns Exclusive Escapes Dunsborough, which manages about 100 properties in the City of Busselton, and said it allowed all managers to act in the same manner. ""We're very happy with the changes. From a professional short-stay accommodation property management business perspective, these all make good sense to us,"" he said. The third stage of regulatory changes proposed by the City of Busselton could see commercial holiday homes banned from some residential areas. ""Areas that are predominantly urban, have a reasonable density, that aren't suitable for further holiday homes, we may look at curbing that growth into some of those areas,"" Mr Henley said. ""But we're waiting to see what the outcome is of the state government's consideration of their own regulatory framework.""

40,Want to book an overseas flight this year? Here's what to expect,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Demand for overseas flights sees 'severe shortage of seats' as travel gears up post-COVID Just months after Queensland's border reopened to the world, demand for seats on overseas flights is contributing to higher-than-usual ticket prices. It has been two-and-a-half years since the pandemic turned the aviation industry on its head, grounding flights and halting travel across the world. Now the sector is finally starting to recover, but it is struggling to keep up with demand. CEO of Brisbane-based Flight Centre, Graham Turner, said on overseas flights there was a ""severe shortage of seats"" and the industry ""desperately needs more capacity"". ""It's being reflected in prices, particularly premium ones,"" Mr Turner said. Between peak season price hikes, expensive aviation fuel, staff shortages and lack of capacity issues, coupled with high demand for travel, it is a perfect storm for costly flights. Mr Turner said prices would not likely drop for another six to eight months. ""The Northern Hemisphere summer period is going to be significantly more expensive than pre-COVID — we think that will probably continue up till Christmas,"" he said. Yesterday, major US airline United Airlines announced it would fly three times per week from San Francisco to Brisbane from October. Tourism Minister Stirling Hinchliffe said the deal was Queensland's ""pathway to success and a pathway back to the $6 billion tourism industry"". Brisbane Airport aviation general manager Ryan Both said it would help fill demand, but there would not be an immediate effect on prices. ""As capacity returns and the normal competitive dynamic returns, then we'll see a normalisation of the airfares,"" Mr Both said. ""It is going to take some time to rebuild, but the demand is there and that's encouraging — people want to travel."" But overseas departures are nowhere near where they were pre-pandemic. Data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in March 2019 showed that 309,710 people flew overseas from Queensland. In 2020, that number was sitting at just 4,740. But since international borders reopened to vaccinated travellers in February this year, that number had risen to 54,270 for the month of March. Confidence in the aviation industry is bouncing back and Mr Turner said there was no need to be concerned about travelling overseas.

""There is absolutely no reason now to travel to most countries and have any major fears,"" Mr Turner said. ""The main problem is queues — particularly at peak periods — there will be some congestion at airports.""

41,'Hypocrisy': Airline boss slams union's move to strike,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Pilots' strike on the table after wage negotiations break down between Rex, union Regional Express Airlines (Rex) could have a strike on its hands after the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) successfully lodged an application with the Fair Work Commission. A vote will take place from the June 15-22 A federation spokesperson said the potential for protected industrial action came after recent failed negotiations where staff were offered a deal ""worse than previous offers"". But Rex has hit back hard, labelling the union's decision to reject the proposed pay rise as ""beyond belief"". The federation spokesperson said the organisation had been ""attempting to negotiate a new Enterprise Agreement since early 2018"". However, the offer they received from Rex last Friday was ""even worse than previous offers"" made by the company, according to union. The spokesperson said the latest offer ""represents a cut in a real-term salary of more than 5 per cent since 2018"". ""It does not contain back pay and does not cover CPI over the previous four years,"" the spokesperson said. In response, Rex deputy chairman John Sharp said it was disappointed the pilot's union had applied to the Fair Work Commission for permission to hold a ballot to take industrial action. ""Just last September, the AFAP agreed to a 2 per cent pay rise in 2021 and 2022 for QantasLink pilots saying ""we are pleased to have arrived at a pragmatic outcome for the QantasLink pilot group,"" he said. ""Rex, on the other hand, has offered its Saab [a model of aircraft] pilots a 5.1 per cent pay rise from July 1, 2022, plus significant catch-up payments worth another 8 per cent once the business is profitable again,"" Mr Sharp said. ""It clearly demonstrates that it [AFAP] is not really interested in protecting its members' interest but rather in pursuing its own agenda. ""We believe the vast majority of our pilots are company-minded and can see through the hypocrisy of the AFAP."" According to Rex, it is the only airline that did not retrench any of its pilots throughout the course of the pandemic. ""We believe they will stand by the company during this period where the recovery is nascent and the company is still fragile,"" Mr Sharp said. Now that it's approved by the Fair Work Commission a poll will be conducted of pilots. Rex Pilots will have seven days from June 15 to vote in the protected action ballot. According to procedure, if more than 50 per cent vote to take industrial action, strikes are required to begin within 30 days of the result.

42,"ACCC sues Airbnb, alleges it misled customers over pricing",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Airbnb sued by ACCC for allegedly misleading customers about accommodation prices Accommodation firm Airbnb has been sued by the competition regulator to force the holiday rental company to compensate thousands of customers for allegedly misleading them about prices. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) accused Airbnb of deceiving people into believing that prices for Australian accommodation were in Australian dollars when in many cases they were in US dollars. It has taken the company to the Federal Court to force it to pay refunds and damages. ACCC chairman Gina Cass-Gottlieb told the ABC 2,000 customers had complained to Airbnb, and many more were likely to have been affected, with the watchdog seeing a peak in complaints in 2021 and numerous complaints on social media. The ACCC said between at least January 2018 and August last year, Airbnb misled people by displaying prices on its website and mobile app using a dollar sign, but not making it clear the price was in US dollars. ""Airbnb's misleading conduct meant that consumers were deprived of the opportunity to make an informed choice about whether, and at what price, to book their holiday accommodation on the Airbnb platform,"" ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. ""In addition to paying higher prices than expected, some consumers who were charged in US dollars also found themselves further out of pocket through currency conversion fees charged by their credit card provider."" When thousands of people complained, Ms Cass-Gottlieb said Airbnb allegedly told many customers the prices were shown in US currency because they had selected that option. Airbnb's country manager for Australia and New Zealand, Susan Wheeldon, told the ABC in a statement it would fully compensate all affected customers and investigate how the problems occurred. ""While a fraction of a percentage of guests are believed to have been impacted, we were nonetheless extremely disappointed to have found that this occurred and we will compensate affected guests,"" Ms Wheeldon said. ""Upon this issue being brought to our attention by the ACCC, we worked to update our platform so that the relevant currencies are clearly displayed from the first page for all Australian guests booking stays on our platform. ""We're also conducting a comprehensive review of how this issue occurred and the way in which guest complaints were initially handled."" Social worker and mother-of-two, Penny Wearne, told the ABC she had to battle Airbnb for about two months to get a refund when she was overcharged nearly $300 in 2018 for accommodation in Victoria's Dandenong Ranges where she was attending a friend's wedding. Ms Wearne said the price when she booked was $799,  but she found out the actual cost was almost $1,100 because she was charged in US currency. Eventually Airbnb agreed to refund her the $300, but only after she had paid the full amount. It then offered her a voucher for $150, which she refused, and was then refunded the $300. ""I paid the final amount and then they came back to me and said, 'We'll offer you a $150 Airbnb voucher,'"" she said. ""And that was after they'd agreed that they would refund it, and so I just really lost it."" Ms Wearne supports the court action. ""They need to be held to account … [their actions were] totally criminal.  It was like they had actually stolen my money,"" she said. ""They might as well just come into your bank account and take your money. ""And, you know, it was very clearly advertised at that price of $799 Australian dollars, so I wasn't expecting to be charged more than that."" The ACCC has called for customers affected by problems with Airbnb's currency display to contact it. It said it was seeking ""declarations, injunctions, pecuniary penalties, orders for the compensation for affected consumers, costs, and other orders"". ""By taking this action, we are stating very clearly that digital platforms like Airbnb need to ensure the accuracy of all statements that may affect consumers’ purchasing decisions,"" Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. ""Despite thousands of consumers complaining to Airbnb about the way prices were displayed, Airbnb did not amend its booking platform until after the ACCC raised the issue."" Ms Cass-Gottlieb said Airbnb changed the way currencies were displayed in November last year after intervention by the ACCC.

46,'From a standstill to 500 miles an hour': Travel industry fights to keep up with demand,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Travel agents say COVID is making overseas travel more complicated than ever, but a severe workforce shortage means they cannot help everyone through the process. ""The level of service you need to provide each individual customer, to navigate COVID restrictions globally, is a really long and complicated process,"" chief executive of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents (AFTA) Dean Long said. ""Unfortunately, [some agencies] are having to turn customers away because they just don't have the ability to serve the number of requests that are needed."" A travel agent on the NSW Mid North Coast said he had never seen as much demand. ""It has been crazy. We have gone from basically a standstill to going 500 miles an hour,"" Bellingen's Windsong Travel owner James Cracknell said. Mr Cracknell's pre-pandemic workforce of 22 had reduced to five, which is even lower than the sector-wide shortage of one-third of what is needed. ""We have advertised and advertised trying to get people back in the industry,"" he said. ""We're absolutely desperate and the whole industry is the same."" Mr Cracknell said one option could be to expand Australia's working holiday program from people up to 30 years old to those aged 50. ""That would be an easy solution, to bring out a whole different range of workers to fill the gaps while the industry recovers,"" he said. International passengers out of Australia jumped 270 per cent in the year leading up to March 30. Mr Cracknell said higher prices for airfares were not deterring customers, despite being at levels he had not seen since he started in the industry in 1998. ""An average airfare to Europe at the moment is well over $3,000 if you want to travel in the next few months, so we are seeing the airlines obviously trying to make as much money [as possible],"" he said. It is something Nicole Moore can relate to. The Sawtell-based birth trauma specialist recently paid $4,000 to fly between Coffs Harbour and Germany for work in July. ""My profit margin is greatly reduced according to the extra expense,"" she said. ""I think travel anxiety is real given what happened for so many people in the past two years, people getting stuck and all those things. ""[But] I don't want to live a life of fear, I want to bring my work to the world. I don't want my whole career to be held back."" Mr Long was not surprised people still wanted to fly. ""Travel is sometimes there as a discretionary figure, but when you actually look at the figures for the past 20 years … 6 to 7 per cent of household income is spent on travel regardless of the economic conditions,"" he said. ""It is what people want to spend their money on and we expect that to continue."" He said the industry had struggled to keep up having lost more than a third of the sector's workforce through the pandemic and called on the new federal government for measures to help the industry employ more people. ""At a time when travelling Australians need professional travel advice more than ever, we urgently need to address this skills and workforce shortage,"" he said. Australia's Minister for Tourism, Senator Don Farrell, has been contacted for comment.

47,Some foreign tourists still facing long delays for visas to visit Australia,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Foreign travellers still facing long waits for Australian tourist visas The tourism industry is urging the Home Affairs Department to speed up the processing of tourist visas as some travellers face months-long delays to enter Australia to holiday or see family. While there was much fanfare when Australia fully reopened to the world in February, the recovery for tourist operators has been sluggish, with overseas arrivals still far below pre-pandemic levels. ""If we make it difficult for them to get a visa and it takes forever, they'll take their money and trip elsewhere,"" Margy Osmond, chief executive of the Tourism and Transport Forum, told 7.30. ""It is actually damaging our brand not to be able to get those visas out the door as quickly as possible in the most appropriate way."" Australia's $60 billion tourism industry lost an estimated 610,000 jobs during the pandemic. Queenslander Leonora Luff told 7.30 she was desperate to reconnect with her relatives in the Philippines but they had been waiting five months for their tourist visa to visit Australia. They have not heard back from the department and applicants are unable to check on the status of their application. Ms Luff said she had not seen her young niece for years and had not met her one-year-old nephew. ""The stress to the family, the emotional toll and the psychological toll, it can be unbearable,"" she said. ""It is very important for me because they're like my children, they're my joy, they're my world."" The Home Affairs Department said it had experienced a 427 per cent increase in visitor visa holders since the border was partially reopened to some travellers in November last year. The department says tourist-visa processing times have improved from 20 months to 37 days for 90 per cent of applications as it works through the backlog. When asked what applicants should do if they had not heard about their visa status, the Home Affairs Department did not provide a direct answer, but said: ""All applications are assessed on a case by case basis and processing times can vary due to individual circumstance and whether or not the application lodged was incomplete or required further information."" Many operators, such as BridgeClimb in Sydney, which runs the iconic Harbour Bridge climbing tour, are yet to see pre-pandemic numbers of foreign tourists return. Domestic sightseers now make up the majority of current sales. ""We couldn't keep going at this rate for an elongated period of time,"" chief executive Deb Zimmer said. ""What we can see is the green shoots, and we're really hopeful, but for us the litmus test really is December and January."" On top of visa delays and aviation constraints, Australia's tourism sector is facing a $12 billion black hole because the Chinese visitor market has evaporated. Before the pandemic, Chinese tourists were the largest and biggest-spending group of visitors to Australia — about 1.4 million people a year. Now Chinese tourists have dropped to eighth spot, with British visitors now on top. That is because China is still living under a hardline zero-COVID strategy, meaning residents face localised lockdowns and restrictions on non-essential travel out of the country. Jian Sun runs a bus tour in Sydney that specialises in Chinese visitors. He has had to switch to domestic Chinese Australians to fill in the gap, and is worried about how long it might take for Chinese nationals to return. ""We feel a bit nervous and stressed because of the uncertainty,"" he told 7.30. While the industry expects a slow recovery, it celebrated a significant milestone last month with the return of the Australian Tourism Exchange, an expo where buyers and sellers do business. It was the first time in two years that overseas buyers could meet face to face with Australian operators. Tourism operator Sherry Heard travelled from Texas to see what Australia had to offer to Americans. Ms Heard told 7.30 she believed people should not fear taking an overseas trip. ""The world is fully equipped to handle all types of tourism, whether it's here in Australia or any part of the world,"" she said. ""It's time that people start travelling again.""

48,Could Darwin become a tourism hotspot in the wet season?,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tourism NT starts push to increase wet season tourism in Greater Darwin, drive up visitation year-round For six months each year, when the humidity level soars in and around Darwin, demand for tours with local tour guide Rob Woods's small ecotourism company takes a steep dive. ""I'd say [there's] probably a 60 per cent, 70 per cent drop from, say, June, July numbers down to say October,"" he said. ""Each operator is going to have different statistics on that … but, especially, with what we do, it is a big drop."" Even then, Mr Woods and his wife Tracey's company is one of the busier Top End tour guide businesses when the wet season rolls around: it's one of the relatively few that remains open at all. According to statistics from the Northern Territory Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade, 396,000 people visited the Greater Darwin region during the wet season in 2019, compared to 512,000 in the Dry — a fall of about 23 per cent. With the drop in numbers, a high number of tour businesses close in the wet season, while some hotels reduce capacity and restaurants can close for a month or more. But that could soon change. Tourism NT is trying to smooth out the well-known seasonality of the Top End tourism by driving up visitor numbers in the wet season. It's part of a strategy for the Greater Darwin region, which aims to boost operator profits, support a more stable workforce and encourage more investment in the industry. Scott Lovett, the department's deputy chief executive for tourism, said ""changing the perception"" Darwin was only worth visiting during the dry season was key to boosting the industry's value to $3 billion by 2030, from its current value of $1.84 billion. ""One of the best ways we think to grow the visitor economy up to $3 billion, is to look at the shoulder season, the wet season, as an opportunity for us to grow."" While international tourism to the NT dried up during the pandemic, as it did everywhere else, for a short time the relatively COVID-free jurisdiction became a go-to destination for domestic travellers — including during the wet season. Hundreds of millions of dollars awarded to an Australian world heritage site has been left sitting in the bank as tourism operators scream out for new facilities. Even with no international tourists and some border controls still in place, Greater Darwin recorded 195,000 visitors during the 2020-21 wet season, with multiple businesses — including Mr Woods's company — reporting higher-than-usual domestic visitor numbers. Mr Lovett said that experience had opened stakeholders' eyes to the possibilities of attracting more tourists in the wet season. ""It can be done. We're adamant about that,"" he said. Ulrike Kachel, a tourism researcher at Charles Darwin University, said the uptick in tourism in that period could open up a range of new possibilities for operators in the Top End. ""We didn't really have much experience in that sense [before], because in the past we've focused much more on the dry season,"" she said. ""I think there are now opportunities because tourists came more during the wet season, and hopefully that will help even with just word of mouth, spreading the word that Darwin is actually not that bad during the wet season. With high humidity, heavy rain and storms and even the occasional cyclone all features of the Top End's wet season, it's little surprise visitor demand has historically been quieter over the Wet. But Tourism NT believes weather isn't as great a deterrent for travellers as many may think. Mr Lovett said Singapore and Bali, which enjoy strong year-round tourism despite their tropical climates, were two cases in point. ""The simple reality is, when we go to Bali or when we go to Singapore, two areas with a similar sort of climate to what Darwin and its surrounds has, seasonality doesn't enter into most people's consciousness,"" he said. ""What do [those places] do that we don't? Why do you go to Bali in December? Because lots of people do."" Manuel Pamkal had never heard of TikTok. Twelve months later, the Katherine tour guide became a star on the platform. For Mr Lovett, the number one problem is a lack of ""product"" in the wet season, including infrastructure, activities and attractions. He said following Singapore and Bali's lead, more water-based attractions and more ""resort-style"" accommodation would be some of the biggest game changers for the region in the Wet. And while Tourism NT is keen to play down the importance of weather, he admitted that cooling and greening central Darwin would make wet season conditions a lot more pleasant for tourists. ""In Darwin city, I think [the result] looks like a really vibrant city centre, with more hotels and restaurants, great entertainment options, events, open green space running through the city and down towards the [Darwin] Waterfront, lots of water-based activities, and quite an activated city space,"" he said. Dr Kachel said with Top End communities used to tourism activity considerably slowing down in the Wet, the lack of events and activities on at that time of year also played a role. ""At the moment it sounds like 'oh nothing is happening during the Wet', in terms of events and markets, or not much else, and then people might get the impression that there's nothing there,"" she said. Asked if, with significant development, Darwin could one day increase wet season tourism to the point where year-round visitation matched Singapore and Bali, Mr Lovett said: ""Why not?"" ""Whether we are going to register the same level of visitation as Bali or Singapore in the next few years? Probably not. But I think we locals tend to think to ourselves, 'well it's the wet season and no one's going to travel here',"" he said. ""Weather alone is not the major inhibitor, or it doesn't need to be the major inhibitor."" For now, during the wet season, Mr Woods says things aren't so bad for his company. The business makes enough money during the Dry to tide it over year-round and runs tours specifically tailored to the Wet – though with much fewer tourists – when the season kicks in. But he said an increase in wet season tourism across Greater Darwin would benefit all operators across the region. ""Not only can we boost it, we should boost it, because the wet season has every bit of specialness and unique educational components and experiential value that the dry season has,"" he said. ""At the moment it feels like we're only sharing half of the cake.""

49,Pearl farmers ready to unlock challenging tourism jewel,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Abrolhos Islands pearl farmers see future in tourism From catching lobsters to growing pearls, Jane Liddon has lived an extraordinary life on the remote islands she calls home. But she never imagined her work and her story would become part of a tourism event held in her backyard. Jane moved to the Abrolhos Islands, 60 kilometres off the West Australian coast, as a child from England. She has continued her father's legacy of commercial crayfishing using jet boats, and 20 years ago she diversified into pearl farming. Her ""boutique"" pearl farm now produces pearls which are sold around the world, championed by Jane's son Jesse and his wife Michela, who designs jewellery. Their passion for the family's pearls, and joy in sharing the story of the rugged but beautiful environment where they are grown, has seen them begin a new chapter in the Liddon family's life at the Abrolhos. ""For me, tourism is is the way forward,"" Jane said. ""And Jesse and Michela are running with that. I probably wouldn't have done it, but it's come to me."" For the past two years, the Liddons have hosted a weekend of long lunches for 60 people at a time on Post Office Island where they are based. It's a new marketing strategy bringing the public to the pearl farm. ""Pearls and Plates is an event that we have created in the last few years that is combining all of our passions and loves of music, art, beautiful food, beautiful drinks and our pearls,"" Jesse said. ""And it just creates a nice feeling to have people on the island experience our family island, having a great time."" For Jesse, visitors to the island are the way of the future, but in a ""light touch"" manner. ""Maybe the [tourism] shift is going away from the traditional kind of fishing charters and it's going more towards what we do, which is high value, low impact,"" he said. ""People are here for four or five hours and then they go away."" The remote and pristine Abrolhos Islands are dotted with colourful shacks that are a base for lobster fishers while they work the local waters. Some tourism operators take visitors to the islands, but the weather can make the journey from the mainland difficult, and regulations currently do not allow for guests to stay overnight on land. Want more local news? Sign up for the weekly ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt email newsletter Developing more tourism opportunities at the Abrolhos has been on the WA government's agenda for many years. In 2017 it committed to ""develop a new whole-of-government approach to better protect the Abrolhos and create tourism opportunities"" and later this year it is expected to release a new management plan for the Abrolhos, integrating tourism, conservation, aquaculture and fishing. Consultancy firm Agdots was contracted by the state government to meet members of the Abrolhos community as part of its preparation work to create a new management plan. While it found most members of the commercial fishing industry supported marine-based tourism activities on the islands, it was also a point of conflict due to fears about tourism creating ""risks"" to the fishing industry. For the past 19 years Jay Cox has chartered eco cruises to the Abrolhos, taking guests on a five-day sail around the islands. He said developing an eco-tourism business had not been easy, largely due to opposition from some concerned by the prospect of people not involved in the fishing industry visiting the islands. Mr Cox hopes a new tourism framework will allow him to have a permanent base on the islands and access to infrastructure like jetties and walking paths, things he says tourism operators can't currently develop. ""We're waiting for the government to show some strength and push through these barriers,"" he said. ""We cart everything over with every trip, if [we] could have a base over there with camps and things to house our staff and moorings, and have the boat based there and fly everyone in and out, it would be a lot easier."" ""You see all sorts of things, whales and dolphins and nature just happening in front of you,"" he said. ""Bait balls and birds feeding on them, mackerel and tuna coming in, there's just so much going on out there."" Crayfisher and pearl farmer Andrew Basile heads up the Southern Group body corporate, one of four of the fishing industry representative groups at the Abrolhos. He said tourism, fishing and aquaculture could coexist and develop if managed correctly. ""We need we need some basic infrastructure here,"" he said. ""We need capabilities for anybody in the reserve to make a phone call in an emergency. ""I would like to see some dedicated rescue resources and an increase in public mooring just for guys who've come up there on their boats.""

50,The long-running battle over a Great Ocean Road eco-resort proposal,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Long-running battle over Great Ocean Road eco-resort proposal It's an age-old story — the million-dollar development and the locals who oppose it. But at Princetown, in south-west Victoria, a battle over plans to build an eco-resort near the Great Ocean Road is more than just a fight between development and the environment. On one side are the proponents, whose eco-lodge-and-restaurant proposal has the backing of the state and federal governments, regional tourist organisations, local council, and the area's catchment management authority. They say the construction of the eco-resort near the mouth of the Gellibrand River is vital to helping revive a struggling tourism industry and capitalising on one of the under-valued jewels in Australia's tourism crown — the Great Ocean Road. On the other side are locals and environmentalists who say the development not only puts an entire ecosystem at risk, but is a flood disaster waiting to happen that could cost lives. The Great Ocean Road begins at Torquay near Geelong, runs along some of Australia's most beautiful coastline, and ends just east of Warrnambool in south-west Victoria. Pre-pandemic, it attracted more visitors than Uluru and the Great Barrier Reef combined, pumping an estimated $1.3 billion into the economy and creating approximately 11,200 jobs. But for two-thirds of visitors, the Great Ocean Road is not a place to stay — they're day-trippers who hop in a car or bus in Melbourne or Geelong, reach the Twelve Apostles, then turn around and head back to the city. As a result, the tourist route and its surroundings are seen as a land of missed opportunities. Great Ocean Road Regional Tourism (GORRT) general manager Liz Price said a recent study found there was a 3,000 to 4,000 room shortage in accommodation along the road. ""The challenge people aren't necessarily understanding is there's lots of small accommodation [but no larger facilities],"" Ms Price said, noting the most recent large-scale accommodation built along the road was the RACV Torquay Resort, which opened in 2013. ""It really is quite a complex challenge to build the sustainability of the region in the long term."" But the proposed Princetown Eco-Stay project was a step in the right direction that GORRT supported, Ms Price said. The federal and state governments have also contributed more than $7 million. Montarosa Pty Ltd plans to build an eco-lodge with 18 rooms and 20 villas, sleeping up to 200 people, on farmland next to the Princetown campgrounds and now unused footy ground. It will also build a 300-seat restaurant and an activity centre as a base for hiking, kayaking, and cycling. The site is just off the Great Ocean Road and sits along the Great Ocean Walk and Gellibrand River, about a five-minute drive from the Twelve Apostles. The state government's Shipwreck Coast master plan singled out the spot as a possible site for ""low-key eco-tourism opportunities"". Montarosa director Gavin Ronan and his wife bought the farmland about six years ago, having previously set up an award-winning eco-lodge along the Great Ocean Walk that they operated for more than a decade. Mr Ronan said they did their homework to ensure the resort was the right fit for their property. ""We've been through every hoop to make sure that we're doing this by the book and sustainably,"" Mr Ronan said. ""It's in our interest as eco-tourism operators [to] protect and enhance the natural environment that surrounds us."" Locals who oppose the development have raised concerns about acid sulphate soils, the impact of the development on local flora and fauna, traffic issues, and potential pollution from the site. The lodge will be built beside federally-listed nationally important wetlands, that are home to threatened flora and fauna. There's also only one access road to the site and they're concerned hundreds of tourists could be stranded, or put in danger in times of flood. Resident Kim Morton said flooding occurred regularly in the area, including a major flood in 2010 and minor floods in 2015 and 2016. ""The fact that it's only a couple of hundred metres from the ocean, the storm surge that affects the site can be pretty severe,"" Ms Morton said. ""If we get river flooding as well, it could be catastrophic. Concerned residents, unimpressed by Montarosa's own flood reports and the work of the Corangamite Catchment Management Authority, hired their own consultant to assess the flood risk in the area. Floodplain consultant Matt Hayes, who has worked in the industry for 25 years, said ""the developer's [preliminary] flood report … treated an incredibly complex bit of floodplain as if it's a bathtub"". ""It has grossly underestimated the flood risk,"" Mr Hayes said. ""They're saying the 1-in-100-year flood level is 2.3 metres, and it's beyond the scope of probability that it could be more than 3 metres ... and it could be even more than that."" Mr Hayes said Montarosa's ""preliminary hydraulic report"" from 2016 used only two rain or flow gauges along the Gellibrand River and about eight years of data to make its assessment. Mr Hayes used 44 gauges in the catchment or wider area and assessed many decades of data. ""They've cherry-picked the data,"" he said. He said in a 3-metre-plus flood, the resort would only be accessible by helicopter or boat, and the floodwaters would be in the accommodation. ""It would be pushing a huge volume of water quite fast and the damage that does with debris from the catchment can be phenomenal,"" Mr Hayes said. ""[The location] is just far too volatile — I've never seen anything like this. ""It's the wrong place to put any kind of resort — to site major infrastructure in the estuary is foolhardy at best. ""It just looks like this desire to have facilities on the Great Ocean Road is blinding people to the need to make sure that it's done safely."" Mr Ronan disputed Mr Hayes's assessment, noting that a further flood report had been done and the Corangamite Catchment Management Authority had signed off on the project. He has accused the locals of spreading misinformation to ""influence public opinion"". ""Our property is 120 acres in size, it goes up to 20 metres above sea level, nearly 30 acres of it is cleared farmland above the wetland and floodplain, and we've concentrated our development on that high ground."" Mr Ronan said the ""misinformation"" is part of a campaign against him and his family. ""We're just a family business from regional Victoria, and the behaviour we've had from these people has been very stressful."" There have been protests on the site numerous times in recent years, with a dispute over access to the property last year triggering police intervention and accusations from both sides. The matter went through the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT), where it was settled following mediation and negotiation. A permit for the development was approved, and Mr Ronan hopes the resort will open within two years. But Ms Morton said the fight was not over yet. ""The community certainly understands that we need more accommodation along here,"" she said. ""The community is definitely not against development — it's just this site, this is just the wrong site for it."" She pointed to proposed hot springs and accommodation further along the Great Ocean Road that has the full support of her group. Ms Morton and her fellow opponents believe Mr Ronan has not met the 70 conditions imposed on him by VCAT, though Mr Ronan disagrees. Locals are taking the local Corangamite Shire back to VCAT for a two-day hearing in October, alleging a failure to adhere to the conditions. But the community also feels the cards are stacked against them, given the wide-ranging bureaucratic support for the project. Former Corangamite Shire mayor and local resident Neil Trotter said the fact the project had been given federal and state funding to improve the road and bridge leading to the site had been particularly galling. ""My contention is that public money shouldn't be expended on a project that has an inherent risk of flooding,"" Mr Trotter said. ""You have crumbling infrastructure [around here], yet $8 million is handed over to the private developer when that money could be spent on improving public roads, communications, etc. ""The developer has a right to put up a development and, to date, he's probably gone through due process, but my contention is that public funding shouldn't be allocated to the project, especially in the amount that it has been. ""[Local federal member Dan] Tehan has stated [the funding] was for community benefit — well, the community didn't want it."" Mr Tehan's office was approached for comment but did not respond.

54,"If Australia's richest person can't develop Great Keppel Island, who can?",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Woppa-Great Keppel Island's future in limbo as Gina Rinehart abandons plans to redevelop Australia's richest person is the third in five years to abandon plans to redevelop the once-famous Woppa-Great Keppel Island, off the central coast of Queensland. With Gina Rinehart's deep pockets, there were high hopes among residents and tourism operators in the region that the mining magnate would be the one to pull off what others had so far failed to do. But after an extensive review process into the feasibility of her company's plans to build a world-class beach club, Hancock Prospecting has decided it cannot proceed with the project. It begs the question: if the richest person in Australia cannot develop Great Keppel Island, then who can? State Member for Keppel Brittany Lauga said she was not sure what would happen now. ""We've had developer after developer, a revolving door come through looking to redevelop the islands, and each time it's failed,"" she said. ""If Gina Rinehart can't develop Great Keppel, I'm not sure who can."" She said developing an island presented far more challenges than building a resort on the mainland. ""I don't think there's anyone to blame here and Hancock is certainly not blaming anyone. It's just a really difficult prospect of developing resorts on islands,"" she said. Ms Lauga said she was committed to the island's revitalisation and, if it could not be done through the private sector, the state government would have to reassess the options. ""If the market can't make it work, then perhaps we need to look at different ways of the existing lease arrangements,"" she said. ""We perhaps need to look at infrastructure."" Livingstone Shire Mayor Andy Ireland said he spoke to Hancock Prospecting's project engineer and understood the company's decision to walk away was purely commercial. ""[Gina Rinehart] had been very, very pleased with the level of involvement and commitment from all levels of government … it really just wasn't viable,"" Mr Ireland said. ""Many people will be disappointed by this, but the cost of developing islands is significantly more than the cost of developing our mainland. ""It certainly makes it challenging … If she can't make it work … it's going to be very difficult for anyone else to do."" Decades ago, Woppa-Great Keppel Island was a party destination famous for its ""get wrecked on Keppel"" slogan in the 1980s. But when the main resort closed in 2008 during the global financial crisis, ferries stopped being booked, and tourists stopped coming. In 2012, Tower Holdings had a master plan approved to turn it into a $600-million development complete with golf courses, shops, accommodation, a casino and a marina. But after numerous run-ins with the Queensland government over casino licences and deadline lapses, that never eventuated. Tower Holdings then demolished part of the decaying resort in 2018 and put it on the market. In 2018, a Singaporean-Taiwanese investor initiated plans to buy the lease to the old resort, but that fell through in 2019. After that, Sunshine Coast-based developers Altum Property Group signed a contract to take over the lease, but two years later, the state government found the company did not have the ""financial capability to deliver the proposed development"". In October 2021, Ms Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting announced it had started discussions to buy the Great Keppel Island leases. Tourism body Capricorn Enterprise chief executive Mary Carroll said she was not surprised Hancock Prospecting's plans had fallen through. ""For resort accommodation to occur on Great Keppel Island, it needs three critical components,"" she said. ""That is political leadership, competent bureaucracy, and development collaboration. ""So those three things have to go hand in hand before the stars can align."" The land is owned by the Queensland government, and the resort lease is still owned by Tower Holdings. Ms Carroll said the lease was incredibly complex, with 60 pages of conditions and many stakeholders involved in the development process. ""There's been a history of developers looking at this and investigating, and Altum Property Groups came the closest,"" she said. ""There's development conditions on top of that, there's many stakeholders. ""There's three departments in the state government that are involved, and that's the Department of Resources, the Department of Tourism, and the Office of the Coordinator-General. There's interdepartmental politics. It's a very, very complex project. ""Bureaucracy certainly was the biggest issue with Altum Property Group, I can say that."" Ms Carroll said that given Tower Holdings and multiple others had failed with their development plans, the state government needed to take some responsibility for making progress on the island. A traditional owner confirms the mining magnate's Hancock Prospecting has abandoned its plans for a ""world-class, year-round beach club, sandy bars and shopping"". ""So the state government really are the only ones that can resolve the issue, to look forward to a future of having result development on Great Keppel,"" she said. Ms Carroll said there was support from locals behind the idea of splitting the 160-hectare lease into smaller lots. ""Whether it's another developer, or whether it's a joint venture, or whether it's the government buying back that land and reconfiguring the land,"" she said. ""… Except when I suggested that to a recent, very high-ranking politician in Queensland, they said, 'We're not going to pay a cent.'"" Ms Carroll said she was just trying to offer ""commercial, realistic opportunities where it could be a win-win"" for all sides. ""That is one option,"" she said. ""And there's many other options, I believe, that are before us."" The Department of State Development said in a statement yesterday it had started master planning of Great Keppel Island to identify the community vision for the island. Great Keppel Island accommodation operator Geoff Mercer said the right developer needed to meet the environmental expectations of the traditional owners and broader community. Mr Mercer said he supported the idea that the resort lease should be split up to allow more operators to work on the island. ""I've been involved in a couple of discussions at times, the idea of that, so the Island is never at the mercy of one big operator,"" Mr Mercer said. ""So there's a lot of sense in having small leases and having four or five operators marketing Great Keppel Island. ""Not dissimilar to what happens in the Whitsundays, where you've got many operators talking about the Whitsundays, and it gives it a greater marketing."" Mayor Andy Ireland said it was time the state government made an overall strategic plan for the future of the island and local businesses. He said a first step should be cleaning up the environmental damage caused by the abandoned, half-demolished old resort. ""A lot of the commentary we get from visitors coming to our region is they have been quite dismayed to see the level of environmental damage caused by that in the state of it.""

56,Gina Rinehart backs out of plans to redevelop Woppa-Great Keppel Island resort site,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting backs out Woppa-Great Keppel Island resort redevelopment Mining magnate Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting has abandoned its plans to redevelop Woppa-Great Keppel Island, a traditional owner has confirmed. The company first announced it would acquire the lease for the once-iconic resort off the central Queensland coast in October. The southern Great Barrier Reef island resort closed in 2008 and has since had several development applications from different companies fall through. Traditional owner and director of Woppaburra Saltwater Aboriginal Corporation, Bob Muir, said he received a letter from the company stating its intention to abandon the development. ""It just let us know that Hancock Prospecting, GKI Investments PTY LTD, had a good look around at the potential development and based on the outcome, have decided that unfortunately it cannot proceed with the project,"" he said. ""We don't know why, what the reasons are, but obviously there's genuine reasons there for it to happen."" Hancock Prospecting released a public statement confirming GKI Investments Pty Ltd will not proceed with the project. ""A significant amount of work has now been completed as part of an extensive review process for the project, which was enhanced by the positive engagement with Tower Holdings, relevant stakeholders and government departments at all levels,"" the statement said. ""However, based on the outcome of that process, GKI Investments Pty Ltd has decided that unfortunately, it cannot proceed with the project."" The company wished the leaseholders luck in progressing future developments and thanked Tower Holdings for its cooperation. In a statement, the Department of State Development confirmed the lease negotiations with Hancock Prospecting's GKI Investments were not proceeding. The government said it was committed to ensuring the most viable future for the island and would continue looking for investment partners. It said the department had started master planning of Great Keppel Island to identify the community vision for the island. ""A whole-of-government working group was also established to assist with addressing some of the approval and development challenges faced by investment partners,"" the department said. ""While the lease negotiations involving GKI Investments are not proceeding, the Queensland government will continue to look for investment partners to guarantee a bright future for GKI."" Hancock Prospecting said last year the development would entail ""world-class, year-round beach club, sandy bars and shopping"". ""There has been a bit of silence for a little while,"" Uncle Bob said. ""When [the letter] did come it was a bit of a surprise."" The Woppaburra elder said the news was also a relief. ""It's a bit sad,"" he said. ""But the business of having to deal with a large company like that, even if it did go ahead, it's something where Woppaburra still have to try and negotiate and probably fight for anything and everything to try and get an input or say in what's happening on our country."" The once-iconic resort has since had several false starts from companies trying to bring it back to life since its closure. A master plan, proposed by Tower Holdings, was approved in 2012 spruiking a major development featuring a casino, marina, accommodation, shops and a golf course. The plan never eventuated after concerns from the state government over casino licences and lapsed deadlines. Part of the old resort was then demolished in 2018, before more companies tried unsuccessfully to purchase the lease. Uncle Bob said development on the island was ""a two-edged sword"". ""Some Woppaburra would like to see it left as it is, but myself personally, I'd like to see us try and take advantage of all the opportunities that are there with things like the tourism, education,"" he said. The Woppaburra people were formally recognised as native title holders of the renowned holiday isle in December . Each time a development application popped up, Uncle Bob said it was an opportunity to highlight Indigenous culture and tourism. ""It's just another example of how some of these things, when they're proposed, can be very misleading,"" he said. ""[It] really builds up community's hopes and does it in a way which divides communities as well."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. He said each failed development application left the Woppaburra people, Central Queensland locals and businesses exhausted. ""It's something can be very disheartening and deflating when these things keep happening,"" he said. ""There's a lot of good people out there with a lot of goodwill and some of the processes used for us to be involved with this, it just seems to divide communities before it even starts. ""That's one of the reasons I'm happy that it hasn't gone ahead.""

58,"'Unprecedented' demand for passports causes excessive wait, soaring complaints from travellers",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  When Paris Smith paid for a passport renewal in March for her first overseas trip, she hadn't expected to be waiting for it 10 weeks later. ""I've never been out of Australia, so this is really nerve-racking for me because I've already booked all my tickets,"" she said. The 20-year-old from Noosa on Queensland's Sunshine Coast plans to fly to Europe in July on a business trip for her swimwear brand. In the past month, she has called the Australian Passport Office (APO) more than 10 times. ""Sometimes, I'll be waiting for an hour and a half and then I'll just get sent to an automated message and then it will cancel the call on me, so I haven't even been able to speak to any [one] at all,"" she said. Ms Smith said the uncertainty and risk of losing $3,500 in flights and accommodation was stressful. ""You literally don't know. You have no idea when it's coming. You have no idea if something's missing, or if they can't reach you,"" she said. ""The [APO] is not telling people the truth. They're not saying it's taking three months for you to get your passport [because] I would have paid the extra money to get my passport fast-tracked if that was the actual case."" The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the ABC there was ""unprecedented"" demand for its passport services. The Australian Passport Office has a four-week backlog in its processing queue. Customers were advised to allow six weeks to renew their passport but new applications and those for children could take longer. This financial year, more than 1.1 million passports have been issued, with 800,000 of those since November 1, 2021 when Australia's international borders re-opened. Mum-of-two Nadia Keisho lives in Mackay in regional Queensland and is facing a 2,000 kilometre round trip to collect passports from the Brisbane passport office. After the sudden death of her husband in March, she booked flights to Europe in early June for a trip with her two young children. ""It's sort of a healing journey after such a horrific thing that happened and also to make new memories with my children,"" she said. Ms Keisho applied for her passport in March, baby Luana's in April and seven-year-old Seidia's as a $380 priority application earlier this month. Priority applications typically take two days to process, but in Ms Keisho's case it took two weeks for the passport to be dispatched, and she was told the other applications had been ""escalated"". While she maintains hope that the two outstanding passports will be ready in time, the mum-of-two is preparing to fly to Brisbane to collect the passports in person. ""It was a long, stressful, incredibly difficult process and it took a superhuman effort to finally get some clarity on it all,"" she said. ""There's that lack of compassion because they're not even answering their phones for me to be able to say, 'This is why I'm desperate', it's not because I want to go sunbathe [overseas]. ""I'd love to go sunbathe with my husband [but] he's not here anymore."" New mum Rebecca Smith turned up unannounced at Sydney's passport office when her passport hadn't arrived four days before she was due to travel. Ms Smith from Albion Park, south of Wollongong, said the line was ""50-metres-long out the door"". ""I just basically said, 'I'm travelling on Sunday. I need my passport, I'm not leaving until I get it',"" she said. She collected it a few hours later. Like many Australians, Ms Smith and husband Grant let their passports expire during the pandemic. They submitted applications for themselves and baby Carter in March, ahead of a family trip to Fiji in May, but her passport never arrived. ""They [the APO] just need to communicate better ... put it on the website, update the messages on the phones. They all still say six-weeks [wait]. ""When you are aware that there's a backlog, communicate it to people."" After losing family members overseas during the pandemic, Mojtaba ""Moey"" Mohammadi from Slacks Creek south of Brisbane, is desperately awaiting his passport so he and his wife can reunite with family. But after waiting almost 10 weeks and trying to get through on the phone, he has lodged a complaint. ""When I lodged it [application] originally it said six to eight weeks because of the busy times and I can understand that but going to 10 weeks, that's excessive."" Lauren and Luke Thompson from Sydney submitted passport renewal applications for themselves and their two children two months ago but so far, only one child's passport has arrived. They are due to depart Australia in less than three weeks for a family gathering in Bali. ""I could miss out on that family holiday just because my passport's delayed and I did give ample enough time to receive [it],"" Ms Thompson said. She said staff indicated they would escalate her case, but ""I still haven't heard anything. It doesn't give me much confidence"". The worry has added to the family's stress of travelling during a pandemic. ""You've got to do all these pre-departure things these days and you need all your passport numbers and … you need your vaccination certificate, but to do all that you need your passport number, and we don't have that so yeah, it's getting a bit stressful,"" Ms Thompson said. So far this financial year, the Commonwealth Ombudsman has received 193 complaints about the APO's passport processing times and communication. In comparison, for the same period — July 1 to May 24 — one complaint was received in 2020–21, seven in 2019–20 and seven in 2018–2019.

59,"Physicist walks his toy fox-on-a-skateboard, Jeremy, from Broken Hill to Adelaide to educate students about quantum mechanics",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Physicist Dr Peter Hill walks from Broken Hill to Adelaide to educate students about quantum mechanics A quantum physicist sets off on a journey, armed with a skateboard and a small toy fox. It sounds like the set-up for a Carl Barron joke. Instead, it is the story of Dr Peter Hill, who is trying to raise awareness for his field of expertise and change how it is taught in schools. The retired scientist decided to walk the 500-kilometre journey to raise money for the Royal Society of South Australia. He hoped more school students would be provided with an updated curriculum when it came to quantum physics. ""Essentially, it's not being taught at all,"" Dr Hill said. ""The stuff that's being taught at school is the stuff that was being taught in 1917."" Dr Hill said it was a personal passion to help educate more kids in quantum physics, because he believed it would help them better understand other areas of society. ""Quantum physics describes a lot of useful things like how computers work or how solar cells operate … and you'd get really lost if you didn't have quantum physics,"" he said. Dr Hill is not making the journey on his own, with his faithful sidekick Jeremy Bronfox riding on top of his skateboard. ""A friend Bronwyn, who's a crochet ninja, or mastermind, or whatever they're called, created it,"" he said. ""He's got a crocheted fox girlfriend in Adelaide who he'll see, called Baroness Lynette Von Foxhoven."" Dr Hill hoped the weather would be fine during his journey because he had not brought a tent with him when he slept rough. ""I have a Kmart sleeping bag. I also have a tarp if it rains, but I hope it doesn't,"" he said. Dr Hill trained for his journey by walking 200 kilometres from Broken Hill to Wilcannia, as well as shorter treks north-west to Silverton. He planned to do the majority of his walk at night, for safety reasons. ""I'm planning to walk six hours then have two hours' rest, and repeat if I can,"" Dr Hill said. ""I'm having to walk a lot at night so you can see the trucks in the distance."" Dr Hill's walk coincides with a significant milestone in quantum physics — the discovery of quantum particles. ""It just happens to be the 100th anniversary of the, 'No going back' experiment that was done in Germany in 1922,"" he said. Dr Hill's journey began in Broken Hill on Wednesday night, and he arrived in Cockburn on the SA-NSW border on Thursday. Next he will travel to Olary, then onto Manna Hill, Yunta, Oodla Wirra, Terrowie, Hallett, Burra, Saddleworth and eventually Adelaide.

60,The story behind some of the most historic pubs in Queensland,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Why some of Queensland's most historic pubs need your help The Australian pub is one of our most enduring and prominent cultural symbols. But the local country pub has always been much more than a place to wet your whistle – serving as the vital centre of social life for people living hundreds of kilometres away from the nearest major city. Tanya Luckins, a historian at La Trobe University and co-author of the book The Australian Pub, said small towns on the frontier in early settlement times often had a pub before anything else. ""The country pub also doubled as the post office, the bank, as the Cobb & Co station, and sometimes the morgue,"" Dr Luckins said. ""Most people didn't have access to cheap or reliable refrigeration until the 1950s. ""The pub became an important place to go, have a cold drink and catch up on all the local news."" There are 1,251 licensed pubs in Queensland, with the Nindigully Pub and the Farmers Arms at Cabarlah, both in southern Queensland, claiming to be the state's oldest. Queensland's historic pubs have stood the test of time, but like other tourist venues, they have had the challenges of lockdowns, natural disasters, and a lack of international visitors. Pubs sold 40 million fewer pints of beer between July and September 2021 than they did during the same period in 2019, Australian Taxation Office figures show. So, as we enjoy unrestricted travel again, regional communities hope tourists will stop in for a pint, experience their charm and hear tales from the past. Queensland's oldest pub remains a hotly contested debate, but the Nindigully Pub lays claim to the title. ""Nindigilly Pub is Queensland's oldest hotel located in its original condition and position,"" said owner Steven Burns, who bought the pub in 2002. On the banks of the Moonie River near St George in the Balonne Shire, The Gully was granted a liquor licence in 1864. It originally operated as shearers' accommodation for Nindigully Station and from the late 1800s served as a Cobb and Co station. Despite the town's population of nine, the pub attracts a steady flow of tourists ordering what it claims are the biggest burgers in Australia. The Farmers Arms Tavern at Cabarlah, north of Toowoomba, prides itself on being the longest continually licensed pub in Queensland. Licensed in 1863, over the years the pub has been a house, a store, and even part of the local jail. Local historian Linda Galligan said there was ambiguity about when the pub originally opened and then re-opened. ""We have no evidence of this licence or first owner, as it is really difficult to get details of the licences at that time,"" she said. ""In 1902, the old Farmers Arms hotel [at the top of the hill] burned down and a new Farmers Arms was licensed in 1904 for the building in the present location. ""There were at least 14 pubs in the area at one stage and there is some confusion about which pubs held which licence as lots of licences were bought and sold, but not the buildings."" There are not many places you can park your plane out front and wander in for a schooner. William Blair built the Birdsville Hotel on the edge of the Simpson Desert in 1884 and it is arguably Queensland's most famous outback pub. It's endured a lot in its time: fire, drought, floods, even a cyclone in 2020. These days, Birdsville has a semi-permanent population of just over 100, but each year the town swells as people flock to the Birdsville Races and the Big Red Bash. ""The Birdsville Hotel is in the middle of nowhere,"" Dr Luckins said. ""But it gets thousands of visitors each year because it is such an iconic and important local pub."" If you ever make it to the pub, you'll find hundreds of hats nailed to the pub's ceiling. ""It's invite-only. It's a sign of respect for people who have given back to the Birdsville community,"" hotel general manager Ben Fullagar said. In a town with a population of zero, re-opening the Betoota Hotel was a brave move. The hotel between Birdsville and Windorah sat empty for more than 23 years until Robert ""Robbo"" Haken from Brisbane bought it in 2017 after stumbling across the derelict watering hole on a road trip. ""We had to completely gut the place,"" Robbo remembered. ""The dining room was covered in so much dirt, we thought it was a dirt floor. We didn't realise it was a timber floor."" Robbo finally opened the doors in early 2020, but then COVID-19 hit and he soon had to close. The pub is now open full time. The Lion's Den Hotel opened in Cape York in the 1880s and was named after a nearby tin mine. The Den, as it's known to locals, is 30 kilometres south of Cooktown on the unsealed Bloomfield Track and proudly advertises that it ""has no mobile or internet reception"". ""I love that it's not in a town — the people that come here are genuine people that like to learn a little bit about the history and spend a few days,"" owner Judy Fry said. ""The building is still original, the floors are still original, and the place still tells a story."" Originally established in 1889, the Kynuna Hotel between Cloncurry and Winton in north-west Queensland was renamed the Blue Heeler Hotel in 1963. It's a pub steeped in Australian folklore. ""Banjo Paterson performed Waltzing Matilda for the first time in the pub,"" local historian Kenny Jackson said. ""It's also claimed the squatter and the swagman drank their last drinks at the bar."" There's also a brick fireplace built by RM Williams and graffiti is encouraged at the Blue Heeler — you can sign your name on the walls by donating to the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The Federal Hotel was built in McKinlay in outback Queensland in 1900. After Crocodile Dundee was filmed nearby, the owners changed it to Walkabout Creek Hotel to cash in on the 1980s movie blockbuster. Frank and Debbie Wurst bought the hotel in 2014. ""The pub was too small to film inside. They built a set around the corner and called it the Walkabout Creek Hotel,"" Debbie said. ""You can still see the bar from the movie set in the back shed.""

62,Sydney set to sparkle as Vivid festival returns for first time since 2019,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Vivid Sydney returns after two-year break due to COVID-19 pandemic Vivid Sydney organisers are hoping one small change will put a stop to the problematic overcrowding seen in previous years as the popular lights festival returns for the first time since 2019. Tonight the 23-day festival of light, music and ideas kicks off after its two-year COVID-19 hiatus and the NSW government is hoping it brings millions of people back into the still struggling CBD. In 2019, Vivid broke all records for attendance and international visitation, with 2.4 million guests enjoying the wide-ranging winter festival that injected around $170 million into the state's economy. However, its popularity has also been its downfall and overcrowding has become synonymous with Vivid. At their worst, crowd bottlenecks have led to concerns about public safety and, at their best, they have discouraged people from returning. Although attendance numbers are expected to be lower than pre-COVID years, Tourism Minister Stuart Ayres has urged people to try to come midweek to avoid the busy weekends. ""The weekends are going to be huge, the long weekend will be massive,"" he said. ""I think we still see very big numbers, so it's very important people plan their trip … come in on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday if you want slightly smaller crowds. ""I'm quietly confident Sydneysiders and people right around the country really want to get out and about and see Vivid."" In 2018, then-opposition tourism spokeswoman Penny Sharpe criticised the festival's management of crowds and said too many people felt unsafe around the harbour foreshore, particularly those with children. ""It's an incredible event for Sydney … but public safety issues are being raised more often,"" Ms Sharpe said. ""If people are feeling unsafe, that's the last thing you want at such an important festival."" Ms Sharpe said the solution could be to spread the event further up and down the harbour. And this year, that's exactly what Vivid has done. The renowned light walk, which is the festival's mainstay, will this year be the longest it has ever been, stretching 8 kilometres from the Sydney Opera House to Central Station. The re-design is intended to give visitors ""more room than ever before"" to explore the light installations and keep foot traffic flowing. ""Vivid Sydney has localised crowd management teams, marshals, volunteers and security who all assist visitors keep the pedestrian flow moving and manage crowds along the light walk,""  a Destination NSW spokesperson told the ABC. Festival organisers have also been emphasising that less is more and that attendees shouldn't try to see everything in one night. ""Choose two or three locations to explore, at a relaxed pace, and come back for the rest another night or nights."" However, major strain is still expected on the Harbour City's public transport system, which during previous years has had to skip stops in the city due to crowding. Transport for NSW chief operations officer Howard Collins said this year he expected queues for public transport to be similar to the fare-free period over the recent Easter holiday. ""We encourage everyone to plan their Vivid Sydney experience across several nights because there [is] a plethora of light installations and projections to see across the city, and you won't get to see it all in one night,"" Mr Collins said. Roads around The Rocks and Circular Quay will close each night from 5pm, with more extensive closures in the Sydney CBD and around Darling Harbour on Friday nights and weekends. In addition to the light walk, the Vivid program includes a variety of concerts, speaking events and the largest drone display in the Southern Hemisphere. A NSW Police spokesperson urged visitors to plan ahead ""A lot of planning has taken place behind the scenes to make sure everyone stays safe — whether they're looking at the displays or simply visiting the Sydney CBD and surrounding event precincts,"" the spokesperson said. ""Due to large crowds expected in Sydney CBD, people should plan ahead and be mindful of their own safety and the safety of those around them. ""Crowd barriers will be in place in areas where large crowds are expected, to provide safe viewing spaces and allow for pedestrian movement.""

64,'Super-luxe' international tourists put regional NSW on map,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Regional NSW is welcoming back international tourists for the first time in two years as businesses strive to attract wealthier, ""super-luxe"" tourists to help them recover from COVID losses. ""Famils"" — where luxury international travel agents experience destinations to sell to their wealthy clients overseas — are under way across parts of the Southern Highlands and Shoalhaven for the first time since the pandemic began in 2020. The clients all have budgets between $10,000 and $20,000 dollars per week. Bangalay Luxury Villas owner Michelle Bishop said her Shoalhaven Heads business struggled during the pandemic. Ms Bishop said her customer base was dwindling, despite an influx of domestic tourists when COVID-19 restrictions loosened. She said she has spent much of the pandemic working on new, luxury experiences for her clients and hoped it would pay off. ""We've had the pent-up demand with domestic visitors but now people can travel overseas and interstate again, we need to backfill that vacancy with the international market,"" she said. She said she was looking at a market that was at a ""very different level"" to the ""mass"" market. ""They're looking for nature-based or cultural-based tourism experiences,"" she said. Experience Nature founder Amanda Fry, who hosted a famil in the Southern Highlands, said the premium and luxury markets were looking for a new playground. ""I think travel has changed forever,"" Ms Fry said. ""People are choosing one holiday a year and they want a lifetime memory to walk away with."" Tourism Australia and Destination NSW are working with operators in destinations such as the Shoalhaven and Southern Highlands to entice more wealthy travellers to spend their money in the regions. Australia's biggest travel conference, the Australian Tourism Exchange (ATE22), hosted international travel agents — including ""super-luxe"" agents — this month for the first time in two years. Tourism Australia managing director Phillipa Harrison hoped it would help the sector recover. ""Despite the challenges of the last two years, there has never been a better time to visit Australia and there are plenty of new and exciting experiences and products to showcase,"" she said. She said relationships built at the conference would help to spearhead the tourism industry's recovery. But Ms Fry said there would likely be a delay between the conference and ""famils"", and travellers arriving in the regions. ""I don't think we'll see the flow-on effects until spring just because of the way people are booking,"" she said. ""They are planning a long way out. ""Singaporeans are ready to travel now, but [with] the European and American markets [there] will be about a 12-month delay before we see them starting to come back."" About 550 international travel agents attended the conference this month from 20 countries, including 72 luxury agents.

65,Highway strawberry oasis hits market for the first time in 50 years,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Super Strawberry on New England Highway at Glen Innes for sale Many regional towns have a ""big"" something, whether it is a prawn, pineapple, fish or even a coffee cup. But Glen Innes has something ""super"" and it is set to change hands for the first time in decades. The Super Strawberry has a proud 50-year history in the northern New South Wales town. Owner Cecily Woodlands grew up with the business her family started and has become a skilled jam and strawberry milkshake maker — an iconic item on the cafe's menu. ""The strawberry milkshakes, they have been going a long while now,"" Ms Woodlands said ""They are pretty famous."" Ms Woodlands said she was nearing retirement and wanted to be closer to her son and grandchild because it was ""time to move on"". ""Obviously I am getting a little bit older and [it is] just time to make plans for the future,"" she said. The traveller's oasis has developed its homegrown offerings over the years. ""It was just strawberries to start with and then we started making some jams and doing some strawberries and cream and that kind of thing and we did a lot more wholesale but then the rail closed,"" Ms Woodlands said. The business recently celebrated its 50th anniversary at a party with the town. ""That was a really great night and I think that we had about 250 to 300 people here and just the whole community,"" she said. Ms Woodlands said growing strawberries was hard work. ""It's like when you are growing anything, there are always problems with it,"" she said. ""This year it's been a little bit too wet. A few years ago it was a little bit too dry, but you just sort of take it on the chin and move forward."" Ms Woodlands said she never grew tired of the sweet taste of a strawberry. ""If you can sneak out in the sunshine and grab one straight off the bush — they do tend to disappear,"" she said. Ms Woodlands said the community had kept her business alive during the pandemic. ""It's really well supported locally,"" she said. ""We would not have made it through COVID without the local population just popping out here getting their coffees, getting their lunches,"" she said. Asked whether she would keep up the craft of making jams and milkshakes, Ms Woodlands said she would happily leave it up to the new owners to do it for her. ""Business comes with all the recipes,"" she said. ""[I'm] probably quite happy to buy a jar myself."" She said her family hoped to sell the business in the next few years.

66,Thor has visited 196 countries without flying and he's just embarked on the final leg of his eight-year trip,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Torbjørn ""Thor"" Pedersen never expected his ambitious round-the-world trip would take him the better part of a decade when he left his native Denmark. The 43-year-old traveller has his sights set on becoming the first person to visit every country on the globe in an unbroken journey without air travel. ""I've now come to 196 countries without flying and I haven't been home,"" he said. ""I've spent eight and a half years of my life doing this and I'm kind of close to the end of it."" Mr Pedersen arrived in North Queensland on a cargo ship from Hong Kong last month after being stranded for two years during the COVID-19 pandemic. He is about to set sail to New Zealand in the final stretch of a complicated, exhausting and life-changing journey. Mr Pedersen has travelled via bus from Townsville to Brisbane, then onto Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Tasmania in the past seven weeks. ""When people ask me could I see myself living anywhere else, from all the countries I've visited, Australia is one of those countries,"" he said. The Danish Red Cross ambassador has amassed a significant international audience who eagerly follow his travels online. ""So many people have been reaching out, offering me a beer or a place to stay or to guide me around – people have been super welcoming,"" he said. ""There was a family who had hosted me in PNG and now live in Brisbane, so they took me in and I stayed with them."" He said he felt the weight of his age in Sydney when he then checked into a hostel for the first time in two years. ""I'm probably getting too old to check into hostels,"" he said. Mr Pedersen was visited by his father from Denmark for the first time in four and a half years while he was in Sydney. He was also reunited with his wife, who he had only been able to see sporadically since 2013. A trip to the Blue Mountains was among their highlights. ""I've seen lots of mountains and great landscapes and I'd say that that ranks up pretty high,"" he said. ""Some of the views you get up in the Blue Mountains are truly astonishing."" After several weeks of negotiations with shipping companies and immigration authorities, Mr Pedersen will spend the coming week or so travelling via cargo ship from Melbourne to New Zealand. He then plans to visit Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu and Tuvalu. ""And then from there, I need to go all the way across to the Indian Ocean, which is far away, especially when you're not flying, and then visit Sri Lanka, and then the Maldives,"" he said. He expected the remainder of the journey would take at least another year. Mr Pedersen said much of the trip had not been smooth sailing. ""I've definitely considered giving up and I came very, very close to giving up back in 2015,"" he said. ""I was in a bad situation, and I saw a taxi off the road, and I just envisaged that taxi bringing me to the airport and leaving everything behind."" He said the project was now ""10-per-cent per cent adventure, 90-per-cent work"", with many hours spent behind the scenes on logistics getting from one place to another. ""There are a great deal of countries that just make it mind-bogglingly difficult, and you have to jump through so many hoops to get the paperwork in order and the signatures and the stamps and all sorts of permissions,"" he said. ""All of this was supposed to take less than four years and we're eight-and-a-half years in now, so it weighs heavily on my mind."" But Mr Pedersen said he had taken solace in the ""extraordinary resilience"" of the people he had met around the world. ""It's wonderful to see that human spirit – we always seem to bounce back,"" he said. ""Even in the hardest corners of this planet, people seem to fall in love and get married."" Mr Pedersen said he hoped to start a family and write a book about his adventures when he finally arrived back home in Denmark.

67,"Broome's 'staircase to the moon' a unique combination of tides, location and cosmic angles",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Broome's 'staircase to the moon' effect a unique combination of tides, location and cosmic angles Broome's staircase to the moon phenomenon draws thousands of people from around the world to Roebuck Bay annually, but the science behind the spectacle is just as fascinating. The effect creates what appears to be a glowing staircase over the mudflats leading to a full moon, a combination of location and conditions unique to Western Australia's north. ""During dry season, three times a month, there's an alignment between the Earth, the sun and the moon which creates big tides, or spring tides,"" Broome astronomer Greg Quicke said. ""That means we've got high tide at lunch time and low tide in the evening [so] all the mudflats are wet. ""The ripples in the mud have water in them, and they create a direct reflection of the moon as it appears over the horizon."" This is what gives the reflection its ""staircase"" appearance. Mr Quicke said the location of Roebuck Bay made the occurrence possible. ""Broome is blessed to sit on a peninsula that's 10 kilometres long and 4km wide,"" he said. ""Roebuck Bay faces the east, and that's where the Earth turns to the part of the sky that the moon is in, at a particular time. ""Tonight, it's 6:27pm, or something."" ""Every one of them is different; you never know what you're going to get."" Long-time Broome tourism operator Robyn Maher said people came to Broome to coincide with the natural phenomenon, from March through to October. ""If you're in Broome for the three dates, make sure you see the staircase each evening,"" he said. ""There might be a bit of cloud this evening, but the next two nights the colours might be different. ""If there's a bushfire, the moon might be bright red."" But there is more to Broome's sky show than its staircase to the moon. Yawuru singer-songwriter Steve Pigram said the constellations of Orion and Scorpio signified the changing of the seasons. ""The constellations signify the coming of winter, of Barrgana season, and that's also when the south-east starts to blow,"" he said. ""It signifies the coming of the blue nose salmon. ""They start to run and all the locals go out and catch them in the bay."" Mr Pigram said the staircase to the moon did not hold much significance when he was a child. ""It wasn't made a tourist attraction 'til the 70's or maybe 80's,"" he said. ""Sometimes, when you're in your hometown, you don't really know what you've got 'til someone else says, 'Hey, that's pretty good mate'.""

68,'Mississippi is a long way from the beach': Tourists flock to the Gold Coast for annual blues festival,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Blues on Broadbeach music festival begins on Gold Coast, with hopes high for tourism industry The blues have returned to Broadbeach and the Gold Coast's annual festival is all grown up. Blues on Broadbeach kicks off in the centre of the tourist capital today and is celebrating its 21st birthday. The festival's return, expected to be a huge boost for the local tourism industry, comes just days after it was announced 2,000 delegates from across the world will converge on the Gold Coast next year for the largest international travel show in the southern hemisphere. The Australian Tourism Exchange will host industry and airline executives, agents, and 90 global media outlets over five days from late April, 2023. Blues on Broadbeach director Mark Duckworth said when festival began in 2002 it was a ""small blues event in the middle of Broadbeach mall"". From a one-day event 21 years ago that attracted 3,000 people, Mr Duckworth said Blues on Broadbeach had grown to bring tourists to the Gold Coast from right around the country. ""And 21 years later, we have over 15 stages and we'll see around 170,000 people come to the event [in 2022],"" he said. ""I guess over time, venues and the community in general have just got on board and supported it, so we're very lucky that each year we have got to add new elements because people want to be a part of the event."" Mr Duckworth said because the event was free, festival-goers injected millions into the Gold Coast economy by staying and dining in the city. ""Locals can come down and see music for free, which is excellent,"" he said. ""People from outer regions get to travel in, they can book a room, they can eat at all the restaurants ... and they invest in the area without having buy a ticket."" The festival is expected to bring millions of dollars into the Gold Coast economy and 50 per cent of the acts are from southeast Queensland. Australian blues legend Dom Turner will play this year's festival with Mississippi blues artists R.L. Boyce. ""Mississippi is a long way from the beach so I can't wait to get R.L. down to the beach and see what inspiration he can gather,"" he said. Mr Turner said the festival had ""evolved over the years"" but was still a ""community festival"". ""There has always been a connection to the beach, I mean, rock, surf rock, comes from blues music. So there is some kind of strange connection musically with the beach and blues,"" he said. ""It's a backdrop, it just sort of gives a certain feeling throughout the festival and it just kind of makes people feel good and there are people pouring into the town and that's really great to see things are coming back."" Currumbin musician Karl S Williams said the joy of being able to play to a live audience after many shows were cancelled during the pandemic was ""hard to explain"". ""It feels like I'm a human again, it's something that's quite profound, actually,"" he said. Sunshine Coast artist Minnie Marks said she always enjoyed playing to audiences at the event. ""Honestly, it's such a killer festival and the lineup is insane,"" she said. ""The fact that it's a free event that families can come to, I just think that it's totally set out amazingly. ""If you're thinking about coming out, definitely make the effort to come out cause you'll have fun."" Blues on Broadbeach will run until May 22 and the lineup includes The James Morrison Motown Experience, Mia Dyson and Karise Eden and Hussy Hicks.

69,'He organised his passport and was going overseas': Why this mum is sending rocks across the globe to honour lost son,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Heartbroken Launceston mum keeps son's legacy alive through memorial rocks Molly Graham wishes her son could have travelled the world. Her son Alex McNulty was 24 years old when he died, only a short time before he was due to board a plane to Thailand. McNulty was the bassist for Launceston post-hardcore band Save the Clock Tower up until his death in 2015. ""He always wanted to travel, but time gets away,"" Molly told the ABC. ""He found himself at 24 having never been out of Australia. ""So, he organised his passport and was going overseas. Sadly, he never made it,"" she said. So began the journey to fulfil Alex's travel dreams, by sending out remembrance stones across the globe with friends or families so that the memory of Alex could travel the world one stone at a time. ""I was just so sad and heartbroken without him,"" Molly said. ""I wondered how I would survive living all of those years without him. ""I wondered how we can focus on the good things."" Molly and her grandson started collecting stones and writing Alex's name, birth date with the year he died on them. She took to social media and posted a picture of the stones alongside Alex's story. People began contacting Molly to help bring her vision to life. ""There's been so many offers,"" Molly said. ""One lady in Devonport is taking a stone to Cairns. Other people are going to Egypt, Asia, Thailand, Bali and across Australia with the rocks."" Molly also runs a Facebook page she posts to regularly. She says it is an outlet for the good days and bad. She shares stories of her son and invites friends and family to post their memories of him. ""I started the page because I was just so sad and heartbroken without him,"" Molly said. ""[Posting] makes me feel like I'm talking to him."" In one of her posts, she writes, ""Although I miss you immeasurably Al, I am never really lonely without you. I feel your presence constantly and I'm so grateful to you. Thank you darling for those 24 years."" Fans of the band contacted Molly following her son's death, expressing their sadness at the loss. ""They always had nice things to say. They told me they were heartbroken and told me what a lovely guy [Alex] was.""

70,Model describes 'dehumanising' airport treatment after coming off wheelchair,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Airports and airlines on notice after people with disability speak out about humiliating treatment More people with disability have come forward, describing ""dehumanising"" treatment at airports across the country, after Australia's former disability discrimination commissioner spoke out about his recent experience at Adelaide Airport. Graeme Innes said he was refused access to use the body scanner and was asked to use a walk-through X-ray scanner at the airport on Friday. He said a security guard then decided he needed a pat-down, despite him not triggering the security alarm, which had instead been set off by his dog's metal harness. Further accounts have since emerged from airport passengers with disability who say they have been subjected to rough handling, including model and disability access consultant Akii Ngo. Akii was on a high, returning home via Adelaide from Australian Fashion Week in Sydney, where they participated as a model in the ""Fix The System Not Me"" adaptive clothing collective show. But Akii said that when they were being transported in the airline's wheelchair through Adelaide Airport, Jetstar staff seemed to lack experience when handling people who required mobility support. ""We were on the flight bridge, there's a lot of bumps — essentially they pushed me too hard, I fell right out of the chair,"" Akii said. ""The first thing the staff member said was: 'You should have held on tighter.' ""I couldn't get up — it was dehumanising."" In an Instagram post, Akii said the experience was ""horrible"" and ""terrible"". A Jetstar spokesperson said staff were ""well trained to provide assistance to customers requiring wheelchairs"", and said the airline had since reached out to Akii. ""A number of team members attended to assist the customer on the aerobridge, and assisted them through the airport to the baggage carousel,"" the spokesperson said. ""We've also reached out to the customer several times yesterday and today to better understand their experience and are waiting to hear back. ""We continue to investigate what happened in this instance."" Former FIFO worker Viv Bachelier — who worked as a psychologist for the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) — said she had had dozens of humiliating experiences while transiting through Adelaide Airport security with her guide dog. On one occasion, she said, a security staff member told her she was going through the wrong security lane. ""I said, 'I'm sorry, I'm standing here with my guide dog. I can't see what lane I'm supposed to go down',"" Ms Bachelier recalled. ""He said, 'How am I supposed to know you're with a guide dog? You're not wearing a vision impaired badge – you should be wearing one of those badges.' ""I said: 'Excuse me? That's not my responsibility to tell you I have a disability'."" Ms Bachelier, from Canberra, said she had so many belittling experiences at the airport that she started asking airline staff to assist her through security. ""[The security staff] would use really generic terms — 'just come over here, put that there',"" Ms Bachelier said. ""When you're vision impaired you don't have those concepts — you can't see."" An Adelaide Airport spokesperson said it had not received any notification about the incidents, but would ""welcome"" a chance to discuss possible improvements. ""We weren't aware of the concerns raised by the customer,"" the spokesperson said. ""We would welcome an opportunity to speak with her so we can help make her journey through Adelaide Airport more smooth in the future and we can further improve how our teams support customers with a disability."" Perth woman Filipa Scott said she had made recent complaints to Perth Airport about security's treatment of her 17-year-old daughter, who has autism and PTSD. Her daughter, Myles, uses an assistance dog, and Ms Scott said she was not allowed to use the body scanner and was asked to go through a side gate and have a physical pat-down. ""It's a huge issue for a someone with enormous sensory issues,"" Ms Scott said. ""We offered for her to go through the main scanner with myself in charge of the dog, then let the dog go through and be scanned and [be] patted down, then for myself to go through. ""They refused, stating they could not separate daughter and dog — even if this process was traumatising for her."" Ms Scott said a few months later her daughter tried to pass the same security again, and had to convince staff to use an alternative security check — using the email received from Perth Airport apologising for the first incident. ""No-one should have to go to that level — I think the workers need to hear from people with actual experience [of disability],"" she said. A Perth Airport spokesperson said all security staff undertook additional training on screening passengers with assistance animals and alternative screening methods after Myles's experience. ""Although the screening procedure was carried out correctly and professionally, the use of a handheld metal detector may have been the most suitable method of security screening in this instance,"" the spokesperson said. ""A detailed response and apology was provided to the passengers following this investigation.""

71,Short-stay properties and sea changers have left Adriana's hometown with a 'non-existent' rental market ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  After 10 years of Airbnb and short-stay rentals, is Australia ready for regulation? For six months after breaking up with her partner, aged care worker Adriana Breen searched for a rental home on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula. ""The rental market was just non-existent,"" she said. ""The rents were unaffordable as well. You're looking at $400-plus where they used to be $280."" Ms Breen still works on the peninsula, but she no longer lives there. Instead, she has to drive the 80-kilometre round trip from Frankston, in Melbourne's south-east, every day. ""Mentally it affects me because this was my happy place — I love the peninsula,"" she said. ""I know it's only half an hour down the road, but it could be on the other side of the Earth as far as I'm concerned because I'm not near my family."" Ten years ago the Mornington Peninsula had a ""healthy"" rental vacancy rate of 3 per cent, but it's now at 0.7 per cent. Experts — using figures from independent advocacy and data group InsideAirbnb — say for every vacant rental, there are about 30 short-stay rentals available on Airbnb. ""Non-metropolitan Australia has … always had tight rental markets,"" urban planner and policy analyst Nicole Gurran said. ""Even a small increase — and we've seen a significant increase — in demand for housing associated with the short-term tourism market is going to exacerbate those tight rental vacancy rates."" But coastal communities are facing more than an increase in short-term accommodation. During the pandemic, people have fled the cities and moved to regional areas. ""With the increase in demand from people moving to coastal locations … combined with the increase in tourism demand, that's created a perfect storm in which rental vacancy rates are pitifully low,"" Professor Gurran said. There are about 100,000 Airbnbs properties across Australia, according to figures from data group AirDNA. About 85 per cent of those are entire homes. And while short-term stays have always been popular in coastal areas and tourism hotspots, when it launched in Australia 10 years ago, Airbnb brought holiday homes to capital cities. ""In Australia we haven't had a tradition of having holiday homes in our major cities,"" Professor Gurran said. ""So when we see the cluster of short-term rentals around [our big cities] it's safe to assume that those are residential homes and apartments that have been withdrawn from the permanent rental market."" The sharing platform says it has boosted local economies by attracting tourists and creating jobs. An Oxford Economics report found Airbnb contributed more than $10 billion to Australia's economy in 2019. But a 2019 report by America's Economic Policy Institute found that Airbnb's economic benefits were outweighed by the cost to renters. Then in 2020, global tourism ground to a halt. ""COVID really showed there's a connection between the short-term rental market and rents all across Australia, and indeed across the world,"" housing researcher Peter Phibbs said. In the Tasmanian capital of Hobart, residents have been in the midst of a housing crisis that predates COVID-19. Professor Phibbs said the number of Airbnbs in the city equated to about 9 per cent of the total rental market. That is much higher than in any other capital city in Australia. And Hobart's rental vacancy rate is just 0.3 per cent — the lowest for any capital city. During the pandemic, the balance has shifted. ""When housing stock went from short-term rental back to the long-term rental market, in places like Hobart we saw a sharp reduction in rents,"" he said. Professor Phibbs estimated that during COVID, rents in Hobart dropped by about 9 per cent. Another study in Sydney by William Thackway and Christopher Pettit found rent prices in the most active Airbnb neighbourhoods dropped by up to 7 per cent. While not all of this can be attributed to Airbnb, Professor Phibbs said the evidence was clear: You cannot have an unregulated short-term accommodation industry and a healthy long-term rental market. ""Those two things just can't co-exist,"" he said. ""We need some sort of regulation to limit the spread of short-term rentals so we can enable the long-term rental market to provide homes for so many households that are looking for them at the moment."" Across the world, major tourist destinations are moving to regulate short-stay rentals. In Amsterdam, an entire home can only be rented out for a maximum of 30 nights per year. While in New York, it is generally illegal to rent out an entire unit for less than 30 days. Although there are exceptions. Meanwhile, Berlin allows you to lease out your primary residence, but it can be a bit harder to put a second home on the short-term market and you can only let a secondary residence out for a maximum of 90 days. ""Making the regulation is probably the easy part,"" Professor Phibbs said. ""Enforcing the regulation can be quite difficult. It's certainly resource-intensive. It sometimes involves quite long legal processes. ""It's important to have some kind of taxing regime where short-term rentals pay for the cost of that regulation through some sort of bed tax."" In Australia, New South Wales has 180-day caps in some areas, while Western Australia has been investigating a 60-day cap. Meanwhile, Hobart is hoping to become the first capital city to place a cap on the number of short stays. If successful, it will stop any more entire homes from becoming short-stay accommodation. But it could take a while to change the planning scheme, and in the meantime it could prompt a rush on converting homes to short stays. Professor Phibbs said it was a blunt option, but the only one available to the council. Sushannah's young family had a rental with a big backyard and a dog. Now, they're homeless and living in a tent. ""A partnership between local councils and the state government, where local councils could make decisions based on their particular housing markets but there was an overall state government framework that allowed them to do that, would be ideal,"" he said. In a statement, Airbnb country manager for Australia and New Zealand Susan Wheeldon described the proposed changes in Hobart as ill-considered and said they would place the city and Tasmania on unequal footing with the rest of the nation. ""Housing affordability and availability is a complex issue with a range of contributing factors,"" she said. ""In markets that are traditionally popular with holiday-makers and have always comprised holiday homes, vacancy rates have faced significant pressure due to the relocation of many Australians from cities to regional areas throughout the pandemic. ""In many cases, hosts make properties available on our platform that would otherwise be used only as holiday homes."" Louise Elliot owns a short-stay property in Hobart, and is the president of the Tasmanian Residential Rental Property Owners Association. Ms Elliot, who is running for a seat on the Hobart City Council in 2022, said blaming short-stay properties for the rental crisis was ""very short-sighted"". ""It's a really complex issue. Short stay is a small component of that issue … but it's not the biggest factor,"" she said. ""We need far more social and public housing and we need the processes for building new homes to be more straightforward."" Ms Elliot also rejected the idea that all of the entire homes [listed as short stay] would have otherwise been rentals. ""All you have to be to be a whole home is to have your own kitchenette, toilet or entrance,"" she said. ""A lot of those homes, they’re either under people’s houses, on people's properties or they're places that they'd otherwise leave unoccupied."" She said it made sense for some kind of regulation to be considered, but she said it needed to take into account the benefits of the industry. ""Density limits or prohibiting businesses from owning short-stay properties makes sense, but I think it needs to be a much more rounded discussion,"" she said. ""I don't think blanket bans make sense because there can be unintended consequences. ""We need to recognise the benefits of tourism and how important that is to our communities.""

72,Is the Cistern Chapel the best public loo in the land? City goes for gold with throne,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Is Maryborough's Cistern Chapel the best public toilet in Australia? City goes for gold with throne The city of Maryborough, three-and-a-half-hours' drive north of Brisbane, has unveiled its latest tourism attraction — the flashiest loos in the land. What started out as open, night cart-serviced toilets 120 years ago have been transformed into an ornately decorated Victoriana-themed precinct. Cistern Chapel Committee president Nancy Bates said she had the grand vision after a visit to the dingy toilets a couple of years ago. ""Maryborough is developing into a great tourist precinct and I thought, 'This is the heart of it and it's just not good enough',"" she said. ""So I snapped up a couple of photos and sent them to Daniel Sanderson, the councillor here who looks after the city area. ""A couple of weeks later he sent me back a text and said, 'Good news — we are going to repaint them'. ""I said, 'No, Daniel. I want the best toilets in Australia, maybe the world'. ""The fanciest. I want chandeliers, I want fresh flowers and music."" More than 12 months later the transformation is complete and will be open to the public from Monday. ""The thing about doing this particular project is that the character of the building was so terrific, it just lent itself,"" Ms Bates said. ""You couldn't do this with a new building at all, but there is so much character here within our city hall that we were able to create something a long the lines of the Victoriana theme. ""There are quite a few toilets marketed as tourist attractions — we think we have the fanciest. ""If anybody travels north of Brisbane, we will probably end up on the must-do list. ""We'll have regular checks on the whole thing to make sure it stays as we would like it."" Garry Madden was one of the artists who played an integral role in putting the finishing touches on the project. He said one of the most challenging parts of the project was working on the roof. ""I couldn't get a scissor lift in here because the doors were too narrow, so I was up a ladder painting a lot of butterflies,"" he said. ""That was a bit precarious, but I really needed to do it to fulfil what was my vision as a retreat for mothers to come into. ""I hope people leave a little happier or a little bit more 'relieved' is the statement I would like to make."" Akos Juhasz and Mr Madden were the key artists involved, while other creative work was contributed freely by members of the community.

73,Indonesia's ancient cultures practice a funeral ritual that may change the way you think of death,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  What the extraordinary funeral rituals of Tana Toraja and Trunyan in Indonesia can teach us about living a better life Warning: The following story contains confronting images, which may offend or disturb some readers. Wayan Juli likes to invite tourists to visit the dead. ""The people of Trunyan actually practice a spiritual custom that you are unable to find in other parts of Bali. It is unique,"" Bali-based tour guide Juli told ABC RN's Return Ticket. Around two hours away from the bustling tourist hub of Ubud, the remote village is home to the Bali Mula, the island's original inhabitants. They practice their own form of Hinduism, one which predates the Hindu Majapahit kingdom that ruled Java for two centuries. Trunyan sits on a narrow stretch of land, on the eastern shores of a volcanic crater lake inside the caldera of Mount Batur, an active volcano perched on the infamous Ring of Fire. Bodies aren't burnt here — that might anger the deity the Bali Mula believe lives inside their volatile neighbour. Instead, corpses are offered up to the elements. Dozens of moss green skulls are visible piled atop rocks, ""almost like artwork"", says Juli. He points to bones that lie scattered in the thick undergrowth, some moved by humans, others by animals. Even in the heart of paradise, there is no looking away from this stark reminder of our mortality. The cemetery can only be accessed by boat. At the entrance, under a sign that says ""Welcome to Kuburan Terunyan"", sits a plate with two bleached skulls, a precursor to the numerous bodies waiting within. ""They let the dead body lie here under a tree called Taru Menyan, and they cover it with a special fabric that we normally use here in Bali for someone who has passed away."" Juli adds that Taru Menyan literally means nice smell; the fragrance from the sacred banyan that towers over the cemetery appears to neutralise any odour. There are designated cemeteries for people who have died a normal death, for children, and for those who have died by accident or foul play. Corpses in the ""normal"" cemetery are placed in 11 bamboo cages and are typically in different stages of decomposition; as the cages fill, the oldest remains are moved, and new ones added. ""When I first came to this place, I was scared to see the skulls lying there just like a decoration,"" Juli admits. Yet, after that initial shock, he found there was something special about this tranquil cemetery. ""I don't feel any fearfulness. I just feel peaceful here."" It is no surprise that this place drew in Paul Koudounaris, a photographer with a PhD in art history and three books – The Empire of Death, Heavenly Bodies and Memento Mori – under his belt. Koudounaris has many years of experience documenting sacred human remains as well as photographing buildings and vaults as well as smaller rooms and even wells and containers where human remains are stored. In places like Trunyan, he sees the boundaries between the dead and the living stretch and blur. The space between is where he goes to grasp what death actually means. ""I finally just understood death as a border between two potential socialised groups, the living and the dead,"" he explains. In much of the Western world, in which he includes Australia, the United States and most of Europe, Koudounaris sees many ""hard"", wall-like boundaries. To try to transgress that wall, to interact with the dead, is considered perverse or unnatural. ""The funny thing about that is if you look cross-culturally and if you look historically, it's always been the exact opposite,"" he says. ""If you look at most cultures in the world still to this day outside the West, if you look at the way Europe used to be, if you look at most ancient cultures, you'll find that they always had a very soft boundary. ""The living and the dead were encouraged to interact. That's what we're seeing in Indonesia, for instance; we're seeing this invitation to cross the border to interact with these people who have passed on."" This soft boundary is also evident in Tana Toraja, in the Indonesian province of South Sulawesi. The first time he visited the region in 2016, photojournalist Putu Sayoga took an eight-hour bus ride to the small town of Rantepao, the capital of North Toraja, before switching to a motorbike for the last hour and a half. He was willing to undertake the arduous journey to witness the ritual known as ma'nene (""care of ancestors""), believed to bring good fortune and bountiful harvests to the community. He stood by as Odiya Sulu, a 38-year-old woman, spoke to her mother. Elis Sulu had died aged 65, in 2015, but one year later her body was remarkably intact, kept so by preservation rituals practised by her tribe. Sayoga was seeing Elis long after the elaborate funerals were complete. During ma'nene, families would talk to their deceased, dress them, walk them around the village and even pose smiling for selfies. The oldest corpse Sayoga saw was a person who had died in 1930. ""One time, the family found love letters dating back to 1987, and they read it out loud for all of us,"" Sayoga recalls. However, before you can get to the ma'nene, a grand funeral needs to be held. Those in Tana Toraja are famously expensive, necessitating the sacrifice of many water buffalo. It can take months and even years for a family to accumulate the cash needed. In the meantime, bodies are kept in the home and considered ""to makula"" or merely sick — something Sayoga discovered for himself when he was invited to sleep with a family in the same room as their dead ancestor. He found the corpses were treated much as if they were alive, receiving offerings of food, water, clothing, and cigarettes. Determined to document it all, Sayoga came away with dozens of pictures. ""They are really open [to visitors],"" Sayoga says. He found not only was his camera welcome, he would often be asked to join the family in a round of celebratory drinks after the ritual itself was complete. Come with us on a journey of the mind … to destinations both near and far-flung, the familiar and the unexpected … in search of what the tourist never sees. Koudounaris has had similar experiences. ""They were actually delighted that outsiders had come to witness something that was important to them,"" Koudounaris says. In Trunyan, they may go a step further, encouraging people to handle the skulls and bones in the cemetery. ""They [the locals] have enough tourists come that they know what makes a good picture. They'll be like: 'Oh, hold him up and I'll take your picture with him.'"" Such pictures have often incited outrage and condemnation online, but Koudounaris says the locals' attitude makes complete sense to him. ""We've invented this stigma around death – that we have to be very formal around the dead – but they [the locals] don't necessarily see it that way. They enjoy the interaction and they like seeing us interact as well. It is just a very different relationship."" Koudounaris had been in Tana Toraja for a week when a local walked up to him and said, ""Our grandmother is dead in the hut over there. Would you like to visit her?"" ""She had been shot up with formaldehyde, and she was very well-preserved,"" Koudounaris recalls. ""The interaction was interesting on so many levels: not just the incident itself but also the idea that I was going in to meet her, not to observe her or to see her, but to meet her because really she is still there spiritually with them in a way we just can't comprehend."" Back home in Los Angeles, Koudounaris has begun a new project: roadside funerals for dead animals. He poses their bodies, with flowers, fabrics like silk and voile and jewellery. ""We're kind of shifting gears because we're talking about pets dying, but it's interesting how many people by now, probably thousands of people, have written to me, thanking me for doing that,"" he says. They tell him it has helped them deal with the death of their own beloved animals. ""It almost sounds counterintuitive. If anything, we might think that maybe that's going to make it harder, [to have lost your pet and then] to see a dead animal with flowers on the side of the road. ""But it is the exact opposite — it's seeing it, understanding it, giving it some respect and knowing that someone out there cares."" Koudounaris hasn't spent any time planning his own funeral — he believes those are meant to comfort the living. ""I would say, when it comes to me, let my friends decide whatever they think is best. ""You know, dress me in a suit of armour, put me on a horse and smack it on the a** and send it off into the desert until I fall off. Put me on a ship and just let me go out to sea … whatever they think is best."" Meanwhile, he thinks we could all do with a little more time meditating on death – and it doesn't have to involve an actual corpse. ""It's such a humbling experience,"" he says. ""[Witnessing death] really makes you understand how small you are in the grand scheme of things, but also it really helps us understand how interconnected we really are.""

74,New push for Kalgoorlie and Esperance air link in a potential 'game changer' for WA's south coast,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Proposed air link between Kalgoorlie and Esperance a potential 'game changer' Tourism officials hope a new partnership will make flights between Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Esperance a reality on Western Australia's south coast later this year. It comes as the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder steps up efforts to reinstate an eastern states air link, which was suspended at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Kalgoorlie-Boulder-Esperance Aviation Development Partnership is made up of the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, the Shire of Esperance and tourism body Australia's Golden Outback (AGO). AGO Esperance tourism development manager Simon Latchford said negotiations were underway with prospective carriers and was hopeful flights could begin as early as September. He quipped the ""walls are coming down"" after two years of the pandemic and WA's hard border ending in March. ""For us to be able to work together to get large aircraft running services out of Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide into Kalgoorlie, we can then leverage off that by providing an appropriate connecting service between Kalgoorlie and Esperance,"" Mr Latchford said. ""That's a game changer … from a business perspective you can fly up in the morning and fly back in the evening in Esperance. ""So it's great for business and it's great for tourism, obviously, because people can now access the region."" Regional Express (REX) is the only commercial passenger service flying into Esperance on a government-regulated route from Perth. The airline began operating the route in February 2016 and has a contract with the state government until June 30, 2023. Meanwhile, the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Chamber of Commerce and Industry has been canvassing the local business community about preferred days for flights to Melbourne. A short online survey asked questions such as how many times a year businesses would use the service and for what purpose. Kalgoorlie-Boulder Airport manager Chris Barnes said he could not discuss which airlines were in negotiations about an eastern states air link. He said there had been ""excellent feedback"" from the business community. ""We already have an understanding, from our historic numbers, of what the average traveller would be using those services for and what the peaks are,"" he said. ""It's important we understand what the business travellers are seeking and what businesses are requiring on those routes, so when we look at negotiating these routes, we can understand best what works best for everyone."" Virgin Australia's direct flights to Melbourne were suspended when the pandemic prompted the introduction of tough border restrictions and eventually forced the airline into administration. Qantas previously ran direct flights between Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Adelaide but the route was axed in 2014 due to poor ticket sales. Meanwhile, the state government today announced $4 million to underpin new direct flights between Karratha and Geraldton. Operated by Aviair, the new route expands the existing Inter-Regional Flight Network, which currently provides flights between Karratha and Port Hedland, Newman and Broome, and Newman and Port Hedland. WA Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said it would significantly reduce travel times, with many small business and FIFO travellers in Geraldton currently travelling to the Pilbara via Perth.

75,A bird's-eye view of tractors seeding in WA's Wheatbelt at night,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," ABC Rural Tractors seeding crops in WA's Wongan Hills blend with the stars from the night sky When Virgin Australia pilot Kris Parnell was stood down at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, he headed out to Western Australia's wheatbelt to help at the family's tree nursery and drive harvesters for a season. Now that he's back in the air full time, Mr Parnell says it's a joy to look down over the same area from 36,000 feet, or 11,000 metres, and see the tractors seeding through the night. He said for most of the year it would be a sea of black, but during seeding and harvest, it was a different story. ""It's quite incredible when you get a dark night like we've had this week with no moon early in the evening. It's just a sea of lights that look very much like stars,"" he said. ""We fly on our instruments so it doesn't really affect us but if you're flying on visual cues to know which way the plane was up, you'd find it very hard to know because the stars and the ground look exactly the same from all the tractors and the seeding equipment."" Mr Parnell took a photo from the air about 150 kilometres north-east of Perth, near the Wongan Hills area. He said the glow in the picture was Perth city. ""I just took that picture because I've been describing it to my dad and a few mates out there from when I was working on the harvester, and I thought, 'I'll have to try and get a photo of this,'"" he said. ""I was just playing around the long exposure on the phone and that photo came out so I was pretty happy with that.""

76,Bear essential: Treasured teddy rescued from outback after dad's travel photo blunder,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Lost teddy bear 'Pooh' reunited with family after being lost in the outback A long-lost teddy has finally been reunited with his family months after being left behind in outback NSW. Gordon Wilson left his son's treasured bear 'Pooh' on a fence post along the Barrier Highway near Broken Hill in March while part way through a 5000km journey from Bowen in north Queensland to Perth in WA. Mr Wilson had been taking photos with the bear as a way of keeping himself and the family entertained. After being ""distracted by flies"" and driving off – it took hours for Mr Wilson to realise he'd left his son's prized possession more than 150km away. He decided against going back, and that's where the real adventure began. He and his wife Lois Wilson logged onto to social media and began posting on Broken Hill Facebook groups, asking if someone had seen or picked up the bear. What happened next came as a shock to the Wilsons. Their appeals for help were shared all over the internet. ""I was actually quite amazed by the reaction and how many people were following the story,"" Mr Wilson said. Grazier Mitch Rodgers was one of those interested onlookers. Determined to reunite the family with their beloved bear, he drove out from Comarto Station near Wilcannia to find Pooh where he had been left. While the plan had initially been to post him back in the mail, Mr Rodgers and Mr Wilson thought the adventure should continue. So they decided to harness the power of social media to find more people willing to travel with the bear across to the west coast. ""Mitch went to great trouble and started to share the story on social media with some great photos,"" Mr Wilson said. ""The story then took on a life of it's own and if it wasn't for Mitch it probably wouldn't have got off the ground like it did."" He said Pooh's journey garnered interested from as far afield as Scotland, where he had relatives. He said Pooh travelled 150km to Broken Hill and visited Silverton before heading south to Mildura in Victoria. ""He then received a lift from a couple to Adelaide and from there flew to Perth,"" he said. ""I'll tell you what it took off pretty quick,"" Mr Rodgers said. ""It was just good to hear that people were getting a bit of joy out of it."" 24-year-old Ben Wilson, who's had the bear since he was a baby, is still stunned that so many people dedicated their time and effort to make sure the teddy was returned. ""I thought that was it, and I was never going to get him back,"" he said. ""I'm grateful for Mitch, the Broken Hill community along with anyone and everyone who was involved,"" Ben said. Asked if Pooh would be having any more adventures anytime soon….the answer was ""unlikely"". ""He'll be staying with me until I have my first child and then when he or she gets old enough, I'll tell them the story of what happened here,"" Ben said. ""Because it's not something we're going to forget anytime soon.""

77,First new baby in decades brings life to tiny town where a dark mystery may never be solved,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tourists Ondra Hadras and Lucie Minarikova could not have imagined they would land jobs feeding emus and crocodiles in one of Australia's smallest outback towns, infamous for a dark mystery that may never be solved. Then, mere moments after touching down in the Northern Territory – thousands of kilometres from their Czech Republic home country, they were swept off to Larrimah – a dot on the Stuart Highway with no schools, petrol stations, restaurants or even a grocery store. Population, fewer than 11. ""When we got here the internet connection was very poor, we didn't know about the history of the town, or about the missing persons case,"" Lucie said. ""We're used to travelling around to different places, so we just packed our bags and headed here to work."" The couple planned to stay for a fleeting few weeks as the newest publicans of the Pink Panther Hotel to earn some extra money on their travels. But then the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, trapping them for far longer than expected. They became parents just a couple of months ago when they welcomed the first baby born in Larrimah in more than two decades. Mathew's birth single-handedly grew the population by about 10 per cent and significantly lowered the median age of a town where residents are closer to 100. ""It's a one-in-a-million story,"" Ondra said. ""This is something which not many people do … our family can't even imagine [what it's like] when we tell them all the things we do. ""When Mathew grows up, we'll be telling him he grew up next to a crocodile cage, in a really special place."" In a town where every single resident now gathers together for Christmas, and most convene at the Pink Panther Pub for an end-of-day beer about 5pm, Mathew ""gets a lot of attention,"" Ondra said. But attention is not out of the ordinary for the residents of Larrimah, who are now accustomed to news crews rolling into town, documentary teams settling in for a couple of weeks and ongoing police probes. A coronial inquest into the missing persons case of Larrimah larrikin Paddy Moriarty, who disappeared without a trace in 2017, last month found he was dead. Even without a body, coroner Greg Cavenagh said he believed Mr Moriarty's colourful life came to an end in suspicious circumstances. ""Paddy was killed in the context of and likely due to the ongoing feud he had with his nearest neighbours,"" he stated in his official findings handed down in April. The case has captured global attention, yet remains unsolved despite a probing book and a podcast. These days, if asked to describe their hometown, most of Larrimah's residents do not hesitate to say it's nearing its demise, even with the most recent population explosion. ""We're all in our 70s and 80s now … we'll all die out eventually,"" long-term resident Karl Roth said. But it hasn't always been that way. During World War II, about 10,000 troops were stationed at Larrimah and years later it served as a railhead until the line closed in 1976. ""It was never a big town … when we first moved here the population was about 28, including kids, but all the stations would come in back in those days,"" Mr Roth said. ""This place used to hum on a Friday, Saturday night."" For Ondra and Lucie, the quietness of Larrimah was a major selling point, and as the sole managers of the ageing hotel, they are usually run off their feet keeping a zoo of animals alive and catering to the flocks of grey nomads on their travels around Australia. ""It gets really crazy with the tourists here during the dry season,"" Lucie said. ""We are the chef, the waiter, the cleaner. We do it all."" Ondra and Lucie say they would look back on the journey as a once-in-a-life-time experience. They have no plans to leave just yet. ""There is something about this place. We have emus that stick their heads in our rooms in the morning,"" Lucie said. ""We never liked the big cities … but for me this is more like an interesting extreme, where you will live for a period of time … and we plan to stay for a few more years."" She said it was not a job where she went into an office and sat for eight hours. ""When you work here you go and feed Sam the crocodile, and the emus, and our parrots, and long-billed corella,"" she said. ""For people from [the] Czech Republic, that's pretty special.""

81,'Perfect storm': Staff shortages threaten Top End tourist season ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Standing in the gleaming lobby of the major Darwin hotel he manages, Markus Kaliss says this dry season has the potential to attract a record number of bookings for the venue – if only he could find enough staff. ""At the moment we're not fully booked, but there's already now days and weeks where we're saying 'you know what, that's it, we don't sell more because we can't handle [it], unless we find staff',"" Mr Kaliss said. ""So we are now capping capacity, simply for staffing reasons."" Mr Kaliss is not alone. The pandemic has brought a challenging two years for businesses, and Mr Kalliss's hotel is one of countless hotels, restaurants and bars across Australia struggling to meet demand due to staff shortages. But while the problem is nation-wide, it's threatening to have a particularly severe impact in the Top End, as it enters its peak tourist season this month. Mr Kaliss said it was a ""tough time"" for territory hospitality businesses, which were also grappling with existing staff taking time off after catching COVID-19 or leaving due to the territory government's wide-ranging vaccine mandate. ""We've never seen this shortage of labour that we need here,"" he said. Alex Bruce, the head of the Territory's peak hospitality industry body, said Top End businesses were bracing for strong demand this dry season, especially from interstate. But with few international visitors in Australia – including prospective workers – and a large number of former domestic staff having left the industry for other sectors during the pandemic, Mr Bruce said the staffing situation was dire. ""What we're hearing now from people that have travelled over to South-east Asia, is a lot of people that were working in the tourism and hospitality industry in those countries, they've moved into other industries as well,"" he said. ""So we're facing a bit of a perfect storm – we don't have enough domestic local workers, and we don't have enough international workers coming back online now."" Mr Bruce said the crisis was having serious impacts on hospitality businesses, which were still trying to recover from a difficult few years during the pandemic. ""You're seeing restaurants unable to open during the day, during the week, even though the demand is there,"" he said. ""We are hearing that some of the hotels around town can't get all their rooms online. ""So it's still a great time to get out and about – the weather's never better — and you'll still get a good experience in our venues, but the tip is this year, to plan and book, and book early."" Martin Bouchier, the owner and chef of a restaurant in Darwin said the current staff shortage at his business made the dry season a ""scary"" prospect. ""There's just not the [staff] around to be able to accommodate the people that want to come into the town as tourists,"" he said. ""So we're bringing people into the CBD, into Darwin and into the Northern Territory, and yet there's not the backpackers or the international students or the working group to keep us going."" Today Tourism and Hospitality Minister Natasha Fyles announced more funding for the territory's tourism industry, ahead of the delivery of the 2022 NT budget tomorrow. It includes $1.3 million for attracting and retaining tourism staff and $1 million for marketing to international students, as well as $14.2 million for generally promoting the NT over the next year. Mr Bruce said the initiatives were welcome, with international students making up ""a core part of the hospitality workforce"". However, he said a range of measures were needed to help solve the sector's staffing crisis, including fast-tracking work visas, easing working hour limits for international students, and even the NT government scrapping its worker vaccine mandate. ""It's not just when the borders open we can flick a switch and get everybody back,"" Mr Bruce said. ""We're on a three-year rebuild for our workers.""

82,Search begins for 'good people' to take over remote island resort,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Sweers Island Resort hits market for $3.95m as owners vow 'good people' will take it over Known among anglers as a fishers' paradise, the pristine Sweers Island Resort in the Gulf of Carpentaria has hit the market at $3.95 million. Its reputation for world-class fishing, resort accommodation and pristine beaches means more than 900 accommodation nights have already been booked by tourists for 2022. Thomas, better known as Tex, and Lyn Battle have held the perpetual lease, on the land of the Kaiadilt people, for the past 34 years. While interest in the island is high, the couple say it will take a special type of buyer to seal the deal. ""It's been a hard decision to sell up. We've been here for 34 years but my date of birth has caught up to me and we've realised we have to sell,"" Mr Battle said. ""We've already said no to a few developer-types, that's definitely not what we want. ""Our ambition is to have good people take it over. ""We want someone who is going to love this place as much as we have and who is going to maybe invest in a few upgrades. A chef would be nice, for example."" Along with its own private airstrip, accommodation, fishing charter facilities, liquor licence, mobile and internet, the resort is the only tourist hotspot in the region. Private Islands Online's Richard Vanhoff said many potential buyers had already shown interest. ""No other land for lease will be made available on any islands within the Gulf of Carpentaria for the use as resort business, so no competition,"" Mr Vanhoff said. ""The phones have been running hot since it got out there and most of the inquiries have come from groups of people."" Mr Battle said it was a ""walk in, walk out"" sale. ""If someone buys it, they get everything we have here. Cabins, workshops, machinery, everything,"" he said. As the couple prepares to depart the island at the end of the year, they say the biggest highlight of managing the getaway has been the people they have encountered over the years. ""We've met everyone from council workers to millionaires. They're all the same when they're here. They come here to enjoy themselves,"" he said. ""The highlights have simply been visits from nice people or seeing people return year after year and enjoy themselves. ""It's a special place, and while we are sad to leave it, rest assured we will be visiting again.""

83,"Jetstar to fly directly from Canberra to Melbourne, Gold Coast",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Jetstar expands direct flights to and from Canberra to include Melbourne and Gold Coast Jetstar is adding two new routes to its Canberra service with direct flights to and from both Melbourne and the Gold Coast. The budget carrier, owned by Qantas, entered the Canberra market in December with flights to and from Brisbane. Now Jetstar has announced that daily flights to Melbourne will begin on July 1, with the Gold Coast service starting in mid-September. ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said Jetstar's Brisbane-Canberra route had proven successful over the past five months, with more than 80 per cent of seats sold. ""This is a real vote of confidence from Jetstar in the Canberra market,"" he said. ""It's going to work both ways for us: it's going to be great for Canberrans who want to get to the Gold Coast or down to Melbourne. ""But it's also going to open the door for thousands of extra tourists to be able to get to Canberra in an affordable way."" While new flights might make it easier for Canberrans to enjoy a Melbourne or Gold Coast getaway, it is the potential influx of inbound visitors that the ACT government and tourism operators are focusing on. ""Visit Canberra will work with Jetstar on cooperative marketing campaigns to promote the new services,"" Mr Barr said. ""Melbourne is our second biggest inbound market after Sydney, so it's going to be an easy opportunity for us to grow our Victorian tourism and particularly short-break tourism over weekends. ""Now to have four airlines flying [to Melbourne] and competing, really is fantastic news. ""One of the challenges for us is that it's often been cheaper to fly to Bali or to other parts of Australia than it has been to fly into Canberra, so this is a game-changer for us."" Canberra Region Tourism Industry Council chief executive, Naomi Dale, agreed the new services would ""make a big difference"". ""It really gives us access to a whole new set of people who otherwise would not make the time to travel to Canberra,"" she said. ""Just the way that Canberra is perceived as an expensive place to visit or travel to, it will make a huge difference having access to that budget airline."" Mr Barr also said Canberra was ""edging closer"" to the return of international flights, with talks ongoing with Australian and overseas carriers. ""Piece by piece we are rebuilding the aviation network out of Canberra,"" he said. ""We'll have some further announcements, we hope, in the months ahead."" Canberra Airport chief executive Stephen Byron offered further details, saying Qatar Airways had been set to resume daily flights to Canberra but a shortage of planes had forced them to delay the restart. He said the airport was also in close contact with Singapore Airlines. ""I was up in Singapore a couple of weeks ago talking to Singapore Airlines and it's very much on their radar as international travel picks up,"" he said. Meanwhile, Mr Byron said mask-wearing in the airport terminal was still being heavily policed, despite restrictions continuing to ease across the country. He said he hoped the airport's mask mandates would be lifted mid-week. ""What amazes me is it's taken 10 weeks already,"" he said. ""You can be in a nightclub for four or five hours and dance until 3am and drink and stand up, and none of that needs a mask, then surely sitting quietly in an airport lounge cannot be more dangerous than that.""

84,Russians to be deported from Bali for obscene Instagram content,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  It's known as the Island of the Gods, but that's lost on some Western influencers who like its picturesque temples and landscapes for risque social media content. Russian yogi influencer Alina Fazleeva and her husband, Andrey, will be deported and barred from entering Indonesia for six months, after Ms Fazleeva offended Balinese Hindus by posting images of herself posing naked on a centuries-old sacred tree. Known as Kayu Putih, which translates as ""white wood"", the giant tree behind Babakan Temple in Bali's Tabanan district is believed by locals to be 700 years old. The image went viral after Niluh Djelantik — a prominent Balinese fashion designer and politician — posted a screenshot asking people to report Alina to immigration authorities and the police. ""She should be responsible for the cost of the cleaning ceremony to be carried out by villagers,"" Ms Djelantik said. ""Trashy tourist. Go home!"" she later posted. Ms Fazleeva deleted the offensive post and published another photo depicting herself offering prayers while clothed at the same tree. ""I apologise to all the people of Bali and Indonesia. I regret what I have done,"" she wrote in Indonesian. ""I am so ashamed, I did not mean to offend you in any way, I had no knowledge of this place,"" she said. ""I just prayed under the tree and went straight to the police station to explain this and apologise."" Despite the apology, Bali's Governor, Wayan Koster, personally ordered her deportation, saying in a statement it was ""far important to preserve the culture and respect the dignity of Bali"" than tolerate such behaviour for tourist dollars. Ravinjay Kuckreja researches indigenous religion at the State Hindu University of Denpasar in Bali and hosts the Being Bali podcast on local culture. He said that, for Balinese Hindus, ""sources of water like springs, statues, trees and volcanoes are amongst the many everyday objects that are sanctified and regarded as sacred"". Having one's naked body against a holy tree was thus considered ""sacrilege"" by Balinese Hindus, who revere large trees as embodying ""a divine ogre named Banaspati Raja (lord of the forests)"", Mr Kuckreja said. ""The tree is completely sacred ... it is considered a manifestation of God,"" he said. The incident came shortly after immigration officials said they would deport a Canadian man who had filmed himself attempting the ceremonial Māori Haka on a volcano worshipped by Balinese Hindus. Jeffrey Craigen, a self-described ""mind body healer"", live-streamed himself dancing, naked, on the peak of Mt Batur while proclaiming that stripping naked made him into a ""fearless child of God"". Mr Kuckreja said that dancing naked at Mt Batur was considered even worse than posing naked on the tree, because the volcano was ""exceptionally sacred"" for Balinese Hindus. Jamaruli Manihuruk, the immigration head in Bali, said locals across the province were urged to ""proactively monitor and report various violations committed by foreigners to authorities [so that they can take] strict action"". Neither Ms Fazleeva nor Mr Craigen responded to requests for comment. Such incidents are not new in Bali. In August 2019 — shortly before the pandemic devastated the local tourism industry — a Czech couple uploaded a video of themselves splashing holy water on intimate body parts during a visit to a Hindu temple complex. Another video recently circulated on Indonesian social media appears to show a Caucasian man masturbating under a waterfall in Bali. The island welcomed more than six million international travellers in 2019. With Indonesia's borders largely closed due to COVID-19 in 2021, however, Bali saw only around 50 foreign tourists for the whole year. Bali is welcoming back most international tourists, including Australians, without a requirement to quarantine. Other holiday destinations in South-East Asia are also scrapping restrictions for foreign travellers. Direct international flights to the island resumed in February 2022 and fully vaccinated travellers are no longer required to quarantine upon arrival. With life approaching normal and an influx of foreigners to Bali, so returns tourists behaving badly. ""Balinese culture, Balinese ancestral beliefs, and Hinduism, are one in everyday life in Bali,"" said AA Ngurah Adi Ardhana, a local MP and deputy head of the Indonesian Association of Hotels and Restaurants in Bali. He said tourists came to Bali for many reasons and that authorities needed to be prepared for such incidents by educating foreigners about local customs and maintaining the sanctity of holy sites. ""Preventing it is far better than having to repeat it and causing disturbances to this sanctity,"" Mr Ardhana told the ABC. Hindus account for some 90 per cent of Bali's population and around 2 per cent of the total population of Indonesia — a Muslim-majority country where religion is fundamental to identity and plays a major role in cultural and political life. A 2020 Pew survey found 98 per cent of Indonesians said religion was ""very important"" to their lives, compared to just 18 per cent of people in Australia. It was one of Bali’s best kept secrets, then tourism boomed. Now COVID has forced locals back to nature. Blasphemy is illegal in Indonesia, with most high-profile cases consisting of a member of a minority religion offending Muslims. Jakarta's former Christian governor, Basuki ""Ahok"" Tjahaja Purnama, was controversially jailed in 2017 for supposedly blaspheming Islam. Mr Kuckreja said that, while Balinese Hindus rarely had the opportunity to claim blasphemy against members of the Muslim community, in the case of foreigners, it was different. ""It's about getting their rights, about getting respect,"" he said. Indonesia's Tourism Minister, Sandiaga Uno, said recently that he was keen to promote traditional culture via ""tourism villages"" to international visitors in Bali for the G20 conference in November. Mr Kuckreja said that within Balinese culture, visitors from other parts of Indonesia and from overseas were considered ""guests"" and thus treated with the island's famous hospitality. ""It becomes really weird when the guest would then do something obscene … It's kind of misusing the hospitality that they are giving to guests."" It is not difficult to identify holy places in Bali, he said, given that trees and other objects were usually adorned with offerings and ceremonial cloth. ""[Tourists] should really understand that they are guests and they don't own everything. Before they want to do something, just ask,"" Mr Kuckreja said. ""It's just so much more polite to ask, 'Hey, can I hug your tree naked?' and get an appropriate response.""

86,The small island near Australia promising to be the new Great Barrier Reef mixed with Bali,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  East Timor's coral reefs are the most biodiverse in the world. Why are they surviving climate change? Luis Melky Here-Huno — or Melky as he is known around here —  is East Timor's first qualified diving instructor. We meet in Dili, where Melky is teaching more than 40 Timorese kids how to swim and introducing them to diving theory, before taking them on their first dive. For most of these children, Melky's lessons are their introduction to East Timor's stunning coral reefs, recognised as the most biodiverse in the world. ""I want to keep teaching Timorese people to dive and help them understand what is down in our ocean so we Timorese people can learn to take care of our coral reefs,"" he says. The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste is one of the world's youngest nations, gaining its independence and officially changing its name in 2002, after a brutal war with Indonesia. From its inception, the tiny nation has sought to project itself as an eco-tourism alternative to Indonesia's island of Bali, 2,000 kilometres west. But as Timor-Leste reopens to the world post-COVID a key challenge remains: how can its pristine natural environment be maintained while building sustainable livelihoods for locals like Melky? ""Everyone is talking about climate change here — people are worried about the future of the reefs,"" Melky says. ""I know what is inside the ocean here now — and if the coral reef is dying we won't have an industry."" Melky, 30, grew up in Dili close to the ocean, and spent much of his childhood at the beach. He never dreamed he would one day make a living as a dive teacher, but he recently won a tourism champion award for his efforts. He was just 10 years old when the war ended and has vivid memories of huddling at the port in Dili, waiting for the United Nations peacekeepers to arrive to provide protection from occupying Indonesian forces. ""So many people had died but for young people at the time we felt very happy,"" he says. ""Timor-Leste is very small but at least we are independent."" Melky's first job was collecting garbage in Dili. Then he worked as a security guard watching the cars of divers while they went out on diving trips. ""While I waited for them, I used to wonder what they were doing down there under water,"" he says. His lucky break came when he met Kate Barker and Ivan Samra, the British and Mexican co-owners of a dive school, and began working with them in 2016 as he trained to become a dive instructor. ""I want tourism to become much bigger in Timor-Leste, but not so it becomes like the next Bali,"" he says. ""In Bali you can see the beaches are covered in rubbish and it's just too commercial. We want more tourism, but we want it to be more natural and environmentally friendly."" Melky is not the only one with a passion for preserving Timor-Leste's environment. Catherine Kim grew up in the suburbs of Washington DC, a long way from the coral reefs of Timor-Leste. ""I first heard of the coral reefs in Timor-Leste in the first year of my PhD at the University of Queensland when the project I was working on planned a field trip there,"" she says. ""To be quite honest I wasn't at all familiar with Timor-Leste as a country but I was drawn to it in part because it was newly independent. In that regard I felt there was a lot to tell people about this tiny new country with amazing coral reefs."" Over four field trips between August 2014 and October 2019, Dr Kim contributed to the most comprehensive surveys of Timor-Leste's reefs ever undertaken. Together with data from XL Catlin Seaview Survey and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the research results underpinned her PhD thesis. Part of Dr Kim's research focuses on the island of Atauro, 30 kilometres north of Dili, which boasts extraordinary coral reef habitats and associated marine biodiversity, including endangered, threatened and protected marine megafauna. ""It is part of the Coral Triangle which is the marine epicentre of biodiversity,"" she says. ""These reefs are recognised as the most biodiverse reefs in the world. So part of my interest in studying them is a belief that this is something people really should know about."" Dr Kim's research used data from water temperature and detailed reef surveys to confirm that the tiny country's coral reefs were remarkably high in biodiversity. She further discovered that Timor-Leste's reefs — which sit on the southern edge of the Coral Triangle, an area of ocean stretching from Papua New Guinea to the Philippines and down to Indonesia — appeared to have lower levels of bleaching compared with other reefs such as Australia's Great Barrier Reef. ""What I found from those surveys taken during the rainy season in Timor was that the temperature was a couple of degrees cooler than the satellites were picking up,"" says Dr Kim. ""That was interesting because those bleaching forecasts are based on satellite data of surface temperature. But [for a coral reef] a single degree of difference is quite significant. So despite the satellite predicting bleaching based on satellite data the actual temperature was below that."" Although ocean temperatures are usually warmest after summer (April in the southern hemisphere), Dr Kim's research shows that the waters in Timor-Leste were cooler than predicted when the potential for bleaching events were at their highest. ""One of my key findings was that Timor-Leste could be viewed as a climate refugium in terms of ocean warming and climate change,"" she says. ""That cooler temperature is a significant protective factor against bleaching. So I found that while there is bleaching occurring in Timor Leste, those reefs have a bit more of a buffer in terms of ocean warming."" Dr Kim says if current warming trends continue, most of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef will be gone within a century but the reefs of Atauro may remain in a similar state if other threats are properly managed. ""We cannot underestimate the myriad of threats that impact coral reefs,"" she says. ""Ocean acidification, land-based pollution, overfishing and unsustainable human activities [are some of them]. Dealing with these issues needs to coincide with managing the most significant variable threat to reef health, which is climate change."" For the nascent diving industry in Timor-Leste, there is hope that tourists and divers will be drawn to the remarkable coral wonderland in Atauro before it's too late. ""Part of the reason I have a business in Timor-Leste is to support the local people and try to do things differently,"" says Ivan Samra, co-owner of the Dreamers Dive Academy Timor and President of the Marine Tourism Association of Timor Leste. ""But I am not naive. Coral reefs are dying right now all over the world. Look at the Great Barrier Reef, the Cayman Islands and the Pacific Ocean. ""I am 30 years old but we speak about it every day because we are very aware that by 2040 or 2050 tropical reefs may not exist. Just by its oceanographic conditions and sheer luck, Timor Leste may be one of the last places with coral reefs left in the world within the next decades."" Today, Timor-Leste is positioning itself as an eco-tourist destination that boasts a relatively untouched natural environment compared to neighbouring Bali. Nick Hitchins, who pilots emergency support and tourism flights between Dili and Atauro Island, says the plan – while exciting — poses significant challenges. As well as its impressive coral reefs, Atauro Island is also home to some of the world's poorest people, Hitchins says. ""The challenge facing the Island and the rest of Timor-Leste is how to balance environmental impact with the need for survival in its rawest sense."" While flying the the 30-kilometre stretch between Dili and Atouro in a tiny Australian made Gipps Aero GA8 plane, Hitchins explains a modest $2 ""reef-tax"" levied on all visitors is designed to help offset the fact that locals are now not allowed to fish in protected waters. ""This goes some way to providing alternative means of livelihood,"" Hitchins says. But there is a greater challenge remaining, he says. ""We must ensure that it's not just the world's wealthy who benefit from local tourism and that our Western environmental ideals don't inadvertently worsen the plight of those living in extremely isolated, impoverished societies,"" he says. One of the ways Atauro is seeking to balance environmental and economic outcomes is through Tara Bandu, an animistic spiritual belief that uses traditional laws to manage natural resources. ""Our ancestors used Tara Bandu to protect our most sacred natural places including the fish, animals and important species,"" says Osaias Soares, president of the Atauro Marine Tourism Association. ""It taught people that if we go slow and tread lightly the environment will benefit us. So now we are applying Tara Bundu to our marine protected areas."" Soares says that when he was growing up on Atauro Island there were many more seabirds and animals, but their numbers have dwindled over the past two decades. ""There are only a few seabirds left now, not like when I was a little boy,"" he says. ""Atauro used to focus more on agricultural production and livestock but because of the failure of agriculture to thrive here people switched to focusing on marine shallow water industries in the reef area."" Soares studied marine biology in New Zealand and has brought that knowledge back to Atauro to work with local tourism operators and marine conservation groups. ""We need to teach our local Timorese people about the science of the oceans and reefs here,"" he says. ""Maybe they will tell the tourists about the life of giant clams and how they reproduce. Then they take people into the Marine Protected Area and show them the clams."" Soares knows Atauro is not immune to the threats from climate change. Coral bleaching would be a disaster for his tiny island because of its reliance on marine activities. ""We have one of the most beautiful natural resources in the world here and we are doing our best to take care of the marine area,"" he says as we walk along Beloi beach with the coral reefs just metres away. ""In order to keep it we ask Australia, China, America and other countries that rely on carbon production to find an alternative. Please help us in Atauro and Timor Leste because we want to protect our environment so the world can enjoy them with us."" James Norman flew to Atauro courtesy mission aviation fellowship.

The outback conjures images of hot red sand and temperatures soaring past 40C. But winter in southern and south west Queensland can routinely get down to freezing — not that cold weather will stop a good party. Charleville business owner Courtney Bylett said the region's social season kicked off as the mercury fell. ""We've got races, cultural shows, football season and gymkhanas — mate anything you want, we've got it out here,"" Ms Bylett said. The Charleville Show's ball is being held on Friday night for the first time in several years, bringing a crowd and heralding the start of a busy event season that will have plenty of locals booked out for weekends with no break in sight. ""You'd think we'd all start hibernating [when it gets cold] but none of that bothers us,"" Ms Bylett said. ""Give us a jacket, give us a fire drum, give us a couple of cold rums and a jumper and we're good to go."" Southern parts of Queensland are expected to experience cool weather in coming days as a high pressure system in the Great Australian Bight directs air from the Southern Ocean across southeast Australia. Weather bureau forecaster Shane Kennedy said the cool change would be followed by a rise in temperatures by next Tuesday. ""The coldest places [in Queensland] are most likely to be the Granite Belt and parts of the Southern Interior near the New South Wales border, so looking south of Cunnamulla,"" he said. ""Those temperatures are likely to be well below 10C at night, and getting down to 5 or 6 on Saturday and Sunday morning."" He said that was fairly close to the May average in the Darling Downs but getting up 3 and 4C below average in the Maranoa and Warrego district. Mr Kennedy said the winter was forecasted to be warmer than average. ""It's likely to be the coolest morning of the year for many parts of the Southern Inland area over the next couple of days, particularly the weekend,"" he said. A dusting of snow is a common sight for Queensland's coldest town, Stanthorpe. It's not only residents who enjoy the cooler weather, but tourists who make the journey up from the southern states after two years locked out. Granite Belt Wine Tourism president Martin Cooper said tourists loved the colder weather. ""It's frantic,"" Mr Cooper said. ""People love to come out in beanies, scarves, gloves and parkers."" Mr Cooper also owns and runs a winery which has cabins as accommodation amongst the vineyard. ""Between our accommodation we estimate we're going to use about 22 tonne of firewood this winter and we've been organising the supply for the last two months,"" he said. ""We've got heaps of piles of firewood ready to put next to our cabins every night."" Mr Cooper has a few words of advice to ensure a positive holiday as smaller towns experience a huge influx of tourists and caravans. ""Make your bookings,"" he said. ""Restaurants are filling up, the accommodation is filling up and you don't want to be disappointed, so get your bookings in."" Ms Bylett said patience was also appreciated as tourists made their way west. ""[Tourists] are very much welcome,"" she said. ""Sometimes it's a bit unfortunate we don't have a lot of cafes to offer to them."" She said tourist season could be a bit overwhelming in small towns. ""Be patient with us, but we're doing our best to work towards what you guys [tourists] need."" ABC Western Qld will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday.

89,Which flights will Qantas beat to take the world's-longest-haul title?,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Qantas will break records with Sydney-to-London haul. Here are the some of the longest-duration flights in the world Qantas has revealed plans for the world's longest-duration commercial flight by the end of 2025, ferrying passengers between Sydney and London on Airbus A350s in just over 19 hours. Only a handful of airlines fly non-stop over such vast distances, feats that present a host of challenges, including the capability of planes, commercial viability and even the health of crew and passengers. Here are some of the longest-duration flights in the world today: Singapore Airlines Flight SQ24 to New York's John F Kennedy International airport is currently the longest commercial journey in the world, taking passengers more than 15,000 kilometres from the city-state to the eastern United States on Airbus A350-900s. It also operates the second-longest journey – Flight SQ22, also on A350-900s, to Newark in the US state of New Jersey, which is scheduled at 18 hours and 25 minutes. Qantas will use the A350-1000 variant for its planned Sydney-London flights. The longest current Qantas route – QF9 – connects Darwin in northern Australia with London daily, with passengers covering almost 14,000km on Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Its flights were originally operated between London and Perth, but were moved to Darwin because of Australia's COVID-19 travel restrictions. Qantas has said it will resume its Perth-to-London route this year. Singapore Airlines Flight SQ35 takes passengers more than 14,000km over the Pacific Ocean, from Los Angeles on the US West Coast to the Asian city-state in 17 hours and 10 minutes. The carrier's San Francisco-Singapore flight is scheduled at 16 hours and 40 minutes. Cathay Pacific said in March that it was planning to alter its New York-to-Hong Kong route over the Atlantic instead of over the Pacific Ocean, making it a longer journey than Singapore Airlines Flight SQ24 to JFK. The flight path will cover ""just under 9,000 nautical miles"" (16,668km) in 16 to 17 hours, the airline told AFP in a statement. It declined to be drawn on why its flight path gave a wide berth to Russia's airspace, which it has previously flown through, according to Bloomberg. Many airlines have cancelled routes to Russian cities or are avoiding Russian airspace over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Cathay Pacific said the decision was taken because ""strong seasonal tailwinds"" made the new route more favourable.

90,Queensland state school students caught up in international travel ban,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Queensland state school students have been unable to attend international events due to an education department ban on overseas travel, despite open borders. In March 2020, Queensland Education Minister Grace Grace banned international travel for state school staff and students due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While Australia's international borders reopened after two years in February this year, the ban on government school staff and students remains in place. Independent schools are not bound by the department's ban. The department's restriction has prevented two teams of students from Brisbane State High School, who won a national linguistics competition, from travelling to the Isle of Man to compete at the International Linguistics Olympiad. Additionally, students from Mountain Creek State High School, Merrimac State High School and Worongary State High School were prevented from going to compete at the 2022 VEX World Robotics Championship the United States this week after they qualified at the national level. In a social media post praising some of the students ""incredible results"" the department of education said they would be joining the competition online due to travel restrictions. Tory, a mother of one Brisbane State High School student unable to travel for the competition, told ABC Radio Brisbane they were initially excited at the opportunity for Ben and the team to represent their school. She said she had spent the past 10 days trying to find out when the ban would be lifted from both Education Queensland and Queensland Health. ""I understand why the ban was brought in and you know, I appreciate that it's been really difficult times,"" she said. ""However, now obviously, international travel is open to private citizens and Education Queensland is actively encouraging international students to come and study here. ""So I just wanted to find out when the ban would be lifted to see whether we could accept the invitation and start booking tickets."" She said she suspected the ban would be lifted soon but she said ""trying to find out when the ban would be lifted has been a really fraught exercise and I don't have an answer"". An education department spokesperson said the department was working through ""issues related to COVID insurance and other matters"" to lift the restrictions ""as soon as it is responsible to do so"". ""On Queensland Health advice and in line with the Declared Public Health Emergencies, and during a world health pandemic, as at 15 March 2020, all departmental international student and staff travel was put on hold until further notice,"" the spokesperson said. ""The safety of students and staff who travel overseas will always be our number one priority, and we will always follow the health advice."" A Queensland Health spokesperson said the health advice in March 2020 and throughout the pandemic was appropriate at the time. ""The Department of Education can provide comment on policies they may have put in place during the pandemic for staff, students and teachers,"" the spokesperson said. Education Minister Grace Grace declined an interview with ABC News.

91,Planning a European holiday? It will cost more and take longer to get a passport,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Travel agents say Australians who are planning a European holiday this year should expect to pay 25 per cent more for their trip than pre-COVID prices. Despite the opening of international borders, flight capacity is still limited and the tourism industry is dealing with a staffing shortage. Flight Centre CEO Graham Turner said recent interest in international travel had been ""huge"" and the industry was struggling to attract enough staff. Mr Turner said a lack of airline capacity, especially out of Queensland, was also a major problem. ""The reality is, if you want to go to Europe in summer, late June, July, August, you need to get in quickly because there's just not enough seats,"" he said. ""And it'll be more expensive than pre-COVID, probably about 20-25 per cent more expensive."" Flight Centre had 21,000 staff globally before COVID but its workforce now is only about half that. Mr Turner said an industry-wide staff shortage and an increase in demand for bookings had led to  ""queues out the door"" at some travel agents. ""There's a lot of pent-up demand,"" he said. ""We're back to 60 or 70 per cent of the pre COVID traffic so there's a lot of pressure on our people, our frontline people, which is one of the things that is a worry for us. ""All we want is more airline capacity, and we need more people to help our customers out as well. ""Because obviously, inevitably customer service will suffer a bit, or a lot in the odd case."" Australian travellers are also being warned of delays to passport processing. A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said following the reopening of Australia’s international border it had experienced high demand for passport services. Between January and March this year, DFAT issued about 390,000 passports – more than double the number it issued over the same period in 2021. ""Due to the high demand, passport applications are currently taking longer to process,"" the spokesperson said. DFAT said travellers should allow at least six weeks for passports processing. ""Current processing times are, on average, 17 business days,"" the spokesperson said. ""This is well short of the time frame the department is encouraging customers to renew their passport."" Gold Coast Airport CEO Chris Mills said last month's passenger numbers were close to the previous April record set during the Commonwealth Games in 2018. ""When we recorded those numbers a couple of years ago international traffic was well and truly a key part of our business,"" he said. ""So to see these sorts of numbers we're achieving just short of pre-COVID levels without international traffic is a really good sign."" Despite the ongoing staffing issues, Mr Mills said the airport was coping with operational challenges. ""We've demonstrated we can manage these large numbers and keep people moving to their destination,"" he said. Flight Centre says it is hoping to open another 50 offices as soon as it can find enough staff. ""The shops are all kept up to date but we just don't have the staff to open those last 50 or so at the moment,"" Mr Turner said. ""Over the next six months, we'll be building up our staff numbers. ""I think the [airline] capacity will be pretty much back to normal for the Christmas holidays. ""We're pretty confident we'll get back to be able to really look after customers over the next two or three months, look after people really well.""

92,Brisbane's Rivergate Marina secures approval for $200m superyacht expansion ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Brisbane's Rivergate Marina secures approval for $200m superyacht expansion Brisbane could welcome dozens more luxury superyachts annually, becoming a major industry hub in the Asia Pacific after Brisbane City Council recently approved Rivergate Marina's $200 million superyacht expansion plan. The multi-million-dollar project will see Rivergate's existing marina expand into the largest superyacht hub in the region, able to accommodate up to 60 superyachts per year for maintenance and retrofitting. Rivergate Marina director Tom Hill said the flow-on effects of attracting more superyachts to Queensland would have big impacts on the local tourism economy. ""We had an overseas boat with us last year and the year before, and the weekly charter for this vessel was in the millions, and the flow-on effect for this boat being in our waters for a bit over a week was $2.5 million,"" Mr Hill said. The marina has been operating since 2006 but anticipates its expansion plans — mostly funded by the company but with hopes of government contributions — will significantly boost its ability to service luxury yachts. A $31 million ship lift that can move 90-metre-long yachts of up to 3,000 tonnes in weight is a key feature of the 27,878m² development, which will be staged over two sections. ""Picture a large superyacht coming into the Brisbane River and getting lifted up on a large boat trailer, being put onto a hardstand here where thousands of employees will be working on these boats,” Mr Hill said. ""Whilst the boat will be up on a hardstand, or in a purpose-built refit shed, the crew and the captain and the owner will be able to stay at our trade centre, a five-storey building on-site with amenities … a pool, a bar.” Mr Hill said the massive ship lift would also offer some defence capability, allowing the company to work on some Defence vessels. The project will be constructed in two stages, with the second stage a five-storey trade building with offices, training rooms and 14 short-term crew accommodation units. At Tuesday's city planning committee meeting, councillors were given details of the development application made by Rivergate Marina and its potential economic impact on the city. Three 35-metre-tall sheds will be built to house superyachts undergoing retrofitting, while hardstand capacity for 10 vessels and two water service berths will also be constructed. The project is anticipated to host 433 jobs during construction, putting $154.6 million into local business, and host 1,458 jobs post-construction, with $525 million injected into the local tourism economy. City planning committee chair Adam Allan said the ""multifaceted"" development would ""put Brisbane on the map"" in the superyacht industry. In April last year, industry body Superyacht Australia reported Australia's domestic superyacht industry had doubled in size during the pandemic, with border closures prompting a spike in charters and holidays aboard the luxury vessels. Superyachts have been a target market for Queensland for several years with the state government releasing a five-year superyacht strategy in 2018, aiming to become the key superyacht hub in the Asia Pacific. The superyacht industry was predicted to contribute more than $1.1 billion to the gross state product, with nearly 8,000 full-time-equivalent jobs in south-east Queensland by 2021. On the Gold Coast, a $9 million superyacht berth was opened in February at the Southport Yacht Club, backed by the state government, described by Mayor Tom Tate as a ""red-carpet moment"" for the city. A superyacht mooring trail announced by the state government for the Brisbane River, which could have conflicted with the Kangaroo Point Green Bridge, was put on hold during the pandemic.

93,Private landowners yet to approve Parnkalla Trail upgrade along Port Lincoln foreshore,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Parnkalla Trail upgrades hope to link Axel Stenross Museum in safer Port Lincoln foreshore walk Negotiations are ongoing between private landowners and the Port Lincoln City Council over proposed upgrades to the popular Parnkalla Trail. If approved by property owners the foreshore walk from the Lincoln Hotel will be extended through to the Limani Hotel. Council CEO Matthew Morgan said discussions with home owners have been ongoing since 2016. ""We're dealing with various different landowners including private landowners and government landowners,"" he said. ""We [already] have full government permission to utilise the coastal path from the Limani to Axel Stenross. ""[But with] the Limani through to the foreshore there are various different private landowners. If they agree we will go coastal; if they don't agree then we will go roadside."" This week the incumbent Member for Grey, Rowan Ramsey, announced $6.8 million to upgrade parts of the Parnkalla Trail if he is re-elected this month. The upgrade is phase 3 of City of Port Lincoln's Foreshore Redevelopment Project. The council has already begun works along the foreshore earlier this year as part of phase 2 of the project. Mr Ramsey said the trail was an important part of the city's attraction and said that both locals and tourists would enjoy the upgrades. ""I think we will see a lot more of the locals getting out to exercise in the morning, going for a walk, going for a run, all those things. And it will be great for the Port Lincoln community,"" he said. ""I think it's a really, really important part. The frontage of Port Lincoln is one of the delights of the place, it's a great tourist attraction."" The trail was formally developed in 1986 and follows the coastline around Boston Bay, providing visitors and locals with the opportunity to enjoy the views of the coastline. In 2008, the council developed a Parnkalla Trail Strategy, identifying key aspects of the path that needed upgrading. Mr Morgan said the upgrades were needed urgently between the Limani Hotel and the Axel Stenross Museum close to the highway as it could be dangerous for some walkers. ""There are points where you're dicing with traffic and heavy vehicles and putting your life in your own hands. That won't happen if this project is funded,"" he said. He added the council was looking to start construction on phase 3 of the project within the next year. ""It probably has a 12-month construction period, so [it'll be] about two and a half years until the path is completed,"" he said.

94,Carriage trade: Decommissioned Gold Coast monorail on track to be holiday units,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Decommissioned Gold Coast monorail carriages on track to become holiday accommodation in NSW After gathering dust in a storage yard for five years, the former Broadbeach monorail carriages may be on track for a new role as holiday accommodation after a private buyer has expressed interest in purchasing them. The once ""futuristic"" public transport system was decommissioned on the Gold Coast five years ago. Built in 1989, the monorail ferried passengers between the Oasis Shopping Centre and Jupiters Casino until it was mothballed in 2017. Trucking business owner Alberto Marques transported the carriages to his Arundel storage yard when the system shut. He said the original buyer intended to use the carriages in a new theme park that never eventuated. ""We ended up with them, and we thought we've got to do something with these carriages,"" he said. ""So we put them up [for sale] ... and maybe someone wants to do a cubby house."" Mr Marques said the carriages were in good condition and have remained untouched since they arrived in his yard. ""I have got two full sets which is one leading carriage at the front and back, because the monorail goes both ways, and then in the middle it's got three mid-carriages,"" he said. ""They've got the seats and the bars and the doors. ""Sometimes we go in there and have a coffee."" Mr Marques said he was negotiating with a surgeon who is interested in buying the carriages and trucking them to a property near New Italy in the New South Wales Northern Rivers region. ""He's really interested in the full set,"" he said. ""He's interested in taking them down to New South Wales … and he wants to set them up as a B&B [Bed and Breakfast]. ""So people actually push the button and go inside the room."" The business owner said he expected to sell the leading carriages for between $3,000 and $4,000, while he hoped to sell the mid-carriages for between $2,000 and $3,000.

95,What passengers can expect on Qantas' longest commercial flight in the world,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  What passengers can expect on Qantas' longest commercial flight in the world They are the futuristic jets that will soon fly us halfway around the world without a stopover. That's if you can spend almost 20 hours confined to the cabin. Qantas announced the purchase of 12 Airbus A350-1000s for their long-haul Project Sunrise flights from Sydney to London and New York beginning in 2025. They will become the longest flights in the world, eclipsing the Singapore to New York haul of just over 17 hours. Qantas boss Alan Joyce championed the purchase, delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as the ""last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance"". So, what can the 238 passengers expect to see and how would a 20-hour flight work? Despite the fanfare, A350s have actually been flying in Australian skies for a few years. Cathay Pacific uses the aircraft on its Melbourne to Hong Kong route and Qatar Airways, which has the largest fleet of A350s with 19, flies it from Sydney to Doha. Internationally, A350s are being used on routes including Shanghai to Boston, Paris to Santiago and Manchester to Los Angeles. The plane is 73 metres long and most airlines use a 3-3-3 seating configuration in economy. The jet is competing with the Boeing 787 and 777X for market share. Qantas has partnered with the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney to investigate the impacts of ultra-long-haul flying on the human body. Professor Steve Simpson was part of a research team that hooked passengers up with wearable health monitors in the week before and after a long-haul flight in a series of tests in 2019. ""You're not sleeping well, you're fatigued, you're at low pressure, all the sorts of physical things that happen from being in the air,"" Professor Simpson said of the findings. Blood clotting in the legs, a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT), is a risk during long-haul flights. But Professor Simpson said non-stop flights from Australia to London or New York were no more risky than current long-haul routes. ""There's no evidence that being in the air for 15 hours is any worse than being in the air for 19 hours,"" he said. Qantas' A350 will feature a ""wellbeing zone"" where passengers from all classes can stretch their legs. Professor Simpson said getting some physical activity, even if it was a five-minute stretch, was critical to minimising the health impacts of flying. He added that cabin light, meal service, types of meals and stretching could all help passengers feel more refreshed at their destination. The plan has the backing of Tony Lucas, the president of the Australian and International Pilots Association. ""The fatigue of those sorts of 20-hour flights is certainly something that we're going to need to manage,"" he said. ""We'll work closely with Qantas and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to make sure that we've got a good regime in place, I'm sure the Australian and travelling public expects their crews to be well rested."" Mr Lucas suggested changing the crewing arrangements could be one way of managing the issue of fatigue. ""Traditionally on long-haul flights we would operate the aircraft with one captain, one first officer and two second officers,"" he said. ""What we might find on these Sunrise flights, is that we operate with a slightly heavier crew, that is with one captain, perhaps two first officers and one second officer."" Shane O'Neil flew 18 hours from Darwin-London to see family in February. ""I felt better than if we had gone through Dubai, the total duration was less and we didn't have the anxiety of changing planes,"" he said. Travellers at Sydney Airport gearing up for intercontinental flights on Monday were more hesitant. Sophie Ball and Max Barker were jetting off to Vancouver for a working holiday. ""This is our longest one for both of us, 14 hours, so another six on top of that wouldn't be great,"" Mr Barker said. Maile Loloa said a 20-hour flight sounded ""a little bit crazy"". ""I can't even last on a four-hour plane, so I don't know how its going to be on a 20-hour plane,"" she said.

97,Direct flights from Sydney to London and NYC are starting — this is how long passengers will need to spend on board,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Qantas announces plans for world's longest passenger flights, direct from Sydney to London and New York Qantas has announced it will begin direct flights from Sydney to London and New York from 2025. The new routes will be the longest passenger flights in the world, and are expected to take more than 19 hours. A Qantas test flight direct from New York to Sydney in 2019 took 19 hours and 16 minutes. The airline has bought 12 Airbus A350-1000s to operate the routes, and says the planes ""will have the range for direct flights between Australia and any city in the world"". Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline was looking for ways to make the lengthy new routes pleasant for passengers, including a ""wellbeing zone"" in the centre of the planes. ""The cabin is being specifically designed for maximum comfort in all classes for long-haul flying,"" he said. The A350-1000 planes will seat 238 passengers, 140 of those seats will be in economy class. NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said the announcement was ""a huge win for the state"". The airline has operated direct flights between Perth and London since 2018, however these were suspended during the pandemic due to Western Australia's tough COVID-19 border restrictions. It is now flying between London and Darwin instead. The airline, with Mr Joyce as a passenger, undertook the 2019 test flight to gauge the effects of long-haul travel on passengers. Fifty passengers and crew were fitted with technology devices to test their wellbeing during the flight and were given space for exercise. President of the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA), Tony Lucas, said the announcement represented a ""huge moment of renewal for the aviation industry"". Mr Lucas said the long-haul flights would present a challenge both operationally and in terms of fatigue, and those issues would need to be worked through with Qantas. ""We'll submit reports and monitor flight and study times, monitor how we are feeling both in flight and after arrival in London or Sydney ... and we'll learn from those experiences,"" he said. ""Given that no-one's ever operated these sort of flights before, that will be a learning experience for both Qantas and us as pilots, and we expect that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority will be involved in that process as well."" Mr Joyce said the airline had initially hoped to order the new planes in 2020, but that the pandemic had delayed the purchase. He also announced the airline's domestic fleet would be revamped with 40 new Airbus A321s and A220s . Those planes will touch down in Australia from late 2023.

99,This man thought he had escaped after encountering a brown snake at his resort. Then he saw the fang marks ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Uluru holiday detour with Royal Flying Doctor Service after brown snake bites guest at resort A Melbourne family's once-in-lifetime trip has been cut short thanks to an encounter with one of Australia's deadliest snakes just a few steps outside the hotel door. Edward McKinney, his wife Carmen and their two-year-old daughter, Vienna, were on a trip-of-a-lifetime to Uluru in the Northern Territory. The former New Yorker, now a Melbourne-based software salesman, was holidaying at one of the Yulara hotels to celebrate his and his wife's birthday and Easter when a 15-centimetre brown snake bit the 35-year-old. ""It wasn't a big one. It was just a baby one,"" McKinney said. ""Its entire body was light brown, almost like a silver, and its head had a very big black stripe of black on its entire head."" Mr McKinney said he and his family had only been at the resort for 24 hours, and he was taking his toddler for a swim. ""I go to leave the room, open the door, take five steps to the left,"" he said. ""I feel something go up my leg. It felt like a piece of grass. ""As I'm lifting my leg up, and I'm wearing nothing but thongs, I see a snake … fly off my leg."" Given his overwhelming fear of snakes, Mr McKinney said he would never forget those five steps in the metre-wide hallway. He returned to the hotel room, where he and his wife scoured his lower limbs for puncture marks. ""I think I'm okay. My wife's looking at my leg. I'm looking at my leg. We can't see any bites,"" Mr McKinney said. ""We wait a couple minutes. We're like, 'Okay, I'm the luckiest man in the world.'"" Five minutes later, at the pool, Mr McKinney started to feel unwell and noticed an itching and burning sensation on his shin. ""I didn't even realise the snake had gone that far,"" he said. ""I have my wife look down, and we see two fang marks right in my shin. ""I go, 'Oh my god! I just got bit by a brown snake."" Despite knowing that immobilisation is one of the steps in the first aid for a snake bite, Mr McKinney wrapped the bite in a towel and moved to one of the resort restaurants where he could get help. ""I just tried to stay as calm as possible,"" he said. A woman named Jules, who Mr McKinney believes was a guest, provided first aid while an ambulance was called. ""She wrapped it up … and they called the ambulance right away,"" he said. Mr McKinney remained positive while receiving treatment at the Yulara Health Clinic, given his symptoms had not worsened in the two hours since the bite. But he became concerned when he learnt he was not out of danger despite his symptoms. ""There was a rash on my neck and chest, which was concerning,"" Mr McKinney said. ""They said, ""Look, we don't have anti-venom here. ""To treat this, we really need to get the flying doctors to take you to Alice Springs,"" he said. Mr McKinney said that he questioned how necessary it was to be flown to the Alice Springs emergency department, and he was told: ""As soon as we pull this compression bandage off if there's venom in your leg, it'll go straight to your heart and could potentially kill you."" ""I waited probably six, seven hours for the flying doctors to land,""  he said. During this time, his wife and daughter visited him at the health clinic, which reassured his wife, Carmen, of his condition. ""Vienna still didn't understand I'm not supposed to move. But all [she] wanted to do was jump on Daddy's stomach and act like I'm a horse,"" he said., ""They fly me to Alice 7 o'clock at night. ""These people are heroes. They were sensational. It was actually a really cool experience."" When Mr McKinney arrived at the emergency department, he was met by a team of six or seven medical professionals. ""In five minutes, they unwrapped my bandage and just monitored my symptoms. [They] took blood to make sure my blood wasn't coagulating with the venom,"" he said. ""Everything was fine. I was quite lucky — very lucky man."" Mr McKinney said, but for the slight symptoms, he would never have sought treatment. ""I had no idea I was bitten,"" he said. ""It must happen where people get bitten, and they don't even realise it and don't get the help."" The whole experience, including catching a six-hour tourist bus back to Uluru to be reunited with his family, has changed his perspective on life. ""I've just learned from it to be less fearful,"" Mr McKinney said. ""Because sometimes your biggest fears are literally just in your mind."" Andrew Thomas from Northern Territory St John Ambulance said that it was vital for first aiders not to wash the bite site. ""One of the ways of trying to identify the snakes in hospital is to use a snake bite detection kit,"" he said. ""They're able to do a swab of the site to see if there's any venom and then identify which snake it is."" He said the next step was to immobilise the patient. ""If you can, use an elasticised or crepe bandage to immobilise the whole limb,"" Mr Thomas said. ""Starting at either the toes or the fingers and then [wrap a] nice firm bandage all the way up the limb.""

100,"Chinese resort developer Freesoul fined $650,000 for damaging Fijian mangroves and reef",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Chinese resort developer Freesoul fined $650,000 for damaging Fijian mangroves and reef A Chinese company that dug a channel through mangroves and a coral reef to provide access to a multi-million-dollar resort and casino development on a Fijian island has been fined $FJ1 million ($650,000) by the High Court in Suva. In the landmark judgment handed down on Thursday, Justice Daniel Goundar also ordered Freesoul Real Estate Development to pay a $FJ1.4 million bond, refundable once the damage had been remediated. The company was found guilty in April last year of two counts of undertaking unauthorised development on Malolo, a tourist island in Fiji's west, where it removed mangrove trees and destroyed extensive parts of a reef to create the boat channel. Justice Goundar said the company had ""caused substantial harm to the environment"" and the sentence reflected the ""community's disapproval for the offender's lack of respect for the environment"". He added there was ""no comparable case in Fiji"" for sentencing purposes. ""The offender had no regard for the marine life and corals that existed in the area where the channel was dug,"" he said. ""The structural damage done to the area is irreversible."" While the affected areas could not be restored to their natural states, he said the damage could be mitigated with works with an estimated cost of about $FJ1.3 million. Freesoul's lawyer David Toganivalu told the ABC the company had not yet decided whether it would appeal the judgment. ""Definitely they want to start the project again,"" Mr Toganivalu said. ""They will need to work with the Department of Environment to see how to rehabilitate the place again."" ""The fine was a bit too high, but that was to be expected,"" he added. Local media quoted Environment Minister Mahendra Reddy as saying the case would serve as a deterrent to other developers failing to comply with environment laws. Navrin Fox, an Australian who has a long-term lease on land neighbouring the development site and who had raised concerns about Freesoul, said he was ""surprised and happy"" the fine was substantial. ""It's good to see the Fijian government and the court system standing up for what's right,"" he said. ""I think that they could go one step further and cancel Freesoul's lease, because they have shown negligence. ""To dig that much reef out and to dump it in front of our lease land and do that without any authority to do it is just pure negligence, and they knew what they were doing."" Fiji's Prime Minister apologises for the arrests, saying ""rogue"" police officers were to blame, and praising media for exposing a Chinese company's ""illegal environmental destruction"". Wildlife Conservation Society Melanesia director Stacy Jupiter also welcomed the sentence but she too said the fine did not go far enough. ""This bond of $FJ1.4 million isn't going to be nearly enough to cover the restoration,"" she said. ""You'll never be able to get back the value of services that has been lost because this channel has been created. ""It takes reefs hundreds to thousands of years to be able to build structures of the size and scale of which they've destroyed and so you can't rehabilitate this. ""No amount of money can rehabilitate what's been taken away."" The story was brought to national and international attention in 2019 when three New Zealand journalists were arrested after being denied an interview with the director of the company Freesoul at its offices in the capital, Suva. They spent the night on the floor of a Fijian police station before being released the following day with the Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama apologising for their treatment.

101,Sellout show tipped when Grammy winners Kings of Leon head to Mildura in October,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Kings of Leon to play one-off regional gig in Mildura for up to 15,000 people American rock band Kings of Leon will play a gig in regional Victoria later this year, and Mildura locals hope the event can attract thousands to the state's north-west. Up to 15,000 people will be able to see the Grammy Award-winning four-piece band at the Mildura Sporting Precinct on October 29, with tickets going on sale at 12pm on May 3. Making the announcement in Mildura on Thursday, Minister for Major Events Martin Pakula said he expected a sellout show for the band's only gig in a regional city. ""We would expect people to be coming from all through the eastern part of South Australia, particularly given that [Kings of Leon] are not going to be playing a show in Adelaide,"" he said. ""Off the back of Foo Fighters in Geelong and indeed Katy Perry in Bright … we know how popular big global rock bands in regional Victoria can be."" It will be the first major event of its kind to be held at the new $44-million Mildura Sporting Precinct in south Mildura. Mayor Liam Wood said while he ""wasn't sure of the logistics"", Kings of Leon would bring their own stage for the performance. ""We're talking about a band that has sold more than 20 million albums, so I think their stage will be a bit bigger than Nowingi Place [in Mildura],"" he said. ""I think it would take up the training oval at the precinct and more. I imagine it will take up a massive amount of room. ""And what a fantastic backdrop with the vines near the stadium."" Cr Wood said he was also hopeful the event would speed up other works at the stadium, with stage two of the development including outdoor seating beginning soon. ""It takes these events sometimes to really push to get things organised and push things forward,"" he said. Mildura Regional Development chief executive Brett Millington said he was certain the act would attract people from far and wide. ""There will be huge benefits to our region from outsiders coming in, attracting people that might not have otherwise considered Mildura as a destination,"" he said. ""As an example, a couple from Perth came [to Mildura's SummerSalt Festival in March] because they wanted to see Birds of Tokyo play by the river. ""It's a unique destination in that context and it can attract different people to our market."" Independent member for Mildura Ali Cupper compared the announcement to when Mildura hosted Triple J's One Night Stand in 2014. ""How amazing that was for our town — the atmosphere was incredible and we just looked so cool, the visitors we had walking through the streets, you could feel the buzz,"" she said. ""I can imagine a similar feel and look and bounce out of this."" ABC Mildura Swan Hill will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Wednesday.

102,North-west gets eco-tourism boost as state allocates $500k for adventure trail,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  $500,000 Victorian government funding to plan, design Kerang-Koondrook Rail Trail What was once an important supply chain for early colonialists living on the Victorian-New South Wales border is set to become a popular outdoor adventure attraction for the Gannawarra Shire. The Victorian government has handed over $500,000 to start the planning and design work for a 22-kilometre cycling and walking trail between Kerang and Koondrook. The trail will follow parts of the former Kerang-Koondrook Tramways route, which delivered supplies to Kerang from the Koondrook Wharf, transported downriver by paddle steamer. Built and operated by the Shire of Swan Hill (later the Shire of Kerang) from 1889 until 1952, when Victorian Railways took over, the tramway was privately owned, had no signalling and had rails of lighter construction. Gannawarra Shire Mayor Charlie Gillingham remembers the tramways running when he was a child. ""When I was young, going to school, students used to travel on the tramway to Kerang."" Victorian Railways operated passenger services on the line until 1976, and freight services ended in 1978. The Koondrook Wharf was dismantled by the Marine Board in the late 50s, and in 1975 the rail turntable was removed, but a replica steam train is located at the old Koondrook station, just across the road from the wharf today. In recent years, redevelopment of the wharf and an emphasis on eco-tourism and outdoor adventure along the Murray River have created new opportunities for the region. ""We do focus a lot on nature-based tourism, and with the new wharf in Koondrook, glamping and the new all-abilities playground, Koondrook and the Gannawarra are going places,"" Cr Gillingham said. The Kerang and Koondrook Rail Trail will eventually extend from Kerang out to the Ramsar-listed Lake Charm and Reedy Lake. It will form part of the wider Murray River Adventure Trail — a multi-sport adventure trail that runs the length of the Murray River from Lake Hume, near Albury-Wodonga in the east to Mildura and Wentworth in the west. That trail takes in river red gum forests and major sites along the Murray, providing visitors the opportunity to experience the iconic river in its natural environment through active recreation. The land-based trail is about 1,040 km, while the water-based trail (for kayakers and other craft) is 1,390 km. State MP Mark Gepp said it was a real asset for northern Victoria and would turn the Murray River into a ""magnificent"" tourist opportunity. ""Tourism doesn't start and stop at a border. The Murray River doesn't recognise a postcode"", Mr Gepp said. ""It's about connecting all these different projects, these different amenities and infrastructure in the Gannawarra, which aren't done in isolation with each other but are designed to connect up to all the wonderful things going on here."" Loddon Murray Cycling Club president Brent McKnight said that once completed, the Kerang-Koondrook Rail Trail would be great for local cyclists and tourists alike. ""A lot of our members do, when they go off and visit different areas, take on the rail trails,"" he said. ""But unfortunately, we've got to travel a fair way to do that, so this will be new for us. It'll be fantastic."" He said it should be a good way to connect people who might not be avid riders, with the 22-kilometre length easily achievable in a little over an hour ""depending on which way the wind is blowing"". ""Most rail trails are not so much a sealed surface but made of a compacted gravel which does make it difficult to use a proper road bike, "" Mr McKnight said. ""However, the introduction of a lot of mountain bikes and what we call gravel bikes, which is a bit of hybrid bike, is ideally suited to a rail trail. ""The biggest thing we see about a rail trail like this is it's all off-road, which means it's much, much safer, especially for young families to take on because the road here can be quite busy with a lot of trucks."" Gannawarra Shire Council's chief executive Tom O'Reilly also has high hopes for the project. ""Once completed, this project will drive economic growth to the region through increased visitation and expenditure, while enhancing community wellbeing and livability, and employment opportunities for local trades and indigenous workforce through construction and new product development,"" he said. The state government has fast tracked the funding for the project to support recovery in the Gannawarra shire and northern border region, which was heavily impacted by travel restrictions during the first two years of the pandemic.

103,More families with kids ditching the school system to hit the road for lengthy holiday adventures,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Caravanning boom continues across Australia as families with kids hit the road for a nomadic lifestyle The caravanning boom in regional areas across Australia is showing no signs of slowing, according to tourism operators and the nation's peak caravan club. There are now 800,000 registered recreational vehicles in Australia, with 1.5 million people taking to the road and holidaying yearly. The boom is also driving an 18-month wait on new motorhomes, caravans and campers and a lengthy wait times in the second-hand market. Those on the road include families seeking lifestyle changes and ditching the school system after lengthy pandemic lockdowns and restrictions. Regional South Australian tourism operator Jan Coleman, who runs tours at the Engelbrecht Cave in Mount Gambier, said there was an increase in full-time travellers visiting the caves. ""There is a lot more families on the road permanently. They've given up their home, they've pulled their children out of school, they're homeschooling, and they're just travelling,"" she said. ""Whether it's because they are sick of being in lockdown or whether they've realised that life really is too short."" Hervey Bay retiree John Bennet, who stopped to enjoy the tourism spots at Mount Gambier, has been on the road for several weeks, with plans to travel into Victoria, around Portland, and then through the middle of Australia. Caravanning since 2002, he said he had also witnessed an increase in the number of young people and families travelling. He said this type of travel offered a certain kind of freedom many families were craving after being in lockdown for so long. ""You can get away from people, but you meet other people too,"" he said. ""You can get out and have a look at what you want to look at, rather than just going to city."" Damian Hooker from Adelaide has been caravanning with his family for 11 years, and he too loves the freedom it provides. ""It's great just to get out and see Australia and let the kids experience things that they would not from just going here to there."" Mr Hooker said COVID affected how often he had been able to travel, but with things beginning to settle, he was planning to take the family on a five-week holiday to Cape York. Campervan and Motorhome Club of Australia chief executive Richard Barwick said there had been a rush of inquiries from families keen to start their nomadic lifestyle. After a challenging year, some families are considering a hiatus on the road. We spoke to others who have gone before to give us some tips. He had seen a shift from the traditional older demographic to more young people and families. ""We've just finished the New South Wales Caravan and Camping Show in Sydney, and there's a number of young families that are looking to do this in the near future,"" Mr Barwick said. ""Towards the colder months, you'd see a migration of what they called the grey nomads, not they're necessarily that grey anymore."" He said many of the younger families interested in this lifestyle owned homes that they rented out for a year and they homeschooled their kids on the road. Thanks to the technology, Mr Barwick said the lifestyle was becoming easier with people able to work and study remotely. Mr Barwick said events and festivals tailored to campers and caravanners, such as the Mundi Mundi Festival, In western New South Wales, were becoming popular and bringing travellers to regions. ""There is actually no basic services at that particular festival [Mundi Mundi],"" he said. ""But If you've got your own potable water, you're own toilet, your own shower, your own power supply, you're self-sufficient."" Mr Barwick said the popularity of caravanning was expected to continue. ""The uncertainty about travel overseas is making people nervous, but travelling in your own country is not,"" he said.

104,"With the starting line at Everest base camp, this marathon is the pinnacle of challenges for 65yo Peter",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Everest Marathon the pinnacle of challenges for 65yo Peter Counsell The Everest Marathon, Peter Counsell can admit, is ""absolutely insane"". ""Harebrained, mad. That probably sums it up,"" he said. Nonetheless, the 65-year-old from Batemans Bay on the New South Wales South Coast will board a plane next month as one of about 50 people from across the world taking up the 42-kilometre challenge. If other years are anything to go by, it is likely only 80 per cent of those who enter will even make it to the starting line at Mount Everest base camp. ""It takes about 10 or 11 days of trekking just to get to the start so just getting there is an achievement,"" Mr Counsell said. ""The last time it ran a guy broke his shoulder, another got altitude sickness, a couple had to be lifted out by helicopter. ""They do give us a medal if we make it, so that's nice. Straight to the pool room."" The Everest Marathon is considered one of the toughest races in the world, with a starting point at 5,364 metres above sea level. Runners pick their way down through the Sherpa trails of the Khumba Valley dodging yaks making their way up the narrow paths and fighting a mental battle against fatigue and low oxygen levels. In its 19th year, the race will commemorate the first recorded ascent of Mt Everest by Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953. ""My only goal is to beat a Nepali porter who carry 20 or 30 kilograms on their back,"" Mr Counsell said. ""If I can achieve that, I'll be very happy."" Typically it takes runners double the time they would normally complete a marathon. Deepak Rai, a Nepali runner, holds the course record of 3 hours and 28 minutes, while Antoine Bonfils from France holds the fastest time for a non-Nepali runner in 4 hours and 50 minutes. No one has ever beaten a Nepali on the Everest run. Mr Counsell has been trekking in Nepal for 40 years and ran guided walking tours in the 80s. He first heard about the marathon four years ago when he noticed a running shirt pinned up in a tea house in the Himalayas. ""That was it, my heart was set,"" he said. ""It's the adventure of a lifetime."" For at least the first 10 kilometres there will be less than half the oxygen Mr Counsell is used to on the coast. ""To be really honest it's almost impossible to really train for the conditions you experience,"" he said. ""It's pretty weird when you're going from sea level, training for something that starts at 5,500 metres. There's a bit of a gap there. ""As we go progressively downhill, theoretically it should get easier to breath."" Mr Counsell completed his first marathon at 38 years of age and is the oldest competitor in this years race. He has done three marathons in the past six months to prepare and runs at least 30 kilometres a week. ""I've been throwing in a few hills too,"" he said. While it will certainly be a gruelling physical challenge, it will also be a mental battle. ""I'm sure the body will hold up, but it's more of a mental thing. That's the real challenge,"" Mr Counsell said. ""But at the end of the day you sit back with an Everest beer and reminisce about the day and have a tremendous sense of achievement."" Mr Counsell hopes his adventure will inspire others to pull out their passports again. ""Nepal really relies on the tourism industry and they're doing it really tough,"" he said. ""Hopefully I can encourage people to get back over there.""

105,"'They could be having some cold showers': Food, gas supplies run low for up to 80 stranded on outback track",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Travellers stranded on Oodnadatta Track with supplies running low, and more rain coming More rain is forecast in South Australia's far north this week as up to 80 travellers remain stranded on the Oodnadatta Track. A recent downpour in the state's outback has caused a significant number of vehicles and caravans to become bogged on the remote track. Woomera recorded a total of 68.6mm of rain on Monday and the Bureau of Meteorology has forecast more heavy rain and thunderstorms for Friday. William Creek publican Trevor Wright said some people were stuck out on the roads for up to three days. ""We had more rain last night, which has made the roads worse,"" he said. ""There are also abandoned caravans out there as well."" Mr Wright said even more travellers could be stranded on outback roads but low cloud in the region has meant aircraft have been unable to fly overhead to check. He said trucks could not reach the town to transport essential supplies due to road closures. ""We're nearly out of gas bottles for heating, so they could be having some cold showers relatively soon,"" he said. ""We're looking at where we are with food. ""I think people are just trying to work out what decisions they have to make given there's more rain on Friday coming."" Andrew Eagle was travelling from the Northern Territory back to his home in Melbourne with his wife before he became stranded three days ago. ""We were planning on staying here for a night and then Leigh Creek for a night but, yeah, now we've spent three days and maybe four here,"" he said. Mr Eagle said outback camaraderie had seen both locals and travellers picking people up who were stuck on the roads and bringing them back into town. ""With [poor] phone reception, the government could do a bit in the area to help,"" he said. ""I don't have to start work until Monday. ""We should be back there by then. If we're not, we're not, we can't do much about it."" Mr Wright said more needed to be done to prepare for situations like this now that people were freely travelling between interstate borders without COVID-19 restrictions. ""What these places need with these rain events, that they're saying are going to be quite common, is that they need road crews that are available to clean up these roads as quickly as possible,"" he said. Mr Wright said there needed to be fast and reliable phone coverage infrastructure put in place so people could communicate effectively with authorities if they got stranded. ""We desperately need to get these microcells that Telstra have cleaned up so that you can actually have data on them,"" he said. ""People are trying to pay bills and organise airfares and everything and they're just timing out on them. So, [they're] very frustrated. ""Luckily we've got one of the Starlink [communication satellites] from Elon Musk, so we're giving everyone access to it for free. ""And hopefully that'll solve the problem — in the short term.""

106,"Locals fail to flock to Mundi Mundi Bash, but organisers say first-ever event positive",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Mundi Mundi Bash raises $130k for RFDS, but organiser wants road access improved The inaugural Mundi Mundi Bash music festival has wrapped up amid concerns about local ticket sales and safer access to the festival site for future events. Around 9,500 attended the three-day festival, which wrapped up on Saturday and featured acts such as Paul Kelly, Ian Moss, Kate Ceberano, and The Radiators. Organiser Greg Donovan said he was happy with how the event went and there was an overwhelmingly positive response from festival-goers. But he said locals-only ticket sales for Broken Hill and Silverton were low with just under 70 residents picking them up. ""A few people came out and had a look but I guess when you're looking at a town of 17–18,000 it's probably a pretty low number considering the sort of thing we're doing out here,"" he said. ""Everybody else here travelled a long way to come and experience it."" The festival took place at Belmont Station, about 10 kilometres north of Silverton, with early access to the site hampered by rainfall across the region. Mr Donovan said he would like to see improvements made to the Wilangee Road — the dirt road that heads out to the station — for future events. ""Once you leave the [bitumen] road, before you enter the property, there's kilometres of dirt road, which is state government road. So we'd like to work with them and see if they can put a bit of gravel on that,"" he said. ""To have a bit of rain and too much traffic, it can really go to hell quickly, so it's a bit of a risk for us."" The festival also saw a number of events take place to raise funds for the Royal Flying Doctor Service with about $130,000 raised altogether. One of those events, the Mundi Undi run, saw about 700 people strip down to their underwear and run a one-kilometre course to raise about $14,000 for the organisation. Annette Ohlsen, who works in community engagement for the Broken Hill RFDS, said the money would help staff continue delivering care to those who needed it. ""For the organisation that is crucial because we deliver vital services especially out of Broken Hill,"" she said. ""We've got 19 locations we service out of Broken Hill so that helps to provide a service to a little community that may not have that."" A world record attempt for the Largest Nutbush Dance also saw a further $40,000 raised for the RFDS during the festival alongside $75,000 in merchandise sales. Barrier Police District Crime Manager Inspector Tom Aylett said 99 per cent of festival-goers were well behaved. He said the only incident police dealt with was a group of eight campers who partied too hard on Wednesday night and did not heed the warnings of security. ""They were removed from the site the following day, so Thursday about midday,"" he said. ""The irony is the first actual performance commenced at one o'clock on Thursday and they were removed before the first performance. ""It was a costly lesson for them — I think in total they told us their site fees between the four sites cost $7,000.""

""There are some that are way too scared and not prepared to take that chance,"" said Lyndell Mann, who works at a holiday park in Kununurra. ""We've never had this level of concern. ""[They want to know] how safe will we be? How safe is it? Is our car going to be safe?"" Ms Mann said she had managed to discourage some travellers from cancelling plans by giving them information about safety measures to protect their belongings and avoid being targeted by offenders. ""We just have to say if you lock everything up and take that precaution you should be fine,"" she said. ""We can't guarantee it, but you've just got to be aware of where you are. ""It's a hard one this year. Every other year it's 'lock up, you'll be okay', but this year is that little bit worse."" Premier Mark McGowan wants his government to help break the cycle of crime and dysfunction in the Kimberley, but residents are in the dark about how. Derby caravan park manager Anne Thomas said about 5 per cent of bookings had been cancelled at the park due to concerns about safety. ""Five per cent is 5 per cent … in our busiest time of the year,"" she said. ""I ask [tourists] why they're cancelling and they say 'we've heard about the crime'. ""I try and give them the better side of Derby, the positives rather than the negatives, but at the end of the day I can't force them."" Tourism is a major economic driver for towns such as Derby, a small town about two hours north of Broome in WA's West Kimberley. Ms Thomas said local operators were concerned some tourists may opt to bypass the town before embarking on travels further north or south. ""We do hear quite frequently that people are just not coming into Derby because of the crime,"" she said. ""They'll just turn and go up the Gibb or go up the Great Northern Highway."" Wyndham-East Kimberley Shire president David Menzel agreed efforts to address the widely publicised challenge of youth crime in the region had thrown up challenges for the tourism sector. ""You can't be out there trying to highlight crime while trying to hide it at the same time,"" he said. ""Our community is facing some issues with a small cohort of our young people. ""But at the end of the day we're not dissimilar to most places in Australia, we're just focused on trying to resolve some of these issues."" The chief executive of marketing agency Australia's North West, Natasha Mahar, said the Kimberley was ""as safe as anywhere else in the world"" to visit. ""Crime happens no matter where you go. You could be in Rome … you could be in downtown Melbourne, you could be absolutely anywhere and be a victim of crime,"" she said. ""I would suggest that common sense prevail. Obviously lock up and don't leave anything lying around. ""It would be a real shame if people decided not to come for that reason because crime happens everywhere.""

110,Victoria's COVID rules have changed. Here's what you need to know,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Many of Victoria's remaining COVID-19 restrictions were scrapped from 11:59pm Friday, including mask rules in certain settings and isolation requirements for close contacts. Health Minister Martin Foley said the state was able to make the suite of changes because Victoria was ""one of the most vaccinated places in the world"", with more than two thirds of the eligible population now triple vaxxed. Victoria's seven-day case average is now less than 10,000. The state on Friday reported 9,439 cases and a further 16 deaths. Earlier this week, Mr Foley said the peak of the latest Omicron wave had passed. ""Only the most important of settings remain,"" he said. Here's your guide to what's changing across the state this weekend, and what isn't. One of the most significant changes is the scrapping of the requirement for close contacts of a positive case to isolate for seven days — a rule which has been in place since COVID-19 came to Australia. Close contacts are defined as those who have spent more than four hours in a home-like setting with a positive case. From this weekend, close contacts will need to test negative on RATs on five of the seven days that would have previously been the isolation period. After recovering, COVID cases won't have to undergo testing or quarantine again for 12 weeks — up from eight. They'll also need to wear masks indoors and avoid sensitive settings like hospitals and aged care facilities. As for mask mandates, they're set to go in schools, early childhood settings, hospitality, retail and at events. At hospitality venues, patrons won't need to show they have been vaccinated, and checking in via the Service Victoria app will become a thing of the past. Life will be a bit easier for travellers, with the removal of the requirement to get a PCR test or RAT upon arrival in the country. Unvaccinated arrivals will no longer need to complete seven days' quarantine, and unvaccinated air crew won't need to get tested before departure. In hospitals, visitor restrictions will be removed except for mask requirements, but health services will be able to set their own rules. Workplaces won't need to notify each potentially exposed worker if someone tests positive, but individuals will still need to notify their workplace and social contacts. Unsurprisingly, positive cases will still need to isolate for seven days after their diagnosis. Face masks must still be worn on public transport and in airports, and by workers in aged care and sensitive health and justice settings. Vaccine mandates will remain in place for workers in key industries, including education, healthcare, aged care, disability support, emergency services, food distribution, custodial services, and meat and seafood processing. However, Mr Foley said mandates would be reviewed in coming months. Victorian opposition leader Matthew Guy accused the government of ""playing politics"" with vaccine mandates. ""It's about moving beyond COVID, we've got to manage this and live with it sensibly,"" he said. ""The Victorian government's played politics with it from the start, and the fact they've got mandates for some areas and not for others to me tells you they'll keep playing politics with it for long as they can."" Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said despite the easing of restrictions, it was still important for the community to get vaccinated and take measures to protect themselves from COVID. ""As a community, we also need to remember those basic and simple behaviours that are part of our everyday life,"" he said. ""Wearing a mask indoors continues to be a protection, and staying up to date with your vaccine."" Premier Daniel Andrews flagged that he hoped Victoria's pandemic declaration would not need to be extended beyond its expiration date of July 12. ""I don't know what expert advice I'm going to get in the days leading up to the 12th of July,"" he said. ""It's my hope that we don't need that, or we see something less than that, or we need some other arrangement — that'd be terrific."" Victoria's pandemic bill, which passed the state parliament in December last year, superseded the state of emergency framework. It allows the Premier to declare a pandemic, activating the Health Minister's ability to bring in restrictions. Victoria is the only state in the country with such pandemic legislation.

111,"Spike in COVID cases in northern NSW following school holidays, festivals",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus There has been a surge in COVID-19 cases in northern New South Wales, despite numbers across the state trending down, as holiday makers and festival goers flock to the region. The local health district recorded monthly highs for two days in a row with 631 cases detected yesterday and 719 today. There has also been a near doubling of the number of people in hospital in the past week to a monthly high, although that figure has fluctuated throughout April. ""There has been a 50 per cent increase [in cases] in the last week on what we've been seeing on the previous fortnight [which] had been averaging 350-450 cases a day for the last two weeks,"" North Coast Public Health director Paul Douglas said. The region, which is currently in recovery mode after two devastating flood events, hosted more than 100,000 people at the Bluesfest in Byron Bay over the weekend. But authorities said the uptick was likely the result of broader travel to the area over the Easter break. ""We had more visitors, more travellers, more people vacating out here over the school holiday period,"" Mr Douglas said. ""We know where people are travelling that's where the disease will go as well."" Some areas in the region have lagged behind with uptake of the COVID vaccine, but Mr Douglas was comfortable with the current rates. ""We know in some areas of northern NSW there is some vaccine hesitancy, but I think the numbers are high enough now that we do have broad protection,"" he said. The health director said anyone who caught the virus while travelling in northern NSW could potentially take it back with them. ""Again, go get vaccinated and that will minimise any impacts,"" he said. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC North Coast's weekly email newsletter. The increase comes as NSW prepares to relax rules for close contacts from Friday. Mr Douglas said the move struck the right balance as the community learnt to ""live with COVID"". ""I don't think we'll ever get back to the settings we had two years ago because, from a public health perspective, we do need to protect the most vulnerable in the community,"" he said.

112,'This place is alive and thriving': Orca ecotype spotted off WA coast,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Orca ecotype spotted at Bremer Bay off WA coast for first time Marine experts have been left stunned after an ecotype of killer whale was spotted off Western Australia's south coast for the first time. The pod of about 120 orcas was seen swimming in the Bremer Bay canyon over the past few days. Marine biologist Pia Markovic said the pod was likely to be the type C or Ross Sea ecotype of orca from cooler waters on the eastern side of Antarctica. She said the whales were slightly greyer, smaller in size and sported a different eye patch to those typically seen in the area. Ms Markovic said the ecotype also had a different diet and only ate fish, unlike other orcas, which are known to also hunt whales. She was unsure why the whales had ventured to this part of the world. ""Animals don't really travel for any other reason apart from feeding or for mating,"" she said. ""They [could be] coming up to a warmer water to get rid of bacteria to keep them healthy. ""Just like a visit to the day spa."" Although this was the fist time they had been spotted, Ms Markovic said she had no doubt the pod had been in the area before. Aquatic filmmaker David Riggs said his crew chanced upon the visitors through ""sheer luck"". ""A huge rainstorm went through, we had zero visibility,"" he said. ""Just as it cleared, the skipper noticed a couple of blows. ""It's made us wonder, have we missed them by a whisker in past years?"" Mr Riggs said spotting the whales proved the ocean was healthy. ""This place is alive and thriving,"" he said. ""Sustaining two entirely different populations of killer whales over the course of the whole year — pretty much unheard of."" Mr Riggs said it had been a real journey discovering the Bremer Bay canyon over the years. ""To have this happen adds another layer of interest, it's really spectacular. ""It does make you wonder about the other secrets of the ocean."" ABC Great Southern will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

113,Are hikers being pushed to the limit on one of Australia's toughest trails? This expert thinks so,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  NT Parks defends campsite booking system criticised for pushing hikers to limit An author of the Larapinta Trail Guide has criticised a campsite booking system introduced by the NT Parks and Wildlife Commission in March for requiring hikers to make concrete plans. Emergency services attended four requests for assistance from hikers on the popular walking trail in less than three weeks, including one call for help when a 22-year-old man collapsed and died before paramedics could reach him. Experienced bushwalker and author John Chapman said the booking system caused some to push themselves to continue walking in difficult conditions. ""They just made a big mistake by making people book campsites each night,"" Mr Chapman said. He said the booking system should distinguish between hikers doing short trips, and people walking the full 230-kilometre length of the Larapinta Trail. ""The end-to-ends can take whatever time they need,"" he said. ""Sure, you’ll get the odd night the campsite will be crowded but overall, the numbers will work out. ""What will happen is … they’ll do a short day or two when it’s hot and then when the weather cools they might do a double day to catch up."" Devan Pillay, 58, had planned to spend nine days hiking on the Larapinta Trail when he visited Central Australia over the Easter long weekend. He set off from Standley Chasm on Saturday carrying at least five litres of water and a bag weighing more than 20 kilograms. But as temperatures reached about 36 degrees Celsius, Mr Pillay began to experience heat stress and activated the emergency beacon he was carrying. ""I knew that I was losing a lot of fluid because of the heat, so I started to pace myself … I was taking a lot of breaks,"" he said. ""Every time I took a break and sat down I was dozing off … that’s when I got a little bit scared. ""I continued drinking water but it didn’t seem to quench the thirst."" Four emergency services personnel reached Mr Pillay about 9.30pm and stayed with him overnight until a helicopter could airlift him out of the remote location early Sunday morning. Mr Pillay said he didn't know how to express his gratitude to his rescuers, and he didn't believe he would have survived another day if he continued on the trail. He said he did not blame the campsite booking system for his misadventure. District manager of Central Australian Parks, Phil Cowen, said hikers should not put themselves at risk to keep their campsite bookings. ""We absolutely don't want people feeling like they're in a position where they have to get to a particular campsite or have to start their hike if conditions are not good,"" he said. ""We do want people to understand that there is flexibility in the system. ""If you need to pull up and rest and have a break and wait for conditions to ease … we absolutely want people to make that decision. ""We can always sort out their booking retrospectively."" Mr Cowen encouraged users experiencing difficulty with the booking system to contact the NT Parks and Wildlife Commission.

114,'It's a beautiful way of seeing things': Walking the length of New Zealand on a mental and physical health pilgrimage,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Why an 'average bloke' from Wollongong is preparing to traverse New Zealand on foot Josh Storey is the kind of guy who, in a ""random moment"", decided to walk from Nowra to Wollongong on the New South Wales south coast. It was an 81-kilometre walk, but it planted the seed of achieving something much bigger. He then walked from Newcastle to Wollongong — a distance of 266 kilometres. Now he's looking beyond the horizon. At the end of this year he will take on the Te Araroa trail from the top to the bottom of New Zealand. ""For me, it's a good sense of understanding my brain better,"" he said. ""I love throwing myself into situations where I have to push myself and understand how my brain works. ""It's a better way to see the world as well because you get a better understanding of where you are and how far you're going. ""It's a beautiful way of seeing things."" For Mr Storey, long walks and long skates were a major part of his childhood. His mother did not drive and his father has Parkinson's disease, so he would have to find ways to get himself to school and his two jobs. Usually, that was by foot or by skateboard. ""I'm an independent person and from a young age I had to be independent,"" he said. ""I've always been the type to do everything myself and I didn't have the easiest childhood — I started working two jobs at 14, went to school and slept about four to six hours a day. ""I had to get myself from A to B and that could mean skating home at three or four in the morning, but I look back now and appreciate the time I had to myself and it helped me a lot for my future."" Mr Storey says the New Zealand walk, which he intends to do with almost no help,  will be about 3,000km long and take him about four months. Despite the enormous stamina required to traverse New Zealand, Mr Storey is keeping his preparation simple. He is working with a personal trainer to prepare his body for carrying considerable weight, but his training will not include any enormous walks. ""It's a lot of conditioning and getting my mind mentally ready,"" he said. ""I'm fortunate that now I'm very mentally strong, but it's about getting the body used to what it's about to encounter. ""I'm absolutely not walking in the lead-up to it. ""I'm an average bloke, but it's all mind over matter and I'll get there no matter what. ""Even if it takes me a bit longer, I'll be pushing every day."" Mr Storey will be raising money and awareness for Illawarra-based charity Talk To Me Bro. The mental health organisation runs an early intervention program to reduce the rates of male suicide, as well as weekly social meet-ups. ""When I was looking for a new charity, I definitely wanted to keep it on the mental health side of things,"" he said. ""I go pretty much every Friday for their morning session where we go for a swim, have an ice bath or go for a walk and have a coffee. ""If you have something to talk about you can, if you don't, it's perfectly alright because it's just a bunch of blokes hanging out and having a good time.""

116,Lord Howe Island's charms distilled in rare botanical brews,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Lord Howe Island brewers use rare botanicals to highlight island's charms Inspired by the pristine environment, rare wildlife and unique botanicals that make up Lord Howe Island, two locals have decided to create a brewing business to highlight the World Heritage site's special features. As a sixth-generation Lord Howe Islander, Anthony Riddle has a longstanding connection with the island. ""My family has been very much entrenched in the history and the tourism industry on the island for many years,"" he said. ""I was actually born in a hospital named after my great grandfather Gower Wilson who was lost at sea on his way to Lord Howe Island."" With a population of 400 residents and with only 400 tourists allowed at a time, Mr Riddle said the island was a unique place to grow up. ""Everyone walks around barefooted,"" he said. ""There are no snakes, there are no poisonous spiders. ""School children ride their bikes to school no issue at all and straight after school they can walk 50 metres across the road and be at the beach."" At age 11, Mr Riddle was sent to boarding school on the mainland, where he was exposed to the wider world. ""Going back to the island after eight years after school, I realised there were limited opportunities here for future youth coming through,"" he said. ""So, after much discussion, me and my childhood friend Christian Young decided to start a business together … to try to grow some awareness of the island."" The pair started their brewing and distilling business in 2019 but ran into challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We were hit with a few hurdles through COVID-19, but it also gave us some really good time to figure out how we wanted to approach this business,"" Mr Riddle said. The duo worked on ways to incorporate special features of the island into their beverages. ""We celebrate some of the endangered species that exist around the island, like our phasmid which is the world's rarest stick insect,"" he said. ""We've named our lager after the [Lord Howe] golden whistler bird and our sour is named after the red-tailed tropicbird, which has also got guava from my garden in it."" Mr Riddle said he collects botanicals from the island by hand before the distilling process. ""The early settlers planted these fruit trees on the island and they are in these old gardens now, so we go and collect them, cryovac them and add them to our very unique tasting gins,"" he said. ""We've worked out with the Lord Howe Island board what botanicals we can source without having an impact on the wider island, such as the wild lemons which we collect that date back to the 1820s."" The pair have also incorporated the history of the island on their packaging. ""On the back of each can and bottle that we produce it's got a unique story that links to the history of the island,"" Mr Riddle said. Mr Riddle said being an island-based business had its challenges. ""The island is very unique in the fact that it is a World Heritage site and it's also governed by a set of rules that were established around an act which was formed in 1853,"" he said. ""For example, all the business licences including the liquor licenses have to go through the Lord Howe Island board. ""We are establishing our distillery on the island through approvals through the Lord Howe Island board in the next 2–3 months."" There are also the physical implications of being based on an island. ""We're limited by things like trade, we have to ship things on and off the island,"" Mr Riddle said. ""We're also limited by the amount of botanical we can collect and almost all of our products are seasonal."" Mr Riddle said the island also has a unique recycling program, to reduce its residents' carbon footprint. ""It takes a while to understand how the island works but all [the rules] are worth it to keep it our paradise, and limiting our footprint is what we want to do with the business."" ""We just want to make something that tourists can take home with them and gives them a piece of the island.""

117,Business booming in Broken Hill ahead of Paul Kelly-headlined music festival,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tourists head way out west for Broken Hill’s Mundi Mundi Bash, featuring Paul Kelly Travellers from across the country continue to pour into Broken Hill and NSW's far west for the Mundi Mundi Bash music festival, with local businesses excited about the crowds. The inaugural three-day music festival gets underway just north of Silverton on Thursday, with more than 10,000 people expected to attend. Produced by the organisers of the annual Big Red Bash festival in Birdsville, in far western Queensland, the festival is set to be headlined by Paul Kelly and also features artists including John Williamson, Ian Moss, Russell Morris and Kate Ceberano. Broken Hill's Regional Events Centre operators said campers had been rolling into the city's racecourse since Saturday morning. The centre's chair Cheryl Krutli said 1,800 vehicles, or about 3,500 people, were expected to have visited the site by the time the Bash kicked off on Thursday. Two of those visitors are Warrnambool residents Linda and Phillip O'Neill, who travelled to the region as part of a group of 10. Mrs O'Neill said she was looking forward to catching some of the acts, as well as soaking up the atmosphere. ""I'm a bit of a Kate Ceberano fan, I like [Abba tribute band] Bjorn Again ... there are quite a few artists that I'm looking forward to,"" she said. ""We're from an ocean town so it was nice to come to the bush,"" she said. Adelaide resident Susan Wheaton said her sister Maxine Moutin had travelled all the way from Newcastle to pick her up and take her to the festival. ""I've just been looking after young boys for about seven or eight years now and my beautiful sister said, 'I'm taking you away, we're going to the Bash and then I'm taking you up to Darwin',"" she said. Ondine Freedman said it had taken her three days to get to the region from the Central Coast and she was looking forward to volunteering at the Bash. Want more local news? Sign up to the weekly ABC Broken Hill email newsletter She said a visit to the far west appealed for a variety of reasons. ""It's the combination of the uniqueness of the festival and being completely off-grid in the outback in an awesome environment and a beautiful part of the world."" Brisbane resident Kathy Parlane travelled out with her dog Charlie and said a combination of the music and the region drew her out to the far west. ""My girlfriend said to me as soon as I got the caravan, 'right, you're coming to the Bash?'"" Rosie Siemer, who owns Broken Hill clothing boutique Sitting Bull, said business had been booming over the Easter long weekend and in the lead-up to the festival. She said she had experienced pre-Christmas levels of trade over the past six days. ""I'm going into 19 years in retail in Argent Street alone and this is the most amazing weekend I've seen in Broken Hill,"" she said. ""There's a few trickling in from Mundi Mundi already but honestly I just feel we haven't seen the Mundi Mundi crowd yet and that's a little bit concerning but exciting. ""I think they're going to hit the town in droves over the next couple of days."" ABC Broken Hill will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Friday.

121,Three 'jam-packed' days of fun soften blow as Bendigo's Easter parade cancelled,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Bendigo Easter Fair parade rained out, but spirits high after days of fun The Gala Parade was cancelled on day four of the Bendigo Easter Fair, but the weather didn't dampen people's spirits. The parade, which usually sees thousands of people line the streets to watch Dai Gum Loong, could not go ahead due to rain. The Rotary Market in Rosalind Park was also cancelled on Easter Monday. One Bendigo family braved the rain to check out the carnival rides on Mundy Street. ""We planned to come down to give the kids some fun,"" Ryan said. ""Kids are happy — not often you win."" Ryan, his partner Isabel, and their children, Max and Stephanie, said they were disappointed to see the parade cancelled. ""We were going to watch it, but it's understandable with the weather,"" Ryan said. ""We're locals so can come next year."" Bendigo Easter Fair President Simon Mulqueen said he had been monitoring the weather forecast closely. ""If there was a chance it was going to clear, we perhaps would have looked at it differently,"" he said. ""It's dangerous — we have to think of the safety of the crowds, slippery roads. ""This is the one element of an outside festival that we can't control."" After the decision was made to cancel the Gala Parade, the Bendigo Chinese Association decided its dragon, Dai Gum Loong, should make a brief appearance outside the Golden Dragon Museum. Bendigo Chinese Association president Doug Lougoon said it was special to be able to include the dragon in the 150th fair. ""It was really well received,"" he said. ""There was a crowd of people outside the Golden Dragon Museum."" Dai Gum Loong, stayed under cover, with his head poking out of the Golden Dragon Museum. More than 60 carriers came to the museum, alongside lion dancers, for the impromptu performance. After debuting in the 2019 parade, the 125-metre -long Dai Gum Loong has remained in storage in the museum. The imperial dragon is made of delicate materials that would be ruined if they were exposed to rain. ""The scales have cardboard and paper backing, there's plenty of silk,"" Mr Lougoon said. ""It would have been a disaster."" Hundreds of volunteers and trained Chinese lion dancers come from across the state to participate in the parade, including Celia, Calista and Angus from the Chinese Youth Society in Melbourne. ""We're disappointed, but it’s good we got to do the Saturday performance,"" Celia said. ""We will still definitely come back next year."" Mr Mulqueen said the cancellation of the parade did not detract from a very successful and busy three days for the festival and Bendigo. ""Biggest crowds we've seen in years at an Easter fair,"" he said. “Every event that we organised was jam-packed with people, from Elvis in the park to the Sun Loong parade on Saturday, awakening of the dragon — all had huge crowds, crowds that haven’t been seen for years.” The parade has been held on Sunday in the past, but was moved to the Monday this year. Mr Mulqueen wants to see the Gala Parade remain on the fourth day. ""We'd like to see the four-day festival as a permanent fixture, because of the huge numbers we've had over these last three days,"" he said. ""The economic benefit is key.""

122,"Another 10,000 travel vouchers released for senior Victorians, but is the industry over COVID?",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Senior Victorians encouraged to travel as industry faces last hurdles to COVID recovery Tourism operators are reporting their busiest Easter weekend in three years as another round of travel vouchers are being offered to senior Victorians. A further 10,000 vouchers worth $200 each are being issued to senior travellers who spend at least $400 on accommodation, tours and experiences across the state. The Victorian government scheme aims to help the entertainment, dining, and travel industries recover from two years of COVID-19 lockdowns and border closures. The vouchers will be given to senior Victorians who applied for the last round of the scheme. Regional Development Minister Mary-Anne Thomas said there were more than 35,000 applications under the first round of the Seniors Travel Voucher scheme in March. ""I would recommend that any senior Victorian who made application through our ballot process for a travel voucher check their email today and see if they are indeed a recipient of these additional vouchers that have been made available,"" Ms Thomas said. The government said the Victorian and Seniors Travel Voucher Scheme had so far injected $159 million dollars into the state's economy. ""It's a really great time with school holidays upon us to take the opportunity perhaps to get out with grandchildren and spend some time with them and, importantly, take the opportunity to have a couple of nights away,"" Ms Thomas said. Victoria Tourism Industry chief executive Felicia Mariani said offering another round of vouchers to seniors would be particularly helpful as the industry entered the quieter, post-Easter period and headed into winter. ""These vouchers at this point in time are incredibly useful because they really do help to encourage visitation when the industry needs it the most,"" Ms Mariani said. While figures are yet to be official collated, Ms Mariani said Victorian tourism operators were reporting their busiest Easter since the pandemic began. ""Many of the regions that I've been talking to, our members have told us that they've had the best season this year that they'd had since 2019 and, in many cases, they are exceeding performance."" She attributed the recovery to Victorians wanting to travel ""in their own backyard"" and an influx of interstate visitors attracted by the return of major events. ""But everyone is a bit wary that we are heading into winter and we all know that winter is the hardest time when it comes to what we've experienced with COVID."" Ms Mariani said demand was not an issue for the industry now that there was no longer a threat of lockdowns or snap border closures. She said finding enough staff continued to be the main hurdle to recording a full recovery. ""We've seen that manifested over the last week with the scenes at both Sydney Airport and Melbourne Airport and this is a chronic problem across the whole country. This is not endemic to Victoria,"" she said. Ms Mariani called for the formation of an industry body involving operators who could work with state and federal governments on solutions. ""A lot of the issues to resolve this matter are not levers that the state government can pull,"" she said. ""They are levers relating to federal government ruling over immigration, over skilled migration visas, over international students, over backpackers and the numbers of those cohorts that are able to enter the country.""

125,"A 'little baby' the size of an elephant: Meet Ollie, Australia's smallest sauropod dinosaur",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Australia's smallest sauropod dinosaur confirmed from fossils found in outback Queensland Fossils unearthed in outback Queensland more than a decade ago have been officially identified as Australia's smallest sauropod. The juvenile Diamantinasaurus matildae, nicknamed ""Ollie"", is the third of its species to be discovered and roamed the earth some 95 million years ago. The rare discovery was made by a sheep grazier near Winton in western Queensland in 2012 and took researchers years to excavate and analyse. It is the first juvenile sauropod to ever be found in Australia. The plant-eating dinosaur is estimated to have measured about 11 metres in length and weighed 4.2 tonnes— roughly the size of an adult elephant — at the time of its death. ""So even though we're talking about a little baby, he's not actually that small,"" palaeontologist Samantha Rigby said. Adult sauropods measured between 20m to 30m in length. ""Some of the bones in his body weren't fused, so we know that [Ollie] was a juvenile,"" Ms Rigby said. Dozens of fossils were unearthed during the excavation process, including thoracic vertebrae, ribs, a scapula, a humerus, a thumb claw and a femur. Ms Rigby, who is the lead author of the research paper published last week and a masters student at Swinburne University, said the discovery would help researchers understand how the species grew. ""I spent a really long time comparing Ollie with all of the adult specimens here in Winton and we found that Ollie is not an exact copy of the adult,"" she said. ""The limb bones of this juvenile titanosaur grew at a more rapid rate than its back and shoulder bones. ""The bones are also narrower in width when compared with the robust limb bones of an adult Diamantinasaurus."" The discovery suggests that, like humans, baby sauropods would have changed as they grew older. ""Ollie's limbs were a lot more overgrown and as he grew up, he grew into his limbs,"" Ms Rigby said. ""He would have looked a bit weird with really long legs and a small body."" It is not clear how Ollie died, but researchers believe it is likely he became stuck in mud near a watering hole and sank. ""For us, it means that fossils below the surface are preserved quite well and in good condition,"" she said. Ms Rigby, from Brisbane, fell in love with dinosaurs when she travelled to Winton as a teenager. ""I visited the Australian Age of Dinosaurs museum when I was 16 as a birthday present from my grandma,"" she said. The trip sparked a lifelong ambition. ""I knew from then that this was the place for me, and that I was going to end up one day being a part of the team,"" she said. Over the past several years, Ms Rigby and a team of researchers at the Australian Age of Dinosaurs have scanned the ancient fossils to create 3D images. ""It's really important for us to be able to compare what we're finding here and see how that relates to other sauropod species around the world so we can understand how they evolved,"" Ms Rigby said. ""I'm really lucky that I was given the opportunity to study the first juvenile sauropod in Australia."" Ollie's bones are now part of the sauropod collection at the Australian Age of Dinosaurs in Winton. The centre's founder David Elliott is confident the discovery will draw in tourists from across the country — and even the world. Paleo-tourism is already booming across western Queensland and operators believe the lifting of state and international borders will lead to more crowds. ""Now that the borders aren't closed, I should expect the numbers will be just as good this year,"" Mr Elliott said. ""You never really know, but I'm optimistic that it will be a good year.""

128,Bumper Easter for Gold Coast as tourists choose glitter strip ahead of Sydney and Melbourne,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Bumper Easter for Gold Coast as tourists choose glitter strip ahead of Sydney and Melbourne Tourists have flocked to the Gold Coast for the Easter long weekend, with the city ranked the most popular destination for Australian travellers, according to a Tourism and Transport Forum (TTF) survey. TTF chief executive Margy Osmond said a survey of 1,000 people found almost 13 per cent of those planning a trip were opting for the Gold Coast, followed by Sydney and Melbourne. ""The Gold Coast has always been in everybody's top five,"" she said. ""It offers all of the bits and pieces that you would like in one package. ""You are getting the beach, you are getting the ability to go shopping, you're getting the theme parks."" Sirjana Sharma travelled to the Gold Coast with her family and friends from Sydney and said it was the theme parks that attracted them. ""It's the school holidays; of course we are going to come here,"" she said. ""We had so much fun in WhiteWater World and Movie World ... it has so much to offer for tourists. ""After nine years [away], so much has changed around the city."" Mick May drove from Mudgee in central west New South Wales with his wife and two children. He said they had been waiting for two years for the opportunity to travel. ""We were actually meant to go away on a cruise pre-lockdown and two days before we were due to leave everything got shut down,"" he said. ""We've been waiting to get away somewhere and we thought this was a good place to bring the kids."" Joe Breidi lives in Sydney and said he and his family wanted good weather after experiencing a wet start to 2022. ""It was a last-minute whim because our plans fell through in Sydney because of the weather,"" he said. ""We packed the car and the kids and we drove up and have been here for almost a week."" The couple said they did not have a problem finding accommodation but did notice a number of restaurants were short-staffed. ""You can see that all of the restaurants are still struggling but hopefully they get them back soon,"" Mr Breidi said. Lisa McLaren and her husband, David, travelled down the M1 from Brisbane and chose to stay in Broadbeach. ""We've been here on day trips but never actually stayed to explore,"" she said. ""We haven't had to use the car once; everything is in walking distance. ""The variety of all the restaurants, we've had a different meal every night and the beach is second to none."" Destination Gold Coast's head of stakeholders and strategy, Rachel Hancock, said most visitors had travelled from Sydney and Melbourne. ""It's been a long time coming for tourism operators across the coast,"" she said. ""They've hung on through the pandemic, and the last school holidays in December was really difficult with Omicron, but now we're coming through it. ""They deserve a really good Easter."" Ms Hancock said theme park upgrades and new food and beverage offerings had added an extra dimension to the city's tourist appeal. ""They've reinvented themselves really; it's a different Gold Coast to what it was two years ago. The TTF said almost one-third of those surveyed who were planning a holiday would spend between $500 and $1,000 on their break, while almost a quarter would spend between $1,000 and $2,000.

129,"Sydney Airport security guards offered $1,000 bonus over Easter school holiday break",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Sydney Airport security staff offered $1,000 work bonus as travellers continue to face long queues A decision to offer Sydney Airport security staff a $1,000 bonus to work every rostered shift during the Easter school holiday period has been criticised as ""unfair and reckless"". Passengers have been arriving early and traffic through bag drop and security has improved at the domestic terminal, with 79,000 people expected to transit through on Good Friday. Sydney Airport has blamed significant delays being experienced by travellers at the airport on staff shortages due to the coronavirus pandemic, with around 20 per cent of staff either on sick leave or having to isolate. Certis, the Singaporean-based company that is contracted to provide security guards for the airport, announced it would pay staff a $1,000 bonus if they work every rostered shift from April 14 to April 26. Damien Davie from the United Worker's Union, which represents airport security guards, said the $1,000 bonus was an ""unfair and reckless"" way of boosting staff numbers. ""If you don't turn up for one shift you lose the $1,000 bonus,"" he said. ""We're concerned it's putting pressure on people to come to work when they're sick, which may see an explosion in the spread of COVID-19. ""We think Certis and Sydney Airport should do the right thing and reward these workers for the hard work they've put in in these trying times and just pay everyone the $1,000 bonus, regardless of if they're at work or not."" Qantas and Jetstar have had to call in corporate staff to help baggage handlers at Australian airports, as worker shortages lead to massive delays and lost luggage. The airlines confirmed “a small number” of flights had left airports without baggage on board amid the chaos. “This baggage is being put on later flights and we are then couriering bags directly to customers,” a Qantas spokesperson said. Mr Davie said the cash bonus for security personnel was a band-aid solution to try and resolve staff shortages during the busy Easter period. ""What we're seeing at Sydney Airport is the result of low wages and lack of foresight,"" he said. ""Certis laid off over 200 workers during COVID and they've gone and got other jobs, and because it's a low-wage job, they simply haven't come back."" Certis's workforce is 30 per cent below its pre-COVID staffing levels and the company is trying to recruit 100 new security guards. In a statement, Sydney Airport said 50 new screening staff are currently undergoing accreditation but are not yet ready to start working. But Mr Davie said the company was struggling to find new recruits. ""Guards there are paid as little as $23 an hour, that simply doesn't compete in a tight labour market,"" he said. ""And when you overlay that with COVID problems, you're going to struggle to fill spots. ""Everybody should have seen this coming, Easter is always a busy period. Certis and the Airport should have been better prepared."" After days of long queues and delays, Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport was running more smoothly on the morning of Good Friday. One traveller told the ABC the queues were ""actually pretty good"" in comparison to the chaos faced by passengers earlier in the week. But there were still some small delays on planes leaving the airport. Qantas said up to 50 per cent of employees in some areas were unable to work due to COVID-19. The travel pressure over the busy Easter school holiday period has prompted calls for close contact rules to be scrapped for airport staff across the country. In Victoria, pilots, aircrew, baggage handlers and airport security staff are exempt from close contact rules and are legally allowed to work if a household contact has COVID-19. However, airlines can opt to be more conservative with their return-to-work rules. Nick McIntosh, the Assistant National Secretary of the Transport Workers' Union, said it had been a ""pretty terrible"" time for airport and airline workers. ""Unfortunately, this is largely due to a massive own-goal that Qantas have kicked by outsourcing 2,000 of the most experienced baggage handlers and replacing them with a casualised, low-paid workforce that definitely isn't experienced enough to keep up with this level of demand,"" he said. Mr McIntosh acknowledged problems caused by COVID-related staff shortages, but said things were made worse by the dismissal of those 2,000 workers. He said it was clear getting inexperienced staff to help with baggage would not be the fix, and pointed to planes landing without bags on board and passengers reporting their luggage had been lost entirely. ""It is a calamitous situation in baggage terminal around the country at the moment, there's no two ways about it,"" he said. Luggage delays have continued at the Perth Domestic Airport where Qantas staff are working to reunite customers with their baggage. Tens of thousands of people have flown into Perth for the long weekend to reunite with friends and family. Katelin McEwan flew into Western Australia on Wednesday evening for a friend's wedding on Saturday. ""It's stressful having no personal belongings and no-one can tell you where it is and when you're going to get it, so it's just a big relief to get it back,"" she said. ""Everyone at the airport has been really helpful but its been really hard to get anyone on the phone so I just kind of decided to come on down."" Matthew Magnay and Hayley Stather flew into Perth from Melbourne on Thursday morning. ""When we were in the air, the pilot said, 'Sorry, but your bags didn't make it on the plane,'"" Ms Stather said. With hundreds of bags lined up at the Qantas terminal, they were lucky enough to find theirs. Customers can visit the airport to collect their luggage or Qantas has offered to deliver it.

130,"Travellers whose European holiday was disrupted by 2013 floods win $20,000 in compensation",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Australian travellers whose European holiday was disrupted by floods win $20,000 in compensation A group of disappointed travellers, whose European River Cruise holidays were disrupted by major flooding in 2013, have been awarded more than $20,000 each in compensation by the New South Wales Supreme Court. The case involved claims from 13 identified cruises that travelled from Amsterdam to Budapest along the Rhine, Main and Danube Rivers, operated by Scenic Tours. The court found the company had not provided the ""once-in-a-lifetime cruise along the grand waterways of Europe"" where the travellers would be ""immersed in all-inclusive luxury"" with ""first-class service and intimate personal touches"" as advertised in their brochures. Instead, details of each cruise shows most days were spent on buses, and staying in hotels, leaving the travellers angry and frustrated after spending thousands for the luxury trip. The case is unusual because the damages were able to be awarded for disappointment and distress, after a High Court ruling in 2020. The court has awarded damages to 32 specific claimants who were represented in the case, including the man who led the class action, David Moore. Mr Moore chose the cruise partly because he had a physical disability that made sitting for extended periods difficult. He had not travelled extensively overseas before. The court found Mr Moore's experience was so bad he should get a full refund. Another man travelling with family said the cruise was a disaster. ""The only cruising that I experienced as per the itinerary was during the first four days,"" he said. ""The rest of the tour was like a disorganised and chaotic coach tour. ""I was disappointed by how much time we spent on buses. ""We spent more time on buses than on the ship, and certainly more time on buses than at our destinations,"" another of the travellers said. Another was a woman travelling with her mother and father who had mesothelioma. She told the court the first few days went well, but things quickly became difficult when the cruise was affected by the weather. ""Due to my father's deteriorating health, I thought that this cruise would probably be our last holiday together as a family before my father's passing,"" she told the court. ""I wanted him to experience the best holiday possible and I wanted to enjoy his company and make memories together whilst we could."" But the family found themselves travelling in buses to cities with very limited visiting time, and also swapped to a vessel of lesser quality. The court awarded three lots of damages for the loss of value in the trip and some got full airfares refunded. The lawyer who ran the case, Ben Hemsworth, hailed the award of damages as an important victory. ""Many passengers used their life savings to experience a five-star luxury cruise of a lifetime,"" Mr Hemsworth said. ""What they received from Scenic did not resemble what they paid for and the court has ordered Scenic to pay compensation in recognition of what the group members had to endure. ""The court … has made it clear that Scenic are responsible and will have to properly compensate all disappointed group members."" Mr Hemsworth says he hopes the ruling will be a blueprint for the remaining 1,200 members of the class action.

132,Beauty proves a curse as tourists flock to SA's 'hidden' beaches,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Pristine Eyre Peninsula beaches overrun with campers, with traffic set to increase at Easter Isolation has kept South Australia's Eyre Peninsula coastline in a pristine state, but its natural beauty is under threat as visitor numbers continue to increase. Greenly Beach and Perlubie Beach are two key areas without official camping grounds that are under pressure from tourists. As many as 100 caravans and campers have been seen on Perlubie Beach at a time, a dramatic increase on years past that worsened during the pandemic. ""Maybe there needs to be limits,"" Eyre Peninsula tour operator Craig Haslam said. ""Perlubie has been smashed – literally smashed – for a long time, and people are going there because it gives them that extra bit of freedom, rather than actually being in a camp ground, but we need to monitor it and we need to manage it."" The region faces the conundrum of needing visitors to help struggling businesses, but also the desire to preserve the area's unspoilt beauty. ""As we grow, that's our challenge — how do we continue to develop and grow the destination, but at the same time keeping the same values that are important to us as a region?"" Mr Haslam said. ""There are so many places along our coastlines that are beautiful spots. ""It's about how we make sure that they stay pristine and we look after them"" The Streaky Bay Council has raised similar concerns with the state government, which controls the beach, highlighting the inadequacy of the infrastructure. The council has been in talks with the state to try and arrange handover so it can take over the management of the site. Streaky Bay Mayor Travis Barber says the increase in visitors is welcome, but sustainability in the area is crucial. ""The growing population of the destination as a campsite is placing significant pressure on the beach and we're reaching a tipping point in terms of sustainability,"" he said. Peter Hanson has been visiting Perlubie for 20 years, and says the number of caravans on the beach has swelled to about 100 over Easter and Christmas over the years. He travels 1,200km from Donovan, near the Victorian border, to camp in the car park off Perlubie Beach for two months every year. ""When I first started coming here there was no-one on the beach, and then probably half a dozen up here,"" he said. ""Then over the years WikiCamps and all that spread the word."" He said it was a great place for families and that many camped along the beach as a stopover en route to Western Australia. Mr Hanson said most caravanners had little impact on the beach environment. ""There's one toilet, but 90 per cent of the campers have got their own toilet and showers and cassettes that collect their water, and they just take it into Streaky Bay to dump it."" Regional Development Australia (RDA) Eyre Peninsula tourism development manager Annabelle Hender said the volume of visitors was creating ""environmental pressure"". ""Just trampling, vehicles driving off-road — it can disrupt birdlife that nest on the beaches,"" she said. ""There's not necessarily one vehicle that causes the trouble, or one visitor, but it's an increased pressure when you have multiple or an increased number of tourists all using the one space."" Ms Hender said the RDA was working through the Eyes on Eyre program to increase infrastructure at camp sites. ""Perlubie is definitely on our list, as is Greenly Beach,"" Ms Hender said. Greenly Beach has no camping facilities, but plenty of tourists have been staying on the cliffs. ""We feel like we do have the solution — we have campgrounds like Sheringa and Walkers Rock that have been brought onto this online booking program,"" Ms Hender said. ""That is a way we can manage capacity at those sites. ""We know we have this model that we have trialled and tested in Elliston that is ready to be implemented in Perlubie and Greenly Beach, in cooperation with the council. ""It's just working through those land issues to ensure the councils have the ability to implement these programs at the sites.""

133,Easter fish orders down but South Coast traders hoping for net gains from holiday tourists,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Towns along the New South Wales' South Coast are holding their breath to see whether the Easter weekend signals a return to normal trade after a biblical few years of natural disasters and the pandemic. But while some businesses are already booked out, others say they are concerned high fuel prices, COVID infections and the soggy weather will keep travellers away. The Innes Family Boatshed on the main street of Batemans Bay sells fresh fish and takeaway food. Owner Tracey Innes said the Easter weekend was typically the busiest time of the year, and while they were hopeful it would pick up soon, so far trade had not bounced back to pre-pandemic levels. ""We are certainly quieter at this point than we would normally expect to be,"" she said. ""We'd normally have 150 [fresh fish] orders for Good Friday, and at this stage I think I've got about 25."" She fears the poor weather and high fuel prices are a likely deterrent for travellers from Sydney or Canberra. The family business lost hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of trade during the Black Summer fires in 2019–20. They were then hit by the pandemic, and more recently, flooding along the Clyde River. It's a similar story up the road at the Nelligen Caravan Park, a few kilometres out of Batemans Bay. Manager Tod Sutherland said while there had been some demand, there had also been a number of cancellations due to COVID infections and isolation, and some sites couldn't be used because they were still too wet. ""We've had to cancel about 30 sites,"" he said. ""It's not as busy as it should be. ""It's not only just us, it impacts the surrounding businesses as well."" Nearly 200 kilometres south, the town of Eden has hopes for a sold-out show. The town has missed out on its fair share of peak tourist seasons since the summer of 2019, due to bushfires and pandemic-irelated restrictions. But this Easter was expected to be one of the best on record, according to Garden of Eden caravan park manager Lyn Carlson. ""For the whole four days, we're completely booked,"" she said. ""But everyone is coming for a longer time … they're spreading it out over the two weeks of the school holidays."" Ms Carlson said while COVID-related cancellations continue to trickle in, most vacancies are scooped up. While there is also potential for her to take bookings for 18 additional camp sites on an overflow property adjacent to the park, the recent wet weather has made the land too boggy for guests. Regardless, there is hope this season will be a significant boost for the area. ""We've been here for six years and this will be the best Easter ever,"" Ms Carlson said. ""It just gives you a bit of hope that things are nearly back to normal.""

134,Spreading its wings: Newcastle Airport secures $55m upgrade in bid to become 'international hub',travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Newcastle Airport set to take more international flights after election funding boost Both major parties have committed to upgrade Newcastle Airport to allow for more international flights. Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce was in the seat of Paterson to announce $55 million in funding to upgrade the terminal. Also campaigning in the Hunter, Labor leader Anthony Albanese was quick to say his party would match the funding if they won next month's election. The airport has previously hosted flights to New Zealand on a seasonal basis, but the terminal upgrade would allow the airport to process larger, long-haul aircraft. Newcastle Airport chief executive Peter Cock said a terminal upgrade was the final piece of the puzzle for the region on its path towards global connectivity. ""This upgrade is essential to process the long-haul aircraft, which can carry close to 400 passengers,"" he said. ""This is an entirely different scale to our domestic fleet, which is closer to 180 passengers."" Mr Cock said the terminal upgrade would benefit more than only people wanting to travel overseas. ""It will drive huge, sustainable economic benefits throughout the region through inbound tourism, and freight-related industries, including import and export,"" he said. The airport has forecast that the upgrade will bring 850,000 additional visitors, 4,410 jobs and $12.7 billion in economic activity for the Hunter and Northern NSW across the next 20 years. Last year the federal government committed $66 million to upgrade the runway to international standards, so it could cater to daily international and domestic flights. That work is expected to begin next year. Newcastle travel agent Julia van Huisstede also welcomed the new funding announcement. ""Newcastle and Hunter people are well known as some of the highest per capita travellers anywhere in Australia,"" she said. ""We all travel a lot to Sydney to get on planes ... for people of the Newcastle and Greater Sydney region it's going to be wonderful as another option to get overseas."" Mr Albanese has visited Cessnock, in the seat of Hunter, to announce Cessnock Hospital will be the first location in Labor's $135 million four-year trial of 50 Medicare Urgent Care Clinics across the country. The bulk-billed after-hours clinics are designed to take the pressure off local hospitals and emergency departments. The seats of Hunter and Paterson are currently held by Labor, but are considered winnable seats for both major parties. Hunter has a margin of 3 per cent and Paterson 5 per cent.

135,'Looking positive': Yacht race bring tourism boost after pandemic downturn,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race set to boost tourism in regional city after COVID-19 downturn Peter Harburg was just six years old when he got his first taste of the Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race. ""I saw the very first one in 1948. My father took me down for the start of it,"" he said. ""I was very intrigued by these giant yachts, which are probably a third of the length of [the boats] today. ""They looked big to me as a six-year-old, and I've sort of been interested in sailing ever since."" The owner of yacht Black Jack is no stranger to Queensland's flagship race, with his team, led by skipper Mark Bradford, winning with the current yacht and its previous iterations eight times. It is also the current race record holder, completing the race in 16 hours, 53 minutes and 57 seconds in 2018. Last year, Black Jack made history by being the first Queensland boat to take line honours in the Sydney to Hobart race. ""The Brisbane to Gladstone race is one of the most important on the Australian calendar,"" Mr Harburg said. ""It's our big Queensland race, and it attracts a lot of good boats. ""We're looking forward to it."" The race sets sail in Moreton Bay, near Shorncliffe, on Good Friday at 11am before concluding in the early hours of Saturday morning near Gladstone. Queensland Cruising Yacht Club vice commodore Harley Cowlishaw said there were 38 yachts taking part in this year's race. ""We've also got the two handicap winners of the Sydney to Hobart in the fleet, which is Alive and Ichi Ban, so it is a very high-quality fleet in this year's race,"" Mr Cowlishaw said. ""The forecast is 15 to 20 knots from the south-east, which should give everyone a very quick ride to Gladstone."" Mr Cowlishaw said they had not been able to hold a proper race for the past two years due to COVID. ""We had one year where the race was totally cancelled, and last year there wasn't allowed to be too many celebrations,"" he said. ""This year, it's full steam ahead."" There will be almost a dozen major events happening in Gladstone across the Easter long weekend in celebration of the race, including special lunches, food festivals, music festivals and parties. Gladstone Area Promotion and Development tourism manager Nicola Scurr said forward bookings for accommodation in Gladstone were higher than they had been in years. ""The last few years have definitely been challenging, especially at Easter, given it is one of the biggest times in the region,"" she said. ""Talking to operators and looking at their bookings, they're saying leisure traveller [numbers] have gone up over this period. ""I'm really excited to see the actual outcomes of that post-Easter."" The tourism boom isn't just being felt in the city itself, with the southern parts of the region, including the towns of Agnes Water and 1770, also experiencing a growth in numbers. Janina Speck owns and operates 1770 Liquid Adventures. He said while it had been a slow start to the school holidays, the forward bookings had picked up for the long weekend, as well as the Anzac Day and Labour Day weekends. ""We did have some rather rough weather last week, but it's looking all good now for the Easter weekend,"" she said. ""The town will be full up."" Ms Speck said overall, the mood in the tourism industry locally was one of optimism. ""There's a lot happening. A lot of businesses have started up in the last 12 months,"" she said. ""There's a bit of fresh energy as well."" Chris De Aboitiz runs a stand-up paddleboard hire company alongside his trusty dog, Rama. He said accommodation providers in the region were starting to reach capacity. ""It's great to see the crew coming back out to have a holiday, and it's all sorts of demographics,"" Mr De Aboitiz said. ""We are noticing there aren't so many international people."" At the nearby 1770 Camping Ground, caravaner Mike Kelly from the Sunshine Coast said high fuel prices would not interrupt his trip. ""We've been coming here for 30-odd years to the same caravan park every Easter,"" he said. ""The fuel prices, they give you a bit of a fright, but you just grin and bear it."" Noni North lives in Gladstone but made the trip to 1770 via Tenterfield. ""It was a more expensive trip,"" she said. ""The high fuel prices don't change our mind [on travel], as it's coming down already. ""We'll just keep going, keep travelling.""

136,"Night curfew, dog supervision rules as Busselton cracks down on holiday 'party houses'",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Strict new holiday home regulations announced for Busselton, Dunsborough and Yallingup Tourist hotspot Busselton is set to adopt the strictest holiday home laws in the state, including a limit on the number of guests past 10pm in a ""party house"" crackdown. The first stage of the regulatory changes also mandates that owners display a sign with the manager's contact details visible from the street. People renting short-term accommodation will also be forbidden from leaving their dogs unattended at the property at any time. The changes are due to come into effect in September and also include: Mayor Grant Henley said the current regulatory framework did not address community concerns over short-term rentals. ""There are concerns that there is a proliferation of holiday homes into traditional residential areas,"" he said. ""There are also some anti-social or social amenity issues with people in holiday homes, such as partying on weeknights."" But in an interview with ABC Perth's Nadia Mitsopoulos, Mr Henley appeared to soften his stance. ""We're not going to be standing outside counting people,"" he said. ""These are to deal with disorderly conduct and where we are able to then take some action against the holiday home owners, and there is recourse for neighbours who are impinged upon."" Susan Wheeldon, Airbnb country manager for Australia and New Zealand, said the regulations would make short-term letting more burdensome. “The proposed regulations will make hosts who share their homes worse off, make family holidays more expensive, and cost jobs,"" she said. Stayz corporate affairs director Eacham Curry said the changes would threaten Busselton's tourism industry. ""What it's going to do is make people think twice about letting a property and that takes away from the value that short-term letting brings to local communities,"" he said. ""It doesn't meet a community sniff test. If people are allowed to keep their dogs at home when they go out while long-term renting — why should it be any different for short-term?"" John Ryall owns Exclusive Escapes Dunsborough, which manages about 100 properties in the City of Busselton, and said the changes would level the playing field. ""It's great to see that they've put forward these proposals where everybody needs to act and behave in the same manner,"" he said. ""We're very happy with the changes. From a professional short-stay accommodation property management business these all make good sense to us."" The City of Busselton has been cracking down on unregistered holiday homes in recent years. Council has even devoted a part-time role to solely focusing on tracking down unauthorised short-term stays in the region. The changes come as the state government reviews more than 2,000 submissions from a public consultation about statewide short-term rental regulations. Mr Curry said Busselton should have waited until the government announced new laws to avoid a patchwork system. ""We would call on all stakeholders, including local government, to actually let that process play out before unilaterally jumping the gun,"" he said. But Mr Henley accused the state government of dragging its heels in finalising the laws. ""I think 2017 was a parliamentary inquiry — so we've been waiting for a long time,"" he said. ""We were required to do a review of our local law which we undertook and at the same time, we've looked at our other regulatory framework and we've spoken to our community.""

137,'Another tough day': Queues out the door at Sydney Airport ahead of Easter long weekend,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Queues were out of the door at Sydney Airport on Thursday morning as travellers and staff battled the busiest day at the terminals since the pandemic struck. Passengers were queuing for hours since the airport opened at 4am, with the domestic terminals expected to see 82,000 people over the day. The last time there were more than 80,000 travellers at Sydney Airport in one day was March 6, 2020. The airport's CEO apologised to travellers but stressed ""every lever available"" was being pulled to improve the situation, including senior executives being deployed to manage queues. Delays eased in the afternoon but dozens more flights were scheduled to depart into the evening. Speaking on the campaign trail, Prime Minister Scott Morrison acknowledged the ""frustrating"" delays but implored people to trust that the airlines were doing all they could to keep up. ""This is what returning to normal looks like,"" he told the media while campaigning in Tasmania. ""As the country comes up again … our tourism and travel industry [will face] some congestion issues along the way, there's going to be some setbacks as the staff come back in and the systems build up again. ""I just ask people to show some patience."" However former Qantas staff and the Transport Workers Union (TWU) say airlines failed to plan for Easter and are calling for an independent body to oversee aviation operations. Former Qantas senior airline operator Don Dickson, who worked for the company for 20 years, said he had never seen anything like today's chaos. ""It is a sad day to see this happening ... there is absolutely no leadership here at all."" Former Qantas baggage handler Graham McKay said the thousands of staff who were made redundant during the pandemic should be re-employed to alleviate the pressure. ""We'd love to work and we want to clear this backlog ... we had days where we were short-staffed, but we worked around it because of our experience,"" he said. In 2021 Qantas outsourced more than 2,000 ground crew jobs, mostly to Swissport, which the Federal Court later ruled was a breach of the Fair Work Act. The TWU's national secretary, Michael Kaine, said this meant thousands of skilled workers were ""sitting at home"" during this chaotic period. ""They are ready willing and able to work. They could be helping ease this congestion,"" he said. Mr Kaine said it was his understanding that none of the 2,000 staff made redundant had been able to secure work with Swissport. A forecast of daily passenger numbers released by Sydney Airport shows another 79,000 people are anticipated to pack the domestic terminal tomorrow. Numbers could drop to 55,000 and 62,000 on Saturday and Sunday respectively, before spiking to 72,000 on Monday. Airlines have blamed COVID-19 for a shortage of security personnel, ground handlers and other staff, with 20 per cent of daily absences due to either COVID infections or close contact rules. The NSW government recently added air transport services to the list of critical jobs exempt from COVID-19 close contact isolation rules. Earlier this week, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said inexperienced travellers were also contributing to delays as they were unfamiliar with security protocols. ""Passengers are rusty in travelling,"" he told the ABC. But Mr McKay said it has ""nothing to do with uneducated travellers"" and comes down to minimal, inexperienced staff. Sydney Airport chief executive Geoff Culbert said rebuilding the workforce to pre-pandemic levels would take time, a problem exacerbated by a tight jobs market. ""The roles that are being recruited are skilled, specialist roles and we won't compromise on safety and security,"" Mr Culbert said. Mr Culbert said people should arrive at Sydney Airport at least two hours before any domestic flights over Easter.

138,World's best daredevil pilots to strap in for Air Race Series over Lake Macquarie,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  International Air Race Series to be held above Lake Macquarie in coup for regional NSW Matt Hall has lived the high life, literally. The former fighter pilot has travelled the world competing in the world's fastest motorsport: the white-knuckle pursuit of air racing. The reigning air race champion is flying extra high as come November, he is set to compete in front of a home crowd. ""It's going to be fantastic competing in front of a home crowd because you know everyone there is cheering you on,"" Hall said. ""I hope I don't get knocked out in the first round."" The International Air Race Series is the former Red Bull series that finished up in 2019. In the air race, pilots compete in a sprint competition to gain the fastest times as they navigate through a series of air gates. Lake Macquarie, two hours north of Sydney in New South Wales, is just one of four locations on the International Air Race Series circuit and the only one in Australia. The last time the event was held in Australia was 2010 in Perth above the Swan River. ""Everyone says we should run it on Sydney Harbour and under the bridge, but as a working harbour you have to close down sections, so logistically it's pretty hard,"" Hall said. ""I've always had this vision that nothing would ever beat Lake Macquarie as an air race venue."" Hall flew F/A-18, a type of twin-engine fighter aircraft, for a career until he took up the sport of air racing. He is quick to point out that the high octane, twisting and turning required in air racing is more physically demanding than piloting an F/A-18. ""We're going up to 12G (a measurement of acceleration) in these aircraft,"" Hall said. ""I flew fighter jets for a career and they're 7.5G, so the forces on the body while racing are pretty radical."" The International Air Race Series hasn't been held since the onset of the COVID pandemic. Organisers predict a crowd of up to 100,000 will line the shores of Lake Macquarie for the spectacular, along with a global audience in the millions. Phil Stoddart, managing director Air Race Australia and New Zealand, believes Lake Macquarie's proximity to Sydney makes for a perfect location. ""Matt and his team have been banging the drum about Lake Macquarie for a number of years now,"" Mr Stoddart said. ""Lake Macquarie fits like a glove really."" The International Air Race Series will be held from November 18–20. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Newcastle's weekly email newsletter.

140,"'Second-chance sunflowers' bloom in time for Easter, raising funds for Ukraine",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Quirindi's 'second-chance-sunflowers' bloom in time for Easter, as a gift to Ukraine When Quirindi farmer Ian Carter's sunflower crop was a washout earlier this year, he never expected a unique second planting would bloom into a towering success. But just five minutes down the road from Quirindi's main street, drivers are greeted by a flash of brilliant yellow on the Liverpool Plains horizon — three months later than usual. ""In a normal year, we plant a small patch for tourism purposes along the road,"" Mr Carter said. ""But this year, we were rained out. Completely drowned."" Along with the sunflowers, the mixed-crop farmer's 81-hectare block was flooded twice — in November and in January. By the time the field had dried out, Mr Carter said it was too late to plant sorghum, which should have continued the winter crop rotation. ""The only option left was to plant sunflowers again,"" he said. ""We thought better to have a crop than to plant nothing at all,"" he said. It will be the first sunflower crop on the Liverpool Plains to be planted twice. An honesty box set up in front of Mr Carter's crop usually raises money that goes towards agricultural lessons for local children in the Liverpool Plains. But this year's second crop aims to provide a broader helping hand, with money raised to be sent to war-torn Ukraine through the ABC Gives Appeal. As the sunflower is the national floral emblem of Ukraine, Mr Carter said he hoped his crop would provide a potent symbol of reflection for visitors. ""I thought, here's a good news story. We can donate some money to the poor people who are struggling over there,"" he said. ""It can help give some joy that we are producing over here."" Previous sunflower blooms have attracted more than 4,000 snap-happy visitors to the region. Quirindi Chamber of Commerce president Sally Alden said agritourism was a major lifeline for businesses in town. ""Considering Quirindi's population is 8,000 that's quite a significant impact,"" Ms Alden said. ""More than half of our town's population travelled through here in three weeks. That goes into the cafes, the galleries, the businesses. ""Ian probably doesn't think this because it would have cost him a lot to replant, but it's actually a secret bonus for the community to have a second boost."" The majority of tourists have been social media influencers looking for the perfect backdrop. But visitors to the fields have ranged from locals to wedding reception guests. Ms Alden, who is also a keen photographer, said it was no secret why so many people were attracted to the flowers. ""I think they just represent happiness. You can't stand in a sunflower field and not smile,"" she said. ""After the years of drought and COVID, people need joy. And the sunflowers are absolutely capturing that."" Once Mr Carter's 81-hectare crop has seeded in a few weeks' time, it will go to stock feed. But, having seen the success of this second blooming, he said he was now contemplating two plantings every year. ""Perhaps Easter time is a better way to do it. Not sure. It's just a happy accident really,"" he said.

141,"One dead, groups rescued as heat takes toll on hikers tackling NT's rugged Larapinta Trail ",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Larapinta Trail warning after hiker, 22, dies and paramedics rescue groups in crippling heat Authorities have warned hikers to be prepared for hot weather in Central Australia after a 22-year-old man died and two different groups of people required assistance for heat stress within a week. The man collapsed last Wednesday on the Larapinta Trail between Standley Chasm and Simpsons Gap. His friends attempted CPR before another group of hikers arrived with a satellite phone and called emergency services. A helicopter was sent to the area but the man died at the scene. Last Thursday, St John Ambulance paramedics assisted a group of walkers on the trail near Euro Ridge who were suffering from dehydration. On Monday, four students from a large school group received assistance on the Larapinta Trail near Simpsons Gap due to dehydration and heat-related illness. ""I think the weather has really impacted people,"" St John Ambulance NT operations manager Craig Garraway said. The Bureau of Meteorology recorded a maximum of 33.2 degrees Celsius at Alice Springs Airport on Wednesday last week, while Thursday it reached just over 30C. Temperatures rose again on Monday to nearly 36C. Mr Garraway said people using the trails should carry a minimum of three litres of water and walk early in the morning when the temperature was cooler. A 230km path carved out of the landscape with the help of prison labour, this journey through the heart of the continent is attracting visitors in record numbers. ""Communication is really, really important,"" he said. ""Make sure that you've got a [satellite] phone and that you're able to contact someone. ""Let someone know where you're going to be and when you should be out."" Mr Garraway said it had been a busier-than-usual start to the tourist season in Central Australia and asked holiday-makers to be careful when driving long distances. ""A lot of people are going to be on the road driving long distances … we want to keep that road toll to zero moving forward,"" Mr Garraway said. ""Please be careful.

143,Mass fish-kill event strikes popular tourist beaches on Ningaloo Coast ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Mass fish kill hits popular Coral Bay beaches on WA's Ningaloo Coast As holiday makers enjoy the crystal blue water at Bill's Bay, in the WA tourist town of Coral Bay, fish skeletons lie scattered among the seaweed. It's a stark reminder of Western Australia's largest fish-kill event in more than a decade and the epic effort locals made to save the beach before the peak tourist season began. On March 27, the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD), launched an investigation into the fish kill after an estimated 16,000 dead fish were counted along affected beaches on the Ningaloo Coast, including Turquoise Bay, Bill's Bay and Yardie Creek. Bill's Bay, Coral Bay's most popular swimming beach, was the most severely impacted. During this time, DPIRD warned people not the enter into or fish from the putrid water, which contained high levels of bacteria. The analysis of water samples from Bill's Bay indicated no harmful algae were present, DPIRD said, but ammonia, nitrates and phosphates were detected, likely the result of decaying coral spawn and fish. Marion Massam, from DPIRD, said the department believed the mass fish-kill event was caused by coral spawning. ""Coral spawn itself can use up oxygen in the water and when it breaks down, more oxygen is used up as part of the breakdown process,"" Ms Massam said. ""That reduces oxygen in the water for the fish. They can end up dying as a result."" Coral spawning is an annual event, which typically occurs following the March full moon, after corals are stimulated by the seasonal rise in water temperatures. DPIRD said another factor which could have contributed was local marine heatwave conditions that occurred along the Ningaloo coastline in late March. The department said the coral-spawn slicks could drift towards the shore and when trapped close to the coast, could create low oxygen conditions made worse by a low tide and swell. The Ningaloo Coast is no stranger to fish-kill events. Authorities said the last fish kill of this magnitude was 12 years ago. If you're travelling to Coral Bay these Easter school holidays, you can thank John Farne for the improved state of the beaches. With a couple of trucks, a bobcat and a loader, John, his mates and the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) took to the beach to clean up the dead fish, which were taken to the local tip. ""It was as bad as it gets and every year the coral spawns and you walk out and you go — sniff — 'Oh the coral is spawning' and that's the end of it. There's very little. But this year was the exception,"" he said. ""But as locals, we want to have it clean. We can't do much about the water but that's now freshened up. It's lovely out there so Easter school holidays, we're good to go."" On April 8, DPIRD removed the fish-kill alert for Turquoise Bay, Yardie Creek, Point Billie and Jane's Bay. Sallyann Gudge, from the DBCA, said a survey of dead fish showed they were all reef-associated species and the ecosystem should recover soon. ""Fingers crossed that all those things fall into place and those fish numbers can come back. A lot of those fish species do recruit pretty quickly,"" Ms Gudge said. Authorities say they will continue to keep a close eye on the Ningaloo Coast and the fish population. DPIRD has reminded visitors to exercise caution in the area and not to enter or fish from any water that appears smelly and putrid, as it could contain high levels of bacteria. They urge people to report any further fish kills to Fishwatch at fish.wa.gov.au or on 1800 815 507.

144,'Why not now?' The families swapping suburbia to live on sailing boats,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Meet the sailing families who swapped suburbia for quality time and adventure Six years ago, Sheree Willems, her husband Paul and three of their children, embarked on the journey of a lifetime. They left their nine-to-five jobs, sold their belongings and joined a growing ""cruising families"" movement who have swapped suburbia for sailing the high seas. Before selling their suburban house in Perth, the family learnt to sail and bought their boat, Solur, outright. They've been cruising the Western Australian coastline completely off the grid ever since. ""We had a typical mortgage, two cars and were very busy with activities and work,"" Ms Willems said. ""We didn't have time to spend with the kids. We didn't have time to take a holiday together. ""We had our own little home and all of this stuff in it — but we were never actually there to enjoy it. We were always working."" The couple had always loved the ""concept"" of sailing but never thought of making their dream of living on a sailing boat a reality until retirement. ""Then there came that moment where we just thought, 'well, why not now?',"" the mother of five said. ""Why do we have to wait until the kids are grown up? Why do we have to wait till we retire? ""The process to get here has taken almost seven years between planning and buying a boat, and then moving on board."" Ms Willems started the journey as a sailing novice by trying the sport for the first time at age 30. ""We decided that we'd take some sailing lessons and then the hunt started for a boat,"" she said. ""We asked a lot of cruisers who were currently sailing with kids what we needed in a boat because we had no idea. ""Every year, we'd push ourselves to sail a little bit further and a little bit wider and take a little bit more time off work, until we got to the point where we felt that we could sail indefinitely."" An international online community of about 7,000 sailing families have proved invaluable for the family. ""We're all on a map so we can see where each other are,"" Ms Willems said. ""We also have an Australian sailing group, which has about 700 families, we have the option to have a shared map and check-in points so we can connect in different ports. ""Often, since we're moving with the weather, groups of boats will move together."" Ms Willems, a bookkeeper, and her husband Paul, a software developer, are able to work from the boat. ""The cost of living is so low, the only income we needed is for food, boat insurance, fuel, and just basic costs. ""We use solar power to run all of our computers to do our work [from the boat]."" After a separation eight months ago, single father James Brougham has also been bitten by the sailing bug and lives aboard his boat dubbed Salty Jocks with his two young daughters. ""With the rental market the way it is in Perth, it's pretty hard,"" Mr Brougham said. ""It was going to be tough, moving into suburbia and I'd thought about this [sailing] when I was younger, but I ended up just biting the bullet and doing it. ""I thought I'm going to bloody learn how to sail and we're going to go on adventures. ""My daughter Isla was about 11 months old when we moved onto the boat. She learnt to walk on the boat."" Mr Brougham, who is preparing to set off to the Abrolhos Islands in a convoy, said life onboard with two young children had been a ""steep learning curve"". ""I did a few night sails because it was easier to sail when the girls were asleep,"" he said. ""I've learnt about solar, maintaining, weatherproofing, and restoring the boat. ""We've spent quite a bit of time sailing out to Garden Island and Carnac Island and [taken] photos of the girls with seals [and done] a fair bit of fishing. ""We spend quite a bit of time just out on the water and it's just us and it's been really nice. ""Most dads don't get to spend so much of the younger years with their kids. ""I really wanted this, and I didn't care if it was going to be hard."" While life onboard with three children could get a bit cramped, Ms Willems said she often sent the kids ""out in the dinghy"" when they got on each other's nerves. ""My kids have had to learn to play like we did in our childhood,"" she said. ""They may not have access to technology or [the] internet all the time. ""They have to learn to entertain themselves when they're bored."" Ms Williems homeschools the children through the School of Isolated and Distance Education (SIDE). ""I'm still learning how to navigate different aged kids doing different things,"" she said. ""But instead of learning about history from a book, we can learn about history as we walk the land, and we can actually see and touch things; it just makes the process of learning more organic."" Ms Willems' 17-year-old daughter Chanelle recently finished her year 12 studies onboard and will take time off the boat to study at Murdoch University. Two other older children have lived on and off the boat over the past six years. Ms Willems said the family had shared some ""incredible"" experiences. ""We were getting in the dinghy to go and get some groceries and we had a whole pod of dolphins around us and they were so curious and playful,"" she said. ""And that's just an experience you couldn't pay for it. It's just part of boat life. It's amazing. ""We've had everything from incredible sunsets to insane storms."" She said the family would call the boat home for the next 15 to 20 years. They are getting ready for a sail to Exmouth and then onto Indonesia. ""I can't see us coming back to typical nine-to-five routines until our health demands [that],"" she said. ""We will stay out here as long as we are enjoying it.""

145,"Adorable baby goat 'Doug, the little thug' joins rescuers on epic WA road trip",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Baby goat 'Doug' goes on epic WA road trip after his rescue by four good Samaritans When George Hornidge embarked on a road trip to the Kimberley with three of his closest mates, he never imagined they would be picking up an extra passenger. Doug the baby goat has been turning heads along the Great Northern Highway on his way to Broome this week with Mr Hornidge and friends Dillon Paulik, Luke Hornidge, and Mitchell Fitzpatrick. The kid was picked up by the group of friends after they heard its desperate calls. ""We were about an hour north of Kalbarri, and I heard him crying from a bush,"" Mr Hornidge said. ""It was just after a storm; I don't know if he got separated during that."" The group hurried the baby goat to the local vet. ""He was a bit weak at the start, so the Karratha vets gave him a vitamin shot … he was pretty skinny and the vet said he wouldn't have lasted much longer,"" Mr Hornidge said. Without any clue where the kid had come from, the men decided to adopt him and bring him along for the journey. They gave him a name and popped him on a dog bed on the back seat of the car. ""He just looks like a Doug … Doug, the little thug,"" Mr Hornidge joked. Doug has been on more adventures than almost all humans his age. He is only two weeks old yet he has visited a pub, posed with the famous red dog statue in Dampier, frolicked in the waves at the beach, and watched pearl farming in action. The men say travelling with a goat means they do need to make frequent potty stops, but it has not affected their road trip too much. Mr Hornidge says Doug has been well received by all who meet him along the way. ""Everyone's been trying to buy him, but we couldn't put a price tag on him,"" he said. The men have created an Instagram account for the goat to document his travels. ""He's like a puppy,"" Mr Hornidge said, while the goat lightly headbutted his leg. Many Broome locals have taken to social media to offer forever homes for Doug. One user commented: ""Love the surprises that come with the dry season"", while another conceded the goat's cuteness: 'Most destructive animal God put on earth, but bloody cute"". Doug and his four rescuers will soon be heading back to Perth, where Doug will live out the rest of his life on the Hornidge family farm.

146,Queensland couple restores Top Deck tour bus they fell in love on,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  North Queensland couple relive their 1980s romance by restoring Top Deck tour bus Instead of roaming the countryside in any old motor home, this North Queensland couple have tracked down the overseas bus they first fell in love on. Top Deck Overland tours in the 1980s took young travellers from London to Kathmandu, promising the trip of a lifetime. That first trip in 1985 was just the beginning for Whitsundays resident Paul Willcocks, who got hooked on driving the caravan-style converted buses. ""It was a party on wheels around Europe, that's the way it started off,"" he said. ""I went overseas as a backpacker, and I saw this advertisement for road crew wanted for Top Deck Travel and they said, 'We're short on drivers so would you like to have a go at driving? I said alright'. ""That changed my life really."" Not only did Paul fall in love with driving these tours, but the job also led him to meeting a fellow young backpacker he'd one day marry. ""That's where Roz and I met, driving these things from London to Kathmandu and back,"" he said. ""In a place called Lahore in Pakistan; she was going one way, I was going the other."" More than 30 years later, Paul has bought and restored an original Bristol Lodekka tour bus to relive their adventures. ""This is the particular model that Top Deck used and it's fairly similar to the way they were set up in the Top Deck days,"" he said. ""They used to carry 20 [passengers], plus two crew."" While they're not planning to ferry backpackers on this particular bus, Paul says the passion project has already stirred up fond memories. ""That's why we did it, trying to live in the past I guess,"" he said. ""Now it's going to be a little touring vehicle for us, for two, not for 22."" Towering 4 meters in the air, Paul admits it took a while for him to get used to winding through narrow streets and mountain passes on a double-decker bus. ""I was as nervous … for the first couple of weeks driving them,"" he admits. ""My first trip was driving from London to Kathmandu in four weeks: 15,000 kilometres. ""That included going through places like Syria, Jordan, Israel, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Iran, Turkey and Europe of course. ""I did it for about 35–40 weeks straight, driving backwards and forwards from Kathmandu to London with groups, having a ball."" Every Top Deck bus had its own name, which Paul has kept true to, dubbing theirs 'Tranquilo'. ""Tranquilo is a word that mum and dad use for their kids in Spain,"" Paul said. ""There's no direct translation for it, but just 'settle down and take it easy'. ""That's why we're calling our bus 'Tranquilo', because it's time for us to settle down and take it easy.""

148,"South Australia records one death and 4,777 new COVID-19 cases ",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  South Australia has recorded one death and 4,777 new COVID-19 cases in the latest reporting period. A woman in her 90s has died after testing positive to COVID. The number of daily cases in the state has dropped from records of 6,091 new infections, set on Thursday, and 5,666, which was recorded yesterday. It has been a common trend during the pandemic for case numbers to peak mid-week and drop over the weekend. There are currently 37,618 active COVID-19 cases in the state, with 201 people in hospital, 13 in intensive care and one on a ventilator. According to SA Health data, of those hospitalised, 140 people had been vaccinated with two or more doses, 50 people were either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated ,and 11 are listed as ""unknown vaccination status"". Premier Peter Malinauskas said it was too early to tell if the state had reached a peak in cases yet. ""I caution actively against anyone thinking we have reached a peak here. Today's case numbers are positive, that's a good thing, but they are up and down like a yo-yo at the moment across the world,"" he said. Mr Malinauskas said the state was still on track to relax mask-wearing rules next week. ""We haven't reached that 8,000 case number that was forecast only a few weeks ago. That means it appears we can proceed with our intended plan to lift the mask mandate on Thursday [of] the week coming, which I think a lot of people are looking forward to,"" he said. Meanwhile, passengers have faced delays at Adelaide Airport due to staffing and equipment issues as demand for domestic travel returns to pre-COVID levels. An airport spokesperson said staff shortages were caused by a ""high level of last-minute absenteeism due to COVID and close contact rules"". There were also technical issues with screening equipment that slowed the progress down. ""We are working to put on additional resources wherever possible as we approach the busy school holiday peak, where we're anticipating our busiest period in more than two years,"" the spokesperson said. ""Our advice to travellers is to arrive around two hours before your domestic flight, and to be respectful to airport staff, who are doing all they can to get you on your way."" Travellers have faced extremely long queues at Sydney Airport over the past few days, with some planes held back to allow passengers to make their flights as people flocked to get away for the Easter school holidays.

150,Isolation rules changed for Sydney Airport staff as passengers hit with third day of long delays,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Isolation requirements for airport staff have been relaxed following major delays that have plagued Sydney Airport for a third day. Earlier on Saturday, passengers had to wait for hours to go through security and check-in, while footage showed long queues stretching outside domestic terminals. Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia were all impacted. In one tweet, a person who had arrived before 5am described the situation as ""hell"". Some planes were held back to allow passengers to make their flights as people flocked to travel for the Easter school holidays. Staffing issues due to COVID-19 close contact rules were partially blamed for the delays, with airline staff unable to get exemptions available to other industries. However,  the state government has now added air transportation staff to the list of critical workers, exempting them from self-isolation rules if they become a household contact. Under the changes made to the Public Health Order on Friday, workers identified as household contacts no longer have to isolate for seven days and can return to work if they have no COVID symptoms. Workers must travel directly from their home, to-and-from work and wear a mask in the workplace at all times. They must also undergo frequent Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) for seven days. A spokesperson for NSW Health said the exemption applies to air transport services whose absence would pose a high risk of disruption, including pilots, baggage handlers, flight attendants and security staff. If a worker tests positive or develops symptoms, they must self-isolate at home and cannot return to work. On Friday, Sydney Airport chief executive Geoff Culbert issued an apology to passengers for wait times, saying the coronavirus was at the root of the issue and they were facing a ""perfect storm"". ""Traffic numbers are picking up, travellers are inexperienced after two years of not travelling, and the close contact rules are making it hard to fill shifts and staff the airport,"" Mr Culbert said. Airlines had been encouraging travellers to arrive at least two hours before their scheduled departure, but on Saturday some of those travellers who arrived earlier had to wait another hour to be able to join the queue. One traveller arrived at the airport at 1.00pm for a 4.20pm flight to Brisbane only to be told they had to wait. ""We started to queue up, but we got kicked out of the queue. We have to wait now for another hour before I stand in the queue again,"" they said. ""They should have realised [it's] first school holidays since lockdown, with Easter holidays, I think they should have just been prepared."" A spokesman for Sydney Airport said security queues had been extensive before 6am but later settled down, and there had been no reports of passengers missing flights. Teams of staff were working to comb through passenger queues to prioritise more urgent flights, he said in a statement.

151,"analysis: We haven't 'forgotten' how to fly. Rather, there's a new set of rules for travelling now",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Ah, so it's our fault. Apparently, shutdowns and cancelled holidays and lives frozen in pandemic times have meant that we've actually forgotten how to do airports. Sure, the airport is juggling the universal problem of close-contact rules and staff shortages but add in increasing traffic and ""inexperienced travellers"", Geoff Culbert says, and you have a perfect storm. That's the watertight explanation offered by the chief executive of Sydney Airport after two days of horror queues that rival anything that we might remember before 2020. Well that makes sense. We just don't know what to do anymore at these vast, heretofore empty terminals. As if the pre-pandemic horrors of the Virgin ""bag drop"" queues could ever leave you … May I humbly suggest that if anything's been forgotten here it might be the spin doctor's golden rule that when you're in a crisis you don't blame the customer? It was an odd damage-control choice that one, and of course it didn't go the distance. A far more human and understandable defence would have been to admit that you can make all the plans you like right now – including staff-lists and rosters – but we're running at a 50/50 chance of any of it coming off. Just like that flight you've got booked: go your hardest, but two little red lines on a piece of cheap imported plastic are going to decide whether you get to pass ""Go"". For the first time in almost two years — 704 days — Australia’s borders will open to all fully-vaccinated travellers next week. But for many the ordeal is far from over. The first block of school holidays in this ante-pandemic restrictions period is now underway in most states, and if Culbert is right about anything, it's that none of us are quite sure about how they go now. Do you fly interstate, overseas? Those airport scenes aren't terribly encouraging. Is it another close-to-home experience, with floods and rain a constant in otherwise beguiling locations? Do you stay with the unfurling pleasures of a city opening up again with music and theatre and sport and gardens alive and kicking? I have friends who haven't seen their family in New Zealand in months who booked flights the day that country announced they were re-opening, nicely timed for Easter. I haven't had the courage yet to ask them what their airport experience was like – but their approach was you go, you go quickly, you go now and you plan for the best. Is there any other way to live life right now? For me it's all about re-framing whatever the situation is you're in right now: a fake-it-til-you-make it trick of the mind that spins towards the positive. It's a deliberate act of choice to make these messy, sometimes upsetting, sometimes disappointing times as good as they can be. Yes, call me Pollyanna: I can think of no other way. So if that means a weekend stay at an OK beach is as good as it gets, then that's the paradise you've been craving – and look at where we are! A sudden close contact that cuts off the next seven days? Well, that's an opportunity to get to at least a few of the books you optimistically purchased in lockdown and never cracked. Wherever you are is wherever you are, and that slight re-framing of the view might be all you need to see a glimpse of blue sky. This weekend watch the PM being grilled by experts – school kids. Seriously, our journalistic future is in good hands, and the embarrassing songs we love without guilt, and that’s just as it should be. And can I also recommend to you the ABC podcast, Fierce Girls, a remarkable selection of women who have dared to do things differently, including shark conservationist Valerie Taylor who worked with Stephen Spielberg on Jaws. Have a safe and happy weekend. I've been taking down-time with Vogue Magazine’s My Life in Looks, in which stars, musicians and general well-heeled celebs walk through a photo album of some of their most noteworthy looks. I sometimes imagine the sheer joy of sitting down with, say, Marilyn Monroe, or Josephine Baker or Liz Taylor and getting them to talk you through a sumptuous collection of their best looks – what fun. A dive into Kylie's best looks took me to her celebrated Glastonbury performance with Nick Cave, which led me to this, and if you don’t know it, I know you'll love it. And speaking of holidays, I'm off for a few weeks but I'll be back on April 30. Go well. Virginia Trioli is presenter on Mornings on ABC Radio Melbourne and a co-presenter of Q&A.

152,Kalgoorlie eyes new links with the east as it spends millions on airport runway,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Kalgoorlie-Boulder Airport spends millions upgrading runway hoping for new links to eastern states The runway at Kalgoorlie-Boulder Airport in Western Australia's Goldfields region is undergoing its first major upgrade since 1993, as officials push for the return of an eastern states air link by the end of the year. Resurfacing works, worth $3.7 million, are being carried out over the next month and are set to extend the life of the runway for another five to seven years. The works are not expected to cause any flight cancellations or delays. It buys the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder valuable time as it is still facing an estimated $20 million bill to overlay the runway surface in the future. Kalgoorlie-Boulder Mayor John Bowler described the cheaper option to extend the runway's life as ""common-sense"". ""It will give us time to build up our airport reserves, so by the time we do the big work and the expensive work, there will be no impost on the ratepayers,"" Mr Bowler said. ""It's a big saving and it extends the life of the assets that we've got. ""This is about saving money ... it's good common-sense, it's good economics."" The City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder awarded the contract to Fulton Hogan in December for what is known as ""surface enrichment sprayed treatment"" works. The area being repaired covers more than 220,000 square metres across the main runway, taxiways and the smaller airfield used by light aircraft. Fulton Hogan operations manager Jason Huppatz said the emulsion product was a 1-2mm layer on top of the existing tarmac. He said it was unusual for a runway to go without a major upgrade for so long, but it was ""still in really good condition"". Mr Huppatz said a 12-person crew was completing the works and he was adamant there would be no impact on flights. ""We'll be working around flights,"" he said. ""When commercial flights are not due in, we'll be closing the runway and undertaking the works then. ""It needs good conditions [to dry] but we can put down a layer and you can be trafficking that layer in two hours."" With flights from Melbourne to Busselton Airport in WA's South West beginning this week, Mr Bowler also spoke about the possibility of an eastern states route returning to the city. Virgin Australia's direct flights to Melbourne were suspended when COVID prompted the introduction of tough border restrictions and eventually forced the airline into administration. Qantas previously ran direct flights between Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Adelaide, but the route was axed in 2014 due to poor ticket sales. ""I believe as people get used to travelling again that [Melbourne flights] will come back onto the timetable,"" Mr Bowler said. ""Also, there has been some small discussion about Kalgoorlie to Adelaide again, which would be an exciting development. ""Wouldn't it great if we have Kalgoorlie-Adelaide return and Kalgoorlie-Melbourne return? ""A lot of people then would find it very easy to come here knowing they have a quick direct flight home to their family and loved ones."" Mr Bowler said he was not concerned about which airline operated an eastern states route and he wants it sooner rather than later. ""I hope later this year … whichever airline … we just want the service,"" he said. The viability of other intra-state routes, including Busselton and Esperance, are also being investigated as part of the airport's new Master Plan, which is set to be completed later this year. The expansion of the main runway – currently 2 kilometres long and 45 metres wide – will also be considered to accommodate larger aircraft. The master plan will also consider a possible expansion of the Ron Yuryevich Terminal, which was renamed after Kalgoorlie-Boulder's long-serving Mayor in 2015.

153,Qantas customers left without access to thousands of dollars of their own money for days as calls go unanswered,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Qantas glitch sees passengers charged multiple times for the same flight Qantas customers have expressed anger and confusion on social media, saying they have been ""charged twice"", or more, for flights they have booked. After being unable to get through to the Qantas call centre, several consumers pleaded on Twitter for answers from the national carrier. ""Two hours on hold… totally unacceptable,"" Gary Butterfield said in a post. ""This happened to me. I was charged twice, and it took 15 business days to get my funds back, after approximately 10 hours on hold with Qantas over a week,"" Ruby Halloumi wrote. Jake MacMullin, who had similar experience, tweeted: ""I thought I’d search Twitter to see if other people have been waiting on hold for a while."" Kay Steadman, who works for ABC News, is one of the growing number of people who have voiced their concerns about the matter on social media. She and her husband recently booked a trip to London using their debit Mastercard. She said she noticed on Wednesday Qantas had billed them a second time. ""The two transactions that came out on Saturday were for $2,025 each,"" she said. ""Yesterday, I was billed by Qantas for another $4,050."" Some customers have reported even larger multiple deductions from their accounts after making a booking. David Clapin booked his flights to London on Tuesday by using both flight credits and his Amex credit card. He said the actual deduction for the booking should have been around $3,500 but, instead, 14 pending transitions appeared on his account over the past two days totalling $42,000. ""Still no ticket issued as of this morning,"" Mr Clapin told the ABC. ""I have spent 12 hours on hold over three days, spoke to three people and still no resolution."" Ms Steadman said, after several unsuccessful attempts to reach Qantas by phone and email, she called her bank for help. ""Basically what [the bank] was saying is as soon as you put your card details in when you bought those initial flights, you have given your permission for that company to take funds from your account, and they can continue to take funds from your account,"" she said. ""And there's nothing I can do about it or the bank can do about it."" The airline said it was aware that a small number of customers appeared to have been charged twice for flight bookings, but that was ""not the case"". “Unfortunately, there is a delay in releasing pre-authorised funds which we are urgently working with our banking and payment partners to resolve,” a spokesperson told the ABC. “The pre-authorised funds are being automatically released within three to seven days. ""If customers need the funds sooner, they should contact their banks to request a payment release."" Ms Steadman said eventually Qantas confirmed to her it was a glitch and should be resolved within seven days. Many consumers have criticised Qantas' customer service since the pandemic began. CEO Alan Joyce admitted that Qantas customers had been enduring excessive delays when trying to contact its customer service staff. “I do apologise for anybody trying to get through to our call centre at the moment,” he said. “Because the average wait time is an hour and a half and we shouldn't be at those levels for general calls, half an hour for premium calls. “But that's because our call centre, with these changes of borders, has gone from 5,000 calls a day to 15,000 calls a day.” We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

154,Families rejoice as first direct flight between Melbourne and Margaret River touches down,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Direct flights launched between Melbourne and WA's Margaret River tourism and wine region After eight false starts and years of waiting, the first direct flight from Melbourne to WA's Margaret River food and wine tourism region has arrived. The sold-out Jetstar flight, with 186 people onboard, left Melbourne and touched down at the Busselton Margaret River airport on Wednesday. While the route had been discussed for almost a decade, an airline carrier was only confirmed in 2019, and then plans to launch were scuttled by the COVID-19 pandemic. The new flights are scheduled three times a week and will continue in a trial of the route over the next three years. Jetstar chief executive Gareth Evans said he expected the flights to continue beyond that time. ""This is very much a permanent route,"" he said. ""Hopefully with the strength of bookings we will be able to grow the route beyond the three-a-week we are initially looking to operate."" Wheatbelt residents Martin John Ranis and Blanche Gucor were among those on the first flight. Mr Ranis said the new flight was a good option for people from regional WA. Another passenger, Natasha Kelly from Newcastle in NSW, said she hadn’t seen some of her closest relatives in the South West for two years and this flight route would make it much easier for all of them to visit each other. ""It's actually easier than going from Sydney to Perth then Perth to Busselton,"" Ms Kelly said. ""The flight was really good. I've been trying to get over here for a while."" The new service follows major upgrades to the Busselton Margaret River Airport, jointly funded by the state and federal governments and the City of Busselton. Regional Development Minister Alannah MacTiernan said additional funding would depend on the success of the new route. She said $47 million had already been spent on the airport and attracting a carrier. ""If this does work and if we are able to attract more flights in, then we will obviously look at upgrading further."" Liberal member for Vasse Libby Mettam said the state government should proceed with funding the expansion of the Busselton airport's terminal capacity instead of waiting for another 12 months. ""This is a game-changer project for the region,"" Ms Mettam said. ""We know it is an ambitious project [but] we need to properly invest in these important routes through marketing and suitable infrastructure. Jetstar announces it will start running three flights a week between Melbourne and Busselton in the south-west of WA. ""This air route has every chance to succeed."" An additional $10 million that had been earmarked for the development by the state government was reallocated to the proposed underwater observatory expansion at Busselton jetty. The new route is seen as a major boost for tourism in Melbourne and the South West, which have both suffered significantly due to COVID. Previously, interstate tourists who wanted to visit the Margaret River region needed to fly into Perth and drive three hours' south. The arrival of the new route is expected to bring more than 60,000 visitors to the region over the next three years and generate $40 million for the local WA economy. Victorian Tourism council chief executive officer Felicia Mariani said domestic tourism would play a crucial role for the tourism sector, as international arrivals were slower to rebuild. ""Margaret River has huge appeal to Melburnians, so I don't see why there wouldn't be a benefit both ways,"" she said.

155,$92k for a barista: The big bucks causing shockwaves in northern Australia,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Wages boom in northern Australia as businesses compete for staff ahead of tourist surge If the prospect of winter sun is not enough to lure you north, what about the promise of six-figure salaries and cash to book your flight? As the clock ticks towards the start of the northern tourist season, businesses are offering escalating wages and relocation payments as they jostle for staff. ""I've never seen anything like it,"" veteran Broome cameleer John Geappen said. ""People are advertising wages and packages that are way over what's been offered historically. ""Broome usually relies on the backpacker pool of workers, so without them there's been a big shift and it's the workers who are benefiting."" There's a $92,000 salary on offer to make coffees at a Broome cafe, and also $2,200 relocation payments for cooks and kitchen hands to move to Kununurra. Supermarkets are offering $35 an hour to stack shelves, with one advertising $1,000 bonus payments to staff who stay more than a couple of weeks. While the approach is allowing some businesses to shore up a workforce ahead of the peak season — which traditionally starts at Easter — it is causing anxiety among those who cannot afford to keep up. Broome cafe owner Bikram Pradhan said he had a sinking feeling when he saw the $92,000 barista salary. He is also trying to recruit staff but cannot match that. ""At the moment there are five of us pushing through to keep the cafe open, which is a bit crazy; ideally we'd have five more people,"" he said. ""It's mentally draining and you can only do it so long. As the weeks go on, you get physically tired and you just can't handle it. ""It's right before the season starts so I don't know how we'll cope if we can't find the staff."" Like many small businesses across northern Australia, Mr Pradhan is pinning his hopes on the imminent return of the backpacker workforce. During the pandemic the number of working holiday makers plunged from 141,000 to 2,000. The latest federal government data suggests the number of backpackers is bouncing back but is still at just 10 per cent of pre-pandemic levels. Since Australia reopened to international travellers in December, more than 14,000 backpackers have arrived, with another 41,000 granted visas and expected to arrive soon. Many will receive a $495 refund on their applications costs as part of a Commonwealth scheme to attract travellers. The absence of the fire-twirling backpackers and their minimum-wage work ethic has exposed a major fault line in the prospects for economic development in northern Australia. Economist Aaron Morey from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA says it is part of the unique set of challenges facing regional businesses. ""The inability to access workers both skilled and unskilled is quite unprecedented,"" he said. ""Along with international students, it's really laid bare the reliance we have on these people coming into the country."" He said the eye-catchingly high wages and signing bonuses might be a sign of what's to come as unemployment continued to drop and wage pressure grew. ""There is building pressure in the economy around boosting those base wages, and many businesses are trying not to bake in those permanent cost pressures on their business. ""A lot of them are using sign-on bonuses or retention bonuses and the like."" In recent years state and federal governments have launched subsidy schemes to encourage people to relocate to fill vacancies. The federal program offers people $6,000 to move to a regional area experiencing worker shortages and $3,000 to a city with more available jobs. The Department of Education, Skills and Employment says 3,939 people have so far received the payment. A breakdown of applicants shows most people have used the money to move to Queensland and New South Wales. With tens of thousands of holiday makers set to migrate north in coming months, it will be just a fraction of the workforce needed to keep the coffees flowing and the tours on time.

156,Alice Springs' Lasseters Hotel Casino set for $70 million expansion,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Alice Springs' Lasseters Hotel Casino set for $70 million expansion The owner of Lasseters Hotel Casino in Alice Springs has announced a $70 million expansion, adding additional accommodation, a rooftop bar and large swimming pool to the existing site. The first stage of the expansion would include almost doubling the number of rooms, adding more dual and family rooms the resort. Iris Capital, which purchased Lasseters Hotel Casino last year, have plans to later build residential apartments next to the hotel. Construction is expected to begin later this year and be completed in stages over a period of at least three years. Iris Capital chief executive Sam Arnaout said the project was expected to create more than 500 jobs during construction. He said the organisation would look to hire locals and ""transient travellers"" for a further 500 full-time jobs once the precinct was fully operational. ""We're excited about Lasseters resort becoming the economic engine for the inland capital,"" Mr Arnaout said. While visiting Alice Springs on Monday, Chief Minister Michael Gunner said the Northern Territory government backed the investment. ""They're [Iris Capital] doing this because they have confidence in Alice Springs and the future of Alice Springs that this is a world class destination,"" Mr Gunner said. The funding announcement followed the Northern Territory government committing to building the National Aboriginal Art Gallery in the Alice Springs CBD last month, after five years of negotiations. ""I think we're going to see a lot more private sector investment follow now there is absolute certainty around the gallery and the investments that we're making.""

159,Australian World Heritage site older than pyramids celebrates big step forward,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  New aquaculture centre next step for World Heritage-listed Budj Bim There are still a few finishing touches to be made, but the official opening of the Tae Rak Aquaculture Centre at Budj Bim in south-west Victoria is another important milestone for local Indigenous people. Tourists are expected to be welcomed to the $12 million facility at the UNESCO World Heritage-listed site from June 1, but an opening ceremony was held on Friday. The building sits near Tae Rak (Lake Condah), which is home to an elaborate aquaculture system of eel traps that are older than the pyramids. The aquaculture centre will house Indigenous artefacts, visitor facilities and an eel tank, as well as a kitchen serving up the bush tucker of the region, including eels. The site received its heritage listing in 2019, but the pandemic and a lack of suitable infrastructure limited the chances for the traditional owners to welcome visitors to country. That hasn't stopped the offices of the Gundijt Mirring Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation in nearby Heywood from being inundated with calls from around the world from people wanting to see the ancient site. The corporation's acting chief executive, Denis Rose, says it will be ""a nice problem to have"" when tourists finally arrive this year. ""It has been a lot of long years and we've had great support along the way, but it's just really great to have all this infrastructure pretty much completed and ready for some tourism activities,"" he said. ""While it's an economic benefit, it's also an opportunity for us to put forward our perspective on life around here. ""I've taken a lot of tours over the years and there's one recurring theme — that people have never heard the story or seen from this perspective, and never understood the rich and long history of this part of the country."" During the opening ceremony, tribute was paid to the 1981 High Court case in which Gunditjmara elders Sandra Onus and Tina Saunders challenged mining company Alcoa in order to protect Indigenous archaeological relics, effectively paving the way for the protection of areas such as Budj Bim. The corporation's chair, Donna Wright, said the official opening of the Tae Rak Aquaculture Centre was the latest step in an ongoing journey. ""Our ancestors fought hard to protect our country, and … that continued connection with country can now be shared with everybody,"" she said. ""I love this place.

160,Thor has visited 196 countries in a single journey but hasn't flown once,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Torbjørn ""Thor"" Pedersen has travelled to almost every country on the globe with one important caveat: he's never once arrived by plane. The Danish adventurer is on an ambitious mission to become the first person to traverse the world in an unbroken journey without the use of air travel. ""About 200 people have successfully managed to reach every country in the world, but then I worked out that no-one's been able to do it completely without flying,"" he said. ""I thought all of this would take four years or less, and here we are more than eight years in."" Mr Pedersen arrived in North Queensland on Friday after more than two weeks onboard a cargo ship from Hong Kong. He plans to spend about a month in Australia — his 196th destination — before visiting the final seven countries on his list. The Red Cross ambassador, who left his home in Denmark in October 2013 and has not returned since has spent the past eight years on an average budget of $US20 a day. ""It has been this patchwork of trains and buses and shared taxis and ferries and container ships now and again,"" Mr Pedersen said. ""Some days I spend $100, some days I spend no money whatsoever."" Like the rest of the world, Mr Pedersen's travel plans were brought to a standstill in 2020. ""Before I knew it, it was declared a pandemic, and I was stuck in Hong Kong,"" he said. ""The only way out would be to go to the airport and fly, so I had the choice between sitting it out or giving up on the project."" He decided to wait it out and ended up spending two years living and working in Hong Kong. ""It's been tough mentally, thinking that it's just one more week … maybe it's just one more month, and pushing and pushing and pushing for something I believe in,"" Mr Pedersen said. He eventually negotiated a trip to Palau and now Australia, where he will be visited by family, including his wife. Mr Pedersen was collected from the Townsville port by Kara Pendergast, who has offered him her spare room during his time in North Queensland. She has never met the Danish traveller but has spent the past five years following his journey on his Once Upon a Saga page on social media. ""I just saw him on Facebook. He said he was heading to Townsville, so I sent him a message, and here he is,"" Ms Pendergast said. ""It's inspiring to see people can do this with their life."" Mr Pedersen said he expected to return home to Denmark next year after the experience of a lifetime. ""The motto of this project is that a stranger is a friend you've never met before,"" he said. ""When I left home, that was just a tagline and something that sounded really nice, but within weeks that was proven many times over.""

161,Flood victims told to leave Byron Bay emergency housing to make way for Easter holiday-makers,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Flood victims told to leave emergency housing in Byron Bay to make way for Easter holiday-makers At least 60 victims left homeless after the northern NSW floods have been ordered by the government to leave emergency accommodation and make way for Easter tourists. The Department of Communities and Justice has written a letter advising people to ""check out"" by April 4. The departments's deputy secretary Paul Vevers said the only accommodation the government could find to move people to was in Grafton, Brisbane and the Gold Coast. ""I just cannot apologise enough for the disruption that this will cause people and we will do everything that we can to minimise it,"" he said. Mr Vevers said 60 people would be shifted in the coming week, but could not give a total number of people who would be relocated. The department was housing more than 1,600 people in emergency accommodation as of March 31, but said those staying in caravan parks and motorhomes would not be affected. ""When Easter is over, we will transport people back again, and we will put people back in emergency accommodation, and they will be able to remain there for as long as they need,"" he said. He said there was a team of employees calling hotels daily to snap up any cancellations that arose. But Mr Vevers said he could not begrudge people who had booked to stay in the Byron Bay region for Easter. ""All of the bookings were made months ago, in some cases people booked two years ago,"" he said. ""The Bluesfest was cancelled twice, and people have carried their bookings through. ""I would say tourism is vital in the Northern Rivers, it's vital for jobs, it's vital for businesses."" Mr Vevers said moving to accommodation in Queensland was not the ""only option"" — people could find their own lodgings, and get a ""substantial"" payment from Service NSW to help the transition.

163,Quirky self-taught engineer remembered for iconic playground and other inventions,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Monash playground engineer Grant Telfer remembered for creating beloved SA attraction In his own community, Grant Telfer is remembered as an engineer and free spirit who rode his bicycle barefoot and dressed in white overalls. Much further afield than his trusty bike could take him, Mr Telfer's legacy has been the creation of an iconic playground in his tiny home town of Monash in South Australia's Riverland. Known for his handiwork, he also built sheds for a living and invented the gopher outdoor mobility scooter. Mr Telfer died in December at the age of nearly 90. Fundraising is underway for a $40,000 statue in his honour at the Monash Adventure Park, where the original playground known as Grant Park, then later as the Monash Adventure Playground, was created. The playground began with a small slide in the 1960s for the town's children. When he semi-retired in the 1970s, his designs became more ambitious and soon the two-hectare reserve was filled with 180 pieces of steel play equipment. It became an attraction for families and, as word spread, busloads of tourists would seek out the thrill of racing down the towering slides on hessian bags, whizzing around in steel cages or soaring across the playground on the flying fox. By the 1980s, an estimated 300,000 people a year were visiting what had become one of South Australia's biggest attractions. Archival videos of the playground on social media today attract thousands of opinions on whether the playground was good, old-fashioned fun or plain dangerous. ""Absolutely loved this place. I remember getting burnt by the metal on hot days,"" one Facebook user wrote. The playground was closed in 1992 amid growing concerns about litigation and an inability to secure public liability insurance. It reopened as the Monash Adventure Park in 1996 with green lawns replacing the dirt, soft fall instead of grape marc and modern play equipment. Berri Barmera Mayor Peter Hunt paid tribute to Mr Telfer. ""He put Monash and of course the Riverland on the worldwide map,"" Mr Hunt said. ""The amount of tourists who have visited that place … it would be astronomical."" As a child, Mr Telfer loved making things. He made a canoe out of a sheet of corrugated iron and used it to accompany his high school teacher on a swim across Lake Bonney. In his late teens, he made his own welder using parts from an old tractor. And when he heard the Renmark Gliding Club needed a shed, he built one at the age of just 20 and went on to start a business making sheds that are still in operation today — 70 years later. Daughter Alison Halupka said her father didn't have any formal qualifications. ""He just had a natural interest in making things from steel and over the years he just seemed to have a natural engineering mind and physics mind for putting things together,"" Ms Halupka said. Mr Telfer was part of a group called Technical Aids for Disabled and was asked to design a three-wheeled hand-propelled tricycle for children who didn't have the use of their legs. ""He was thrilled to think kids who couldn't ride an ordinary bike could jump on their hand-propelled one and join the other kids,"" Ms Halupka said. ""He was selling them at cost, not to make any money."" This invention led to enquiries for a motorised outdoor scooter, which Mr Telfer designed and trademarked as the gopher. It has since become a generic household name and was manufactured by Mr Telfer's company until the availability of cheaper imports made it too difficult to compete. Ms Halupka worked alongside her dad until she and her husband took over his shed-building business 20 years ago. ""People have asked me, did your dad encourage you to work in a man's world and I would say, no, he didn't encourage me, he didn't discourage me either,"" she said. ""I don't think he put people into boxes, he had a very broad mind."" Mr Telfer didn't put much stock in social conventions and he'd wear overalls and ride his bike barefoot between local towns. ""Sometimes it was mental health, he would jump on his bike and ride to Pinnaroo to clear his mind,"" Ms Halupka said. And she said while her dad would not have wanted any public recognition, she was grateful for the community support for the statue project, which was halfway toward reaching its funding goal. ""That could be their legacy to all the fun he gave them,"" she said.

164,Planning a flight from regional WA? Residents' airfares are about to get much cheaper,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Airfares to be capped for regional WA residents, as Mark McGowan fulfils election promise Capped airfares for residents in regional parts of the Western Australia will come into effect from July 1, Premier Mark McGowan has announced. People living within 1,000 kilometres of Perth will pay a maximum of $199 each way, and those in more distant parts of the state will have their flights capped at $299. The $19.8 million scheme was a key commitment from the WA Labor government at last year's state election. The state government said return flights within the state had previously cost regional West Australians up to $1,000. The price caps will only apply to return flights starting in the regions. Mr McGowan said the caps would ease the financial burden for people living in regional centres including Kalgoorlie, Albany, Broome, Geraldton, Port Hedland and Karratha. ""This will make a huge difference for those residents needing to travel to and from Perth, whether that be for medical or personal appointments or to visit family and friends,"" he said. WA Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said the scheme would be the first of its kind in Australia. ""I am so proud we have secured this funding and have been able to work collaboratively with airlines and regional communities to deliver this unprecedented election commitment,"" she said. Broome resident Paul Jones travels to Perth every three months for MRI scans. Mr Jones said the cost of the trip meant he had to go alone and stay in hostels. ""It just makes it hard sometimes when you have to go by yourself, stay in hospital by yourself, stay in accommodation by yourself, and to have a family member there would be a lot more comforting,"" he said. Mr Jones said the caps would be welcome, but at $598 return from Broome under the scheme, the costs would still hurt the hip pocket. ""Having capped flights is good but we could do a little bit better I think,"" he said.

166,'He's not very talkative': Grazier and outback community rally to help find lost teddy bear,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Outback community rallies to help find lost teddy bear A 5,000-kilometre, cross country journey for a father and his son's beloved teddy bear is the recipe for a successful Mem Fox book, or potential disaster, as Gordon Wilson has found out. Throughout the trip, Mr Wilson had been taking photos with the bear as a way of keeping himself and the family entertained. But it all went wrong when the 61-year-old lost his son's treasured teddy ""Pooh"" part way through his journey from Bowen in far north Queensland to Perth in Western Australia. ""It was an 'Oh, s**t' moment,"" he said. ""I was distracted by flies, I left the door open so I went to shoo them off, then got in the car, locked the door, and drove off and left him behind. ""I realised after arriving in Broken Hill and I was like 'Oh no'. ""It was getting dark, and it was a three-hour round trip there and back so I decided against it. ""The next morning I got up and I thought 'Nah, I can't go back', because I'd probably go back and he may not be there and it'll be a wasted journey."" This is when Lois Wilson, Mr Wilson's wife, sprang into action, reaching out to locals on a Broken Hill Facebook group to see if anyone had seen the bear that had been left more than 150 kilometres away. ""I said 'Look, I'll try Facebook',"" Ms Wilson said. When the Wilsons woke up the next morning, they were stunned by the number of people who had reached out to offer support. ""I couldn't believe there were so many shares and so many comments,"" Ms Wilson said. ""We've just been blown away by the reaction from everybody."" Fortunately for the Wilsons and their son Ben, grazier Mitch Rodgers of Comarto Station, 50km west of Wilcannia, came to the rescue. ""I saw a post on Facebook about someone leaving him behind when they took him out for a photo,"" Mr Rodgers said. ""I recognised the sign post where it was, and it's only about 20km from my house. ""So I went out there and had a bit of a look and there he was, sitting there next to the post. ""It's worth it. If you can put a smile on someone's face, it's worth it. ""They [the Wilsons] were pretty stoked about it."" Before he headed back into Broken Hill, Mr Rodgers decided to give Pooh a taste of station life. ""He's not very talkative,"" Mr Rodgers said. ""But it's been fun to chuck him out and get a photo here and there."" The Wilson family are grateful for Mitch Rodgers, but none more so than Mr Wilson who left his son's treasured toy he had since childhood. ""It was a big relief. When I heard that he was found it was really good,"" Mr Wilson said. ""A big thank you to Mitch especially, and the Broken Hill community for going out of their way to do something that a lot of people wouldn't have done."" Ms Wilson said the community response, in particular, was overwhelming and it was testament to the good nature of people. ""It's not COVID, it's not floods, it's not fire, it's not somebody's been attacked — just a feel-good story really,"" she said. Ms Wilson said the teddy bear had been a part of their family for more than 20 years, but it belonged to her 23-year-old son. ""It's a bit embarrassing, everyone thinks this is for a baby. It's not, but it has sentimental value to the whole family,"" she said. As an added bonus, Mr Wilson is visiting his son, mother, and sister, who all live in WA, for the first time in almost a year. Rather than posting Pooh back via the mail, the family are looking for volunteers to transport him back across to Perth. They are banking on goodwill and word of mouth. ""It'd be good for him to continue the adventure with someone else,"" Mr Wilson said. Sadly for the grazier from Comarto Station, who rescued Pooh, it means the pair have had to part ways. ""He's with a woman from Broken Hill who will travel down to Mildura, then a couple will pick him up from there to take him into South Australia,"" Mr Rodgers said. From there the journey continues.

""This means Darwin Airport welcomes Australia's shortest and longest international flights."" Passengers on the new Darwin to Dili service can expect their journey to take about one hour and 20 minutes whereas travellers departing Darwin for London can expect a travel time of longer than 17 hours.

168,Australian sea lions struggle to rebuild low populations off WA as new pressures emerge,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Sea lions struggle to rebuild low populations off Abrolhos Islands as new pressure emerge They are charismatic and curious but the Australian sea lions that live on the Houtman Abrolhos Islands off Geraldton are listed as endangered. New funding has allowed conservationists to start undertaking research to help protect the marine mammals. According to researchers, sea lion numbers have still not recovered from the effects of mass killings by whalers and shipwreck survivors dating back more than 300 years and surveys of the endangered animals are stepping up. Department of Biodiversity and Conservation Midwest Conservation leader Anthony Desmond said Australian sea lion numbers on the chain of 122 islands were so low that one boat or jetski strike could threaten an island's population. Mr Desmond said the Dutch, who were shipwrecked on the islands in the 1600s and 1700s, killed the sea lions, and in the 1800s a whaler boasted of collecting ""11 tons of seal oil and 150 seal skins"". He said despite the years that have passed, the sea lion population at the Houtman Abrolhos was estimated to be only about 150, which is about the same as the number killed in that one early 1800s expedition alone. Funding from the area being turned into a national park is now enabling research teams to undertake intensive surveys of the animals and their unusual breeding habits, with the aim of better protecting them as the windswept fishing islands prepare for more tourist visits. ""They have not rebounded from that [early] impact,"" Mr Desmond said. Population surveys have shown about 20 pups are born every year. ""When you have such a low population it does not take much to impact them,"" Mr Desmond said. ""So things like a simple boat strike where an animal gets hit by a boat or a jetski could have a severe impact on the overall population for a small group like the Abrolhos and we think that sort of thing happens occasionally,"" he said. Mr Desmond said Australian sea lions, which are also found on the Turquoise Coast near Leeman and at the Recherche Archipelago off WA's south coast, have ""an unusual breeding cycle"" of about 17.6 months. ""So it is not the same time of year every year,"" he said. ""And that breeding across the Houtman Abrolhos Islands appears to be very different from different islands so one set could be breeding in October and the others could be breeding in January and February."" He said female sea lions bred at the place where they were born, which added to the Abrolhos population's vulnerability. There was also a potential for them to get caught in nets and fishing lines. A warming climate and disease were also threats. ""If there is a major impact at any one island it is very hard for other ones to come back because their instinct is to go to the island they were born at,"" Mr Desmond said. A draft management plan for the Houtman Abrolhos Islands states the animals are ""vulnerable to human disturbance"". Mr Desmond said people were drawn to the ""charismatic"" animals but he urged them to keep a distance warning ""they have a good set of teeth"". ""They are certainly not aggressive a lot of the time, but if they are feeling threatened they have certainly got the potential to give you a savage bite,"" he said.

169,Pride Train rolls into Bendigo in colourful display of support for queer communities,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Bendigo Pride Festival sends message of support as Pride Train rolls into town A rainbow-coloured V/Line train has journeyed through Central Victoria to celebrate the Bendigo Pride Festival. Commissioner for LGBTIQ+ Communities Todd Fernando invited queer leaders from across the state to join him on the train, which arrived in Bendigo on Saturday. He said the train was a display of intersectional support for the queer community. ""We know how challenging it is for young LGBTIQ+ people who often leave regional rural areas to seek out a better life,"" he said. ""The Pride Train is a visible display of Victorian pride of our communities, which is a great initiative."" ""We hope that by this V/Line Pride Train coming to Bendigo it's an expression of how this government feels about LGBTIQ+ equality across the state."" Member for Bendigo West Maree Edwards said the voyage, which first ran in 2021, doubled as a tourism experience for Melburnians. ""I think the whole point of it is that people who do catch the Pride Train can spend the afternoon or even the evening and catch the train back again the next day,"" she said. ""There's so much going on in Bendigo at the moment, and there's so much to do. Visiting our restaurants and takeaways and having a great time in the town is very important for our economic recovery. ""It's going to be a trip of fun and laughter and enjoyment, I'm sure."" The Pride Train arrived in Bendigo in time for travellers to attend the Racism in the LGBTQIA+ Community forum, featuring Commissioner Fernando, Australian actor Uncle Jack Charles and local identities. Commissioner Fernando said it was an important event for LGBTQI+ leaders from across Victorians to attend. ""It is a demonstration of their commitment to stand against racism and to eradicate racism within our communities,"" he said. ""LGBTIQ+ people are intersectional, and they can also be Aboriginal or be a person of faith or a person with disability."" He said it was important to acknowledge and honour those intersections.

170,How a worldwide backpacking adventure in his 80s helped Deano recover from disaster,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  How backpacking around the world in his 80s helped Dean Springbett overcome Cyclone Debbie trauma In gusts of howling wind and rain, it took his boat and established gardens — but Cyclone Debbie did not touch Dean Springbett's free spirit. Five years on from the disaster that rocked Queensland, the 85-year-old said it was enough to make him want to up and leave on an adventure. ""It comes in a big roar, big gusts, blows like mad,"" he said. ""The water just turned to vapour and blew away like it was snowing."" Some people may wear their heart on their sleeves, but it's clear Deano — as he likes to be called — wears his on the walls, trees, nooks and crannies of his small beachside oasis. His Dingo Beach home is lined with his artwork, street signs and mementos from adventures, and print-outs of photos. Why should they be locked up in albums? That's the way Deano sees it. With Cyclone Debbie leaving his property in shambles in 2017, the thought of starting over at age 80 might have been enough to break a person. But Deano had other plans. ""Everything was just devastated, it was just sticks,"" he said. ""I laughed and said, 'It even blew my heart tablets away.'"" ""Palm trees I'd grown snapped down, the tree out the front which was the biggest on the beach fell down, crushed my boat. ""I just wanted to leave. ""That's why I just planted [some trees] and thought, 'I'm taking off around the world'."" With a lot of travel booked digitally now, Deano brushed up on his smartphone skills, left Australia and didn't look back. ""I did Bali, Thailand, Germany, Morroco, the Bahamas, Canada ... 17 places I think I went to,"" he said. Every leg of the trip was true spontaneity. ""I didn't have any idea how long I was going to stop wherever I was,"" he said. After hosting backpackers on his property for some time, he said he knew people all over Europe who he was able to catch up with. Over the six months he said he met so many new friends, went on tours and just did ""whatever comes up for the day"". ""My heart’s been playing up a bit, I don’t know how much longer I’ve got [so that's why I thought] I’ll take off and come back later,"" he said. ""And [Dingo Beach has] really grown back."" Deano remembers the overwhelming feeling he had the first day after Debbie. ""At that stage you think, 'How am going to do this?'"" he said. ""That’s the worst part – that next day, it was unbelievable to walk out and see the trees gone."" The ABC spoke with him during the clean up, and he discussed taking on the cyclone with his chainsaw, which he kept beside his bed as the wind roared outside that night. ""I knew I probably wouldn’t be able to crawl through the bushes and branches in the morning, so I put the chainsaw there,"" he said. After returning from his round-the-world trip, things started to slowly resemble life before Debbie. Insurance losses from Cyclone Debbie totalled almost $2 billion, with more than 70,000 claims made, including on home, contents and commercial insurance. It was the most expensive cyclone in Queensland's history. Now, five years on, Dingo Beach residents look back at the cyclone as different to any they had experienced before. Deano stuck by words he remembered saying at the time — that a ""new dingo"" was coming up. ""Meaning the town is going to grow back again,"" he said.

171,Why spiritual tourism is tipped to boom,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Spiritual tourism tipped to boom as travellers pursue a different kind of holiday For as long as humans have walked the Earth, we've travelled. Even in an age of abundance, with the internet at our fingertips, we're still driven to seek out tactile experiences. Whether it's to see family and friends, visit museums or lie on the beach, the hope is to be transformed — to return home replenished, rested, or more knowledgeable. There's also a cohort of travellers who are seeking more. They're on a spiritual path, similar to a pilgrimage — though for many it's an immersion in a religion they don't already belong to. One of those is Irina Morrison. A few years ago, she set out on the Mystic Express, a tour of Indian temples and ashrams. It changed her life. ""Growing up in a non-religious environment, I was always sceptical and a little bit resentful of churches or leaders of religion or faith,"" she says. ""This trip turned that around completely."" For two weeks Irina visited temples, meeting Sikh, Hindu, and Buddhist spiritual leaders. ""It was much deeper than just learning basics about the Hindu religion, or just going to a temple to observe what the Hindu temple looks like,"" she says. ""The opportunity to meet these leaders and to have that intimate time with them, that's what was so life-changing for me. ""Just to be in their presence and to hear their wisdom — it was a real eye-opener."" Irina could have backpacked her way around India's spiritual sites, 1970s style, but says that wouldn't have been the same. ""One particular ashram is not even open to the public,"" she says. ""The owner is a high-level spiritual leader and speaks at the United Nations. I wouldn't ever be able to, on my own, find him and his ashram and be able to sign up or be a guest."" The doors to these sacred places were opened to Irina by a group called World Weavers, co-founded by Australian man Ben Bowler. In 2006, Bowler travelled to the Thai-Burma border with his then wife Jildou Brouwer to work with a Canadian NGO called Free School. He became fascinated with the intercultural tapestry of religion and spirituality. Out of this was born the idea of Monk for a Month. With the blessing and guidance of local religious leaders, they would invite small groups of people from around the world to come and immerse themselves in a monastery for up to four weeks. ""People were taking the robes and doing the whole thing … [they were given] a very authentic ordination as a novice monk."" So successful was the idea that they were soon teaming up with other religious leaders to offer experiences like Muslim for a Month in Turkey, and Rastafarian for a Month in Ethiopia. ""There's a number of these different programs that were running,"" Bowler says. ""And then out of that a network just grew up with all these amazing spiritual leaders. It was incredible, a beautiful thing."" Since then, the demand for spiritual tourism has continued to grow and Bowler says it's showing no signs of slowing down. ""There's a whole sort of crisis and tumult, of reorganising meaning in life, and I think that in the next five years we'll see a huge boom in that space for sure."" Freya Higgins-Desbiolles agrees with him. She's a scholar of tourism management at the University of South Australia with a particular interest in tourism as a social force. In decades past, she says, the tourism industry hasn't focused on spiritual travellers because they tend to be low-impact visitors, preferring to stay in temples and hostels, spending little money. But she says the economic and social spin-offs have enormous potential which go far beyond personal growth. ""I think the pandemic might actually change some mindsets,"" she says. ""We are looking at meaning in life. We're looking at using our holidays for things that enhance our spiritual growth."" The ABC's Religion & Ethics portal is home to reporting on religion, ethical discussion and inspiring stories of faith and belief. Dr Higgins-Desbiolles experienced a transformation of her own many years ago when she first moved from the US, taking part in tours with Aboriginal cultural leaders in South Australia. ""It really reshaped my whole agenda,"" she says. ""What they're trying to do is to change us non-Indigenous Australians, so that we can appreciate their spiritual connection to country, and thereby allow them to protect and maintain it. ""If we really want to appreciate this country and appreciate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge of this country, it comes from learning those stories."" But is tourism the best avenue to communicate a spiritual connection to country? Anne Poelina, a Nyikina Warrwa woman from WA's Kimberley region, believes it has great potential — particularly what she describes as ""luxury tourism"". Professor Poelina is the director of Madjulla, an Indigenous not-for-profit organisation in Fitzroy Crossing. ""Luxury tourism is not five-star luxury, but the luxury of knowing and feeling this place. ""It focuses on our environment as a living system, which holds memories from the past into the future."" She says we need to respect and value the ancient spirituality that Indigenous people have invested in through their custodial stewardship and love for country. ""This creates links to both management and protection of landscapes and ecosystems as vital parts of heritage protection and social and spiritual development."" Professor Poelina is hopeful that the tourism industry will encourage ""good faith"" sharing, which asks the visitor to exchange a moral contract with themselves. ""We want the visitor to focus on their own values and ethics, and to leave with a sense of obligation and care for the people, and the River Country."" Dr Higgins-Desbiolles says the industry can also assist by providing education, regulation, and clear labelling. ""People should know they've paid for an experience that has been created or vetted by traditional owners,"" she says. Ben Bowler agrees that partnering with local authorities and cultural leaders is critical. ""You're never going to avoid criticism if you're doing something at scale in this space that involves spirituality, religion, and money,"" he says. ""The answer is making sure that the guidance is coming from local cultural authorities. That's very true in Aboriginal Australia, and very true in a religious context."" These days Bowler focuses his time and energy on a not-for-profit called Unity Earth, and like everyone else is considering what a post-COVID venture looks like. ""We're not going to rush back to massive intercontinental travel the same way we used to."" With a major event planned for World Unity Week in Australia this year, they're exploring a hybrid of virtual and real-world festivals and cultural events, as opposed to intimate spiritual immersions. ""I think that in the age of tribalism and fundamentalism, it's probably more philosophically interesting to present a banquet of spiritual riches for people to enjoy, rather than just one tradition, which can reinforce the idea that one is better than another,"" Bowler says. A weekly digest of the best opinion, analysis and reporting on religion and ethics from ABC Radio National. ""[The question for] our whole future as humanity is, how do we come to live together?"" says Dr Higgins-Desbiolles. ""We do have religious conflicts that come from the fact that people become very isolated and ethno-nationalist in their religious faith. ""Spiritual tourism teaches us relatedness, and those connections.""

172,Dozens of visitors turn out to feed dolphins at Tin Can Bay after flood disruption,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tin Can Bay dolphins return to morning feeding routine after 2022 floods Travellers are turning out in droves to feed a small pod of dolphins at Tin Can Bay following a period of disruption during south-east Queensland's floods. Poor water quality caused by an increase in fresh water, run-off and debris disrupted the Australian humpback dolphins' morning feeding routine. More than 60 visitors queued on Wednesday morning to take part in the memorable experience. Barnacles Dolphin Centre team leader Marilyn Russell said poor water quality had impacted the dolphins' activity. ""There was too much fresh water up the creek, they weren't coming in,"" she said. ""There was a couple of days where they didn't want to come right in. ""They stayed out in the deeper water where there wasn't as much tannin getting into their blowhole."" Owner and manager Emily Shores said it was hard to gauge how much the water quality had impacted the dolphins' routine. ""We had a lot of run-off from everywhere else coming in and the water was just dirty,"" she said. ""They were coming in late and [dolphin] Aussie and her bub didn't want to come in at all. ""Sometimes we can have a heap of rain and it won't matter to them and then other times they will stay out a bit deeper. ""It's unpredictable how they will react to the weather."" Tin Can Bay is a popular destination for tourists and is usually busy with visitors looking to get up close and personal with dolphins. Ms Russell said visitor numbers at the centre were beginning to return to pre-pandemic levels. ""It's starting to build up now but we haven't had many overseas travellers,"" she said. ""It seems to be Australians travelling Australia. Once all international borders are back open and we get those overseas travellers coming, we're going to get a lot of people."" Ms Russell said Wednesday morning's visitors were there to feed four-year-old male Luna. ""He's Aussie's son and he's a very active dolphin who likes to get up to a bit of mischief,"" she said. ""He's a very cheeky dolphin and sometimes he likes to bring his friend Joe and have a play around out there. ""They're like two-year-olds on red cordial."" Ms Russell said Luna had recently been pushed aside by his mum Aussie because she had a new calf that was born three-and-a-half weeks ago, ""Only one in five calves will live for the first five years of their life,"" she said. ""Sadly they're a part of the food chain. ""Being a male there is a chance the older males will push him out as they like to travel alone or with a travelling partner. ""We are just hopeful that with Luna travelling alone he will stay safe and grow up to be a beautiful dolphin."" Evelyn Schulties visited from the Gold Coast and said feeding Luna was a once in a lifetime experience. ""I thought it was amazing, even just to have the one fish to feed the dolphin,"" she said. ""You really just want to pat him, but you're not allowed to. This will be something I will treasure.""

173,PM announces $60m cash boost to help lure international visitors back to Australia,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Prime Minister Scott Morrison has flown into Cairns packing a $60-million funding boost to entice international visitors back to Australia. It has been a dire two years for the tropical city – known as the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef and world-heritage listed rainforests – with southern lockdowns and international border closures smashing an industry once worth $2.5 billion annually. Speaking in Cairns today, Mr Morrison said $45 million would go to Tourism Australia and another $15 million to the locally based Tourism Tropical North Queensland. ""There is no part of Australia that is more dependent on international tourism than here in Tropical North Queensland,"" Mr Morrison said. ""It has been heartbreaking to see the streets and the cafes and the many operators not realising what they love to do. ""But up here, the tourism industry knows how to deal with setbacks … the pilot strike, back to when the Japanese market moved on and we had to secure new markets. ""They know how to do the tourism business up here."" More than 9,000 tourism jobs have been lost since the pandemic began, according to Tourism Tropical North Queensland. Chief executive Mark Olsen said the funding was the shot in the arm the industry needed and would be used to help market the area overseas. ""We're having to rebuild and establish brand new relationships — it's like it was 30 years ago,"" Mr Olsen said. ""We're going to get back on the road and showcase Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef. ""We'll be leveraging off the Tourism Australia advertising campaign activity to make sure that the Far North Queensland region is front and centre through airlines and digital campaigns."" Mr Olsen said the region's tourism industry employed 15,750 full- and part-time staff before the pandemic began.

174,Myanmar's battered tourism industry to welcome international tourist once again,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Myanmar to reopen borders to international tourists in mid April Myanmar will resume international passenger flights from April 17, the military said on Saturday, lifting a two-year ban on foreign tourists. The South-East Asian nation closed its borders to visitors in March 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in an attempt to prevent rising infections. Myanmar was further isolated after a coup last year saw huge protests and a bloody military crackdown on dissent, sending its economy — including its tourism industry — into freefall. ""We will open all international flights on 17 April, and can fly as regularly,"" said the National Central Committee on Prevention, Control and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease, citing falling COVID-19 infections. In a statement, it said the decision was ""in order to improve the tourism business sector, and in order to have smooth trip for visitors who come to visit Myanmar"". Visitors will be required to quarantine for a week — undergoing two PCR tests — and must be fully vaccinated, according to the Health Ministry. Myanmar's tourism industry was battered by the pandemic, with the country registering 40,000 daily COVID-19 cases at its peak last year. It has recorded almost 20,000 deaths in total. Spiralling violence following the junta's takeover has also dented business, with many international firms pulling out of the nation. More than 1,600 people have been killed by security forces and more than 11,000 people arrested since the coup, according to a local monitoring group.

175,Total solar eclipse to bring Pilbara's astrotourism ambitions out of the shadows,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Total solar eclipse in April 2023 to shine a bright light on WA's astrotourism ambitions Communities on Australia's north-west coast are preparing for an influx of tourists in April next year, with thousands expected to arrive hoping to witness a total solar eclipse. Exmouth, in WA's Pilbara will be under the path of totality, making it an ideal spot for eclipse chasers, but up to 5,000 stargazers are also expected in Onslow to the north-west, which will experience more than 99 per cent totality. ""We have had international interest in the eclipse,"" said Ashburton Shire's Chief Operating Officer of Aviation and Tourism, Megan Walsh. ""We've got tourism companies from the States wanting to book accommodation, wanting to bring boats in. ""Onslow has always been this quiet little fishing town. ""[The eclipse is] going to really put Onslow on the map."" Astrotourism is a key part of the shire's future, with Ms Walsh viewing next year's eclipse as a ""launching pad"". ""It's about what happens after this one event,"" she said. ""The Shire of Ashburton has been recognised as a great place for stargazing. We've got these beautiful dark skies. ""You get on a boat and you get away from the mainland and it just looks like the sky wants to hug you."" Astrotourism WA CEO and founder Carol Redford said the eclipse would put a global spotlight along the Coral Coast and the Pilbara. ""The world's media will be watching this event and they'll be here, they'll be beaming out the story to all corners of the globe,"" she said. Ms Redford said the eclipse would be an incredible opportunity to showcase the region's ""world-class"" night skies and boost dark sky tourism. ""The universe is the oyster. Literally, the sky's the limit for this,"" she said. ""(It's an) opportunity to say to the world, 'We've got this fantastic solar eclipse happening and apart from that, come and see our beautiful dark skies in the southern hemisphere'."" For author, psychologist and eclipse chaser Dr Kate Russo, it will be her 13th solar eclipse. ""Once every 18 months or so somewhere around the world, a total eclipse is visible from a very narrow path,"" Dr Russo said. ""There are things that happen above you, but also it happens around you and within you too. ""You can see the outer atmosphere of the sun and it forms this beautiful, silvery light corona."" Dr Russo is helping the Shire of Ashburton prepare for next year's event, which will also serve as a taster for a 2038 eclipse during which Onslow will be at the centre of the path of totality. ""This eclipse next year in 2023 is very much a warm-up,"" she said. Ms Redford said next year's solar eclipse would be particularly special because the Moon and Sun's disks would be almost the same size. ""We might be able to see the chromosphere, which is the closer atmosphere of the sun or just directly around the sun, and that's a ruby red kind of colour,"" she said. ""To have the same thing happen in Exmouth would take, I believe, another 375 years.""

176,P&O sacks hundreds of workers via pre-recorded Zoom video,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Trade unions have protested at British ferry ports on Friday after Dubai-owned P&O Ferries abruptly sacked 800 workers via a video message, drawing widespread condemnation and raising the prospect of disruption to key tourist and goods routes. P&O, which is owned by Dubai ports firm DP World, is recovering from a difficult two years when COVID-19 prevented tourists from travelling on its routes between Britain, France, Ireland and elsewhere in northern Europe. P&O said it had lost $176 million in the last year and that without changes its business was not sustainable. Staff were reportedly told its ships would instead be crewed by a third-party contractor to cut costs. In Dover, Britain's busiest ferry port, about 150 protesters gathered and truck drivers honked their horns in support but services operated by other carriers were not visibly disrupted. Demonstrations also took place in the English ports of Liverpool and Hull, and the Northern Irish port of Larne. ""Yesterday's events should also mark a sea change in how we treat workers in this country,"" said Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT Union. The overarching Trade Union Congress called for workers' rights to be strengthened, including via a new law to end the so-called 'fire and rehire' practice which some firms have used to re-employ workers at lower wages to cut post-pandemic costs. Transport Minister Grant Shapps said he was shocked and dismayed by P&O's actions: ""Sacked via a pre-recorded Zoom video with just 30 minutes' notice — no way to treat employees in the 21st century."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said the government was looking at whether the sackings were lawful before deciding on any further steps. DP World did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

177,Adam was 45 when a wild tuk-tuk ride across India changed his life,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Adventure calls for tuk-tuk traveller Adam Branford, who was once afraid of the unknown It was the one thing Adam Branford was advised not to do: drive at night. But coming into the Indian city of Agra, he had no choice. ""That was incredibly scary because all the buses and trucks are coming towards you with their high beams on,"" Adam says. ""You're just sitting at their light height completely stunned, you can't see. ""Then there are the potholes and the cows and people riding motorbikes with no lights and no helmets. It was really, really intense."" Adam's decision to travel 3,000 kilometres across the Indian subcontinent in a three-wheeled tuk-tuk — notoriously known for being unreliable — wouldn't appeal to most people. It traditionally wouldn't have appealed to him either. ""As a little kid I was really frightened of the unknown,"" Adam says. ""Unknown"" is a good way to describe a Rickshaw Run, the brainchild of English adventure group The Adventurists, in which thrill-seeking teams drive rickshaws [tuk-tuks] across India. ""We had two weeks to do Jaisalmer and Rajasthan to Shillong in Meghalaya … they get you to the start and they say, 'We'll see you at the end,'"" Adam says. ""There's no mechanical help, there are no maps. There's no support of any sort. It's just, 'Get to the end.'"" It's dangerous and unpredictable, exactly what the former teacher and mine worker was looking for in 2015. ""Australia's pretty sanitary and almost boring in some ways, if that's the right word,"" Adam says. ""Over there all elements of life are very spicy. There's a lot going on, there's a lot to take in."" While once afraid of travelling to places like India, the airport compliance officer from Mount Gambier has since fallen in love with the unknown. Breakdowns, dust storms, dodgy curries and all. Even if it took him 45 years. ""There's just something about it. I don't know,"" Adam says. ""Some people just want to watch reality TV and go to bed every night and not worry about the world. [I] want to get out and experience everything I can."" There's travelling in a tuk-tuk and then there's driving one. The latter was Adam's responsibility in his three-man team with two friends. Bear in mind that the fatal road toll in India is one death every four minutes. At flat-out pace, the 145cc vehicles can travel at 45 kilometres per hour. ""They're a handbrake start. They've very underpowered. They leak. They don't stop well. Driving conditions are very cramped,"" Adam says. ""The road rules are there but people just don't seem to want to obey them and the police don't seem to do much about it."" Breakdowns are common. ""You can't plan your accommodation because you don't know where you're going to end up because the thing could break down,"" Adam says. Fortunately they'd never have to stop for long. ""Some [local] would come and say, 'It's probably this' and they'd have it fixed in 2 minutes and you'd be on your way,"" Adam says. ""When we'd had enough for the day we'd just try to find somewhere to stay. ""Some were really crusty $5-dollar-a-night beds in the crappiest places you could imagine. And some were really nice."" The upside of course being what they'd see in the daytime winding their way through tea fields of Darjeeling, breaking for lunch at the Taj Mahal, and exploring the cremation ghats at Varanasi. After two weeks on the road and a month in India, Adam was well and truly ready to come home. Six months later he knew he needed to go back. ""You get itchy feet. You just want to get out there again and get thrown about in a rickshaw,"" Adam says. This time he and Tim, a friend from the first trip, opted for a 1,000km trip across the Himalayas, travelling on some of India's most remote roads. They arrived a week early to acclimatise to the 5,500-metre elevation, Everest-base-camp height. Despite their efforts, Adam still got altitude sickness. ""We did a road called the Spiti Valley Road which is pretty much a 4WD road. Boulders, creek crossings, mud holes, you name it. It was a hell of a trip,"" Adam says. Unlike in India, where they could pull over anywhere and receive help, in the Himalayas they were on their own. Travelling along the Chinese-Tibetan border, there was an increased military presence, requiring them to pass a series of checkpoints. ""We were up very near to where that physical fight between Chinese and Indian soldiers was a year or two ago,"" Adam says. ""You think, they're a long way from home, they're oxygen deprived, it's cold. I do wonder if they actually know what they're fighting for."" Had it not been for the pandemic, Adam would have bashed around the Baltic Sea in a ""crappy old car"" by now. ""We've got tickets for next year. But with what's happening in Europe now, who knows what will happen,"" Adam says. He used the time grounded to write a book, Cows, Curries and Chaos: An Indian Odyssey on three wheels, which details his ventures and near-death experiences on his first Rickshaw Run.

178,'Like a second home': Australians return to Bali without needing to quarantine ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Read in Bahasa Indonesia Jessica Gordon is happy she could holiday in Bali last week. ""Bali is like a second home to me,"" said the 32-year-old interior designer from Brisbane. Ms Gordon arrived in the tourist hotspot via Singapore from Australia last Sunday, after she discovered she could visit Indonesia without having to quarantine. ""I'm actually going to visit my grandmother who is unwell in Surabaya, but could only enter through Bali because it is the only airport that offered visa on arrival,"" she said. Ms Gordon last visited Bali in 2019 but before the pandemic, she went to the island almost every year. She said she was not worried about the current COVID-19 situation in Indonesia. ""I love Bali and want to support the beautiful people here,"" she said. ""They have been so welcoming, as always, and I can tell it has been an extremely difficult two years for the locals here."" Indonesia initially opened Bali to international tourists, including Australians, in early February, but with a requirement to spend five days in hotel quarantine. But from early March, Bali implemented the Visa on Arrival program for Australians and tourists from 22 other countries. Once the visa is granted at Bali airport, international travellers need to self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test result, but then can continue their holiday. For further Australian government advice check the Smart Traveller website. Local media in Indonesia reported that if the Bali trial was successful, Indonesian authorities would open the rest of the country to international arrivals in April. Djefi Wirjadinata, who was born in Indonesia and is now an Australian citizen, has booked a holiday package to Bali and Jakarta with several of her friends. ""Our flight has been booked, leaving Sydney on April 8,"" she said. ""At the moment nine of us will go to Bali and spend several days there, and [then] continue our journey to Jakarta."" Ms Wirjadinata, who owns a freight business in Australia, said she was really looking forward to the trip — a mix of holiday time and business meetings. She is trying to stay positive and not worry that the trip might be cancelled because of COVID. ""I think the government will not change their promise,"" she said, referring to the Visa on Arrival program. Daily COVID-19 cases in Indonesia have been decreasing over the past few weeks, according to World Health Organization data. Despite the drop in cases, on March 17 Indonesia still recorded 13,018 new cases and 230 COVID-related deaths. But Bali has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country. In the main tourist areas of Bali, 100 per cent of the local population has had two doses of vaccine. Nyoman Santiawan, a member of Bali Tourism Board and a local businessman, hopes international tourists will kick start the local economy. But he said the number of tourists might not pick up until April or May. ""We are happy, but this is early days. So far only four flights have arrived direct from Australia,"" Mr Santiawan said. Bali's economy relies heavily on tourism. Prior to the pandemic, up to 70 per cent of the Balinese population earned a living, either directly or in directly, from tourism. Direct flights between Bali from Sydney and Melbourne resumed in early March, and flights from Perth are set to restart in April. Mr Santiawan said until Perth flights resume, revenue from Australian tourists will be limited. ""For some Perth residents, Bali is like a second home for them,"" he said. ""Because of the distance, the fare is cheaper, so Western Australia is our biggest market."" Mr Santiawan also pointed out that travellers from Melbourne and Sydney sometimes preferred other holiday destinations in South-East Asia, like Thailand and Vietnam. Vietnam announced last week it had scrapped quarantine and other travel restrictions for foreign travellers. According to the Vietnamese Health Ministry, visitors entering the country only need to show a negative PCR test prior to arrival. Malaysia will now also allow fully vaccinated travellers into the country, without quarantine, from April 1. Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said that ""citizens with valid travel documents can enter and leave the country as they did before the pandemic,"" local media reported on Tuesday. Indonesia's daily case numbers are reaching new records while just under 70 per cent of the population has been vaccinated, yet the country insists it is prepared to tackle the Omicron wave. Thailand has been open to fully vaccinated international tourists from 60 countries since early November 2021, with no hotel quarantine requirement. Travellers only need to spend their first night in a pre-approved hotel and provide a negative PCR test result. While Thailand's program was suspended in December when cases increased because of the Omicron variant, the Associated Press reported the ""Test and Go"" quarantine waiver for vaccinated arrivals resumed from February 1. Fully vaccinated Australian travellers have also been allowed to travel to Singapore without needing to quarantine since November 8.

179,How delving into the past is putting Collie on the map,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Jacob Butler focuses on Collie's timber industry history in latest contribution to mural trail For West Australian artist Jacob ""Shakey"" Butler there is some community detective work involved in trying to track down the people featured in his contributions to the Collie Mural Trail. The 34-year-old has just put the final touches on his latest addition. The 10-metre high and 4.5-metre wide mural pays tribute to the South West town's historical ties to the timber industry. ""I was getting all sorts of people coming up who had grandparents in the industry just thankful that it was finally representing the town and sharing stories,"" he said. The mural is based on a photograph dating back to the early 1900s showing a team of timber workers. ""They've got this grit and toughness about them that I was just really intrigued about. ""There's now a bit of hunt going on to find who these workers are."" Other murals completed by Butler in Collie focus on the town's military and mining past. Each took about a week to complete. Bulter said from the first portrait the community had banded together to try and identify those featured. ""One of the locals found an old army pin, a passport-sized photo of one of the coal miners and it happened to be his great-grandpa,"" he said. ""When you actually do a piece about the people then it can really draw the community together and lets people delve back on that past. ""There's a real emotional connection to the piece."" Butler said he was looking to work on another mural focused on Indigenous history of the area. Collie Deputy Mayor Ian Miffling said the mural trail has attracted visitors from all over. ""It's been a huge bonus for the town in terms of bringing tourists in just to look at the murals, and then of course, while they are here they are taking the opportunity to look at other things as well."" The local tourist bureau provides maps for those looking to seek out the artwork. There are more than 20 stops on the 35-kilometre mural trail which also includes the 6,500-square-metre Wellington Dam mural. ""You can pick them. They're walking around town and they are looking at their maps,"" Cr Miffling said. ""They're lots of them now.""

180,"Red tape stalling cycling rail trails in NSW, causing businesses to miss out on 'wallet on wheels', advocates say",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Creating cycling and walking rail trails from abandoned NSW railway lines an uphill battle While abandoned railway lines across Australia are being transformed into cycling and walking rail trails, there are concerns too much bureaucracy is stalling plans in New South Wales. Despite the state having more than 3,000 kilometres of rail tracks that trains no longer run on, turning them into rail trails is proving to be an uphill battle, advocates say. ""There's too much legislation in NSW, too much red tape to get these rail trails built,"" Dubbo Bicycle User Group president Mick Cooper said. Mr Cooper is among a group of campaigners in central-west NSW trying to turn the rail line between Dubbo and Molong into a rail trail for cyclists and walkers. Passenger trains stopped running on the 134-kilometres line in 1974, and freight services stopped in 1993. ""For a cycle path to be built in NSW, legislation needs to be changed to officially close the rail corridors and allow them to be used by other people,"" Mr Cooper said. ""We've been proposing a rail trail for the past 20 years, and it's such a slow process."" The Dubbo to Molong rail trail would see the tracks removed and a 3-metre-wide path built in its place. ""It wouldn't be a huge expense to build. There are only two bridges on the line and no tunnels,"" Rail Trails Australia committee member John O'Brien said. ""Building a cycle path across bridges and through tunnels is where the costs can add up, but that's not an issue for us. ""Having this would allow people to ride their bikes through small communities like Yeoval and Cumnock, and those towns will benefit from that."" Bicycle NSW chief executive Peter McLean estimated rail trails generated millions of dollars in local economies. ""These rail trails are bringing wallets on wheels to communities,"" he  said. ""Cyclists spend a lot of money on accommodation and meals in these towns as they ride the trails. ""If people are spending a week riding rail trails, they're spending thousands of dollars, and that generates millions of dollars into a local economy each year."" Rail trail advocates have long hoped the economic benefits would persuade state and federal governments to invest in projects. However, in NSW, it is not easy to get approval. There are just two rail trails in the state that have been built on the rail corridor. A 22km section between Tumbarumba and Rosewood in the Riverina opened last year, while the Northern Rivers Rail Trail is in its early stages of development. A spokesperson for Regional NSW Minister Paul Toole said the two trails were being run as projects and would be evaluated to determine the government's position on further proposals. The spokesperson said the state government considered rail trails where there was overwhelming community support, a viable business model and biosecurity and land issues had been addressed. However,  Rail Trails Australia said other states were much far ahead, with Victoria having nearly 50 rail trails and Tasmania 19 trails operating. While Victoria sold off its disused rail corridors in one go, allowing rail trails to be built quickly, in NSW, the lines are sold on a section-by-section basis. On the NSW southern tablelands, a 56km section of rail line between Goulburn and Crookwell has not seen a train since 1985. For two decades, local residents have been campaigning for it to be turned into a rail trail. It has created years of debate, with farmers near Crookwell concerned at the impact cyclists could have on their properties. Seed potato grower James Weir said allowing cyclists to ride the rail corridor that passed through the middle of his family property could be devastating. ""If we had bikers come through right next to our potato field, they can bring contamination into our crop whether they get off their bike or not,"" he said. ""If we get a disease or virus, it could shut us down overnight and would likely affect other seed growers in the area."" Mr Weir said there were also issues for farmers who had sheep and cattle crossing the disused rail line and the impact cyclists could have on livestock. The Goulburn to Crookwell rail trail is among several currently being proposed in NSW. While there is some opposition, not all landholders are against it being built. Ian Anderson's property at Woodhouselee has the abandoned rail line running next to it. ""This is such a beautiful area, and the region has such a rich history of gold and sheep, and opening the rail corridor off to tourists seems such an obvious thing to do,"" he said. A renewed campaign has been launched in recent months to encourage support for the $14-million project from state and federal governments. ""Our community has been through drought, fires, COVID, and we need the economic boost these rail trails bring,"" Mr Anderson said.

181,Grey nomads tighten their belts as fuel and food prices eat into budgets,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Diesel price hike expected to hurt regional operators as grey nomads tighten belts As hip pockets across Queensland take a hit with diesel price hikes, the state's tourism industry is bracing for yet another hit in the wake of the pandemic. Experts have predicted a change in travel patterns during what should be prime time for grey nomad tourists to head north to warmer climates. Not only will filling up cost more but a hike in supermarket prices as a flow-on effect will add to the cost of living for retired travellers on a budget. Jill Hammond, who is a month into her trip around the country with her husband David, is just one of many grey nomads forced to reassess plans. The retiree said fuel prices were the latest setback a month into their year-and-a-half journey after being caught in the Northern NSW floods. The Sydney couple had been tossing up returning home at the end of April as fuel prices and the flow-on cost to essential supplies affected their budget for diesel. ""My husband worked out all our costs but now because fuel has gone up so much — we filled up the other day at $2.09/litre and the next day it was $2.24/litre for diesel,"" Ms Hammond said. ""So obviously that will affect our costs quite a lot."" Ms Hammond said they hoped to still see everything on their bucket list, but might need to wait until fuel was more affordable. ""Cost of fuel and the war in Ukraine doesn't help all of this,"" she said. ""If it keeps going up and the costs of everything else going up … we'll just have to work it out and see how it affects us. ""We might have to stay longer in certain areas."" Queensland's Caravan Parks Association general manager Michelle Western said there were still good indications the winter would be strong, but travellers would likely be more planned in their approach. ""Instead of going from town to town and spending one night in each town they may try to stop and stay in a town for a little bit longer,"" Ms Western said. ""We suspect they will watch the petrol prices and they will try to manage those ups and downs that we do see at those petrol stations."" After enduring rolling lockdowns over the past two years, Ms Western said there was a strong appetite to travel north. She said research had shown that high fuel prices would not necessarily have a significant impact on overall travel costs. ""Data from a KPMG study revealed that a fuel price rise of 20 cents per litre may only add about 2 per cent to the overall cost of your touring holiday, so in the scheme of a winter away it is probably not going to make a significant difference,"" Ms Western said. Brisbane retirees Bruce and Kerri Dennett prefer to take shorter trips into regional Queensland with their caravan. ""We believe we'll still travel but we'll probably be more conscious of the weather… if it's really blowy your fuel prices will go up if you're driving into the wind and things like that,"" Mr Dennett said. ""I think what we might do is go to certain places and stay a little bit longer but do longer day trips maybe so we aren't towing everywhere you go … That's something we have tossed up."" Ms Dennett said she thought hospitality businesses might miss out as eating-out budgets were spent on fuel instead. ""We always try to support wherever we visit, you know have a meal at the local pub … but you might pack a lunch for a day trip instead to try and conserve,"" she said. ""The first thing you can start saving on is going out, so you might just cut back a little bit."" Further north, the operator of one of the state's most remote holiday destinations said rising fuel prices could hurt outback tourism. Owner-operator of Cobbold Gorge, about 400 kilometres south-west of Cairns, Simon Terry said the high cost of filling up could make some self-drive tourists reconsider how far they ventured into the outback. ""If they're coming from Victoria or further west then it's definitely going to have a major impact on their budget, on their holiday, how far they can drive, and what spare money they can spend on their holiday,"" Mr Terry said. ""It's going to affect their trip duration or their time spent on the road. ""They'll have to re-budget the whole holiday."" Mr Terry said the sharp increase in fuel prices was already being felt in his daily business operation, which would impact his bottom line during the winter tourism season. ""There's been quite a big hike, as most people would know, on the supermarket shelves where the price of food has gone up,"" he said. ""We're noticing the increases in freight prices too, with some freight companies already passing on a fuel surcharge on top of their usual pricing. ""It's a bit hard to pass the costs on as our prices for the season are locked in and most people forward book by several months, so we've just got to hope that it'll settle down soon and get back to some normality.""

182,New Zealand to welcome vaccinated Australians without quarantine from April 12,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Vaccinated Australians will be allowed to enter New Zealand without needing to quarantine for COVID from April 12. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern made the border announcement on Wednesday morning. Ms Ardern said travellers from other countries with visa waiver arrangements with New Zealand would be allowed to enter without quarantine from May 1. We have now received guidance that it is safe to significantly bring forward the next stage of border re-opening work,"" she said. ""We are ready to welcome the world back."" The Prime Minister said the reopening of New Zealand's border, which has remained shut to much of the world since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, was a sign of the country's economic recovery. ""In particular, I look forward to welcoming back our trans-Tasman travellers, who have historically made up 40 per cent of our international arrivals,"" Ms Ardern said. ""They will be able to arrive in time for the Australian school holidays and provide a particular boost for our coming winter ski season."" Ms Ardern said travellers will be required to have a negative COVID-19 test before they leave, and two negative tests when they arrive and then on day six of their stay. The Prime Minister said this could be a rapid antigen test. New Zealand Tourism Minister Stuart Nash described Wednesday's announcement as ""the most exciting moment"" for the nation's tourism sector. He said the country would be launching a campaign to attract Australian tourists back across the ditch. ""I don't think even the most ardent kiwi sports fan would begrudge me saying we are ready to roll out the green and gold carpet for our Australian neighbours,"" he said. ""We have missed you.""

183,"Free diver's 60 years in the water saw 'lots of money, lots of danger, and lots of fun'",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Free diver reflects on almost 60 years spent in the water with no plans to slow down It has been almost 60 years since Jon Stuart first began free diving in the deep, cold waters of the south coast of WA, and he continues to spend plenty of time diving and sourcing his dinner from the ocean. The Albany resident had his first taste of the sport as a 9-year-old, making friends with a boy around his own age who he saw fishing in Princess Royal Harbour. With a pair of goggles in hand, the duo began experimenting with diving around the many different coastal areas of the region. ""We figured it out and then became quite proficient at diving,"" Mr Stuart said. ""The sport was popular in Albany at the time and a local club in the area had two Australian champions as members. ""The club welcomed us into their group and taught us everything they knew. ""By the ages of 15 and 16 we were diving 19 metres [deep] regularly and having a minute to a minute and a half on the bottom."" Mr Stuart said he would regularly compete in competitions where divers were required to swim unassisted for four hours around islands, headlands, and reefs. He turned his attention from recreational diving to commercial work and spent many years working in the pearling trade in the north of the state. ""It was very exciting. There was lots of money, lots of danger, and lots of fun,"" he said. Now at the age of 69, Mr Stuart still dives frequently, with a special affinity for the clear water of the south coast. ""The thing down here is there's no tide to contend with. Up north you're always swimming against the tide, down here you don't have to worry about that,"" he said. ""You just relax, do your breathing, swim forward, use your momentum and down you go. ""I collect all the food I want. Around the rocks close to town you will always get enough for a feed as long as you aren't greedy."" One of Mr Stuart's most prized possessions is an old diving helmet that reminds him of those early days in the pearling industry. ""All my life I wanted to get a helmet, it's a heritage thing for us,"" he said. But despite its antique status and iconic design, Mr Stuart's partner won't let him display the item in the house. ""It's such a dirty, ugly thing, but I love it,"" he said. ""It's probably the most expensive garden ornament you've ever seen"".

184,Cruise ship return cannot come fast enough for Tasmanian retailers,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Hobart retailers are calling on the Tasmanian government to announce when cruise ships will be allowed back into the state. International cruise ships will be allowed to enter Australia on April 17, following a two-year ban. But the world's largest cruise association has said cruise ships are unlikely to return until mid-year. A spokesman for the Cruiselines International Association, Joel Katz, said it would take months for new protocols to be put in place. ""We're still not going to see ships return immediately, we need to finalise the protocols with the states and territories and then the cruise lines need to gear themselves back up and get those ships back to Australia,"" he said. ""It's more than likely it's still going to be the middle of the year until we see the first ships return."" Tasmanian Small Business Minister Madeleine Ogilvie said the government would talk to all relevant stakeholders before settling on a final date. Shop owner Frances Pepera said a time frame would be helpful so she could order enough stock and ensure she was prepared for high numbers of tourists. ""I also would like to know the dates so we can start pre-ordering because we have 60 artists in here,"" she said. ""It doesn't happen overnight."" Before the pandemic, cruise tourism contributed $100 million a year to the Tasmanian economy and supported around 400 jobs. The cruise ship industry was rocked after 28 people died, and more than 700 cases of coronavirus were linked to the Ruby Princess, after thousands of passengers were allowed to disembark the vessel in Sydney in March 2020. Soon after, around 3,000 cruise ship passengers and staff were barred from disembarking from a cruise ship in Hobart, after the captain decided the risk of people becoming infected with coronavirus was too great, with five cases recorded in Tasmania at the time.

185,Life as a Vatican insider: 'I worked for the Pope and married one of his Swiss Guards',travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  From a Gold Coast private school to working for the Pope and marrying one of his Swiss Guards — Joanne Bergamin's story sounds like something from a Hollywood movie plot. Growing up, Mrs Bergamin's family travelled to Rome annually as part of their jewellery business operation. ""It's their fault really that I moved to Rome,"" she said. More than a decade ago, Mrs Bergamin threw caution to the wind and boarded a plane to Italy. She had no job lined up and only expected to stay for a year, but before long the enterprising young woman found work selling Prada shoes on the Isle of Capri. Working for a glamorous fashion label and living on a Mediterranean island would usually be enough to satisfy any young traveller, but for Mrs Bergamin the adventure was just beginning. The young woman spent her days learning Italian but there was another interest which would become a life-changing passion. ""I was studying theology just as a way to stay in Rome [and had to apply for a] student visa every year,"" she said. ""Becoming a Catholic was the last thing I thought I'd ever do."" As she grew used to her new life in Italy, Mrs Bergamin was offered a job as a journalist on Pope Benedict's newspaper and had daily encounters with the famed Swiss Guards, the pontiff's personal army. ""It was a baptism of fire because I'd only just become a Catholic,"" she said. ""I'd cross the border into the Vatican every day and there'd be a guard that would salute me at the gate and I ended up marrying him."" Drawing similarities between 1953 movie Roman Holiday starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, in which a lonely princess falls in love with an American reporter, Mrs Bergamin said her new love would give her tickets to papal events and passed on sweets from the Pope himself. ""When we started dating he'd bring me sweets that the Pope had given him to give to me,"" she recalled. ""Who gets sweets from the Pope? ""I really fell in love with [Pope Benedict] and the Catholic church because I had to translate everything he said and did every day. ""He's the dream grandfather anyone would want. He's humble and kind. When you talk to him you feel like you're the only two people in the universe."" By the time the couple wed, newly installed Pope Francis was on hand to offer blessings. Mrs Bergamin married her husband Dominic in the oldest church inside the Vatican — a chapel called St Stephen of the Abyssinians which was built by Pope Leo in the 400s. And, during her decade at the Vatican, Mrs Bergamin became the first female, non-Swiss secretary to the Commander of the Swiss Guard. ""There are a lot of forward-thinking men inside the Vatican, believe it or not,"" she said. In another scene from her movie-script life, the Bergamins were locked down in the Vatican for three months under COVID restrictions. ""The Pope's gardens were my own,"" she said. And her Instagram account went viral. ""I can name all the turtles in the Vatican gardens,"" she said. A year ago, the Bergamins moved to Tugun on Queensland's Gold Coast. ""I have to pinch myself nearly every day to think that I've done that,"" Mrs Bergamin said. ""I'm a modern woman in every sense of the word. I love my Chanel bag, but I go to Mass every Sunday.""

186,Turns out TikTok talent Ellie's life as an outback station cook is whetting backpacker appetites globally,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  TikTok talent Ellie's life as an outback Australia station cook is whetting appetites for travel globally When Ellie Daborn moved from England to Australia for a holiday, she never imagined she would end up on a million-hectare cattle station serving meals to 40 people a day. The 26-year-old backpacker and her partner arrived at Newcastle Waters brahman stud station in the Barkly region of the Northern Territory to complete three months of farm work for their visa requirements. Both fell in love with outback life and are now pushing other young people to give it a crack. Ellie is the station cook, serving breakfast, ""smoko"", lunch and dinner for up to 45 people a day. She says It's a challenge but she loves it. She started a TikTok channel to document her life on the land, which has attracted close to 40,000 followers, and she's building a following on Instagram. ""Setting the alarm at 10 to four every morning is a challenge, I don't think I'll ever get used to that, but I love it."" Ellie said. Ellie has done other roles on the station but says being the cook is demanding but rewarding work and she's gathered strong interest on social media. ""Originally I thought the videos would attract a few people, but it seems like a lot of people in Australia who haven't been up to this part of the country are enthusiastic to learn and I felt there was a gap in the market,"" Ellie said. Being 400 kilometres south-east of Darwin, Ellie can't pop to the shops if she needs an ingredient for dinner. Instead, she needs to be organised and plan ahead. ""Once a week I fill in an order that goes to our supermarket and our local wholesaler and the road train delivers our food,"" Ellie said. And with little access to the shops, there's no room for food wastage. ""It forces you out of your comfort zone,"" she said. ""You're thinking, 'What can I make these leftovers into?', and I really like the challenge to re-purpose meals."" Station work is demanding and physically exhausting, so employees need to be well fed. ""They get a fully cooked breakfast, smoko at 9.30am, which is a morning tea where they have cakes and slices and pies, at 12.30pm they have lunch, which is a sandwich or leftovers, and in the evening they have dinner at 7pm,"" Ellie said. With her TikTok and Instagram pages gaining strong followings from young people, Ellie hopes by telling her stories of life as a cattle station cook will inspire others to give remote life a go. ""You have nothing to lose,"" she said. ""People ask me what kind of experience you need. We are just looking for hard-working, enthusiastic people."" ""The stories that I can tell my family are like nothing they have heard before and it feels like a world away.

187,Mixed response to planned redevelopment at famed WA beach,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Cable Beach foreshore revamp draws mixed response from Broome residents Initial plans to redevelop one of Western Australia's best-known and popular beaches have drawn a mixed response, with local officials saying they are open to changes based on community feedback. Concept designs for the $36.5 million Cable Beach redevelopment include an enlarged amphitheatre, water play area, viewing platforms and shaded space for pedestrians and cyclists. Broome Shire Deputy President Desiree Male said the existing foreshore could seem ""underwhelming"". ""A big bitumen car park is taking up the majority of space, so the main concept is to move that car park down and turn it into a wonderful community green space,"" Cr Male said. The firm of landscape architect Josh Byrne has worked on the concept designs. ""Cable Beach is an iconic place and it's an enormous privilege and responsibility to get the design right,"" Dr Byrne said. At the first community information session since the release of the designs, locals raised concerns about beach access routes, access for the elderly and people with disabilities, and the need for suitable car parking. Want more local news? Sign up to the weekly ABC Kimberley email newsletter Dr Byrne said the feedback was ""really constructive"". ""There's always going to be mixed responses and it never ceases to surprise me that you do get good ideas coming through all the time,"" he said. Cars are set to be banned from driving on Broome's Cable Beach during peak turtle nesting season. Johani Mamid, a cultural tourism operator who runs a night-time turtle-nesting experience and other tours on Cable Beach, said he was concerned by the proposed car park relocation. ""With the new design, there's an additional maybe 2km walk for myself and my guests, so it's going to be less appealing, and I have a feeling that I might need to scratch [the turtle experience],"" Mr Mamid said. ""If this is a masterclass tourism attraction, then it's not really working for one of the only cultural tourism operators that operate in that area."" Dr Byrne said his team would now focus on ""digging down"" into those types of concerns. ""There's still time to look at resolving those [issues],"" he said. Attendees at the community meeting were upbeat about the idea of pop-up stalls and food trucks on the foreshore, and there was support for more shade structures. Completed design work is due by May and will include details on public art and interpretative signage. Construction could begin as early as March 2023, and Cr Male said the shire was prepared to adjust plans based on the public's views.

188,Monstrous or magnificent? Contentious Launceston hotel development clears height hurdle,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Launceston Gorge Hotel extra height approved, as opponents bemoan 'monstrous' plan The latest contentious Gorge Hotel development is one step closer to reality after it secured an exemption to Launceston's building height restrictions. The nine-storey, 39-metre-high project has been on the drawing board for seven years and has been dogged by concerns about its height and proximity to Launceston's iconic natural attraction, The Cataract Gorge. The Resource Management and Planning Appeal Tribunal knocked it back in June 2019, however, City of Launceston Council subsequently endorsed a ""specific area plan"" so the hotel could be built — even though it was much higher than the surrounding cityscape. On March 4, the Tasmanian Planning Commission approved that plan in a decision ""very much welcomed"" by developer JAC Group. ""The tribunal refused it because it said unless there was another tall building within 100 metres, it was too high,"" JAC managing director Dean Cocker said. ""But the Tasmanian Planning Commission decision acknowledged that the Launceston cityscape is not like Hobart where you drive down the Brooker [Highway] and you see all of these tall buildings rising like Superman's Palace."" ""In Launceston, we have a three to four-storey cityscape and taller building up to about 39 to 40 metres that pop up, well-separated from each other. ""So you don't get that shadowing and blocking out of views that you see with, say, the Hobart CBD."" The planning commission also weighed the building's height with the project's economic and strategic benefits. Mr Cocker said the hotel would be a similar height to Launceston's Myer building and Peppers Silos Hotel and provide 300 construction jobs, 280 direct and indirect ongoing jobs and $21 million of economic benefit to Launceston. The hotel is set to be built on a 6,025-square-metre property on the edge of the Launceston CBD, on a site currently occupied by a hotel, bottle shop and car park. Community action group Heritage Not Highrise has been fighting the Gorge Hotel project for years and now fears the ""developer has won"". Spokesperson Jim Collier said the project would cause Launceston ""to lose its unique status as a low-rise historical city"". ""It will become just another city and if you want to know what that means just have a look at Hobart."" ""It's a sad day for the Cataract Gorge as it means in time it will have a monstrous building of glass and mirrors right at its entrance."" Mr Collier vowed to keep fighting the project when it returned to Launceston Council to secure development approval. ""It's very difficult for ordinary community groups to take on developers with deep pockets but we'll assess the situation to see if there is anything further we can do,"" he said. ""At the moment it doesn't look good."" ""But with local government elections to be held shortly, this could very well become an election issue and some sitting councillors may well find their positions at risk."" The project has the enthusiastic support of the Tourism Industry Council of Tasmania, whose chief executive Luke Martin said the ""magnificent"" development had ""potential to be a really nationally-significant hotel"". ""I don't think it's that tall and good design, done well, can enhance the city,"" he said. ""I'm confident the developers have the city's best interests at heart."" Mr Martin said Launceston needed investment in high-quality infrastructure to encourage more people to stay in the city, not just visit for the day. He said the Gorge Hotel, alongside other recent developments such as Hotel Verge and Peppers Silo Hotel, were helping to usher in a ""renaissance"" in Launceston. ""I'm really excited about what Launceston might look like in the next five years and our vision for it to be the premier regional visitor destination in the country,"" he said. ""It is well and truly on that path."" JAC Group will spend the next few months refining its development application and hopes to submit plans before the end of June. Launceston's Cataract Gorge is renowned for its ""natural"" beauty — but it took dynamite, the digging up of a swamp and the planting of scores of trees to make it the tourism drawcard it is today. Mr Cocker said the hotel would take another two years to build and understood the public could still object when the plans are once again open for public feedback through the development approval process. ""It's been seven years so far. We think that all of the issues have been examined,"" he said. Launceston Mayor Albert van Zetten believed the Tasmanian Planning Commission had vindicated his council's original decision to green light the project back in 2019. ""The evidence also indicated that the development of a significant visitor accommodation use on the site will support the economic and tourism objections of the City of Launceston and the region without compromising the built heritage of the city,"" he said. ""Confidence is great in the city at the moment. This will just add to the confidence and keep the momentum going.""

189,Trips to the light fantastic: Locals are hoping Lake Cullulleraine display wins approval to help transform region,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Cullulleraine locals hold high hopes for a light show that could be 'phenomenal' for the region Millewa locals say a new light show near Lake Cullulleraine could be ""phenomenal"" for the region, as final funding is sought for the project. British visual artist Bruce Munro, who designed the Field of Light display at Uluru, visited the lake 55 kilometres west of Mildura on Monday, where he plans to install 12,000 solar-powered ""stems of light"". A second exhibition — featuring lights activated simultaneously with music — is also planned to be built on a farm west of the New South Wales town of Wentworth. Mildura Regional Development chief executive Brett Millington says funding is still required for the $9.5 million project, and he hopes the exhibitions are operational by September 2023. Mr Millington said the light display would be located near a walking track on the north side of Lake Cullulleraine on a mixture of Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning and council-owned land, and the exhibitions would be in place for at least five years. Mr Munro said he envisioned the light show as a place for people to ""decompress"". ""We've just come out of COVID, we're just in a terrible time with what's happening in the rest of the world, particularly Ukraine,"" he said. ""So, this is an opportunity for people to escape from their busy lives, come out from the cities, Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney, and also for the locals to come, decompress ... and find a more positive side of life."" Caravan park owner Philip Harmer said increased visitation from the exhibition ""could be huge"" for his business and the surrounding community. ""The farmers here, we've all had it reasonably tough the last four or five years, and of course with COVID, things being open and shut was hard,"" he said. ""But this would be phenomenal. ""It would be great to see a few thousand people in this little area — it's sort of hard to fathom."" Mr Millington said there was ""a lot of positivity"" from all levels of government about providing funding to supplement private investment into the project. ""Hopefully we'll have that [$9.5 million] total secured in the next couple of months,"" he said. ""[It's worth] $130 million a year in terms of our tourism economy — that's based around extending people's stays who are already visiting the region by one night, and by attracting new visitors as well. ""I think it will also put us on the map as a destination for international tourists."" Mr Harmer said he was optimistic the project would soon be given the final go-ahead. ""If it doesn't happen, it'll be a kick in the guts, for sure,"" he said. ""We're just waiting — if it does go ahead, it would just be phenomenal, for the two caravan parks here and for the little pub up the road.""

191,The fact that this part of Australia is so hard to get to is what 'makes it so spectacular',travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tasmania's south-west is a place people fall in love with, but how should tourism be managed in the remote wilderness? There are many reasons why people visit Tasmania's remote south-west. ""Some people love the Indigenous history … some love the terrain, the weather. Each person has their own special connection to this part of Tasmania when they come down here,"" pilot Gavin Groombridge said. Mr Groombridge has been flying bushwalkers and tourists to Melaleuca in the middle of the Southwest National Park since 2017. ""I feel very privileged to be able to come down here so regularly in so many different conditions and show other people this very special part of the world,"" he said. For Tim and Tracey Davis, who both grew up in Tasmania but moved interstate when they were in their 20s, a daytrip to the south-west was on their itinerary for a recent tour of the island state. ""We're back on a bit of a pilgrimage to see the parts that we didn't explore when we lived here,"" Ms Davis said. ""The fact that it's so hard to get to makes it so spectacular."" Mr Davis was also interested in the history of the area. ""I'm in mining so the history of it, how it got opened up with an airstrip and a tin mine,"" he said. Tin mining started at Melaleuca in the 1930s, and continued until 2007. It is now part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. Melaleuca is several days' walk from the nearest road, but the airstrip means it is accessible for day-trippers. It is also the start or end of the Port Davey and South Coast multi-day bushwalk tracks, or the midway point of a longer walk taking in both tracks. Wilderness guide Peter Marmion has been visiting the south-west for the past 50 years, since his first visits as a 12-year-old Scout. ""As I got older I started going to Port Davey in any way I could. I fell in love with the place,"" Mr Marmion said. These days he is an almost full-time guide. ""There's a little bit of religious zeal about it, too, because I want to convert people to understand how precious this country is and how unique."" A seven-day guided walk has been proposed for the South Coast Track, which would include six walkers' huts along the 85km from Melaleuca to Cockle Creek. It was proposed by Ian Johnstone, who sold his business to ASX-listed Experience Co last year. Experience Co has received the proposal documentation as part of the sale. ""The South Coast Track could be one of the most iconic tourism experiences internationally, but we also recognise that this is an incredibly environmentally sensitive and Indigenous sensitive area, and we will work with local stakeholders, the Tasmanian government, and other relevant Indigenous bodies within Tasmania to take this development forward,"" chief executive John O'Sullivan said. ""Our whole model is built around minimising the impact of our infrastructure. We're about small group touring, so we have no more than 10 people on a walk plus experienced guides."" Palawa woman and Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre campaign manager Nala Mansell said the south-west was a significant cultural landscape. ""The tracks that exist at the moment are very close to some of the most ancient Aboriginal heritage that you could find anywhere in the state, so there's huge concern on behalf of the Aboriginal community about what an influx of further tourism would do to those sites and what building or further infrastructure could potentially damage or destroy ancient heritage,"" Ms Mansell said. The Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre has been pushing for Aboriginal ownership of Crown lands. Ms Mansell said at the very least, Aboriginal people should be involved in any development plans from the very beginning. ""Unfortunately, we have been completely shut out of this process so far … The South Coast Track is so significant and important to our people, we should be the ones who are consulted at the very start,"" she said. Mr Marmion said the walking track and hut proposal was ""inappropriate and ill conceived"". ""What we've got to do with World Heritage areas is shift the infrastructure outside the World Heritage area … I don't want to be seen as anti-everything but I'm certainly anti-development in the World Heritage Area,"" he said. Wilderness Society Tasmania campaign manager Tom Allen said the state government's ""policy settings were all wrong"". ""The Wilderness Society supports and wants to see a thriving nature tourism sector alongside thriving ecosystems and properly protected and respected wild areas, national parks and World Heritage."" Mr Allen said the proposal for the South Coast Track was one example of privatising World Heritage land. ""It's our understanding that what's proposed is six luxury lodges … that will involve a significant amount of land clearing,"" he said. ""The more you develop wilderness the more it declines."" The proposal was made as part of the state government's call for developments in national parks, which started in 2014. Parks Minister Jacquie Petrusma said Tasmania's natural and cultural assets were ""an important driver for our regional economies and we want to be a leader in ecotourism"". ""However, we understand this must be achieved through culturally sensitive and environmentally sustainable visitation to our national parks, reserves and Crown lands,"" Ms Petrusma said. One proposal in the World Heritage Area, for a standing camp on Halls Island at Lake Malbena with helicopter access, has been dropped — for now — after the developer decided not to continue a court battle to win approval. The company behind it, however, has said it planned to reapply for planning approval. Ms Petrusma said the tourism master plan for the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, released last year, ""strikes the right balance by providing diverse, high-quality, environmentally sustainable visitor experiences at the same time as conserving and protecting the cultural and natural heritage values that underpin the significance of the TWWHA"". Mr Marmion said there were other ways to attract people to Tasmania for walking holidays. ""I have a vision of walking tracks similar to what you have in Europe and North America, like the Camino and the Cross Britain [Way]."" He said he would like to see a track from Mount Wellington to Recherche Bay through the Huon Valley, and another from Launceston to Hobart via the Eastern or Great Western tiers, taking advantage of accommodation and services already in place. ""That would have enormous international appeal,"" Mr Marmion said.

192,"WA is open but the state's north-west could be kept waiting for flights to Bali, east coast",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Northern West Australians itching to return to Bali will have to wait a while longer for the return of direct flights to the region. WA's hard border reopened to interstate and international travellers on Thursday after almost 700 days. Port Hedland International Airport chief executive Dave Batic said residents were desperate to know when they would be able to fly directly from the mining town to Bali. ""That's the first question they ask, 'When is Bali coming back on?',"" he said. ""I've only been here for a very short time but everyone I've met so far either lives in Bali or has family in Bali or visits there. ""There's a huge eagerness to get Bali back on again."" Mr Batic said Virgin Australia had announced it would resume its Port Hedland to Bali service. ""Tickets are on sale now but the date at this stage we believe is November, but that could be brought forward,"" he said. ""It's a tourism destination, always has been, but I think with the proximity to Bali from Port Hedland it is a natural option for people who want to live there. ""So, I think you know Bali will continue to be a great option for liveability for locals and as a residential option. ""Bali has opened up, they want tourists to come back, but obviously they want their residents back there as well."" Mr Batic said as well as the resumption of flights to Bali, discussions were underway to reinstate direct flights between Port Hedland and Brisbane and Melbourne. ""I think the demand for the direct east coast destinations will come on again in probably the next six to 12 months,"" he said. The Chamber of Minerals and Energy said it was looking interstate to fill worker shortages in the local mining industry and tens of thousands of extra workers would be needed over the next five years. Western Australia is expected to record almost 500,000 COVID-19 cases in six months, according to long-awaited Omicron modelling. ""Most people in WA who want a job at the moment have one and so we need to access workers from somewhere else,"" chief executive Paul Everingham said. ""The best place to start is interstate and then if that's not enough, then you look overseas."" Mr Batic said he expected the resource sector would drive demand for more interstate flights. ""With the borders coming down and the desperate need for a workforce here, we think that'll be the first indication of increased traffic through the region,"" he said. While reinstating flights to Bali would be a priority, Mr Batic said other international destinations were also being considered. ""We do want to look at other markets such as Singapore and possibly the Philippines or Jakarta,"" he said.

193,"analysis: WA's border is finally open, but even the Premier admits it won't lead to 'tourism nirvana' overnight",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Premier Mark McGowan has hailed WA's long-awaited reopening as a ""new chapter"" for the state. Yesterday, as the border fell, he acknowledged the next month would be challenging but spoke with hope of the ""better times"" ahead. The uncomfortable reality, though, is those better times are still some way off for many. COVID infections are expected to peak in the next month or so, with business-crippling restrictions expected to stay until we reach the other end. But the longer-term effects of those rules will linger and the numbers of tourists and skilled workers needed to come into the state aren't expected to bounce back for at least another year. And while the government has tried to help with a handful of support packages, freebies and some toy quokkas, it's quickly becoming clear it won't be enough to soften the blow of what's ahead. ""This is a big day for a lot of Western Australians,"" Mr McGowan said yesterday. And it certainly was, with no shortage of heart-wrenching family reunions more than 700 days after the first border restrictions were imposed. But it was also a big day for the spread of the virus, with the total number of daily infections topping the 2,000 mark for the first time. It was just 21 days ago that WA first recorded more than 100 cases, and only last week that the figure crossed into four digits. WA's new restrictions include a mask mandate in primary schools and caps on home visitors. Here's a guide to help you navigate the changes. That rapid spread has triggered a swathe of restrictions, the most strict of which came into effect yesterday and capped venues to the two-square-metre rule, but only up to 150 patrons. Some have decided to keep their doors open and make do, but for others like live music venue Freo Social, it's just not worth it. Businesses that see at least a 50 per cent reduction in turnover through any four-week period this year can receive somewhere between $7,500 and $50,000 in support. For larger venues, they'll be a three-month payroll tax waiver. But the head of the local hospitality lobby, Bradley Woods, questioned whether that would support every business that needed it. ""Hospitality is a seasonal industry, so if a venue has a 40 per cent decline in revenue over what is meant to be the busiest period of the year, they will quickly find themselves in a perilous financial position, yet unable to access assistance,"" he said. Throughout the past two years, the tourism industry has been one of the loudest voices calling for WA to rejoin the rest of the world. Some in the sector have flourished as West Australians have been forced to holiday at home, but it's put a huge squeeze on others who have missed out on international tourism dollars. Tourism Minister Roger Cook pointed to the bright side, assuring there was pent up demand from people in the east wanting to head west. But even the Premier has acknowledged a tourism rebound is some way off. ""I know some people think there'll be some sort of tourism nirvana come about, but it's not going to happen,"" he said earlier in the week. That sentiment has been backed up by Ryan Mossny, who founded a company that runs walking tours in Perth's CBD. Looking at future bookings, he's not expecting a significant change until later this year. ""People have already made their plans for what they're going to do during the northern hemisphere winter, and so we've missed out on that for this year,"" he told ABC Radio Perth. ""As we move into wintertime, I think that we'll start to see people come over from the east coast, but certainly not at the level that we had prior to the pandemic."" On top of earlier announcements, the government was this week handing out experience vouchers and toy quokkas to some arrivals. It was also announced that a $12 million advertising campaign would begin along the eastern seaboard today to try to entice people west. Confirmed cases so far: 871,777 Active cases: 28,603 Cases in hospital: 260 Deaths: 370 WA population aged 16+ triple-dosed: 82.5 per cent Latest information from the WA Health Department But that's little comfort for an industry that's lost $4 billion and 20,000 jobs since the start of the pandemic, according to the state's Tourism Council. It would like to see a ""sizeable"" support package to help keep the decimated industry afloat. With the government's piecemeal approach to these types of things, it's entirely possible that more support is on the horizon. Whether it arrives in time for struggling businesses though is an entirely separate question. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Farmers are still a way off from recovering too, after a challenging two years trying to find skilled staff. With borders now open and international workers who travel the world chasing seasonal work allowed in once more, things will start to improve. WAFarmers grains section president Mic Fels provided an interesting perspective on the border opening. ""It feels like the last scene in Groundhog Day where you wake up and there's a new song on the radio and a different scene out the window, and the border is open,"" he said. But he said farmers would still be faced with the equivalent of deciding whether ""you want a caravanner doing your accounts this year, or do you want someone fresh out of school with no qualifications running your administration"". Faced with a global skills crunch, he's not optimistic the drought of workers skilled in operating complex farm machinery will be resolved within the next year. After almost two years of being closed off, WA has finally thrown open its border. But as Jacob Kagi writes, things are far from back to normal. WA's reopening is undoubtedly an important step the state needed to take, but it's not the end of the road. The Premier's decision to keep the state isolated for so long has helped it develop one of the strongest economies in the world over the past two years by ring-fencing its vital mining industry. It also looks set to have protected the health system from the worst of the virus. ""But the reality is everything in this pandemic is a choice, and there are consequences for each of these choices,"" Mr McGowan said on Tuesday. And while some of those consequences have already played out, there are just as many that lie ahead.

194,SA Premier defends $416k tourism grant for TV personality 'Cosi',travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Premier 'delighted' with SA Tourism grant for Andrew 'Cosi' Costello's luxury lodges South Australian Premier Steven Marshall has defended an SA Tourism Commission decision to award a generous grant to television personality and tourism show host Andrew ""Cosi"" Costello, saying he is ""delighted"" by the move. The $416,000 handout will go towards the construction of two luxury lodges on Mr Costello's Adelaide Hills sheep farm at Woodside which, according to the commission's website, will also include ""a helipad for additional access and touring options"". The commission said it was one of 114 projects to benefit so far from the $20 million Tourism Industry Development Fund (TIDF), launched in September 2020 to rejuvenate the sector amid the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""The Woodside Lodge project was assessed just the same as all of the other applications,"" a spokesperson said. ""The purpose of the TIDF is to stimulate private sector investment in new and improved regional accommodation, and the development of quality tourism products."" Mr Costello's television show, South Aussie with Cosi, screened on Channel Seven, seeks to showcase the state as a tourism destination. Shadow Treasurer Stephen Mullighan questioned the decision to award the grant, saying ""taxpayers simply can't have any confidence that that was the highest and best use for those funds"". He described it as a ""slap in the face"" to other tourism operators. ""I'm sure there are many people who have got tourism operations within a helicopter ride of Adelaide … that would have enjoyed the opportunity to put their case forward,"" he said. But the Premier said the grant was one of many to the sector, and that it had been assessed ""independently of the government"" by the SA Tourism Commission (SATC)  — a statutory authority. ""I haven't provided any money to anybody — it's been done independently through the SATC, it's a completely independent process,"" Mr Marshall said. ""We don't have any oversight over who is awarded contracts but I must say I was delighted when I learnt for the very first time this morning when I opened up the paper to see that that project in Woodside is going to go ahead. ""This is one of 114 fantastic projects in the Tourism Industry Development Fund."" Treasurer Rob Lucas was also asked about the project on ABC Radio Adelaide this morning. He said he was unaware of the grant, but added: ""The mere fact that you have a name and you're a media identity doesn't automatically preclude you if you meet the other eligibility guidelines"". Mr Costello has been contacted for comment.

196,SA travellers line up to enter WA as restrictions finally lift,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The West Australian border has reopened after almost two years, prompting a wave of relief as an estimated 100 travellers from South Australia waited to cross over after midnight. Domestic travellers and returning WA residents from interstate are required to be triple vaccinated against COVID-19, have a special pass and undertake a rapid antigen test upon arrival. Some travellers on the Nullarbor have waited two years to make the journey. WA's border with SA was open for a brief period late last year, but the restrictions were reinstated in December because of outbreaks in SA. Nullarbor Roadhouse site manager Dorothy Williams is delighted to see more traffic. ""I'm really excited about it opening up again and seeing a lot more people coming through,” she said. “And really excited for the people that [previously] haven't been able to get through as well. ""I think a lot more people will just decide to get out on the road again and see where it takes them."" ""We're fully booked tonight which is really good; we're very excited and I hope everybody else is excited about coming across the Nullarbor and seeing us."" Daniel Brown is one of many who has been waiting for the border to open. ""I'm heading over tomorrow morning as early as I feel like waking up,” he said. ""I'm heading over for a job, and I've been gone for a couple of years and just feel like heading back — going to be home again."" ""I tried to get a job; I think the job started the process of getting me over there in November, but it made it really difficult because we didn't know when borders were opening or if they were going to be closed permanently.” ""It meant at some point I might not even have a job if the border stayed shut and I couldn't get in."" Border Village manager Alan Byers says the business is booked out. ""A lot of people have arrived here thinking they're going to get accommodation and there is none,” he said. ""This is our sixth week here, so it's been a real baptism of fire in that time. “My wife and I have never done anything like this before and, other than last week, every week's been full-on.” Mr Byers hopes that business will return to pre-COVID days. ""We think it'll get back to something like it was, pre-COVID. Now that Western Australia has had COVID now they'll keep the border open ... and the traffic between the border will even out,” he said. Nullarbor roadhouse staff said trucks did help to maintain business. ""We do have a lot of trucks that come through and stay so we're really thankful that the trucks have been coming through and they've still been staying, even though it's not been the volume that we would have been used to before COVID,"" Ms Williams said. “But we just take every day as it comes. ""Some of them are really excited about getting home,” “A lot of them are taking the opportunity to travel around Australia and see the beautiful countryside and then we've got ones that have really just been waiting to see their new grandchildren, getting back to their own house into their own environment again.""

197,Tearful reunions in Perth as WA throws doors open after almost two years behind hard border,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Western Australia is open after the state's hard border was removed overnight. Vaccinated travellers are also pouring over the border by road ""Come home now"" was the message to West Australians when it was announced the state would be closed to the rest of the country from April 5, 2020, over fears of the spread of COVID-19. ""We'll be turning Western Australia into an island within an island — our own country,"" Premier Mark McGowan said. Almost two years later, 697 days to be exact, WA has opened back up to Australia and the world. There were tears of joy as the first plane touched down just after midnight. Among the first to arrive was federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese. For many, March 3 will mean reuniting with loved ones for the first time since the pandemic began. ""I have my family back together again,"" one father said at the airport. Some returning West Australians have not been home in almost two years. ""I can't believe [my daughter] is here. I still don't believe it,"" a mother said. Amal Suleiman and her family landed from Melbourne this morning, with Ms Suleiman saying it was hard to explain how good it felt to be back in the state. “I can’t believe it, I’m just so happy,” she said. Travellers are also crossing through the state's open border by road. A queue of those coming in from South Australia formed at the Eucla road checkpoint overnight, with some flagging fears the border could close again. Chris drove from Brisbane, bringing his wife and dog back to Western Australia. He moved to WA back in December when the border was expected to open on February 5. After almost two years of being closed off, WA has finally thrown open its border. But as Jacob Kagi writes, things are far from back to normal. They faced another month waiting to be reunited after Mr McGowan shifted the date, citing the Omicron outbreak in the east and the need to reach a higher third-dose vaccination rate. The couple got out of Brisbane just as the floods started and had been driving since Sunday to make the crossing. Chris thought the queue forming at the border was a product of uncertainty. ""He'll just backflip and close the border again,"" he said. ""They'll get a couple of cases and that, close the borders again and it's all over."" Lauren and Harley were crossing shortly after with their kids asleep in the back. They are on an extended road trip trying to lap Australia, but they hit an impenetrable wall in the west. ""[We've been] trying to get in since February 1,"" Harley said. They got stuck in South Australia and Victoria before the word came down that WA was open for business, and were also worried it might not last. ""We were sort of getting words from other people it was going to shut again and then we just thought we better get there while we can,"" Harley said. Hugh Hunter was on his way from New South Wales to jackaroo at Spring Creek Station in the Kimberley. He crossed at the Northern Territory border and said it was a massive relief to be able to enter the state. These are some of the everyday Australians who have been impacted by two years of strict border controls in WA. “I’ve been looking forward to going down to work on the station for like, three years or more, all my life,"" he said. ""I’m going to chase a few cattle and ride a few horses, do all the cowboy stuff. I’m keen. “It’s just a massive relief to be able to finally get here and do it.” He said if the border rules had been relaxed any later in the year the work might not have been there. Rex and Judy Booth left their Geraldton home in April last year to visit their children and grandchildren in the Northern Territory. They have been trying to get back to WA since Christmas. ""We couldn’t afford to quarantine, which was going to cost about $2,500, so we were just waiting for when we could come through and not quarantine,"" Ms Booth said. ""[It's] wonderful, we can’t get over it, it’s unreal. Really happy and we’re just glad we’re on the other side now. ""My face is aching that much I’m just so excited to get through, it’s like winning the lotto."" About 6,000 interstate arrivals are expected inside the first two days of the reopening. Ten international flights – from Dubai, Singapore, Doha, Kuala Lumpur, and Auckland – will bring in another 2,000 arrivals by Friday. While vaccinated arrivals are no longer required to quarantine, measures such as mask wearing, proof of vaccination and venue capacity limits are still in place. WA's new restrictions include a mask mandate in primary schools and caps on home visitors. Here's a guide to help you navigate the changes. ""Coming back from Sydney, it's really like going back in time,"" one woman who landed in Perth on the first flight back said. But she did not mind wearing a mask if it meant she could see her family. WA's original border opening date was scrapped due to the Premier's concerns over low booster vaccination rates. Less than a month later, just under 70 per cent of West Australians aged 16 and older have received their booster dose. West Australians now have the chance to reacclimatise to quarantine-free travel, with hopes the hard border is a thing of the past. ""It helps having Zoom and videos calls … but I'm so happy to see her again,"" a husband said at the airport. Despite surging case numbers and an air of uncertainty, little will take away from this moment so many have been waiting for.

198,Why this NT tour guide will ask tourists to wear masks after the mandate ends,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus The NT's mandatory mask mandate will lift on Monday, but tour guide Rob Woods plans to keep asking travellers to wear one in enclosed spaces and when mingling with other groups until the risk of community transmission plummets. ""If the government says you can go out there and not wear masks, well I disagree with that, we're going to wear masks,"" Mr Woods said. ""We're getting everyone to wear masks in the bus, and that'll continue for as long as we think community transmission is a possibility."" The chief minister has announced the NT's mask mandate will end on Monday, with authorities confident the peak of its Omicron outbreak has now passed. People will still need to wear masks in high-risk settings such as health and aged care facilities, but outside of that, they'll only need to wear one if they choose to. But Mr Woods, who runs tours across the Top End including in Kakadu National Park, wants to do everything he can to keep staff, travellers and the broader community safe. ""I think we're getting a little bit ahead of ourselves in thinking we've overcome COVID,"" he said. The NT re-opened its borders in December last year and has recently welcomed back fully-vaccinated international tourists. This means this dry season — the NT's peak tourism period — overseas arrivals will be back in Kakadu and other national parks for the first time since the start of the pandemic. And Mr Woods is not the only Northern Territory guide taking extra steps to avoid any potential spread of coronavirus. Tourism Top End General Manager Glen Hingley says his organisation is now seeking legal advice about what they can — and can not — include in a voluntary code of conduct for tour operators in Kakadu National Park. ""In the same way as a retail or hospitality venue can say, 'no shirt, no shoes, no service', where do the rights of tourism operators stop and start when it comes to vaccination and health policies?"" Mr Hingley said. ""Importantly, we don't want to be discriminating against people."" Mr Hingley said the idea of developing a code arose at a recent meeting between tour operators and Traditional Owners. It aims to give confidence to future travellers and assurances to Traditional Owners that guides are doing all they can to minimise potential risks. ""Sadly, after a long time of being COVID-free, the territory has COVID in and amongst pretty much all communities,"" Mr Hingley said. ""And with international tourists coming back into the country, there was a degree of concern of what could come in from overseas."" Although the exact details were still under development, Mr Hingley said the code would likely include a clause to only accept fully vaccinated international travellers and a commitment to immediately leave the park if anyone developed COVID-like symptoms. Mr Hingley was hopeful the proposed code would be fully developed before Kakadu re-opened to the majority of tourists in April. Justin O'Brien is the chief executive of Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, which represents the Mirarr Traditional Owners. He welcomed the plan to develop a code of conduct for Kakadu tour guides. ""The majority of people I speak to in the Indigenous community are positive about the return of international tourism,"" Mr O'Brien said. ""People understand that there are additional measures and protections in place when it comes to the park that are even above the CHO directions."" Mr O'Brien said Kakadu was a group destination: with many of the big attractions such as boat cruises and rock art tours operated by Indigenous people. He said a voluntary industry-led code would be more ""sustainable"" than mandates in the long term. Mr Woods said although ""in principal"" he welcomed the proposal to develop a code, most local operators were aware of their obligations and already committed to protecting the park: with many considering taking similar steps to his company. ""I don't see any point in running tours anywhere if you're leaving a negative result behind: simple as that,"" he said.

199,Leave off the location: Nature pays a price as social media drives people into the wilderness,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Calls to rethink geotagging of social media posts depicting Tasmania's sensitive wilderness Social media has exposed the wider world to remote and beautiful wilderness once only seen in coffee table books, at slide nights or by the eyes of an adventurous few. So while the instagrammable aesthetics of these locations inspire more people to head out into Tasmania's wild areas, their new-found popularity is coming at a price. ""In a nature perspective it makes locations that were not as well known much more known and visited,"" said Mark Williams, a lecturer in physical geography and spatial science at the University of Tasmania. ""More people are out in nature experiencing the mental and physical benefits, but some places are becoming degraded as more and more people visit these fragile sites."" He pointed to Wellington Park's Disappearing Tarn, which was once only known through local knowledge, and Lake Rhona in the south-west, which became popular via social media but started having issues with toilet paper litter. ""When you're sharing your photographs from your trips, it's fine to share them, but think about sharing some of the more sensitive locations with just small groups of people rather than your entire network. ""Consider stripping the geotag from some of the photographs of particularly sensitive areas."" Mr Williams said geotagging in its basic sense was location information added to a file — like a phone with GPS adding information to a photo. In a social media sense, it's ""checking in"" or adding a location to a post or photo so the audience can find the location. ""In the past you may have had certain people that were part of wilderness organisations or bought photography books and that would have shown people these beautiful locations, but it wouldn't have been widespread,"" he said. ""Now we see them in our daily feeds. ""People are now visiting these places a lot more than they did in the past."" Tasmanian bushwalker and photographer Dan Broun said the rise of social media had led to tracks getting crowded. ""Numbers have increased, it's now harder to find solitude in the national parks,"" he said. He said he'd had to re-think his own social media footprint in the past decade. ""If it's a sensitive landscape, I don't post a location."" He said the demographic of people experiencing nature had changed. ""With that has come a lack of understanding of how to walk and the seven principles of 'leave no trace'."" Mr Broun said he had noticed people leaving rubbish, ""space invading"", not sticking to tracks, using drones and camping at inappropriate spots. ""There's even reports of people getting shirty with each other where there's limited camping."" He said Lake Oberon, a difficult walk in the south-west, was getting 30 to 40 people camping near it when it could handle about 12. Mr Williams said it was unwise to use social media as a bushwalking guide, and the responsibility for safety could not be placed with the Parks and Wildlife Service. ""The individual needs to do the work rather than an organisation telling them to be prepared,"" he said. He suggested people join a bushwalking club or buy books and guides and learn through ""baby steps"", rather than undertaking difficult walks with no experience. Mr Broun said he regularly observed track users attempting to undertake challenging walks with no understanding of the length or difficulty level. ""People think they can day walk into Lake Oberon and don't do their research,"" he said. ""There's going to be a couple of young kids who see something on Instagram and they will get a bright idea to do it in winter. ""There will be a tragedy; I don't know when, but there will be one."" He said many people in the bushwalking community were calling for caution, and that it was not coming from a place of self-interest. ""If the tracks are good, I want people to go out there and enjoy bushwalking. ""We're worried about the environment getting damaged, we're worried about our own experience being impacted, but we are also worried about people hurting themselves or dying."" Mr Broun said he was concerned for Tasmania's wilderness now that interstate and international borders were open. Over summer, Cradle Mountain experienced some of its busiest days on record. ""Nature has had a bit of a reprieve, but it's going to ramp up and already has this summer,"" he said. ""The numbers are so high that in the Walls of Jerusalem, the toilets are overflowing — they can't get the helicopters in quick enough to empty the poo pods."" He said people's digital footprints needed to evolve. ""The numbers are definitely up and managing those numbers is going to be the biggest problem for the parks service. ""If you're posting online about places that are sensitive that involve nature and wilderness, consider the seven principles of 'leave no trace'."" Parks and Wildlife Service acting deputy secretary Stuart Fletcher said the Leave No Trace principles were promoted extensively to encourage users to leave natural areas as they found them. ""Increased visitor numbers to Tasmania's parks and reserves creates a challenge with ensuring we minimise the impact to our environment,"" Mr Fletcher said. ""Leaving no trace in our wilderness areas also includes burying or carrying out human waste if there are no toilets, or the toilets are out of action."" He said PWS have introduced a free voluntary online registration system for overnight walks, which assists in managing the number of people in huts and campsites, and reduces the potential for long-term damage to fragile and remote bushwalking environments.   ""The PWS also employs Wilderness Rangers who provide education and advice to walkers on some of the state's most pristine locations through the summer season.""

200,"WA is at a major turning point in the pandemic — bringing not only relief, but anxiety too",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  For Brittany Garbutt, the challenge of trying to run a business spanning Perth and Melbourne has been immense for the last two years. But, after more than 700 days of border restrictions, travel into Western Australia will once again be free — at least for vaccinated people — from tomorrow. More than 50,000 travellers have already flown into WA with exemptions since border rules were eased on February 5. But once quarantine-free travel begins tomorrow, about 8,000 arrivals are expected to make their way through Perth Airport in two days alone. WA's new restrictions include a mask mandate in primary schools and caps on home visitors. Here's a guide to help you navigate the changes. Around a quarter are due to come from overseas, arriving on flights from Dubai, Singapore, Doha, Kuala Lumpur and Auckland. The remaining travellers will jet in from across Australia on at least 40 flights over two days. It marks a major turning point in WA's experience of the pandemic, and will surely bring relief to families, friends and businesses that have been kept apart by the state's hard border. Ms Garbutt is behind a chain of bright pink Pretzel stores across Perth and Melbourne that have amassed more than 25,000 followers on Instagram. It has been more than six months since she was last able to travel to Melbourne and meet her staff face-to-face, but now a trip east is just two weeks away. ""It's all very dry on Zoom, and at the end of the day there is nothing better than being able to physically be within your company, with your staff in-store and to see what's going on,"" she said. Travelling in the last month was an option but, like many, she said the challenges of quarantining for a week proved too great. With an expansion to Singapore put on hold by the inability to travel and general border uncertainty, Ms Garbutt said she felt much more confident this reopening would stick. ""I don't think that there is much reversing once we've let in internationals,"" she said. ""When borders were opened and then closed it was about rewinding, trying to get us back to that no COVID [position]. ""I just don't think it's possible now, and so I'm quite confident that when they open … it'll stay that way."" But it was a different story for disability advocate Natalia Hodgins who, in early February, was pleased the reopening had been delayed. She has myalgic encephalomyelitis, a complex, multi-system disease that can bring on severe fatigue. It also means Ms Hodgins is immunocompromised, placing her at significant risk if she contracts COVID. But now, she is more concerned about the lack of support for immunocompromised people as case numbers rise. ""Being immunocompromised in this pandemic means being forced to play Russian roulette with your life, every decision could have fatal consequences,"" she said. Confirmed cases so far: 871,777 Active cases: 28,603 Cases in hospital: 260 Deaths: 370 WA population aged 16+ triple-dosed: 82.5 per cent Latest information from the WA Health Department ""It makes it even more difficult when people try to minimise the situation by saying, 'everyone's going to get it' or 'we just have to learn to live with the virus'. ""None of us want to be in this situation and when you dismiss our efforts to protect ourselves. You're saying our lives don't matter."" Ms Hodgins said she was living in a self-imposed lockdown to try to limit her risk of infection. She said easier access to rapid antigen tests, N95 masks and working from home for both people who were at risk, and their families and carers, should be considered as case numbers rose. The border opening was supposed to happen on February 5, the date Premier Mark McGowan said at the time was locked in ""barring some unforeseen emergency or catastrophe which we can't predict"". Omicron delivered ""a whole new ball game"" and prompted the date to be indefinitely pushed back, as detailed in a late-night press conference on January 20. But a turning point in WA's battle with the virus came about three weeks ago on Thursday, February 10 — the last time the state recorded more travel-related cases than local infections. Within a week, travel cases went from accounting for about three-quarters of WA's daily totals to just 5 per cent. It meant the greater threat was from the accelerating spread of cases locally, and the justification for keeping border restrictions was rapidly evaporating. Mr McGowan acknowledged as much when he announced the new reopening date two weeks ago. ""There comes a point where the border is redundant because we'll already have the growth of cases here. Having the border is no longer effective,"" he said. But Mr McGowan maintained waiting a little longer, until March 3, would help get WA's vaccination rates even higher. That is certainly now the case, with WA's booster dose rate sitting at 64 per cent yesterday. West Australians may be sceptical after the previous border plan was ditched, but this time the state should be opening for real. A reopening on February 5 would have occurred with about half as many people protected by a third dose. Mr McGowan said the delay had meant West Australians had avoided the imposition of even tougher restrictions. ""That's because we've got our third dose vaccination rate up and because we delayed the border reopening, which meant we didn't get that massive community spread,"" he said yesterday. ""We saved a great many lives and a great many people from getting sick."" Those factors have also saved WA's health system from being unable to cope with a surge in cases, according to Australian Medical Association WA president Mark Duncan-Smith. ""What it has done is allowed us to really nail down clinical guidelines, protocols, lines of communication, methods of transportation — effectively, to allow us to use the resources that we have got available more efficiently,"" he said. A combination of restrictions and a higher booster dose rate would also help protect more people from ending up in hospital. ""That means our medical system should cope, it shouldn't be overrun,"" Dr Duncan-Smith said. ""We shouldn't see increased problems of not having enough equipment, enough staff, enough beds, and we should be able to handle the workload."" Dr Duncan-Smith said those difference made WA a ""unique social experiment to the whole of the world"" as the state prepared to fully reopen. Only time will tell how that experiment will end, and whether WA will get the ""soft landing"" Mr McGowan has long hoped for.

201,NT Parks hiking and camping booking system experiences 'teething issues',travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Northern Territory Parks hiking and camping booking system experiences 'teething issues' on day one of rollout Adventure-seekers keen to experience some of the Northern Territory's most spectacular multi-day hikes have waited hours online after a long-awaited booking system experienced glitches on the first day of its rollout. Some users reported the location on their personal booking profile being automatically changed from Alice Springs to Alabama in the United States. Others were redirected to the Queensland national parks website through a booking confirmation email. Parks and Wildlife Commission executive director Sally Egan apologised for the website's issues. ""We are currently experiencing teething issues that go with introducing new outward-facing systems and we apologise for the system sluggishness this morning,"" she said in a statement. A $1.34 million contract to set up the booking website was awarded to New York-based company, US eDirect almost a year ago. ""US eDirect are working flat out behind the scenes to rectify the issue,"" Ms Egan said. From today, the honesty box payment system at designated campsites across the NT has been replaced by a mandatory online prepaid system. The multi-day walking fee at this stage only applies to the three most popular trails in the Northern Territory: the Jatbula Trail in Nitmiluk National Park, the Larapinta Trail in the West MacDonnell Ranges and Tabletop Track in Litchfield National Park. It costs $25 per day per person to walk on the trails and the cost is capped at $125 per person, regardless of the length of the walk. There are also additional camping fees, ranging from $4 per night for a single adult to access basic facilities to $20 per night for a premium campground. The new fees apply to everyone aged five and older. According to the NT Department of Environment, Parks and Water Security website, the benefits of the new system include staff having access to statistics and reporting on visitor numbers. The website also listed ""visitor certainty and satisfaction"" and the ability to ""view open/closed parks, available dates and have greater planning options"" as benefits. Each campsite along the 62-kilometre length of the Jatbula Trail was already restricted to a maximum of 15 people. There are currently no capacity limits on the Tabletop Track and the Larapinta Trail. All designated campsites in the NT must now be pre-booked and paid for in advance, eliminating the possibility of spontaneous camping trips. Ms Egan acknowledged this would be a significant adjustment for Territorians and said the Parks and Wildlife Commission was doing all it could to ensure a smooth transition to the new system. Free Wi-Fi services will be extended for 12 months at Wangi Falls, Karlu Karlu and Watarrka and a telephone customer service team is available seven days a week during business hours. Ms Egan said park rangers would be available to assist travellers with making bookings, where possible. She also said signs notifying of the new system were going up in airports, and that the Parks and Wildlife Commission was working with other jurisdictions and the tourism industry to get the word out. ""This booking system will take the pressure off trying to rush to your favourite campsite on a Friday after work only to discover it is full and you have to turn around and go home,"" Ms Egan said. ""It will also ensure Parks receive vital revenue to help maintain them for generations to come.""

202,Heritage train tour of regional Victoria sparks grassfire,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Grassfire near Ararat caused by a heritage train tour A heritage train touring Victoria with rail enthusiasts aboard has caused a ""challenging"" grassfire near Ararat in the state's west. The fires occurred on Saturday at Langi Logan and were caused by sparks from the train made up of three locomotives hauling carriages from the 1937 Spirit of Progress. Seymour Railway Heritage Centre organised the tour which travelled from Seymour to Ararat via Broadmeadows and Geelong with 170 people onboard. The group's president John Crofts said sticking brakes on one of the locomotives was the likely cause of the sparks which then caused the fires. ""The train was immediately stopped and the matter was attended to and ultimately rectified,"" Mr Crofts said. ""Unfortunately some brakes, or some metal parts, started sparking and caused [about] six fires along a kilometre-and-a-half area,"" said Bernie Fradd, CFA chief fire officer for the Ararat region. Mr Fradd said the fires merged into three, burning a total area of around 71 hectares. ""It's as dry as it's been all year … it doesn't take much wind at all with the dry conditions for fires to really get up and kick along a bit, so it was fairly challenging to put that out,"" he said. ""If it had been a bad summer's day that fire would still be going."" Six aircraft and 20 CFA trucks responded to the fire and Mr Fradd said many private firefighting units operated by local farmers also fought the blazes. While the fires burnt through stubble paddocks, some fences, and down to the edge of the Hopkins River where old redgum trees were lost, Mr Fradd said houses and livestock were spared. A spokesperson for the Australian Rail Track Corporation said the organisation is aware of an incident that occurred on the network between Ararat and Maroona on Saturday. ""Incidents such as this are a rare occurrence and an investigation is currently underway into the matter,"" the spokesperson said. A V/Line spokesperson said it was working with the relevant authorities as part of investigations into the incident. Tourist and heritage rail operators in Australia are overseen by the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator (ONRSR). An ONRSR spokesperson said the organisation had not yet received any reports regarding the incident on the weekend. To ensure the safe retreat of the train, Mr Fradd said firefighting crews were stationed along the rail line in the dry paddock area near Ararat so the train could continue back to Seymour. ""In case there was another fire they were going to be on it straight away,"" Mr Fradd said. A passenger commenting on social media said the train did not arrive back to Seymour until around midnight. ""We had a great day that stretched into the next day by the time we got home, but it just added to the excitement of the day,"" Matthew Hope wrote. Mr Fradd said the CFA would continue to patrol the burnt areas to ensure there are no flare-ups until the region receives sufficient rain.

203,Tourism 'gem mine' lay abandoned under the floor of this cafe for decades,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  'Gem mine' tourism attraction Fantasy Land lay abandoned under Kalbarri cafe for decades When Colleen Bubb first started working at a cafe in the West Australian tourist town of Kalbarri, she knew nothing of the treasures hidden beneath its floor. For under the cafe sat a long-forgotten ""gem mine"" tourist attraction – with thousands of semi-precious stones embedded in the walls. Later, when Mrs Bubb and her husband Glenn bought the cafe, they decided to again unearth the attraction for visitors. The reopening sparked an avalanche of memories for long-time Kalbarri residents who remember the attraction as a virtual Aladdin's cave of treasures. In 1976, Kalbarri locals Gwyn and Cliff Ross decided to try their hand at tourism in their semi-retirement years. Mrs Ross was an avid doll collector and so opened The House of Little People to showcase what became a collection of 4,000 dolls from across the world. So popular was the doll exhibit that it is said to have won the crown of the ""best geographical collection of dolls in the world"" at the Festival of Dolls in Poland in 1980. Mr Ross was more of a rock man, so he added to the attraction by opening a gem ""mine"" in which he embedded 2,000 semi-precious stones into the walls of an underground cellar to showcase their beauty. Visitors would descend down a staircase into the ""mine"" to wonder at gems such as tiger eye, amethyst and mookaite, as well as coal and a whole lot more, sparkling from the walls. A pretend railway track, cart and historical mining paraphernalia added to the mine-like atmosphere. Together the somewhat incongruous mix of dolls, gems and other oddities, like bottles and fossils, became known as Fantasy Land. While it would possibly be regarded as gloriously kitsch today, in its heyday Fantasy Land attracted coachloads of visitors and was a must-do Kalbarri tourism attraction. Mr and Mrs Ross's son Kerry remembers helping build the gem mine. ""Dad had a passion for doing all sorts of strange things at different times,"" Kerry Ross said. ""One of his favourite sayings was to bite off more than you can chew and then chew like buggery – and that's what he did in life."" Kerry Ross's wife Christina once worked at Fantasy Land ""Busloads of people would come, they'd all get out, spend all their money, have a cup of tea and just want to talk to Gwyn and Cliff,"" Christina Ross said. Cliff Ross sourced his gems from his own travels and also bought them through gemstone-trading companies. ""He'd have 44 gallon drums full of stones like tiger eye and amethyst – all sorts of stones – he'd polish them, tumble some,"" Christina Ross said. ""And the ones for the mine, he'd make sure they were shiny enough."" When Mr and Mrs Ross sold up in their later years, Fantasy Land changed hands several times before its closure. Most of the dolls were sold, the treasures packed in boxes and the mine closed. Over the decades the doors remained closed, dust gathered and most assumed the gem mine was long gone. Until now. After buying the cafe, Mrs Bubb couldn't wait to re-open the gem mine. She spent days cleaning up years of accumulated dust and revealing the stones in their former glory. Both Mr and Mrs Bubb admire not only the stones but the couple whose vision brought Fantasy Land to life. ""The passion that went into it, was just amazing,"" Mr Bubb said. ""To think someone's had all this time to do this and it ended up so nice.""

204,"'For me, it's home': Dennis and Kay have spent their lives on the road as travelling entertainers",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  'For me, it's home': Travelling entertainers Dennis and Kay have spent their lives on the road For people in country towns right across Australia, carnivals and shows are often the highlight of the year, bringing food, fun and live entertainment to their towns. But for the people who work them, the show never ends. Dennis Humphries and Kay Blades have spent their lives on the road — it's where they met and married, and to this day they still travel from carnival to carnival across Australia. Kay was raised in a carnival family — her father was a clown at rodeo shows when she was growing up, and she was born on the road. ""We were driving along the road and I think I came out,"" she told ABC Radio Canberra with a laugh. But from the time of her birth aboard her family's travelling bus, Kay was involved in her family's business. ""I was a dancer and did a bit in the circus, and when I was about nine my uncle Sunny had a tent show and I used to do the hula dance,"" she said. ""The people used to throw money into me who was dancing, and I was rich every day."" Dennis got his start in festival work at 16 as a rodeo rider in Queensland, before moving into the boxing tents. Eventually, he joined a company of travelling performers. His daughter was born into the carnival business, and is one of the next generation of children Kay fondly refers to as ""show kids"". ""She came out of hospital and I put her in a bassinet and away we went to the next show, which was in Maryborough,"" Dennis said. ""She hasn't stopped travelling since."" Kay's upbringing on the road saw her receive an education from whichever school was closest to her family's show at the time. ""Mum and dad used to send us to school in each town, and teachers used to put us in another room because show kids are pretty tough,"" she said. But her education wasn't the only non-traditional way of life for Kay — her family also had some pretty creative ideas about how to avoid constant pit stops with six children in their travelling bus. ""We had a bus and dad used to just to drive along the road, and if six kids all wanted to have a pee you had to stop and go all the time,"" she said. ""So he got the drill and put a hole in the floor and put the funnel in it so you could go to the toilet as you're going, but you weren't allowed to do stinkies because it's going to clog up the hole."" Both Kay and Dennis said the camaraderie of ""circus people"" means they have a built in support network no matter where they are. ""For me, it's home. With the show and with family, if I've had a problem I've got my family. Everyone's here,"" Kay said. ""The last two years were pretty bad. But showmen are very challenged in what we do so if something comes up, we can work around it."" Indeed, while living their life on the road, Dennis and Kay have seen the festival business through decades of changes. Dennis said the largest issue facing his industry has not been the COVID-19 pandemic, but the rising cost associated with show performing. It's expensive to insure people who perform daring stunts — often, there's a much higher premium to pay. ""Every show used to have entertainment, very good entertainment, but they priced themselves out of the business,"" he said. ""We used to have one family that used to ride a motorbike across the arena on a wire and good stuff like that. ""Unfortunately, the insurance situation which they still haven't solved was [always] going to be a problem, but there's always room for entertainment,"" Dennis said. Dennis and Kay's travelling life has them in the ACT at the moment for the Canberra Show, serving food at Kay's Canteen and Dennis' Diner. They remain hopeful for the future of the industry ""I mean, people love the show,"" Dennis laughed. ""They love the fairy floss and the dagwood dog. You say to someone, 'Hey, you going to the show?' [They'll say] 'Oh I am and I'm going to have a waffle, a bag of fairy floss, and I'm definitely going to have a dagwood dog dipped in rich red tomato sauce."" And, once the Canberra Show ends, they'll be on to the next thing. ""We just pick the eyes out of it, and then we'll be on the road again,"" said Kay. They wouldn't have it any other way.

205,100 days in isolation hasn't put Jayden off from taking work aboard a cruise ship,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Dancer Jayden Prelc returns to cruise ship work despite spending 100 days in isolation After spending exactly 100 days in isolation, many of them alone in his cabin at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, dancer Jayden Prelc is again returning to the high seas on a cruise ship. The 21-year-old South Australian barely hesitated to sign up for another cruise ship adventure two years on from the epic, lonely journey home. Prelc has been employed as a dancer with Royal Caribbean and will fly out to Cyprus today and return to Australia in December. Originally hailing from Penola in the state's South East, Prelc said it was ""not an easy yes"" when he was offered a new contract. Recalling his last job on cruise ship The Rhapsody of the Sea in 2020, Prelc said ""it was an extremely rough process"" to get home when the pandemic hit. ""We first went into isolation in about the middle of April, I think,"" he said. ""We transferred ships a couple of times, we tried different ports. ""I did 72 days on board, stuck on the ship. We did 19 days locked in our cabin. ""I finally got home at the end of May and then did my two weeks of hotel isolation, then two weeks back in South Australia. ""Exactly 100 days [in isolation] which was pretty funny,"" he said. But Prelc said he learned a lot from the hardship. ""It was definitely a pretty dark experience but I think all of those emotions and all of those trials that I went through, have just made me the stronger and greater person [I am] today,"" he said. ""I learned how to make the best out of nothing and be optimistic in the worst circumstances."" Prelc said he was happy to return to his dream career. ""I think the world is moving towards a point where we are living with the circumstances and we are getting back into it. ""I'm really, really keen just to get back to some sort of normality and do what I love again."" His 10-month trip involves sailing to Barcelona, around Scandinavia and Canada, and finishing in Puerto Rico. ""I'm off to some really exciting places, which I'm very fortunate about,"" Prelc said. ""I really get the best of so many worlds, and a lot of different climates. It'll be absolutely amazing."" Prelc said he felt honoured to work on the ships. ""I'm really excited to get learning, get developing as well,"" he said. ""You learn so much when you're on contracts, from the different styles, the different partners that you work with, the different choreographers you work with. ""I'm so grateful to be able to do that at such a young age."" His past two years in Australia have been busy, despite the lack of international travel. He relocated to Adelaide to continue developing his craft. ""Doing open classes, teaching a lot, doing lots of gigs with big productions, directing some shows with Adelaide Youth Theatre,"" Prelc said. ""So [I'm] really grateful for the opportunities that have popped up for me since being back. ""Now I'm just off again, and I'm going to try and put all of that training and all of that mental strengthening since being back home into practice. ""It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up. ""If kind of normalising cruise ships and changing that narrative is a way that we can do that, then I'm really excited to be a part of it.""

206,Agritourism booms during pandemic as consumers get back to basics,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," ABC Rural Farmers urged to consider agritourism opportunities as sector booms during pandemic Farm stays, farm cafes, wineries, farm tour experiences: over the past two years, they have increasingly made their way onto the bucket list of holiday makers. Agritourism boomed during the pandemic, with some operators experiencing a 250 per cent increase in sales. It was largely due to tourists choosing to stay close to home and explore a new-found interest in where their food comes from. International agritourism advisor and farmer John Stanley said there was no better time to get into the industry. ""The timing is right for agritourism for a number of reasons and one of those reasons is, as a result of COVID, people who live in cities desperately want to get into rural activities,"" Mr Stanley said. ""I've got clients who are up 250 per cent in sales as a result of what's happening during COVID. ""Agritourism isn't for everyone. It's more the client of the small, boutique farm looking to add value and educate consumers. ""So I don't want to say that every farm should be in agritourism, but this is an opportunity for small farmers or other farmers to put a niche into their overall plan."" John Stanley said consumers are increasingly wanting to have a unique, uplifting experience, especially during the darker days of the pandemic. ""We're seeing this shift of people wanting experiences outside the city."" It is a concept that Renae Poot and Andrew Middleton are counting on. The pair recently started offering farm tours of Andrew's 3500-acre property east of Esperance. Ms Poot said she was looking for a career change after decades in the health industry. She grew up on a farm in the wheatbelt and wanted to share her passion for the land with those who had not been able to fully experience it themselves. ""I guess for us, it's about having a bit of a different lifestyle and different pace and sharing the purpose, the craft, the lifestyle of farming with other people,"" she said. ""We are having lots of people coming from the cities, they're really keen to know about farming, but really, where their food is coming from, where their clothes are coming from. ""They are a little bit more inquisitive about health and safety, so it's a great time to be in agritourism."" Ms Poot even hopes the farm experience may one day encourage some people to choose a career in agriculture. In a report published by the CSIRO in 2018, it was estimated that agri-related tourism, including accommodation, transport and retail sectors in Australia, could reach around $18.6 billion by 2030. Other studies conducted by Deloitte in 2017 showed that international tourists who visited a farm on their trip increased by 11 per cent a year, domestic tourists increased by 9 per cent. John Stanley said that waiting until the pandemic has passed would be risky. ""There are lots of farmers already developing tourism packages ready for when the borders open,"" he said. ""Leave it a few weeks and you're too late."" ""If you shut the door and say, 'I'm going to wait until the border opens' there will be other people, already in the marketplace, developing the package, now is the time to do the homework."" Esperance local Anna Martins has been toying with the idea of agritourism for a while and she feels the time is right to explore it further. After returning from overseas where she and her husband worked in resort management, she said she was returning to the roots of her family farm and would love to share that with others. ""I think there's a huge market and a huge demographic of people who will never go overseas again,"" she said. ""They are going to want to seek out experiences within WA and Australia, a lot of people will be too scared to travel."" For Andrew Middleton, the idea of agritourism is not new, with his father offering farm tours decades ago. He says it is now even more important that the farming industry embraces agritourism in a bid to educate the general public about the profession. ""I think it's becoming increasingly important because people have less and less contact with rural people, our cities are getting bigger,"" he said. ""I think farmers themselves need to become a little bit more receptive to the idea [of agritourism]."" ""A lot of us are probably tied up in our own businesses and don't relish the thought of people from the cities trooping around and getting in the way. ""But I think if we want to maintain our social licence to farm, then I think it's important to let people know what we're doing."" ""This is our opportunity to level the playing field a bit and show people what farming is all about and what really happens on a commercial farm, how we run stock, how we look after paddocks.""

207,Why people who splashed out on 4WDs may be regretting their purchase,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  West Australians who splashed out on four-wheel drives and caravans during the pandemic may be forced to sell up amid rising interest rates and fuel prices, an auto industry expert says. WA Motor Trade Association president Stephen Moir said while there was a chronic shortage of second-hand vehicles driven by closed borders and interrupted supply chains, that could change in the coming months as the cost of living increased. ""They've actually purchased those cars and caravans … because they haven't been spending their money on overseas travel,"" he said. ""Increases in interest rates will put financial pressure on people and they may need to start selling off those things they acquired during the pandemic."" Mr Moir said fuel prices would also contribute to financial strain. ""I watched somebody with a late model four-wheel drive … put $209 worth of petrol into his car,"" he said. ""They could cost you 20 per cent more in fuel."" Unprecedented demand for new and used vehicles during the pandemic has led to a shortage, but Mr Moir said that would change when owners started to sell up. ""I would expect that the second half of this year you will see an increase in the level of stock coming back into the marketplace,"" he said. But Mr Moir said buyers should not expect prices to drop significantly. ""We saw used cars go up in value by approximately 35 per cent during the pandemic — are they going to drop 35 per cent? I doubt it,"" he said. ""I think the biggest thing will be that there will be greater choice for people."" A backlog of orders for new vehicles has seen some customers wait more than a year for delivery and Mr Moir says there are no signs that will ease soon. ""Mainly because of things such as the disruption to manufacturing because of COVID, we've got a worldwide chip supply issue and now, with the Ukrainian crisis, that could put further pressure on parts of the supply chain,"" he said. ""We are in a very, very fluxing situation right now internationally."" Meanwhile, WA Four-Wheel Driving Club member Pat Jenkin said the reopening of WA's borders would see people opting for overseas travel over outback adventures. ""With the COVID pandemic and not being able to go anywhere overseas and interstate … it's just meant everybody had to do something and they decided four-wheel driving and camping and caravanning was the way to go,"" he said. ""The second-hand market is where a lot of people go and I think there will just be an oversupply if everyone decides to go back to their pre-COVID life and holiday overseas rather than around Australia."" He predicted buyers who had paid more for a second-hand 4WD during the pandemic may take a loss on the resale value if it meant they could afford to travel overseas. ""You don't make money on cars normally, it's a bit of a crazy world at the moment,"" Mr Jenkin said. ""So I think if it becomes an oversupply it will drastically depreciate the value of the vehicle.""

208,"Shelved $17m art collection, mostly unseen for decades, once again in the spotlight",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Rockhampton unveils $36.5m Museum of Art, largest gallery in regional Queensland Millions of dollars' worth of priceless art hidden in storage for decades will finally be on display, thanks to the opening of the largest regional art gallery in Queensland. Dubbed RMOA, the Rockhampton Museum of Art has more than 3,000 pieces mostly unseen because there previously hasn't been a gallery big enough to display them all. The new museum opens today in the central Queensland city renowned for beef. At almost six times the size of the old gallery, established in 1976, the Rockhampton Museum of Art has space to showcase a collection that's among the richest in the country. ""Rockhampton is very, very lucky in terms of the sheer size and importance of the collection,"" gallery director Jonathan McBurnie said. ""There are a lot of works that have never been seen, so it's a very exciting prospect."" The collection, described as ""one of the finest in regional Australia"", is largely attributed to the vision of former Rockhampton mayor Rex Pilbeam, who took advantage of a federal government scheme to purchase about $500,000 worth of art for just $60,000 in the mid-1970s. It is now worth more than $17 million, with works from famous artists Russell Drysdale, Margaret Olley, John Brack and Sidney Nolan. The collection had long since outgrown its former home when Rockhampton Regional Council proposed the new gallery, securing state and federal government funding for the original $31.5 million project. Construction was finalised at $36.5 million, with $10 million from the federal government, $13 million from the state government and the remaining $13.5 million from the council. Mr McBurnie said RMOA could compete ""on a national level"" and would be ""a bit of a conversation starter, even for people that may not otherwise usually attend an exhibition"". ""We like to collect works that reflect the local history, the culture, the people and the stories of the regions … to sort of curate a collection that really reflects who we are as a community,"" he said. For Iman and Bundjalung woman Bindi Waugh it was a ""lovely surprise"" to be commissioned for works in the opening exhibition. ""Hopefully it brings my work to a bigger audience and probably the most beneficial thing is actually working with big galleries and learning their processes and getting that mentoring from gallery directors,"" Ms Waugh said. The self-taught artist from Yarwun, near Gladstone, said it will help other regional artists struggling to break into Brisbane's gallery scene. Her series of sculptures on display at RMOA are inspired by burial poles, incorporating perspectives of ""immigrant, invader, and Indigenous"" to explore the nation's history and question how we move forward. ""It's going to give us the opportunity to have some contemporary discussions about Indigenous issues,"" Ms Waugh said. The gallery has already sparked conversations ahead of its opening on Friday, after the council announced on Wednesday it had commissioned a portrait of former mayor Margaret Strelow from renowned artist Michael Zavros. Ms Strelow made a shock resignation in 2020 after the Councillor Conduct Tribunal found she had engaged in misconduct by failing to update her Register of Interests appropriately. In a statement, Mayor Tony Williams said the portrait was commissioned to honour Ms Strelow's 20 years in local government. It cost $100,000, paid for by council from its annual gallery acquisition funding. At the unveiling, Ms Strelow said she was proud of the council for backing the gallery and, in turn, the city's cultural future. ""In choosing to commission a portrait of me, the council is also recognising that the Museum of Art is also taking Pilbeam's legacy to a new level,"" she said. Mr McBurnie said the work established the gallery as a place of national importance. ""I have been referring to it as a bit of a flex on the part of the city of Rockhampton. I think it's a real statement,"" he said. ""And it's saying to people, 'we're here, we're going to compete with you, we can do anything you can do'."" ABC Capricornia will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Friday.

209,Healing the reef — one broken piece of coral at a time,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Broken coral fragments now reproducing in major milestone for Great Barrier Reef program Scientists say a unique program that sees broken pieces of coral salvaged from the bottom of the sea floor and reattached using a special clip is achieving remarkable results. Four years ago, at the height of a major coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef, Port Douglas-based marine biologists and reef tourism operators John and Jenny Edmonson knew they had to do something. ""After the first bleaching in 2016, it was difficult to come out here on the reef and see it all,"" Ms Edmonson said. ""We started to come up with ideas of how to have a cheap and fast way of out-planting large quantities of coral and thereby returning the sites to what they used to be like."" They established the Coral Nurture Program, which sees staff from several reef tourism boats — under the management of scientists — salvage broken pieces of coral from the ocean floor. The fragments are grown in special nurseries, including one at Opal Reef, off Port Douglas. The nurseries are suspended about two metres beneath the ocean surface, and after the coral matures, it is transplanted back on the reef, with the use of a special metal clip, invented by the Edmonson family. The work is carried out by dive staff who tend to the coral nurseries while tourists snorkel the reef nearby. More than 70,000 coral fragments have been planted across 27 reef sites since the program began four years ago. Researcher and coral scientist Professor David Suggett, from the University of Technology in Sydney, has just returned from a two-week expedition to inspect the sites. He said 85 per cent of the new corals that had been re-planted had survived and were now even reproducing. ""Some of the very first fragments that we planted at the end of 2018, the size of my finger, are now spawning by themselves after only three years,"" Dr Suggett said. ""This now means all planting activity is able to start rehabilitating the reef on its own. ""It's producing new reproductively viable colonies that can turn into seeding to create thousands of other colonies over time."" Five other reef tourism boats from Cairns to Port Douglas are also now involved in the program, in partnership with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.

210,With borders open travel agents are flat out – but there's not enough workers wanting to come back,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus Australia's travel agents are in a tricky situation. With international borders recently reopened, the tourism industry is bracing for an uptick in business and the national peak body for travel agents predicts another 10,000 staff will be needed over the next 12 to 18 months to meet demand. But there's a catch. ""Unless there's a rapid increase in demand, there's still another 10,000 jobs at risk,"" Australian Federation of Travel Agents (AFTA) chief executive Dean Long said. It is a risk former travel agent Sharnee Smith is not willing to take. She is one of the 15,000 travel agents, about a third of the workforce, believed to have lost their jobs since the start of the pandemic. ""It's basically like a switch flicked and that was it,"" she said. ""We went from a bustling, busy agency with three full-time staff to nothing."" Ms Smith was working in Bellingen on the NSW Mid-North Coast at that time, just before she took maternity leave. She found an alternative job in nearby Dorrigo and said going back to the travel industry carried too much uncertainty. ""We just don't know what's going to happen at the moment,"" she said. ""We don't know whether there's security in the industry. ""I'd work for them again in a heartbeat if I knew that it wasn't all going to happen again."" Ms Smith's former boss is feeling ""positive"" about what the opening of the borders means for tourism, but has encountered a new challenge. ""Our biggest issue is trying to staff our agencies, because over the past two years we've had to let a lot of staff go,"" Windsong Travel owner James Cracknell said. During the pandemic his workforce decreased from 22 to five. ""Getting experienced people to come back to our industry is going to be a tough."" ""As owners and also employers we're all apprehensive because we're not sure — in three months' time is there going to be another variant? ""And will the borders shut again?"" Mr Long says that uncertainty is being felt across the industry. ""Those agencies that are looking to come back online and hire, they're facing the same challenges that the rest of the economy is facing,"" he said. ""There's a shortage of skilled people who are willing and able to come back to work."" AFTA has called for further assistance from the federal government, including a travel industry JobStarter package to support the hiring of staff with a payment of $10,000 per new or re-engaged employee. ""A support program for those businesses who need to re-employ and realise that, at no fault of their own, they had to downsize their business and lose really skilled people,"" Mr Long said. Andrew Wellington was in the industry for about 25 years before COVID-19 arrived in Australia. The Coffs Harbour travel consultant is eager to return full-time to the job he loved, but is keeping his back-up plan in place. ""You either had to leave the industry, which a lot of people have done, and it's pretty sad for the industry, or go and find something else to do,"" Mr Wellington said. ""I went out and just started mowing a few lawns and built up my own business, which I do two days a week. ""I thought it was going to last a couple of months and it has now lasted two years."" Mr Wellington said he planned to keep his maintenance business on the side ""in case something goes pear-shaped"". ""[The industry] will come back,"" he said. ""It's just, how long do you wait?""

211,Far North Queensland's biggest LGBTIQ+ event gets Hot and Steamy in mardi gras precursor,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Port Douglas set to get Hot and Steamy in Sydney Mardi Gras precursor Far North Queensland's biggest LGBTIQ+ event is set to go ahead this weekend despite years of uncertainty. The Port Douglas Hot and Steamy festival began in February 2020 as way of luring international LGBTIQ+ tourists to the far north during the quiet wet season. The three-day event includes dinners, pool parties, and the infamous white party which takes place at sunset on the iconic Sugar Wharf. The event falls one week before the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and according to festival director Nathan Clarke it is no coincidence. ""We know that thousands of international tourists visit Sydney for the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and we were looking to tap into that tourism market,"" he said. ""The international visitors who come for mardi gras also like exploring Australia, so we came up with the idea of holding a precursor event. ""We want to show those travellers the amazing attractions that we have up here and also throw an amazing festival."" The first event was held just weeks before the first of the COVID lockdowns started across Australia. ""We snuck through by the skin of our teeth. We were the last major event for the year,"" Mr Clarke said. ""Last year we had border lockdowns. Luckily we did manage to resell most of the tickets for the people who couldn't travel up."" Despite the border restrictions of past years, the event has grown. In 2020, 370 people attended, last year 625 people attended, and Nathan hopes that this year they will get more than 1,000 people. ""We get a lot of people travelling up from Sydney, Melbourne, and also south-east Queensland. But our main driver is to make Hot and Steamy an international LGBTIQ+ event,"" Mr Clarke said. ""The international tourists come for Mardi Gras but they also want to see things like the Great Barrier Reef and rainforest. Prouder, louder and united. It’s the party you've been waiting for. Join the ABC as we bring you all the excitement of the 2022 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Trent Harlow and his partner Kris have travelled up from Melbourne to attend this year's festival after missing out last year. ""My partner and I came up in 2020 for the first festival and we had an absolute ball, so when the borders reopened we decided to fly up and do it again,"" he said. ""We are following the LGBTIQ + events across Australia. ""We just had the Midsummer Festival in Melbourne, we are here all week in Port Douglas, and then we are heading down to Sydney for Mardi Gras. ""We love the hot and humid weather and the community in Port Douglas is so lovely that we wanted to show them some love after all the hardship they have suffered over the past few years."" Port Douglas Mayor Michael Kerr agreed that the festival brought much-needed visitors to the town during the quiet wet season. ""We were looking for an event before the tourism season kicked in and the guys come to us with the idea for the Hot and Steamy festival, and it just absolutely suits us here in the tropics,"" he said ""The festival adds a bit more excitement to our region in the quiet part of the tourism season and we are really happy to have the party goers liven up Port Douglas for the weekend. ""The festival shows that Port Douglas is a place where everybody is welcome to visit.""

212,Calls for Qantas to match other outback flight deals,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Calls for Qantas to reduce 'exorbitant' outback fares from Longreach When Kym Webb had to get from Longreach to a Brisbane hospital within 24 hours, she had to book a last-minute plane ticket from her hospital bed. It cost her $628 one way. ""There [were] storms around so the Royal Flying Doctor Service couldn't fly,"" she said. ""The doctors were waiting for me at the PA Hospital. ""I wondered how people would go in that situation who aren't able to pay that cost."" Qantas' early roots are in Longreach, but many locals are livid with the cost of last-minute flights to Brisbane. QantasLink's Longreach-to-Brisbane leg – also stopping at Blackall and Barcaldine – is the only one of Queensland's regulated routes, awarded by government tender, that does not have a deal selling any remaining last-minute seats at the cheapest price. A last-minute flight from Longreach to Brisbane on Monday on a special resident fare was $392 one way and $502 for everyone else. In comparison, that same flight on Qantas' recent Love Australia campaign was $149, if booked in advance. ""It's incomprehensible that we have to pay exorbitant amounts just to fly from Longreach to Brisbane,"" Ms Webb said. ""It's one of the things that makes living west hard."" Across all of Queensland's other government regulated routes, which are operated by Regional Express (REX), any seats available in the 24 hours prior to departure are sold at their cheapest price for that route. For Charleville to Brisbane, that is $179. Longreach to Townsville on the same last-minute deal is $189. ""There are often important or critical reasons to travel for people in regional Australia needing to get to Brisbane, and sometimes that happens at the last minute,"" REX network strategy general manager Warrick Lodge said. Blackall-Tambo Mayor Andrew Martin said it was usually an emergency when a person from the bush booked a flight within 24 hours of take-off. ""It's not some flibbertigibbets thinking, 'Dang it, I'll go to Brisbane for the football,'"" he said. ""It's generally a mother with a very sick child, or a very sick mother, or someone going to a very sick parent or family member away — it's a desperation thing."" ""To ramp the prices and gouge … I think is horrid."" In a statement, Qantas said it offered year-round discounted fares to Longreach residents on every return flight to Brisbane. ""While there are some realities about the cost of operating regional flights that we can't change, our resident fare program is designed to make regional air travel more accessible for residents while ensuring it remains sustainable,"" a Qantas spokesperson said. “There are a range of fares available on every flight and, as you can imagine, the cheapest sell out first and the last remaining fares tend to be the most expensive.” For Longreach mum Chantelle Smith, a last-minute flight deal would be a ""huge help"" for her family. They frequently travel to Brisbane at short notice to support her husband, Luke, following a serious truck crash last year. ""He has life-changing injuries,"" she said. ""He's at the PA Hospital in Brisbane where he will remain for quite some time yet, nearly up to 12 months, possibly more."" Ms Smith said she had two days' notice before needing to visit Luke recently and wasn't eligible for state government's Patient Travel Subsidy Scheme. ""Purchasing a ticket for myself and three children the first time was $3,500 for a return flight, but at that time Luke really needed us there,"" she said. ""He was emotionally, mentally distressed, he begged us to get there."" Ms Smith said it was not realistic for her to book flights in advance. ""Doctors, nurses, staff, they think you're just an hour away and you can get there,"" she said. ""So, when they say nine o'clock Tuesday morning, you've got to be there nine o'clock Tuesday morning.""

213,"Travel voucher scheme expanded, but concerns regional Victorian businesses could lose out",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Regional Victorian tourism operators have welcomed a new round of travel vouchers aimed at enticing more people to the country, but some say more needs to be done to ensure the money is spent locally. The Victorian government announced Monday it will spend $200 million to help the entertainment, dining, and travel industries recover from COVID-19. As part of this, $30 million has been set aside to expand the Regional and Metropolitan Travel Voucher Scheme. This means people can access $200 vouchers when they spend at least $400 on eligible tourism and travel-related services. Bendigo Motel Association president Kristyn Slattery said while it was good news, the scheme's structure could see local businesses miss out. ""At the moment, the customer can book any way they like,"" she said. ""If they book on an online travel agent anywhere from 10 to 25 per cent commission is going offshore, doing nothing for the small business."" Ms Slattery said she has been calling on the government to restructure the scheme so people have to book directly with businesses in order to access the vouchers. ""We've seen South Australia successfully set up a platform to do that which meant every dollar stayed local,"" she said. ""But I keep getting responses [from the government] that they don't wish to tell people where and how they spend their money. ""Yet they're not spending their money, they're spending Victorian money that's been put out there to support our businesses rebuild after a devastating and very trying two years."" Victoria's new business stimulus package will also include a statewide $30 million dining voucher program. The initiative will take 25 per cent off meal costs for those dining out Monday to Thursday and spending between $40 and $500. An entertainment voucher — also totalling $30 million — will also be launched, giving people rebates off tickets to theatre, live music, cinemas, museums, and galleries. Murray Regional Tourism chief executive Mark Francis said this boost comes as the industry fights to return to pre-pandemic levels. He said modelling showed regional Victoria's tourism industry should bounce back by the end of 2024. ""The industry is definitely seeing some signs of recovery but we still have a long way to go,"" he said. ""These types of initiatives are great to actually encourage more visitors out."" In the west, Justine Hyde of Grampians Helicopters and Grampians Wine Tours also welcomed the travel vouchers, given the ""massive surge"" in bookings following previous rounds of the program. She said her businesses were continuing to witness huge highs and lows in bookings, despite COVID restrictions easing. ""People are comfortable about getting in the helicopter given they're not with anyone outside their friend group,"" Ms Hyde said. ""But with the wine tours and bus component, people have been concerned and nervous about sharing an enclosed space with others they don't know."" She said the region was excited to have international visitors back as of Monday, but she was not expecting an immediate surge. ""I believe it will take a little more time for those internationals to make their way out here where we are,"" she said. The travel voucher program will open on March 23 for travel between April 8 and May 27. An extra 10,000 vouchers will be set aside for Victorian seniors, released through a ballot on March 15. The entertainment and dining voucher programs are expected to open on March 29.

215,'Just add water and it turns': Stunning views as Lake Eyre fills but more rain still needed,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Lake Eyre begins filling with water much to the delight of graziers, businesses and tourists Few rivers in the world remain as untamed and free-flowing as those that run through the ancient landscape of the Lake Eyre Basin. Recent generous rainfall over Australia's inland Channel Country is breathing new life into ecosystems and it's getting graziers and businesses excited for a big year ahead. Red dirt country has transformed into lush green expanses, cobbled with patterns of intrinsic river systems. Talia Ellis, a pilot and owner of a scenic aviation tour and hotel accommodation in Birdsville, has been flying over the lake for more than 13 years. ""The country is just a sea of green at the moment, which is obviously pretty incredible for such a dry arid climate,"" Ms Ellis said. ""It can happen quickly, but then we can have years where we experience nothing like it so we're very excited about this year. ""Just add water and it turns."" The rain has also been welcomed by fourth generation grazier Geoff Moreton who needs to feed cattle on his 526,000-hectare property. ""It's rejuvenated the whole place,"" he said. ""The feed, while not abundant, is growing quite well, but battling against the heat at this time of the year. ""All the cattle are in prime condition now, as in against mid to early December they were in very poor condition, and I was selling off at a rate of knots. ""I always say, 'when droughts come and I start selling, I either run out of cattle or it rains' and luckily it rained this time, so I was able to save a good part of the herd."" This year's wet weather quenches the ground after years of prolonged drought. While residents say it's been the best in a decade, more rain is needed before the end of the wet season to flood Queensland's three largest rivers that run into Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre. The Georgina and Diamantina rivers and Cooper Creek are the lifeblood of the Lake Eyre Basin. ""A flood is the ice cream on the sweets because once we get a flood the whole herd can live on the river country for about 18 months,"" Mr Moreton said. Professor Richard Kingsford, a river ecologist and conservation biologist from the University of New South Wales, has studied the lake for more than three decades. He said it was not just a pretty picture, but a globally significant ecosystem. ""It's a flood that's not quite reached the 2010, 2011 level but is getting there,"" Professor Kingsford said. ""You need enough fresh water in there [Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre] to overcome the huge amount of salt so that it's not just a saline lake."" But it's a free-flowing natural phenomenon that's facing increasing pressure from encroaching developers. Last year, the Queensland government quietly granted oil and gas exploration leases in the Channel Country to Origin Energy. Professor Kingsford said the bioregion was a major factor in keeping down the nation's carbon footprint and interference would upset not only the ancient ecosystems, but the economy as a whole. ""We regard the rivers of the Lake Eyre Basin as free-flowing because they don't have many major structures in their way,"" Professor Kingsford said. ""We are seeing more and more structures on flood plains with some of the mining developments."" Ms Ellis has more pressing matters at hand. Her organisation has been run off its feet fielding enquiries and bookings from people near and far wanting to catch a glimpse of the region in bloom. ""I think this is going be one of the biggest flying years that Birdsville's seen probably in over 10 years because of the interest in the lake,"" she said.

Tourism Central Australia chief executive Danial Rochford said tourism hotspots had become difficult to access. ""The West MacDonnell [ranges have] been very badly damaged,"" he said. ""We need government to not just talk about this — we need action and we need action quickly."" Mr Rochford said that the region was expecting an influx of tourists in April. ""The worst thing that can happen is, as tourists rebound and come back into the region, all we have for them are closed signs. ""That is as bad as it gets. ""We need to move heaven and Earth to get the roads and national park infrastructure fixed,"" he said. Mr Rochford said that Larapinta Trail operators are reporting record bookings for 2022. ""If tourists can't visit the our local icons, that will be seriously detrimental to the reputation of our destination,"" he said. He said the industry has suffered enough and was looking for NT government to support upgrades urgently. Mr Rochford said it in inadequate to have any restrictions on roads to popular tourism destinations. ""We need two-wheel drive access as soon as we possibly can,"" he said.

220,live: NSW Now: Vegemite and Tim Tams on offer at Sydney Airport as international border re-opens,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Here's what you need to know this morning. More than 20 international flights are expected to touch down at Sydney Airport today as Australia's international borders reopen. After closing in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-awaited reopening will allow vaccinated tourists and visa holders to enter the country. Vegemite and Tim Tams were on offer to passengers who were the first to land this morning. NSW Tourism Industry Council executive manager Greg Binskin said the reopening of the country's border to tourists was great news and gave businesses the certainty to plan ahead. He acknowledged that it could take a few months for long-haul tourists from places such as Europe and the United States to make the journey but, in the interim, it was all about family reunions. ""Two years without reconnecting to family is a long time,"" he said. ""So we'll start seeing visiting friends start to come first, then followed by leisure as people start to plan their leave as we're a long-haul destination."" The teachers union has urged parents to remain vigilant to keeping schools COVID-19 safe by continuing to use rapid antigen tests (RATs). That appeal comes after it was announced yesterday that the twice-weekly self-testing requirement for staff and students will end. From Monday, February 28, RATs are to be used at the discretion of school staff and parents when ""families consider [them] necessary so they have peace of mind"". Eight free testing kits per student and staff member will be distributed over the coming days. NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos said RATs had provided an important line of defence against the virus. ""You can never over-compensate when in comes to the implementation of risk-mitigation strategies,"" he said. ""You can't lift all risk-mitigation strategies at once. We need to ensure that we remain vigilant as the pandemic continues."" An announcement on the use of masks in schools is expected next week. A woman who murdered her partner by poisoning and suffocating him at Walcha in country New South Wales, is today due to be sentenced. Sheep farmer Mathew Dunbar died in his bed in 2017, after ingesting a cocktail of sedatives then asphyxiating when a helium tank was connected to a plastic bag around his head. His partner, Natasha Beth Darcy, told first responders he took his own life but a jury found her guilty of murder. A court has heard she also offered a friend $20,000 to lie about Mr Dunbar being suicidal, saying she would inherit his $4.65 million property after being found not guilty. Prosecutors have called for a life sentence. Police have released images of two men they believe can assist in an investigation into an attack in Sydney's CBD on Sunday morning. Emergency services were called to George Street at 3am yesterday after reports two men were assaulted by a group of four males. One of the men, aged 27, was found unconscious and was treated by NSW Ambulance paramedics for a cut to his head. He was taken to St Vincent's Hospital in a stable condition. The second man, aged 25, was treated on scene for minor facial injuries. As part of the investigation, police have released an image of two men who may be able to assist with their inquiries. The first man was described as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander appearance, aged in his 20s, about 175cm tall, with black hair, a fade haircut, and brown eyes. At the time, he was wearing a black sweater, blue jeans and white sneakers. Meanwhile, the second man was described as Caucasian, aged in his 20s, about 175cm tall, with brown hair, a fade haircut, and facial hair. At the time, he was wearing denim shorts, a white button-up shirt and white sneakers.

221,"'COVID wiped out 20 years of growth', when can travel go back to normal?",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  For couples who have been separated by border closures, the reopening is more than just news. Danielle Vogl and her US partner Eric Lochner have been apart since October 2019. She burst into tears, knowing they could finally reunite, when Australia's hard border came down for the first time in two years. ""I actually woke him up to tell him, because I thought it was big enough news to do that,"" the Canberra woman told the ABC. ""He couldn't believe it … he was like, 'are you sure, is this true', and I'm like, 'yes, it's happening'. ""This is over now: we can be together again."" Ms Vogl said her partner's flight to Australia in April 2020 was cancelled due to COVID and later he was unable to get a travel exemption as the couple were not married or living together at the time. Talking to each other virtually was the only way to keep the relationship going. ""It's been a very long and very cruel process for us,"" Ms Vogl said. ""It's all a credit to our relationship that we've survived it, but there were a lot of really sad times."" Ms Vogl will wait until April for her reunion but for many tourism operators, the return of international travellers can not come soon enough. Michael Betteridge, general manager of Fantasea Cruising, was over the moon when he discovered a group of British tourists on his Sydney Harbour cruise. ""I'm so excited to be able to welcome people back and it's great to see people already starting to trickle through,"" he told the ABC. ""We've been ready and waiting for quite a long time now."" According to the latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), there were 265,450 overseas arrivals in January, the highest result since international border restrictions were imposed in March 2020. But that only accounts for about one-tenth of the travel volume pre-COVID. In January 2020, there were 2.26 million overseas arrivals. The travel and tourism industry has been hit hard during the pandemic – businesses being forced to shut down and tour operators leaving the industry for more secure jobs. The sector estimates it has lost more than $4 billion a month due to the lack of holiday makers from overseas. Mr Betteridge said the cruising company used to host hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, but the pandemic forced the business to close during the lockdowns. While he's optimistic about the future, Mr Betteridge said there were still ongoing challenges for the sector. ""What we're looking at is scaling up [our capacity] over the coming year,"" he said. ""[But] one of the challenges right now is labour shortages. ""We're all looking at how do we attract people back into the industry."" Margy Osmond, chief executive officer of Tourism and Transport Forum Australia (TTF), agreed. ""We've lost a whole generation of some of the most important and skilled workers in the industry,"" she told the ABC. ""And all of that led to the difficulty in servicing both local and international visitors. ""We need international students. We need the backpackers back. And then we need the capacity to bring in people with particular skills via the visa system."" It is expected that more international visitors will come back later this year, and families and friends of Australian residents are likely to lead the first wave of travel returns. But how quickly tourists will return to pre-COVID levels remains a question, as the timing of the border reopening has missed the peak summer holiday season. ""It's really critical to understand we may never go back to what were pre-pandemic levels,"" Ms Osmond said. ""The world of travel has changed globally, it's not just about Australia, and travel confidence is not what it once was. ""But realistically speaking, I can't see it as being at a level that there was anything like we were pre-pandemic until two or three years from now."" China's new official report says the majority of its citizens choose to travel domestically, which poses ""great uncertainty"" about when, and whether, Chinese tourists will return to Australia in pre-pandemic numbers. At the start of the pandemic, Australia locked its borders to keep COVID out but now the tables have turned. Despite high vaccination rates, Australia has hit 3 million COVID cases and the majority of them were recorded during the recent Omicron outbreaks. Many travellers from New Zealand, China and the US — the leading source countries for visitor arrivals pre-pandemic — remain vigilant. China's civil aviation administration issued circuit-breaker orders to suspend several flights from Sydney and Melbourne due to Omicron outbreaks last month and its ""zero-COVID"" policy and lengthy quarantine restrictions continue to make travel difficult. Health authorities in New Zealand and the US have slapped ""do not travel"" warnings on Australia amid the surge in Omicron cases. With Australia's international border closed for almost two years, there's one question on the lips of tourism operators, accommodation providers and hospitality venues: When will international visitors come back? While Australian borders have reopened without quarantine for fully vaccinated international visitors, Western Australia remains an exception, set to open up on March 3. Australia is behind destinations like Thailand and the UK, which opened earlier and have also scrapped quarantine restrictions for fully jabbed visitors. Last week, Tourism Australia made its first move to salvage the sector, rolling out a $40 million campaign, Come and Say G'Day – Don't Go Small, in the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. Tourism Minister Dan Tehan said the campaign was just the first step in a long-term strategy to restart tourism to Australia and will invest more in assisting tourism recovery later this year. However, a new survey by the Australian Tourism Export Council (ATEC) found 66 per cent of inbound tour operators have raised concerns over consumers lacking confidence to book their travel to Australia. ""While the government has invested in global advertising to drive demand to return to Australia, there are worrying signs consumers are wary of travelling here with confusion over our various state travel restrictions and concern about snap border closures,"" managing director Peter Shelley said. For the first time in almost two years — 704 days — Australia’s borders will open to all fully-vaccinated travellers next week. But for many, the ordeal is far from over. TTF's Ms Osmond said travel confidence would continue to be the biggest issue and time is what is needed. ""This is a completely cutthroat global market now, every country in the world is looking to get those particularly high-yield leisure tourists back,"" she said. ""Australia needs to do a lot of work. We have reputation-building to do and we have to restore [the confidence of] people and operators like airlines."" Aviation capacity is another vital factor in the post-COVID recovery of the travel and tourism industry. Although Qantas and Virgin Australia have plans to open more international routes later this year, both airlines have announced they would temporarily slash their international capacity due to travel demand, staff isolation and the Omicron situation. Last month, Qantas said its international flying would reduce from 30 per cent of pre-pandemic levels to 20 per cent in the March quarter, despite CEO Alan Joyce being confident the airline could return to 100 per cent of its pre-COVID volume as soon as 2023. Virgin Australia said it would cut capacity across its network by around 25 per cent for January and February and it has suspended its only international service, the Sydney-Fiji route. The pandemic has brought the industry to its knees, with Virgin Australia going into voluntary administration and Qantas standing down tens of thousands of staff. ""The toll on the staff of Qantas and Virgin has been very savage, with lots of pilots, for instance, having to drive combine harvesters just to make ends meet,"" aviation analyst Geoffrey Thomas told the ABC. ""In January 2020, the [global] aviation industry was absolutely booming, we just had the best year ever in 2019. But when COVID hit, it wiped out 20 years of growth."" Airlines have been affected by major incidents but they quickly recovered. Mr Thomas said COVID was a different situation and international travel went down to about 10 per cent of what it was in January 2020, leaving the global aviation industry with a $200 billion damage bill. ""We've had hits before like 9/11, like SARS, but they were just a little tiny blip compared to the drop-off with COVID,"" he said. ""With 9/11, travel certainly took a really big hit in the United States. Not so for the rest of the world and [it] took the US a couple of years to recover. ""The big hit for SARS was Hong Kong and Cathay Pacific … when the World Health Organization announced that SARS was over, almost instantly passengers came back. ""COVID [is] a very different picture."" Mr Thomas said the COVID testing regime and quarantine requirements would be the primary impediments for the travel and tourism rebound. ""There's no question whatsoever when you remove the barriers, the hassles and the irritations, people will travel in droves. But that needs to happen,"" he said. Back in Canberra, while Danielle couldn't wait to see her partner fall in love with the country again, she has a message to other visitors. ""Come back,"" she said. ""I can understand the hesitation of people, but Australia is a beautiful place and we do better when people come.""

224,Tourism operators predict slow recovery as international border reopens,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus After two years of ""Fortress Australia"", the international border is on the cusp of reopening, but Queensland tourism operators predict it will take months or years for overseas visitors to return. From Monday, fully vaccinated travellers can enter Australia without a travel exemption or quarantine requirements. It's a highly-anticipated turning point for the embattled tourism sector, but some in the industry fear long-lasting damage to Queensland's travel brand. Pre-pandemic Townsville's Billabong Sanctuary was ""swarming with international visitors"" wanting to see cuddly koalas and crocodiles. Today, the empty park tells a very different story. ""We've just been hanging on by the seat of our pants,"" owner Bob Flemming said. The federal government's zoo and aquarium support package has kept the animals fed and healthy, but what the sanctuary desperately needs now is guests through the gates. ""We can see a light at the end of the tunnel, but we're not popping the champagne corks just yet,"" Mr Flemming said. ""I think the end of this year or early next we'll see our internationals returning, but certainly not in pre-COVID [numbers]. ""I don't believe it will ever return to that – I think the world has changed."" Australia has shed an estimated 50,000 tourism and hospitality jobs during the pandemic. For the beleaguered hostel industry, the return of international visitors and backpackers cannot come soon enough. Two years ago, Base Backpackers on North Queensland's Magnetic Island was fully booked year-round with a three-month waitlist. ""It was unreal times,"" manager Jack Fantini said. Now, the waterfront business is lucky to have a handful of check-ins a day, but Mr Fantini is optimistic the tide will turn once international travel starts up again. ""There's a lot of uncertainty in the world at the moment, but the ones that want to get out there and do it will,"" he said. ""Everyone's been itching to travel for over two years now, so I think it's going to take off really quickly."" But Mr Fantini admits it's going to be a ""long burn"" to get back the business back to where it was before. ""Being realistic, I think it's still going to be a minimum of six months before we really see those numbers trickle through,"" he said. The past two years have forced businesses to hone their focus on the domestic travel market. It's been a surprise success story for some, like yacht charter company Pilgrim Sailing. Owner Clare Ley relocated the business to Magnetic Island at the start of 2020, and since then she and her husband have hired seven new staff members. ""Somehow the local market has really pulled together and kept us going better and better each month, so we're very blessed,"" Ms Ley said. She views the return of international tourists as a new opportunity for her company, but she doesn't expect any major changes for two years. ""I feel that we'll be on a level playing field because everybody's got to start afresh with that market,"" she said. ""I think older ages are going be more reluctant to travel, but I think the younger will probably want to get the hell out of wherever they are."" In the meantime, Billabong Sanctuary is making changes of its own to cater to the local market. ""On the front cover of our brochure we used to have a koala,"" Mr Flemming said. ""Now, to attract the Aussies, on the front cover of our brochure we have a crocodile.""

225,"In the early '70s, a surf movie put Bali on the map. Fifty years on, the love affair continues",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  It's consistently ranked as one of the top five surf movies of all time, but Morning of the Earth was once seen as a gamble The year was 1971. The place Bali. Two men stood on a reef, holding their surfboards, facing the ocean. They were about to surf a break no-one had ever surfed before. Its name: Uluwatu. The surf beyond them was a heart-stopping eight to 10 feet and it seemed, at first sight, that the waves just kept coming. The scene, which later graced the movie poster for Morning of the Earth, would become an iconic image for thousands of surfers across the globe. It would also become the calling card for Bali and begin Australia's love affair with the island. As they stood looking seaward, the man on the left, Rusty Miller, recalls that he was captivated, but at the same time aware that he had a much bigger task at hand: ""I was thinking, how do we get out? I mean, I knew how we'd get out, but keep in mind there was no duck-diving and no leg ropes."" To his right stood 15-year-old Stephen Cooney with a board not much bigger than himself at five feet, nine inches. Cooney's head was also full of thoughts, as he explains in his autobiography Unearthed: ""The villagers who gathered on the cliffs made clear their concerns about us going into the waves citing bad spirits and dangerous waters."" But talking to Cooney about the situation, he clearly wasn't going to be put off. ""All I ever wanted to do was surf, that was my whole mantra,"" he says. ""So the idea of paddling out in these conditions was really exciting for me — and Rusty was there, so he was great company, particularly on those bigger days."" He pauses at this point and then goes on: ""In big waves, you're always a little bit edgy. And I'd have to admit on that day, that first big day, I was definitely a little edgy."" There was a lot at play here. Above them on the cliff stood filmmaker Albe Falzon. He was the man who had brought them here. With luck this would form a key segment for the film he was shooting. Why did he choose Bali? ""Bali found me,"" he says, laughing. ""Asia was off my radar. I was a surfer, my focus was on Hawaii. David Elfick [his business partner] ended up with a couple of tickets. ""He'd met a surfer — Russell Hughes — when he'd come back to Australia after a trip through Asia. [Russell] ended up in Bali and what he saw was no surfers and all this surf … next thing, we were on a plane."" It didn't take Falzon long to be converted to Bali. ""Within a day or two, I said, 'This is amazing'. The people, the land, the ocean — It just blew me away."" As Rusty Miller and Stephen Cooney paddled out through the gap in the reef and the breaking waves, Miller was taken by the amount of life in the water. ""The ocean was literally teeming … there was a lot happening,"" he says. ""There were dugongs, sharks and whales and there were all these fishermen. There were Balinese fishermen coming out past us in their boats."" Was Falzon worried about the surf and the two people making their way out? ""No, I was totally exhilarated,"" he says. ""Stephen in his youth was totally capable, and with Rusty, he was in good hands."" For the Balinese standing on the cliffs, this must have seemed like magic. Cooney recalls taking off on a wave and hearing a noise coming from the cliff tops. ""They were very excited,"" he says. ""At times they'd be on the cliff, and when you took off on a wave they'd start yelling and then they'd yell for the period of time you were on the wave and then there was dead silence."" The sequences Falzon captured of the two surfing Uluwatu were coupled with slices of Balinese life onshore. There were fishermen pulling sharks up on the beach at Kuta and locals betting on a cock fight. All of them added to Bali's allure. And what an allure the island had. In 2019, the last year before COVID-19 made it practically impossible to travel internationally, 1.23 million Australians visited Bali. For the past two years, the pandemic has left the Balinese — particularly those who relied on surfing and tourism — in a bad way. Falzon hopes the situation will change when borders reopen and people will have work again. As the 50th anniversary of the movie's release approaches, does he ever have second thoughts about exposing Bali and changing so profoundly the way the people live? ""Ultimately it was going to happen,"" he says. ""It was only a matter of time before it happened. Surfers are travellers. I don't see it in a negative or destructive way, however, I had no idea how expansive it was going to be."" The movie, of course, would focus not just on Bali but also on the north coast of New South Wales and Hawaii. In the words of the film, this was ""a fantasy of surfers living in three unspoiled lands and playing in natures oceans"". Falzon was very clear about the message he wanted the film to convey. ""You'll notice if you look at the movie there are no cars, no power poles, no sense of man-made intrusion,"" he says. ""That was quite deliberate."" In that sense, it was an idea ahead of its time. It focused on the environment and the natural beauty it displayed. It showed surfers to a Garden of Eden, unspoiled by human hand. What you also see is a film without a narrator. For anyone used to American surf films with corny voice overlay and humorous sketches, this was something quite different. The music in the film tells the story. Falzon and Elfick had heard a song produced by G. Wayne Thomas. They went to see him at Warner Brothers Records and asked him to create the music for their film. For what would become one of Australia's best selling soundtrack albums, Thomas enlisted a who's who of Australian and New Zealand artists to celebrate the idea of leaving the city, living simply and surfing. The opening scene depicts a massive rolling wave filmed in slow motion at Winkipop in Victoria as the movie's theme song, Morning of the Earth — sounding like a secular hymn — tells the story of earth's creation: ""The forces of the universe and the elements of space, conjured up your beauty your size, your style, your shape."" How much interaction was there between the filmmaker and the musicians? Well not as much as you might think, says G. Wayne Thomas. ""I saw some of the sequences that were going to be used to open the movie and those sequences inspired the words for the song,"" he says. Of course, back in late 1971, as the movie was being edited and coupled with the songs, there were still questions. How would they get the movie to its imagined audience and how would the audience react? Falzon explains that they went to the major film distributors and offered them the movie. Rejections followed. Instead, they hired the Manly Silver Screen themselves. Then came a major poster campaign to let people know a screening would happen on the night of February 25th. It was a major gamble and on the first night Elfick, Falzon and Thomas held their breath and watched the crowd arrive at the theatre. ""I looked around and I had family, friends and every surfer I knew. It was a pretty amazing moment. The lights were going off but going on at the same time,"" Falzon says, laughing at the memory. ""That was a moment for me about how important film was. I didn't need to stay there. I went outside and G. Wayne was there [smoking], full of anxiety."" Inside the theatre, Cooney was sitting in the aisle. As the movie played he watched spellbound. His eyes, though, were giving him trouble after a day of surfing. He found trying to focus his eyes made him cry. When the credits rolled his friends took one look at him and thought he'd been overcome with emotion. He laughs about it now. ""Watching it, I had absolutely no doubts about the quality and the artistic value of Morning of the Earth,"" he says. ""Before I saw it, I didn't have any doubt whatsoever that it was going to be good."" Looking back at the scene and watching the movie today, it's hard to know how anyone doubted its impact. Surfers enjoy the surfing, but the celebration of being at one with nature has a universal appeal. It consistently ranks in the top five surfing movies of all time. The experience had a profound influence on all the people involved. Rusty Miller, having witnessed the Balinese Hindu spirituality, says it forever changed the way he experiences nature. ""Their Hinduism is animistic — so that trees and animals are alive with a spiritual quality. As a result of Bali, I really do believe in magic,"" he says. Stephen Cooney, who would later become a journalist at Tracks and witness the surf industry become big business, looks back fondly on the film — both then and now. ""I'm flattered to still be involved in the whole exercise. I was just one of the characters in the film. It was a real honour,"" he says. The final word about Morning of the Earth, though, should go to its creator, Falzon. He believes its message is still relevant: ""It is about the earth,"" he says. ""We are at a critical point. The end result is it's about the planet that we live on. We have to tread lightly because it's our home. It's a beautiful planet and I want to keep it that way.""

226,"More than 700 days on our own: Australia's border is finally opening, but for many the damage remains",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  For the first time in almost two years — 704 days — Australia’s borders will reopen to all fully-vaccinated travellers tomorrow. But for many the ordeal is far from over. When Prime Minister Scott Morrison stood in front of the nation, flanked by two Australian flags, and announced a complete travel ban on non-citizens and residents entering the country the following day, many knew exactly what was coming. A day earlier, Morrison had announced a worldwide ""do not travel"" warning for Australians as COVID-19 cases multiplied. Days later, this was strengthened to a ""ban"" on Australians travelling overseas without an exemption. It was the first time in history Australians had been barred from leaving the country. A map of the world coloured in red drove the severity of the situation home. It was an unprecedented step for a country where just under half of the population have at least one parent born overseas. At the time, in March 2020, Morrison justified the travel ban on the basis that 80 per cent of coronavirus cases detected in Australia stemmed from overseas transmission. ""We are looking at a situation of at least six months for how we deal with this. It could be much longer than that. It could be shorter,"" Morrison said as he warned Australians against leaving the country. Few expected the actual time frame would be closer to two years. On Monday, after 100 weeks shut off to the world, Australia's last remaining international border restrictions for fully-vaccinated travellers will be lifted, allowing international tourists to return. In November, the restrictions barring fully vaccinated citizens and permanent residents from leaving were removed, and weeks later, fully vaccinated eligible temporary visa holders and international students were given the green light to return. Much has changed: babies have been born, had birthdays, and started walking, without their grandparents, or even parents, there with them. People have died, without family by their side. Couples have lived and cried apart, brought together only by screens, and many others have been forced to make drastic life changes due to policies outside their control. While the travel ban helped keep Australia free from the pandemic-induced calamity elsewhere in the world, at least for a while, they also attracted sharp criticism — not least of all from thousands of Australian citizens who found themselves stranded overseas, unable to return to their country of birth due to travel caps and unreliable flights. Many citizens have now come home and more have reunited with their families overseas. Others are waiting for the final restrictions to lift on Monday, and some still don't know when their circumstances will allow them to return. For West Australians, the uncertainty has lasted even longer. After years cut off from the rest of the country, on Friday Premier Mark McGowan announced the state's hard borders would lift on March 3 — a week and a half after the rest of the country. But as Australia's ""hermit kingdom"" chapter closes, the pain of the past two years is still very fresh. There are many thousands of stories of people impacted by the travel ban — here are five of them. Childcare worker Visha Sunyasi is among those still waiting to come home. For the past two years, her home in Western Australia, full of belongings, has sat untouched after a family emergency days before the travel ban was announced forced an unexpected trip to Mauritius. When the news of the travel ban spread, Visha, her husband and her son, immediately tried to return to Australia — but because they were not citizens or permanent residents, it was too late. ""We were only supposed to come for a week,"" the 36-year-old, who had lived in Australia for five years, says. ""We came with nothing, everything is over there. We didn't even bring our clothes."" Visha says her new, unexpected, life in Mauritius has been difficult. She's had to find foster carers for her dog, who she left in Australia. Her 11-year-old son only speaks English and can't attend public school because he doesn't have a Mauritian birth certificate. Instead, the family has been forced to pay for expensive private school so he doesn't fall behind. When he left Australia, he was in year 4 — he's now starting high school. ""He misses his home, he misses his friends, he still hasn't been able to learn the language here properly,"" she says. For her, finding work has also been impossible with all her qualifications and diplomas in a box in Australia. ""We came with nothing, we've had to start from zero here,"" she says. ""It kills me, I can't be there for my dog, I can't use my own computer, I can't have my stuff, our life is still there."" Visha's bridging visa expired months after becoming stranded, adding another hurdle to returning. She's since applied for a skilled work visa, which allows invited applicants to live in Australia for five years. ""It's been two years now and they haven't even processed it,"" she says. McGowan's shock announcement on Friday offers some hope however, opening up the possibility the family can soon return home as tourists. Over in Australia, it's the pain of being unable to leave the country that stays with Sydney resident Harry Karandikar. In May last year, as Delta tore across India, the 38-year-old risk consultant got a call he had been dreading: both his parents in New Dehli had tested positive for the virus. People around the world had watched terrifying scenes playing out on Indian streets; hospitals were over-stuffed and turning people away and family members were barred from attending the cremation of their loved ones. As a result, the Australian government pushed its travel ban for India even further: for the first time, citizens and permanent residents were temporarily threatened with jail time and heavy fines if they tried to return to Australia. Likewise, Australian civilians were unable to get an exemption to travel to India. Over three weeks, as his father's condition deteriorated, Harry — who is an Australian citizen and has lived here for 20 years — kept applying for exemptions to leave the country so he could see him. Each time, he was knocked back. ""It was like that gambler's fallacy, where you continue to sink money into something when you know the returns are highly stacked against you but you still do it,"" he says. ""Except, in this case, I was gambling my emotions instead of cash."" When flights resumed, it was too late: his father, due to a combination of a blood clot and COVID-19 infection, died on June 13. The funeral happened without Harry the next day. He hadn't seen his father in two years. ""Video calls over WhatsApp are not the same thing,"" he says. An only child, he was then desperate to be with his mother (who was also rejected from coming to Australia). ""She was in her 60s, managing a lot of things alone, and needed to see her only child,"" he says. ""Even that was knocked back."" Now, more than half a year later, Harry's mother is planning to travel to Sydney in May. On the anniversary of his father's death, they will hold a small ceremony to mark his life — this time, together. ""[The past two years] are going to remain with us for the rest of our lives,"" he says. ""As a group of people, with connections across multiple continents and countries, we feel that we've been let down by the system."" Nurse Rheanon Ronquillo is similarly still working to unpack the trauma of being separated from her partner during her pregnancy and first year as a new mum. In November last year, Rheanon's husband met their daughter for the first time in the Philippines — a year and a half after she was born in Mildura, in regional Victoria — when  permanent residents were once again allowed to travel overseas. The family is overjoyed to be together and will finally arrive in Australia together this week, but the road to this moment didn't come easily. Rheanon, a permanent resident, discovered she was pregnant after one of her regular trips home in late 2019. When months later the borders closed, panic set in: ""I was crying, thinking 'I will be alone in the delivery room, it will just be me'."" When her colleagues threw her a gender reveal party at work back in Australia, Rheanon's then-fiance was forced to watch through a video screen. But the real challenges began after the birth. A first-time mum in a foreign land, without family nearby for support, Rheanon relied on friends and the local Filipino community to juggle looking after her daughter and continuing her work on the pandemic frontlines. For extra support, she moved in with a friend's family. ""I was just crying every night, but I didn't want to show my colleagues and friends. You try to show them that you are ok,"" she says. ""But deep in myself, I knew it wasn't going to be OK, asking myself: 'How will I take care of this baby? I don't know how to take care of a baby. It's my first time'. ""The baby's growing, it's not slowing down. One day she was really small, and then you blink, and she's walking and running. It's really sad when you've been witnessing these milestones alone when your husband is on the other side of the world."" It was with this mindset, in November, that she made the decision to go back to the Philippines for three months. ""Our daughter didn't want to go to her dad at first, it was like warming up: 'who's this guy that looks like me',"" she says. ""Now she's got the hang of it … they're inseparable."" Once they're settled in Australia, the couple plan to start the process of applying for a partner visa that will allow her husband to stay permanently. But even now, Rheanon doesn't feel completely secure. ""The rules in Australia can change at any minute,"" she says. ""I just hope they don't lock the borders anymore. Whatever happened to me, I don't want it to happen to my worst enemy."" Courtney Courier and Cameron McDougall credit the pandemic as the reason they met — but it's also forced them to take extreme action to stay together. In early 2021, both working from home — Courtney, 28, in Portland in the United States and Cameron, 33, in Hamilton near Brisbane — they turned to a new social media platform called Clubhouse to meet new people and stay connected to the outside world. Quips in group chats quickly became long, one-on-one conversations that would continue late into the evening. Soon they were ""on FaceTime 24/7"". ""We'd be falling asleep on it, I'd be waking up to it, I'd set my kitchen on fire and she'd tell me before I knew about it,"" Cameron says. ""And then it got to the point that I realised I couldn't live like this."" But in the middle of a pandemic, being together physically wasn't going to be easy. Ideally, Courtney wanted to relocate to Australia because of Cameron's career — but the travel ban meant that wasn't possible. Instead, they decided to take a ""leap of faith"": In October, Cameron quit his job at an electric vehicle start-up, sold his belongings, and applied for a six month US visa. The final step was providing their call logs and entire WhatsApp history as evidence to support Cameron's exemption to travel. ""It's COVID, we didn't know where the world was going, and the most important thing was to figure out a way to be together,"" Courtney says. ""During this time, if you're going to be in a relationship that crosses borders, you have to make sure you're committed to this."" Now, with Cameron's visa coming to an end and Australia's borders reopening, the newly engaged couple are facing the prospect of packing up and doing it all over again. The hope is Courtney will now be able to travel to Australia as a tourist and transition to a partner visa, but there's still the fear that backed up visa processing times could mean another separation. ""Essentially, it could be upwards of two years until either of us get any sort of legal right to work in either country,"" Cameron says. ""It's going to be a long, long battle."" ""The main thing we don't want is to be apart for any length of time,"" he continues. ""Because with COVID, there could be a new strain or variant and they could lock borders — we're at the point where we are going to do our absolute best not to be separated."" Like many Australians, Valerie Preston is eager to get back into the world. Not only is she missing her daughter in Canada and elderly family members in New Zealand, who she hasn't seen in more than two years, she's also keen to make the most of what she calls ""the pointy end"" of her life. This involves a long bucket list, from long-distance walks in South America, to a trip to the Galapagos Islands and a tour around Iceland. But at 69 years old, she's realistic. ""The years to do these things are running out. Every year really counts in what's available, my capacity, and whether I could actually manage to do these things,"" she says. ""I know people who are in their mid and late 70s who are fit and able, but there's no guarantee that I'll be right up there with them."" From her home in Picton, just outside Perth, she'll watch tourists arrive on Monday. Until Friday, she had no idea when she would be able to do the same. Western Australia was originally scheduled to reopen its hard border on February 5, but the Omicron wave prompted McGowan to delay the decision by almost a month. Valerie is conflicted when she reflects on Western Australia's approach to borders during the pandemic: on one hand, she recognises that the strict rules allowed her life to continue in relative safety while the pandemic raged elsewhere. Because of her age, she also doesn't know ""how she would fare"" if she was to catch COVID-19, even with her relatively good health. ""I'm a reasonably fit person, but sometimes that's not a guarantee,"" she says. Travelling overseas, she acknowledges, will come with a degree of risk. But on the other hand, she adds: ""Every day your life is getting shorter ... I just hope I'm up for it.""

227,Stranded sailor pushes the boats out with elaborate repair work,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Boat builder preparing to set sail four years after becoming stranded in WA town High and dry in a boat yard in Carnarvon sits what looks like a big red pirate ship. But the skipper is no pirate, in fact he's quite the good Samaritan. Four years ago, seasoned sailor and boat builder Wolfgang Lantzberg found himself stranded in Carnarvon when the town's harbour, known as the Fascine, became too shallow for his 22-metre boat, the Hybrid Arc. So, the 75-year-old saw it as an opportunity to get to work rebuilding 10 14-foot windrush yachts for the Carnarvon Yacht Club. ""They were almost ready for the tip,"" Carnarvon Yacht Club's number one member, Barry Scott, said. ""But Wolf has rebuilt and resurrected them and now the yacht club has them for anyone who wants to come down and sail them on a Sunday. ""They've got to know how to swim and wear a life jacket."" Mr Scott said Mr Lantzberg's generous efforts have earnt him an honorary membership of the yacht club. ""It was bad for him but good for our yacht club,"" Mr Scott said. Mr Lantzberg and his boat are no strangers to public interest after the vessel was run aground on Broome's Cable Beach in 2016, when the skipper needed to stop in town for some grocery shopping. And this week, the perfect conditions arose for the retired civil engineer to embark on his next adventure, with some elaborate help from his friends. Elaborate, as it required some heavy machinery to move the Hybrid Arc from the boat yard and into the bay, including a 20-tonne crane and 936 Bobcat. ""The crane will act as an additional break, otherwise it might take off,"" Mr Lantzberg said. The launch was a success. Mr Lantzberg is now on his way into a solo circumnavigation of Australia, where he will sail east, before taking the daring route of the ""roaring forties"", across the bottom end of Australia, to Tasmania and then back up the east coast. ""I have the confidence in the boat, and I think I still can do it,"" he said. He said sailing solo was a special feeling. ""After a few days, all problems disappear,"" he said. ""It's just you, the ocean, and your boat. ""Nothing else matters; it is a wonderful feeling."" Onboard, Mr Lantzberg has solar power, desalination, and enough supplies to last him for six months. ""We wish him all of the best and hopefully he comes all the way back to Carnarvon,"" Mr Scott said.

228,'Magical' Bluey house brings crowds of eager kids (and their parents) to Brisbane suburb,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  'Magical' Bluey house brings crowds of eager children, parents to Brisbane suburb Residents of a quiet Brisbane street who have unexpectedly become neighbours to children's cartoon hero Bluey say the unveiling of the Heeler home has brought ""magic"" to their suburb. For the past fortnight, hundreds of young Bluey fans and their parents have streamed down Charlotte Street to see the Heeler family home, brought to life from the beloved children's show in precise detail. This weekend, one family will be living in the Heeler home as part of a three-week promotion by Airbnb — and they'll probably have a few hundred visitors drop by. The small Paddington cottage was transformed over months to match the cartoon family's home, from Bluey and Bingo's bedroom to their equally colourful playroom. Long-time resident Mike Hillburger lives two doors down from the house. He said when the construction teams moved in to start work on transforming the cottage, speculation on the street was rife. ""There were rumours circulating in the street that maybe it was for George Clooney's upcoming movie or something like that,"" he said. ""We thought that was a little bit of a stretch … coming from a movie background myself I could tell it looked like set flats and things like that, so we sort of suspected something was up."" Mr Hillburger said the final result made the house look like ""one of the best renos in Paddington"". ""It's definitely got a lot of character and it's a lot of fun,"" he said. He said last weekend, when the exact location leaked out, the street was suddenly packed with people. The house has proven so popular, security and traffic controllers have been working along the street for the past fortnight. ""It's been really quite magical, just seeing all the kids — the enthusiasm as they drag their parents up the street,"" Mr Hillburger said. ""It's wonderful hearing the laughter and everything. It's been really special, and you see a lot of the community come out. ""I think all of us around here have really enjoyed having the Bluey house next door as a neighbour."" Salon owner Heather has her business on the Bluey street, and said she had also enjoyed seeing the crowds. ""I think it's quite nice to see people getting out and about and having a little look, it's quite magical for kids to imagine that's where Bluey lives,"" she said. In a statement, Airbnb's Susan Wheeldon said the company was not surprised at the global interest the project had generated. ""We are very appreciative of the neighbours in the surrounding area for being so accommodating of this project and we're also grateful to Bluey fans for being respectful and considerate of the neighbourhood,"" Ms Wheeldon said. ""We will begin the process of transforming the home back to its original state at the end of the month. ""There are plans for all the materials used to create the Bluey house — including plants, props and toys — to be lovingly rehomed."" Some items may be given away to the show's fans, while others will be donated to the Queensland Children's Hospital.

229,'There won't be fish for our grandchildren': Push for bag limits to dhufish and snapper ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," ABC Rural Bag limits on the cards for iconic trophy fish amid sustainability fears Catch limits of iconic West Australian fish, such as groper, pink snapper and dhufish would be halved under a new management proposal designed to stop an unsustainable decline in fish stocks. The cuts would apply to both recreational and commercial fishers operating in the West Coast Demersal Scalefish fishery, which stretches from Kalbarri to Augusta. WA Fisheries Minister Don Punch said, under the changes, the total allowable catch of demersal scalefish would be reduced from 750 tonnes to 375 tonnes annually. Last year, a major stock assessment along the WA coast using pink snapper and dhufish as indicator fish species found management changes were needed to reduce catch rates. It found the sustainability risk of snapper was 'severe' while the risk to dhufish was rated as 'high'. ""Look at the science,"" Mr Punch said. ""It has shown us that over the past 10 years since we started the recovery program for these fish, the recovery has not been as good as we had hoped. ""We're at the point where unless we take further action there won't be fish for the future, there won't be fish for our grandchildren."" WA Fishing Industry Council CEO Darryl Hockey said the recreational catch allocation would drop from 270 tonnes to 135 tonnes, while the commercial sector would be capped at 240 tonnes of demersal scalefish. ""This is going to cause our industry a lot of pain and we really wish it had never come to this because [commercial fishers] have been fishing sustainably and under the set benchmarks for a number of years,"" he said. Mr Hockey said the decision would cause a ""restructure"" of commercial operators, but changes were essential. ""The commercial fishing industry has no future unless this is fixed up; recreational fishing has no future unless this is fixed,"" he said. ""The people of WA who go to restaurants and cafes and fish-and-chip shops who want this special prized iconic table fish won't be able to get them either unless action is taken. ""You'll need to go to a museum if you want to see a dhufish."" RecFishWest represents WA's 750,000 amateur fishers. Operations manager Leyland Campbell said the changes would be a ""challenge"" but were needed. He said the measures to implement the cuts were yet to be finalised. ""This is not about halving your bag limits or doubling your closures. It's purely about sustainability,"" he said. ""[The] announcement doesn't actually talk about any specific arrangements and what it actually means in terms of the rules. ""The old mechanisms probably weren't appropriate … we need out-of-the-box thinking."" Mr Punch said the state government would conduct public consultation until April to determine how the cuts would be achieved, with final measures expected to be finalised by mid-2022.

230,How much is this view worth? Tourism giant buys resort built on a boy's daydream ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Lake Argyle Resort in the East Kimberley sold to big Australian tourism provider A remote resort in Western Australia's north has changed hands for the first time in almost 20 years — finally ending one man's 50-year connection to the site. Lake Argyle Resort, in the east Kimberley, has been sold by the Sharpe family to Australian tourism provider G'day Group for an undisclosed sum. ""It's been a huge part of my life,"" Charlie Sharpe said of his family business and childhood home. The 12-hectare property, overlooking the man-made Argyle dam, evolved into an award-winning holiday destination from humble beginnings. The spectacular site on the ridge was once the dam construction workers' village, which housed 650 people and included a hospital, police station, post office and school. After the dam was built, demolition was underway on the village when a business group offered to take it over as a holiday camp in 1973. Charlie Sharpe and his brother were youngsters when they arrived with their parents at Lake Argyle in August 1973 for his dad's job with the Public Works Department. ""Where the infinity pool now is, that was where my school room was,"" Mr Sharpe said. ""My mum was my teacher. And she was very frustrated by the fact that I spent the whole day gazing out the window. ""I always knew that that was one of the best views in the world."" Mr Sharpe went on to work in tourism and business companies around the world, including for a consortium that wanted to build a casino, golf course and airport near the Argyle village in the 1980s, only for it to be shelved with the 1987 stock market crash. But Mr Sharpe had never forgotten the view from that old classroom window, and when in 2004 the opportunity arose to lease the site, Charlie Sharpe returned home. ""It was in its worst state in 2004,"" he recalled of the huge job facing him and wife Chantal. ""It was rundown, it was abandoned. The previous operator had walked away."" But Mr Sharpe's vision was clear. He took away most of the old buildings and started from scratch. His finishing touch was the resort's famous infinity pool — which has featured in many social media posts. Want more local news? Sign up to the weekly ABC Kimberley email newsletter G'day Group, which owns 80 holiday properties around the nation, also signed a multi-million-dollar deal in early 2021 to buy El Questro station, 60 kilometres north of Lake Argyle. CEO Grant Wilckens has committed to ""keeping the magic"" the Sharpes created as well as investing in further capital works. ""It is an absolute premier property. We're delighted to have it as part of our portfolio. We see the Kimberley as a really important strategic direction for us,"" Mr Wilckens said. ""Charlie and his family have done an incredible job. We feel as though we can continue the love."" The sale is expected to be finalised in March and although Charlie Sharpe hopes to return for holidays, leaving Argyle for the final time will be hard. ""There'll be tears,"" he said. ""I've driven that Argyle Road, 37 kilometres out to the turn-off, 4,000 or 5,000 times in the last 40 to 50 years. So when I get to that corner and turn right instead of left, it's going to tug at the heart,"" Mr Sharpe said.

231,Victorian Goldfields Railway car restoration casts minds back to days of opulence and class ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Castlemaine-Maldon rail car restoration casts minds back to days of opulence and class The Victorian Goldfields Railway tourist train service between Castlemaine and Maldon is a tip of the hat to an era of travel many have missed. It is an adventure the volunteer-run group likens to the days of the Orient Express — a long-distance passenger train which travelled intercontinental Europe into western Asia between 1883 and 2009 stopping at London, Athens, and Istanbul. It is a steady rocking on the rails, a slow-paced journey, and opulence you tend to only see in period films. Now with new first-class carriage Acheron renovated and lovingly restored over the past five years, the journey between the two central Victorian towns is even better. Victorian Goldfields Railways (VGR) president Steve Strangward started volunteering with the organisation in the 1980s and said interest in trains was always there, but keeping these living pieces of history alive was a very different experience. ""We started with no equipment, no buildings, we had to scrimp and save to do every little activity,"" he said. But over time, and with more investment by volunteers and recognition by governments that it is a unique offering in rail and tourism for regional Victoria, that has changed. ""Now I see us being accepted as a tourism product in the region and we're growing,"" Mr Strangward said. ""We genuinely have a fantastic destination in Maldon, as well as Castlemaine, being our new base."" The organisation has taken some of the most historic and abandoned carriages and turned them into something unique. The Pullman car, which was built in the 1920s in America and originally ran on The Overland to Adelaide, was used as a sleeping car and then converted into a club car. The newly launched Acheron had a similar life as a sleeper on The Overland. ""It features magnificent timber work, plush upholstery, pressed metal ceilings, leadlight, clerestory roof. It's just stunning,"" Mr Strangward said. ""It's been a massive amount of work to restore those over the last 15 to 20 years."" While the pandemic kept travellers away for the last few years, the hardest part for the VGR and other tourism operators has been trying to attract visitors back to the region. Jamie Heffernan from Experience Maldon and Maldon Getaways said the new organisation was hoping to put a spotlight on the small regional town. He said during the lockdowns, with people stuck at home and connecting with the world online, the door of exposure for the town was opened. ""It gave previous visitors to Maldon, and new people, insight into what's out there after lockdown,"" he said. ""They had more time to research and find out what to do in rural, country areas, and central Victoria. Having a train that carries passengers to the town as a destination is something that will ultimately benefit the local economy. ""We're very excited to work with VGR and the train board to possibly have guests come from Melbourne, on VLine, and then jump on the VGR steam train and come to Maldon,"" Mr Heffernan said. ""It's another avenue to get to our town. To have people arrive in an 1860s train into our village and stay"". Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Central Victoria's weekly email newsletter. VGR used mainly businesses from Bendigo and Castlemaine to complete the restoration of the 99-year-old Acheron carriage. Aileen Caddy, part of the team refurbishing the carriage's upholstery, said the experience was something quite special. It was not an easy task though, and provided a creative challenge to Charles Caddy Upholstery. ""The original carriage was refurbished at some stage, but probably not since the 1960s,"" Mrs Caddy said. ""It was a big job to maintain the character and retain the shape, and the fabric that they chose had patterns in it. ""You had to negotiate all the different pattern matching."" And seeing people react to the restored carriage was a new experience for Mrs Caddy. ""It is quite a rare thing to do because normally when you send a piece of furniture out you never get to see where it sits in the house or in the room,"" she said. ""So this is different, it is really nice to see people reacting to your work."" With this latest project completed by the VGR, Mr Strangward said their next challenge was to encourage more volunteers. ""We have a group of people that just enjoy each other's company working on a worthwhile project to produce living history,"" he said. ""Drivers, stewards, fireman guards, conductors, station staff are all volunteering their time to make this happen."" But as with most voluntary organisations, the more along for the ride, the merrier.

232,'If we don't act it'll be a free-for-all': Fears for residential boat owners in River City,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Kangaroo Point marina residents happy to see commercial boats gone Kangaroo Point residents living close to a popular Brisbane River marina have found an ally in a local councillor after a controversial decision to evict commercial tourism and hospitality operators. Businesses such as Prawnster, Brisbane Jet Skis, GoBoat and Yot Club have until March 4 to find new locations to operate from or risk having to close after two of the most difficult years for Brisbane small businesses. The frustrating news comes after many operators claimed the Queensland Department of Resources and Brisbane City Council directed them to moor at Dockside Marina in the absence of another suitable inner-city marina. However, this month's eviction notices to businesses were clearly from the state government department, which is responsible for seabed leases. Dockside Apartments precinct unit owner Greg Wilson, who has lived in his unit at Kangaroo Point for 15 years, said all the land down to the river was private property and the marina was ""essentially our front garden"". Mr Wilson said the Dockside Marina lease was for residents' boats and there were no amenities such as toilets or bins for business patrons or staff. ""If [the state government] doesn't act on these leases, it will be a free-for-all throughout the state,"" he said. Gabba Ward councillor Jonathan Sri, whose electorate takes in the marina, agreed that allowing commercial river businesses into Dockside Marina could price boat-dwelling residents out of the area. ""Personally I'd like Kangaroo Point to evolve as a more vibrant urban neighbourhood with more culture and nightlife, but exactly how that happens needs to be a democratic conversation where everyone gets a say,"" Cr Sri said. ""One element that's been overlooked is that if commercial activities at the Dockside Marina are formalised, this will likely lead to higher rents being charged for the berths, which in turn would lead to residential boat tenants being displaced in favour of more restaurant and party boats. ""I don't have any decision-making power in this matter, but I'm very mindful that it's hard enough to afford somewhere to live in the inner-city as it is, and the gradual replacement of residential marina berths with commercial berths ultimately means lower-income, long-term boat residents get priced out of the neighbourhood."" Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner sympathised with the commercial operators but said a solution had to be found by the state government. ""You can't have a river city without river tourism and river businesses,"" he said ""We're a decade away from the Olympics, and can you imagine if we went into that major tourism opportunity and we're letting our river businesses go broke because of this situation?"" On Thursday, the Department of Resources issued a statement saying work was ""underway across government to help businesses operating from the marina identify alternative mooring for the vessels"". However, the statement did not address claims that the department had directed businesses to moor at Dockside. ""The marina lease has been very close to a residential area. There have been numerous complaints from residents as well as other tenants,"" the statement said. ""The department has been pursuing these issues with the Dockside Marina lessee for some time and notified the lessee last week he has 28 days to stop all commercial operations at the marina. ""The lessee is allowing commercial operations at Dockside, which is against the conditions of its lease. ""The government recognises the contribution these businesses make to Brisbane and its visitor and night-time economy, however lessees are required to meet the conditions on their leases."" Last year, Brisbane City Council revealed more than 30 inner-city boat moorings would be removed to make way for the Kangaroo Point Green Bridge. The entire Gardens Point Harbour moorings will be removed from March, ending a long tradition of houseboats and visitors mooring on the river at the City Botanic Gardens.

233,'Duckshoved all over the river': Kangaroo Point marina businesses told to move on,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Up to 12 businesses and 400 jobs could be lost after commercial businesses at a popular Kangaroo Point marina were given 28 days to find new moorings. Tourism and hospitality businesses such as Prawnster, Brisbane Jet Skis, GoBoat and Yot Club have until March 4 to find a new location to operate from or risk having to close after two of the most difficult years for Brisbane small businesses. The frustrating news comes after many operators claimed the Department of Resources and Brisbane City Council directed them to moor at Dockside Marina in the absence of another suitable inner-city marina. However, this month's eviction notices to businesses were clearly from the state government department, which is responsible for seabed leases. Brisvegas Cruises owner Barrie Coonan was one of the owners looking for a new home and said a group of disgruntled building managers from the Dockside Apartments precinct had pooled resources to employ lawyers and force the state government to remove the commercial businesses. Mr Coonan said he was sent to Dockside Marina by the state government during the North Quay development and was told the new premises were only temporary. He also admitted the terms of the marina lease did not include commercial operations. The owner of seafood restaurant Prawnster, Martin Brennan, started his business in 2020 and received similar advice. He said, despite promises from state and local government encouraging more activities along the river and indicating there would be a new commercial marina built, nothing has happened. ""I've gone to the state government and told them I'm happy to comply but just tell me where I can go. There was just silence,"" Mr Brennan said. ""I said, 'You know all the mooring options better than I do, there's nowhere to go. You've directed us to come and moor there, other operators have moored there, some have been paid to be there'. This notice doesn't make any sense. ""Fix the lease, or provide us an alternative."" Mr Brennan said up to 400 jobs could be lost and those facing unemployment were ""very, very anxious and worried"". A Department of Resources spokesperson said work was ""underway across government to help businesses operating from the marina identify alternative mooring for the vessels"" but did not address claims it had directed businesses to moor at Dockside. ""The marina lease has been very close to a residential area. There have been numerous complaints from residents as well as other tenants,"" a statement from the department read. ""The department has been pursuing these issues with the Dockside Marina lessee for some time and notified the lessee last week he has 28 days to stop all commercial operations at the marina. ""The lessee is allowing commercial operations at Dockside, which is against the conditions of its lease. ""The government recognises the contribution these businesses make to Brisbane and its visitor and night-time economy, however lessees are required to meet the conditions on their leases."" Close by, operator Matt McKinley has a similar story and an identical fear. He left a profitable water sports business in Fiji to return home at the start of the pandemic after five years overseas. For the past 18 months he has operated Brisbane Jet Skis out of Dockside Marina and said he faced a revolving door of staff at state and local government level who were ultimately unable to help him find a permanent home. ""I've got such a small footprint on the Brisbane River and apparently it's creating a problem,"" Mr McKinley said. ""Everyone on the river has been duckshoved all over the river over the years. This is a real kick in the guts."" The only other marina the businesses could move to is Rivergate at Murrarie but its distance from the CBD and size meant it was not a viable option for Mr Brennan or Mr McKinley who rely on tourists and visitors staying in city hotels and accommodation. ""Rivergate isn't central, they can't hold everyone, they can't take on another 10 to 15 operators,"" Mr McKinley said. ""It's one of those places that is out of sight, out of mind, and if I'm 20km away from the hotels, it's too far."" Mr McKinley said the straight stretch of the river between Milton and West End would be an ideal new location for river-based businesses but no opportunities existed there.

234,Tourism grants 'get things rolling' on projects across the Limestone Coast,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Limestone Coast tourism operators share $1.8m in funding for new projects A group of tourism operators on the Limestone Coast will embark on expansions and renovations in a bid to create new visitor experiences in the region. Fourteen businesses have received a collective funding boost of more than $1.8 million from the South Australian government. The $20 million Tourism Industry Development Fund has now been fully allocated, with a total of 114 regional tourism development projects across the state receiving money from the fund. The government said the projects could unlock about $82.7 million worth of new and improved tourism infrastructure. Mount Gambier brewer Little Rippa Brewing Company is building a new purpose-built venue to house the Ale House Brewery and Restaurant after receiving a grant of more than $260,000. Co-owner Lachlan Mutton said the money had come at the ideal time after two years of COVID-induced hardship. ""It's certainly helping, especially with a venue being built from the ground up,"" Mr Mutton said. ""The grant money will help us get things rolling a bit quicker too … we've been hit fairly hard over the last two years with restricted numbers and low consumer confidence."" Mr Mutton said while some parts of the industry were returning to ""more normal"" operating conditions, there were still ""underlying issues"" with staffing in the hospitality sector. ""I think when the first COVID wave hit, a lot of people left the hospitality industry to do other things … and now there seems to be an overall shortage of trained and available staff."" He said the issue was widespread ""particularly in regional areas"". ""I know of a lot of other businesses too who are struggling to find the staff they need."" The 150-seat open-plan restaurant and brewery, which has a completion date of July this year, was designed with COVID-safe features. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC South East SA's weekly email newsletter. ""We've actually purpose-built it around some COVID rules: we've got a huge amount of open space and big outdoor areas,"" Mr Mutton said. ""We may come across this sort of thing again in the future, and if we do, we can hopefully still manage to trade at reasonable capacity. ""The whole COVID thing has really opened our eyes at how quickly things can change unexpectedly. ""Of course, we certainly hope it's not an ongoing thing, but if it is, we'll be a little bit more prepared for it in the future."" Other successful Limestone Coast grant recipients included Coonawarra wine and tourism businesses Parker Coonawarra Estate, Balnaves of Coonawarra, Raidis Estate, Ottelia and Coonawarra Experiences. In Mount Gambier, accommodation venues Aloha Accommodation, Pine Country Caravan Park, Apartments on Tolmie, Mount Gambier Apartments, Mount Gambier Hotel and The Presidential Motel received funding of up to $336,740. Elsewhere in the region, Port MacDonnell's Victoria Hotel received just over $40,000 for the development of an outdoor beer garden, and the Avenue Inn in Naracoorte will use $133,411 for three, two-bedroom self-contained units. Limestone Coast Local Government Association destination development manager Biddie Shearing said the arrival of international visitors would give regional tourism a boost. ""Because of our location near the Victorian border, we do have quite a lot of visitors from interstate as well as intrastate,"" she said. ""Our international visitors hover around 12 per cent."" She said while lower in numbers, international visitors were important to the Limestone Coast's tourism economy because they spent more money than domestic travellers while in the region. ""The United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, New Zealand and Singapore are the main markets here, and prior to COVID we were seeing real rises in the number of Indian and American tourists,"" she said. ""It will be a slow build, but I think that will work well for our region. ""We do know there's a huge built-up demand from these countries to travel, and Australia is high on their list.""

235,"Ord Valley Muster cancelled for 2022 due to COVID, border uncertainty",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  One of the Kimberley's biggest events, the Ord Valley Muster, has been cancelled for a second time due to COVID-19. The festival was supposed to go ahead over 10 days in May, featuring bands such as Ian Moss and Baker Boy, while showcasing the region's rich Indigenous and pastoral culture. The festival also kick-starts the dry season rush attracting thousands of tourists to the East Kimberley, providing a large windfall for the local economy. But late yesterday organisers said in a statement that the event had been called off. ""We have evaluated the many challenges and uncertainty due to COVID-19 and tried to find workable solutions, however there are too many uncertainties for us to confidently and safely proceed,"" the statement said. Event chair Sophie Cooke told the ABC the risk of the event being called off due to a coronavirus outbreak was too high. ""We could have lost millions of dollars if the event was cancelled last minute,"" she said. ""It's heartbreaking for all of us who spend their time and energy into building these events. It's awful."" The move marks a significant change from last year's festival, which occurred during a brief respite from the national pandemic and was a near-sellout. The announcement comes as individual tourism operators in the Kimberley have reported shedding hundreds of thousands of dollars in cancellations during recent weeks following the WA government's decision to delay the state's reopening indefinitely. Ms Cooke said that border uncertainty also influenced the decision. ""The current border controls and no given date for when that's going to change; we had real concerns about our interstate visitors and artists,"" she said. ""A vast number of our supporters are in that tourism sector so they're already feeling the pinch. It's going to hurt."" Shire of Wyndham East Kimberley president David Menzel said it's a disappointing outcome given last year's event brought about six million dollars into the region. ""Really unfortunate we don't have a pathway to opening up the state,"" he said. ""The idea of going ahead with a massive event in such a relatively small community, it's just too risky.""

236, 'The hardest months are to come': Mothballed tourism operators face staff shortages ahead of border reopening,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tourism operators say staffing demand a challenge as international border reopens In January 2020 Go West Tours had 132 staff on its payroll; as of this week the company has five employees and the managing director Terry Smit is back driving buses for the first time in nearly 15 years. While Mr Smit welcomes the easing of border restrictions for international travellers, he says restarting his business after two years of ""hibernation"" will be extremely challenging. ""It is very good news that the border is being reopened again, but I fear that for me and other tourism operators the hardest months are to come,"" he told The Conversation Hour. ""We've got a long way to come back and, you know, I guess what we would say is that we will muddle through it the best way that we possibly can."" His biggest concern is coaxing staff back into tourism after being forced to find work in other industries during the pandemic. Owner of Hidden Secrets Tours Fiona Sweetman is also nervous about the coming months. ""I think the misconception is just because the 21st of February is happening, that suddenly we will get clients — it just doesn't work that way,"" she said. ""My biggest problem is trying to manage bookings with a very reduced, skeleton staff."" Since Go West Tours was founded in 2000 it has relied almost solely on international tourists, taking them to popular Victorian destinations including the Great Ocean Road and Phillip Island. When Australia's border closed in 2020 and tours ceased, Mr Smit said the company's revenue went from 100 per cent to zero. ""When JobKeeper ended we had to say [to staff] go and get another job, we don't have any work for you,"" Mr Smit said. Two years on Mr Smit believes every single person has found new employment, even he took a short-term position working in COVID testing and logistics. We answer your questions about the new travel rules at Australia's border. When Mr Smit saw signs of international tourism slowly returning a few months ago, he sent an email to all the staff they had stood down in 2020 to see who wanted to come back. ""People were keen, but not until they had guaranteed work. The problem is I can't guarantee people work at the moment,"" he said. He was also concerned about the up-front expenses involved in reviving his business, with everything from recruitment and training, to marketing and re-registering more than a dozen vehicles. It would all be up-front costs. ""There are effectively no tour guides who are match fit and registering vehicles is expensive,"" he said. Ms Sweetman's business runs several different walking tours in Melbourne, serving both international and domestic travellers. ""We are running some tours now, the border announcement hasn't changed the number of tours we are running,"" she said. ""International bookings aren't coming through until at least July … most of them are for November or December."" To stay afloat Ms Sweetman has had to take another full-time job, and is trying to manage tour bookings after hours. She would like to put on an office manager but is concerned about demand, the cost of training someone and maintaining her long-term relationships with overseas travel agents. ""Exhaustion for owners is seriously high,"" she said. ""I want to give a job, but I can't afford to unless income is more reliable."" Prior to COVID, Go West Tours would run about 50 ""mostly full"" tours a week. Even with the announcement that international tourists can return, next week they will only run three-to-five ""half full"" tours. ""It's going to be like turning a tap back on again for the first time in years,"" Mr Smit said. ""There is going to be a fair bit of spluttering, there is going to be a bit of rust and then we will get flowing again. ""But we've got no idea how long it will take to get back to what we were before."" Chief executive of the Victorian Tourism Industry Council Felicia Mariani said Mr Smit and Ms Sweetman are not alone. ""It has been a devastating time for these people,"" she said. After mothballing a business, Ms Mariani said restarting trade won't be easy. ""You can't just flick a switch and all of a sudden open your doors,"" she said. ""They've got to find drivers again, they've got to retrain people and … we've got big holes to fill."" She is calling on federal and state governments to work together to promote Australia as a destination for international tourists and backpackers. ""We've got to get back in that game,"" she said.

239,Meet two house-sitting nomads happy without their own home,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  House-sitting nomads happy without a home to call their own Relaxing in a spa in the leafy backyard of a coastal timber house near Bundaberg, Keith Murfet looks very at home. The retired truck driver believes he has discovered his personal slice of paradise in Moore Park in what seems like a rolling beach vacation. And the best part of living in paradise is the cost of his accommodation — free. Mr Murfet is a house-sitter and lives rent and mortgage-free looking after homes while their owners travel. After he himself travelled across Australia in a caravan Mr Murfet started house-sitting in the Bundaberg region about two years ago, suiting his now relaxed lifestyle. ""I don't have to make plans at all,"" Mr Murfet said. ""The place I'm at now has a spa, a 100-metre walk to the beach, and 'the best bakery in the world' down the road. ""What more can you ask for?"" Using websites that offer listings for those who need house-sitters, or where people can offer their own house-sitting services, Mr Murfet packed his bag and started living without a permanent address. But as time passed he has not needed any further online help. ""I think 70 to 80 per cent [of bookings] have been word of mouth,"" he said. ""I pulled up one time to buy some lychees off a lady on the side of the road and ended up house-sitting their place for 10 weeks."" Some house-sitters also care for pets or livestock, but Mr Murfet prefers flexibility, completing chores and maintaining the house and yards. And while some house-sitters charge, many do not. It has never been harder and more expensive to find a place to call home in Queensland. House prices have risen dramatically in the past two years and rental vacancy rates are close to zero in places like the Fraser Coast and Bundaberg region. Kim, who asked for her surname not to be published, is among those opting for a nomadic lifestyle. For seven years she has had no fixed address and travels around regional Queensland house-sitting, camping, utilising backpackers, or staying with friends. ""I meet a lot of people who are just the same,"" Kim said. ""I think more people at the moment are seeking a change in lifestyle. ""They want to experience more than just the mundane 9-to-5 job and the city life."" Kim admitted her lifestyle was not for everyone and, as a woman travelling independently, it was important to remain ""vigilant"". But her main concern, she said, was spiders in her sleeping bag. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Wide Bay's weekly email newsletter. While house-sitting can often make her yearn for her own home, the sense of opportunity makes up for it. ""There have been pockets at times when I felt very comfortable, in a house-sit mainly,"" she said. ""And I think, 'What aspects of this am I missing?' ""Then I look on the other side and think, 'I've had all these opportunities and great experiences and I don't want any of that'."" Mr Murfet and Kim agreed it took a certain personality to live without a home on purpose. ""Work out what standard of travel you would like to engage with,"" she said. ""Be open and just try it.""

240,Floodwater damage delays Outback tourist hotspot reopening ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Floodwater damage delays Outback tourist hotspot Ellery Creek Big Hole reopening One of Central Australia's popular tourist destinations will remain off-limits for the foreseeable future thanks to damage to the access road from recent rain. Works to upgrade the Ellery Creek Big Hole's 2km access road in the Tjorita/West Macdonnell National Park started in December and were expected to finish late last month. May Taylor, regional director from the Department of Planning and Infrastructure, said the recent weather event caused significant and extensive damage to the road project. ""We're working with the contractor to assess the damage and to develop a plan to progress the works as soon as possible,"" she said. Ms Taylor said the reopening of the road would be delayed. ""We're now in discussions with the contractor and Parks and Wildlife in regards to that revised date,"" she said. Crews have only been able to access the site to assess the damage in the past week and Ms Taylor said it had been disappointing given the progress the contractors had made. ""In some areas, particularly across that river crossing, it has been washed away,"" she said. ""We were getting ready to put some finishing touches in a couple of areas. ""And now we're back to square one."" Heavy plant and equipment stored at the site was also damaged. ""The extent of the floodwaters that came down the Hugh River has seen some of that plant [equipment] actually go underwater,"" Ms Taylor said. ""Obviously you need some of that key equipment to be able to progress."" Ms Taylor was unable to predict the cost of the damage or even when works would recommence as the priority for contractors was to ""get in there and start looking at the damage"". ""We'll need to get more materials into that site so that we can commence our work again,"" she said. ""I can't confirm when the works to actually continue to upgrade the road will recommence."" Ms Taylor said the damage was extensive. ""In some places, particularly across the river, it's hard to distinguish between the road and the actual riverbed,"" she said. ""It's a bit hard to see where the actual road is."" Despite the setback, Ms Taylor said the department was in discussion with Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife. ""We will come up with a plan to get works back on track, but at this stage [I am] unable to give any sort of time frame of when that will be,"" she said. Parks and Wildlife operations senior director Chris Day said the event was a significant flood for the region. ""The entire Finke River catchment was affected,"" Mr Day said. ""It was probably the biggest flow since Easter 2000."" Mr Day said they were expecting significant damage to the campsite north of Ellery Creek, which formed part of the Larapinta Trail. ""We have an automatic rain gauge at Mt Sonder. This recorded 112mm from January 27 to 31,"" he said. ""Then a further 114.8mm to February 3."" Mr Day said rangers would be assessing the effect the recent rain had on the Larapinta Trail, with the season officially starting in early April. ""The biggest issue we get with rain events like this one is the vegetation growth, especially the buffel grass,"" he said. ""Our focus will be to ensure that walkers will be able to safely navigate the Larapinta Trail for the coming season.""

241,Council approves Flinders Island base camp for tourism venture ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Council approves Flinders Island base camp for tourism venture The Flinders Island Council has given the go-ahead to a new base camp for a multi-day walk in the island's remote north-west. The proposal, put forward by eco-tourism operators World Expeditions, would see seven sleeping tents and a steel-framed ablutions block set up on private land at Leeka, between Tanners Bay and Burts Hill. The tents and ""full capture"" ablutions block would be dismantled and removed for the off-season from May to September. ""The proposal is for use of the property as part of multi-day bushwalking expeditions providing an interpretive wilderness walking experience of northern Flinders Island,"" the DA said. ""They will provide an overnight base as part of guided wilderness experiences with interpretive talks on native flora, fauna and astronomy as well as bird watching and landscape art retreats during the summer season."" Numbers would be limited to 14 people with two or three guides. About 450 square metres of vegetation would have to be removed to build an access road and construction would have to be carried out outside of the white-bellied sea eagles' breeding season, from July 1 to January 31. ""If works are required inside this breeding season, a nest activity assessment by a suitably qualified person is required. ""This must be undertaken from the air during October/November,"" the development application said. Birdlife Tasmania's Eric Woehler said white-bellied sea eagles were not as endangered as wedge-tailed eagles but it was still a concern if they were disturbed when nesting. ""Any permit would have to be strictly complied with and enforced,"" he said. ""That's the problem. Council doesn't have the time or resources to enforce these permits and the developers know that."" If any Aboriginal relics are uncovered during construction, work has to cease immediately and the item has to be reported to Aboriginal Heritage Tasmania. According to the DA: ""Wastewater will be disposed of through a low impact eco-friendly on-site solution, most likely a composting toilet. Water will be supplied through refillable containers and no power is required."" Flinders Island mayor Annie Revie said the council wanted to move away from a traditional approach to tourism ""where residents felt it was done to them, rather than with them"" and focus on a more ""regenerative"" approach, which prioritised sustainable, low-impact projects. ""People believe that tourism is very important to the island but in the past it's sometimes been the wrong kind of tourism. ""We want people to come for the landscape. It's a very special kind of beauty and this kind of development will showcase it."" World Expeditions already runs a six-day guided walk across Flinders Island that takes in Mt Killiecrankie and Mt Strzelecki at a cost of several thousand dollars.

242,New airline promises direct flights from Mildura and Albury to the Sunshine Coast,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Mildura and Albury welcome new airline Bonza, direct route to Queensland Two regional airports are celebrating a new airline's plan to introduce direct flights to Queensland. Bonza says it will offer flights three times per week from Mildura to Melbourne and will open new direct, twice-weekly routes from Mildura and Albury to the Sunshine Coast. Mildura Airport chief executive Trevor Willcock says introducing flights to Queensland for the first time was ""very, very exciting news"" for the Sunraysia region. ""We've been after [that] for a long time,"" he said. ""There's always been a very big call for a Queensland route when we do our surveys, so we're confident it will be great."" Bonza, which will be based on the Sunshine Coast, intends to offer flights 16 locations from when it launches later this year. Mildura Mayor Liam Wood hoped the introduction of a third airline in addition to Qantas and Rex Airlines at Mildura would help drive down prices. ""I know [prices] have gone through the roof at the moment and it's making it pretty impossible for people to get out or get in to this town, so every bit of competition … is a great thing,"" he said. ""Due to our isolation we do use the airport a hell of a lot — before COVID I believe we had over 240,000 passengers, so it's really important to our community."" Bonza chief commercial officer Carly Povey said the carrier was an ""an ultra-low cost airline"" that would probably only offer a small number of flights from each of its locations. ""We understand the amount of customers that want to travel,"" she said. ""You won't see from Bonza five, six, or seven flights a day — you'll see two, three, four flights a week. ""Our average fares will be around $50 for a one-hour flight — our starting fares will be significantly lower than that."" Ms Povey said the airline was hoping to offer its first flights by June or July, subject to regulatory approval. Team leader of Albury Airport operations, Nick Politis, said with the additional services provided by Bonza, he expected to soon be able to return to a pre-pandemic level of travel. ""The pandemic has really devastated the aviation and travel market,"" he said. ""We have seen a lot of people stop travelling basically because of the restrictions but as soon as restrictions are lifted people want to travel. ""People want to see each other again."" Mayor of Albury City Kylie King welcomed the news, and was hopeful it would not only boost the local economy, but encourage more people to relocate to regional parts of the country. ""There are more of those tree changes out there that know they can work from anywhere, so I have no doubt that there are other people who will see this as an advantage,"" she said. ""[The flights] will be a great benefit, I'm hoping, to our tourism and accommodation providers in not just Albury Wodonga but the broader region as well.""

243,Qantas to continue Darwin to London service as doubt remains over WA border,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Qantas will continue to run direct daily flights between Darwin and London until at least the end of June amid ongoing uncertainty about the reopening of the border to Western Australia. The route from Darwin to London was established in November last year when international travel resumed but WA remained closed, eliminating the airline's Perth to London service. Qantas was due to resume flights from Perth to London in April, but the WA government has still not confirmed when it will reopen its borders. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the extension of its ""kangaroo route"" to London via Darwin gave the Top End time to ""properly leverage"" the reopening of Australia's borders to tourists. ""It's a great opportunity to encourage thousands of visitors to stop off in Darwin to see what the NT has to offer,"" he said. Australia is preparing to open its borders to international travellers from February 21. From then on, all fully vaccinated visa holders will be able to travel to Australia without a travel exemption. Unvaccinated visa holders, however, will still need a valid travel exemption to enter the country. Qantas will continue to operate the Sydney to London flight via Darwin instead of through Singapore until June. In a statement the airline said testing requirements in Singapore were also a factor in the decision to maintain the Darwin connection instead. The airline currently operates daily flights from both Melbourne and Sydney to London via Darwin on its 787 Dreamliner. As part of the same announcement, the NT government said it had struck a deal with Qantas to deliver a new aircraft base in Darwin for the airline's Embraer 190 domestic aircraft. Mr Joyce said basing the smaller aircraft in Darwin would make it easier for tourists arriving in the Top End to get flights to Alice Springs, and boost tourism in Central Australia. The project promises to deliver up to 200 new jobs, including pilots, cabin crew and aircraft maintenance roles. The NT government has announced it will invest up to $3.6 million in training and marketing, plus incentives to attract workers to move to the NT. Qantas plans to launch E190 routes by the end of March this year, including: Additional flight routes are expected later this year. The weekly Qantas route to Timor-Leste, which opened in February 2021, will now become permanent, with three flights between Darwin and Dili per week, increasing to five flights a week from July. NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner hailed the route as an ""extremely exciting connection that will bolster our case for seeing more frequent flights out of Darwin."" ""We can't forget our friends to the north and our close connections to hundreds of millions of people, especially Timor-Leste [and] the ties of blood and family that go that way,"" he said. Timor-Leste's foreign minister Adaljiza AXR Magno said the new regular Qantas flights presented a ""big opportunity for Timor-Leste to promote [ourselves] as a tourism destination"". ""Many Timorese people go to London to look for jobs,"" she added. However, Mr Joyce said it was unlikely the Darwin to London route would continue after WA reopened its borders. ""The dilemma we have… is that Perth has maybe 2 million people and Darwin has 150,000 people. So the demand you get out of Perth to London and back for business, for tourism, for visiting friends and relatives, is bigger,"" he said.

244,Love lands on the Gold Coast for the first time in two years,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Love is in the air, and it's just touched down on the Gold Coast. It has been almost two years since international flights have been able to land at the Gold Coast airport without COVID quarantine restrictions. The first flight from Scoot Airways arrived from Singapore just before 7am. Waiting at the arrivals terminal, John Gormley said he was ""pretty nervous"" to see his partner Lili Tan after almost two years apart. Mr Gormley, who lives in Thailand, came to Australia for a month-long trip to see his elderly parents in 2020, but was forced to stay when the international border closed. ""I haven't seen her for 23 months,"" he said. ""I don't really know what I'll do [when I see her]. Give her a hug for sure."" But with love in the air on Valentine's Day, the pair plan to head out for a second first date. ""We're just going to find somewhere nice for breakfast that's as far as we're going so far,"" he said. ""Just get to know each other again."" The pair took to video calling twice a day every day for the past two years. After a teary reunion, Ms Tan said it had been a tough lead-up. ""I couldn't wait, it was impossible to sleep, impossible to do anything,"" she said. Gold Coast-based Ejlal Almaktoum has been living and working in Singapore for the past two years. She said it had been difficult to be away from her loved ones. ""It's been a long time,"" she said. ""My family and friends are all here. ""I'm just glad to be reunited with everyone."" The last international pre-COVID flight arrived at the Gold Coast Airport on March 24, 2020, and it has been 696 days since the city welcomed the last quarantine-free flight from Asia. Queensland Airports CEO Chris Mills said the Scoot flight marked the start of a re-emerging airport network. ""In a couples of weeks' time we'll see flights from New Zealand, and we're focused on places like Japan and South Korea,"" he said. Mr Mills said travel confidence was going to be the key driver for returns to the Gold Coast. ""Internationally, each country has its own rules and requirements around testing, forms [and] processes, and people understandably will take time to work their way through it,"" he said. ""People will want to see that it's working and watch what's happening."" Pre-COVID, about 124,000 people travelled between the Gold Coast and Singapore each year. Destination Gold Coast CEO Patricia O'Callaghan said the local economy had suffered a million-visitor blow since Australia closed its international borders. ""We know the international market is absolutely lucrative for the Gold Coast,"" she said. ""More importantly, these visitors are more than just our economy — they are a part of our community and our social fabric."" Ms O'Callaghan said Changi Airport was displaying images of the Gold Coast at the international airport in a bid to attract more tourists.

245,"Known as the Banksy of the bush, Joel Fergie has painted more than 1,000 murals across Australia",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Silo, water tower mural artist Joel Fergie known as Banksy of the bush Known as the Banksy of the bush, Zookeeper is an artist who travels around outback Australia painting giant murals, but unlike Banksy, the Zookeeper doesn't hide his identity. Joel Fergie aka ""Zookeeper"" is a Sunshine Coast-based artist whose large-scale artworks span inner-city laneways to remote silos and water towers across central Australia. Some of his biggest works can be seen on painted tanks and silos in Cloncurry, Mackay, Hughenden, Thallon as well as interstate. Joel says he got the name Zookeeper from his childhood love of wildlife. ""As a kid I was obsessed with animals and I was a huge David Attenborough fan and as I learnt to paint, animals became a big part of that,"" he said. The 32-year-old artist, who studied fine art at QUT and graduated in 2011, said art was a big part of his life growing up. ""I was always into drawing as a kid. It was my release as a teenager,"" he said. ""I wasn't born great at painting; it was something that I had to put a lot of time and practice into and gradually over time I got better. ""I started by doing my bedroom wall and then under our house, then a few friends asked me to do their café and then a I did a soccer club and the more I did the more opportunities arose."" The biggest job that Joel has done was seven silos at Sea Lake in north-west Victoria which took him over three weeks. When tackling the big jobs, Zookeeper collaborates with his mate and fellow artist Drapl aka Travis Vinson. ""We meet in 2010 and we had heard of each other and ever since then, when there's a big job that requires many hands, we collaborate,"" he said. ""The big jobs can take weeks and weeks of planning and we can use over 500 litres of paint."" Most of Zookeeper's and Drapl's work comes from community grants or funds raised by the community, and over the past decade he believes he has painted more than 1,000 murals. ""My favourite part of painting in the outback is the openness of people. There's fewer people, so they have more time for you,"" he said. ""The best stories come from sitting at the pub and the locals telling you about their life. ""I like painting local people, because they tell the greatest stories and I always make sure the background fits into the environment as well."" Joel's last big mural was a water tower in Middlemount which he finished in December and last week he finished a retaining wall in the Pioneer Valley community at the Marian State School which was only 20 metres by 2 metres. ""My favourite little detail from the last wall I painted in Marian is my old troopy crossing into Finch Hatton Gorge,"" he said. Now he is about to start painting a water tower at Point Cartwright on the Sunshine Coast which has been commissioned by the Sunshine Coast Council and Unitywater. ""When doing a big job in a rural area you stay wherever someone will put you up,"" he said. ""Staying with locals is the most authentic way to get to know the place and hear their stories. ""I get to become part of the place and the place becomes part of me."" While Joel has painted outback silos and inner-city lanes, he says that he prefers his paintings in the country rather than the big cities. ""In the city the paintings become diluted by the busyness of the city,"" he said. ""Whereas in the country the paintings stand out and became part of the landscape because there is nothing around them."" While he has been referred to as the Banksy of the bush, it's not a comparison that Joel understands. ""My work is nothing like Banksy's, but I will take the compliment because Banksy is an amazing artist,"" he said. There is also one big item left on Joel's wish-list: ""I want to paint a big dam wall.""

247,'Disrespect not welcome': Tourists are itching to go overseas but some places are wary about having them back,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The world has been reopening after nearly two years of COVID-19 travel restrictions, but some popular destinations don't want tourists back at pre-pandemic levels, while others have urged visitors to be more courteous. The coronavirus pandemic has dealt the tourism industry a massive blow with international arrivals down more than 70 per cent compared to 2019 levels, according to the World Tourism Organization. Last year, tourist arrivals increased by a modest 4 per cent — or 15 million arrivals — compared to 2020. To add to that, new travel restrictions in response to the Omicron variant are causing the industry further pain. So why are some places with a history of drawing massive crowds now trying to revitalise their lucrative tourism sectors, but with fewer visitors? From Kyoto to Barcelona, here's a look at what some destinations are going to do as travellers return. Officials in Japan's historic former capital Kyoto hinted earlier in the pandemic about the need to reduce tourist numbers to the city. Kyoto's Mayor Daisaku Kadokawa said in 2020: ""Kyoto is not a tourist town."" ""We're not going to go back to pre-corona tourism."" Aya McKinley, manager of the Kyoto Machiya Fukune hotel, told the ABC while she couldn't wait to see travellers back in Kyoto, and Japan more broadly, some locals hoped tourists would be more courteous when they returned. She said many residents were concerned before the pandemic about the volume of tourists using public transport, meaning locals often couldn't get a seat. Poor manners from tourists was another concern of locals, she said. But Ms McKinley said it was just a small minority of tourists not following the rules. ""I think we just want them to understand more about Kyoto culture and just follow the rules,"" she said. Japan's National Tourism Organisation said the country was promoting lesser-known areas and outdoor activities to combat overtourism. Recently, Japan has been tackling an Omicron wave that has been breaking daily case and death records. In Bali, businesses have been itching for the return of tourists and local authorities have been more welcoming than those in other popular places. The tourist hotspot reopened to fully vaccinated travellers from all countries last Friday for the first time in two years. Visitors have to quarantine for five days at one of five designated five-star quarantine hotels. It was one of Bali’s best kept secrets, then tourism boomed. Now COVID has forced locals back to nature. ""Everyone's been waiting for this. Tourism is the backbone of Bali,"" restaurant manager Kadek Miharjaya said last year when Bali started to reopen. Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, said last year that the government only wanted to attract ""quality"" tourists after reopening. ""We'll aim for quality tourism in Bali, so we won't allow backpackers to enter once the reopening plan for international travellers is officially put in place in the near future,"" Mr Pandjaitan was quoted as saying by The Bali Sun. But a spokesperson for Mr Pandjaitan reportedly walked back that remark. ""This was just a misunderstanding. What was meant were visitors who disobey regulations or protocols on health, law, and immigration,"" the spokesperson told local media Kompas. Prague's mayor has also expressed concern about increasing tourism, which has reached nearly 8 million visitors a year. In October 2020, Prague introduced a new tourism strategy in the hope of balancing the economic benefits of tourism with the needs of the city's residents. ""Too many people are coming just for a very small number of purposes, and buildings, and those who want to make profits from the presence of the tourists worsen the situation,"" Mayor Pavel Cizinsky said in 2019. Prague City Tourism told the ABC the city centre was becoming overcrowded, which has put a strain on services for locals. Residents have also complained about anti-social behaviour from intoxicated tourists. Mr Cizinsky said he wanted to reduce pub crawls, limit alcohol serving times and encourage tourists to visit other, lesser-known parts of the city. ""We don't want to open bars. We don't want foreigners from all over Europe to come here to drink,"" then-prime minister Andrej Babiš said in 2021. In addition to encouraging tourists to venture beyond drinking spots in the city centre, Prague City Tourism told the ABC it was collecting data to better understand what most interested tourists. The Czech Republic has one of the world's worst rates of coronavirus deaths per capita. According to John Hopkins University, about 37,600 people have died with COVID in the country since the start of the pandemic. Throughout the pandemic, Venetians have wandered their city's streets without the usual crowds of tourists. In normal times, the city attracts about 25 million tourists a year. But that's a number that has concerned local officials and frustrated residents who have left the city in droves, with an estimated 50,000 residents remaining compared to about 170,000 in the 1950s. Foreign Correspondent discovers Venice is facing multiple threats, but the sheer weight of visitors is the one that many native Venetians find most overwhelming. It has been described as ""overtourism"" — when destinations become overcrowded and travellers outnumber locals and push them away. In an attempt to reduce the number of tourists, day visitors to Venice will be charged up to €10 ($16.20) to enter. Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said the charge would make tourism in the city more sustainable. ""I expect protests, lawsuits, everything … but I have a duty to make this city liveable for those who inhabit it and also for those who want to visit,"" he said in September. Mr Brugnaro said authorities had yet to decide how many people was too many, and when the new rules would kick in, though they were expected to come into force later this year or early the next. Visitors will require a ""green pass"" to prove vaccination to enter shops and a ""super green pass"" — to prove they have been boosted — to dine at cafes, restaurants and enter other venues. Italy was one of the world's COVID-19 epicentres at the beginning of the pandemic but life is slowly returning to normal. Amsterdam is another city hoping to reduce the number of misbehaving tourists. Authorities have cracked down on tourists who get drunk and sleep in their cars, and have increased patrols in busy areas, especially on weekends, according to local media. ""We do not want to go back to what we saw before the pandemic, where massive crowds in the red-light district and the city's entertainment areas caused a nuisance to residents,"" Amsterdam's city hall said last year. ""Visitors who respect Amsterdam and the people of Amsterdam have always been welcome and will, of course, remain so. ""Visitors who treat our residents and heritage with disrespect are not welcome. The message we have for them is: don't come to Amsterdam."" Tom van der Leij, the head of Dutch tour company Toms Travel Tours, said Amsterdam needed to move away from a type of tourism that made the city ""one big, open-air attraction park"". As an Amsterdam native, Mr van der Leij said the city was not built to host so many tourists at once. He took aim at larger tour groups that often only had short stays and contributed little to the local economy. ""They don't have any affection [for] the city, they don't bring any money in — so no taxes — and it's an abuse of the city,"" he said. He said Amsterdam needed to move towards sustainable tourism. The Netherlands recently announced it was easing its tough COVID-19 restrictions, even as cases continue to rise because of Omicron. Residents in Barcelona have become frustrated by, according to a Barcelona City Hall report in 2014, an estimated 27 million visitors a year, half of which stay a night. How do you make housing more affordable? Barcelona thinks part of the answer is cutting down on short-term tourist rentals. The city of 1.3 million has struggled with housing for years, and surging tourism numbers have made the problem so bad it's been driving up rents across the city as landlords find they can get far more from foreigners than locals. Last May, Barcelona's tourism authority released an app for tourists, which shows in real time whether popular attractions are busy. Tourism Barcelona CEO Eduard Torres said the app would ""strengthen sustainability"" in the face of changing visitor demands to prevent congestion at popular sites. Alfonso Rodríguez Badal, the Mayor of Calvia — a popular town of about 50,000 on the island of Mallorca — said tourism after the pandemic in his area needed to focus on environmental, economic and social sustainability. ""We cannot continue to measure tourism seasons just by the millions of tourists and stays per year,"" Mr Badal was quoted as saying in the Majorca Daily Bulletin. ""Nor should we believe that these indicators must grow year after year."" Susanne Becken, a sustainable tourism expert from Griffith University, said overtourism recently emerged as a problem in some cities which had been ""overrun"" with tourists before the pandemic. Professor Becken said there were three ways authorities could address overtourism: levies, a crackdown on bad tourist behaviour and working with the tourist industry to ease pressure on destinations. Working with tourism businesses to reduce the number of visitors is the most effective way of easing pressure on overrun destinations, she believes. Australians are one step closer to booking their next Bali holiday. But there are a few COVID-19 conditions to meet, including a mandatory five-day stay at a luxury resort. Professor Becken said Dubrovnik, for example, had halved the number of cruise ships they allow in town. ""That's probably more effective in those areas where there's really so much demand that you have to reduce the pipeline."" Professor Becken said there was less evidence to suggest educating tourists about manners and imposing levies on travellers worked to reduce conflict between locals and tourists. Rather, she believes those kind of moves should be part of a ""portfolio of measures"", because alone they aren't enough to make tourism sustainable. Professor Becken said sustainable tourism respected the social boundaries of a destination, didn't erode its culture and took account of environmental factors like carbon footprint and impact on biodiversity. ""There's some countries or even destinations within countries that [are] really, really quite keen to not revert back to old patterns and models,"" she said. ""There's a lot of old structures that of course prevent the change but there's also considerable interest.""

248,The Spirit of Tasmania's Victorian terminal will move from Melbourne to Geelong this year,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  TT-Line says new Spirit of Tasmania terminal at Geelong will be operating from spring Spirit of Tasmania passengers hoping to arrive in the heart of Melbourne have only a few months to do so before TT-Line shifts its Victorian port to Geelong. The Spirit's lease at Port Melbourne's Station Pier will end in November, with the passenger ferry to dock at Corio Quay instead. An exact date for the move has not been set, but bookings have already opened to sail to and from Geelong next year. New promotional vision of the 12-hectare Corio hub boasts ""smooth boarding and disembarking"", with the facility offering marshalling for 600 cars and freight parking for 150 semi-trailers. The Corio Quay port base is about 70 kilometres south-west of Port Melbourne, roughly an hour's drive from the capital city. TT-Line announced its new Victorian port in 2020, with chairman Mike Grainger saying it would give the company ""a unique opportunity to enhance the customer experience"". Mr Grainger has said Corio Quay is easy to get to and solves a number of ""operational constraints"" at Station Pier. TT-Line has said the move will not add time to the sailings, but efficiencies at the new port will save time. The promotional video states the new port provides a ""gateway to some of Victoria's best destinations"", including Geelong, the Twelve Apostles, Ballarat and the Bellarine Peninsula, and it will ""open up opportunities in the tourism, hospitality and logistics sectors"". The Corio Quay will also able to accommodate two larger Spirit of Tasmania vessels which are set to be built by Finnish shipbuilder RMC. The new vessels, slated to replace TT-Line's existing fleet, are expected to start sailing next year and in 2024.

249,How welcoming is Australia of LGBTQIA+ travellers? This couple hit the road to find out,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  There are two questions Charlie Douty asks himself before heading off on holiday. ""First question – is it safe? Second question – will I have to go back into the closet?"" They're common questions for many LGBTQIA+ travellers, Mr Douty says, even in Australia where some believe inclusion ""isn't an issue anymore"". He and partner Michael Kabourakis are a year into their tour of the country, having hit coastal and regional sites across Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. The couple have documented their road-trip through a string of glistening selfies and sweeping drone shots. Why? Firstly, for the memories, and secondly, to fill what they say is a void of LGBTQIA+ representation in media and marketing in the tourism industry. The couple is known as the Husbands That Travel to more than 35,000 Instagram followers, who have joined their journey to create ""the very first gay and LGBT+ travel guide"" of Australia. ""A lot of the time it's not necessarily that it isn't a gay welcoming town, it's that you don't know,"" Mr Douty said. ""[You don't know] if it's worth taking that risk of being yourself or if it's just easier to pretend you're brothers."" LGBTQIA+ advocates say now is a ""critical time"" for Australia to be welcoming, with borders opening and international events on the horizon like Sydney WorldPride 2023 and the Brisbane 2032 Summer Olympics. Mr Douty said overall the couple have had ""inclusive and welcoming"" experiences around the entire country, but still felt ""afraid to show [their] sexuality"" in some instances. They said venturing into new communities without knowing if all were welcome, was daunting, and kickstarted their mission to fill in the unknown for their followers. ""When you google 'gay travel', usually what pops up is cities, bars, clubs … you don't hear about the Ningaloo Reef, you don't hear about Fitzroy Island, you don't hear about all the natural hotspots,"" Mr Kabourakis said. ""And that's the beauty of Australia, Australia is so beautiful. I definitely wouldn't want anyone to miss out."" In ""Australia's largest national survey of the health and wellbeing of LGBTQI people"" led by La Trobe University in 2020, only around 30 per cent of some 6,800 participants felt accepted ""a lot"" or ""always"" in public and at mainstream venues and events. Mr Douty said members of the community often carried previous experiences of ""trauma and rejection"" and valued knowing a place was welcoming before they arrived. ""It's not enough to say, 'everything's fine … everything's equal',"" he said. ""The work is not done."" Now was a ""critical time"" for the tourism industry to reflect, according to Dr Elise Stephenson, who was named among Google's Top 50 LGBTIQ+ Australian leaders. She said inclusivity and representation was ""100 per cent"" on advocates' radars, given most Australian states had removed interstate travel restrictions, more were allowing international arrivals and there were ""really big events on the horizon"". In a first for the southern hemisphere, Sydney is set to host WorldPride 2023, the largest event of its kind, including 17 days of marches, festivals and conferences. Organiser Interpride said the New York hosted event in 2019 saw about five million people gather over the main weekend alone. ""We'll have a lot of LGBTIQ+ travellers from across the world coming to Australia,"" Dr Stephenson said. ""And they'll not only sit in Sydney, but they want to come and visit the [Great Barrier] Reef, head out to Uluru or other locations."" Dr Stephenson said Australia will be on the ""international stage"" approaching the Brisbane 2032 Summer Olympics and ""urban and rural"" areas alike needed to prepare to welcome the ""infinitely diverse"" global community. ""LGBTIQ+ communities cut across every sector of society, every ethnic group, every age, every income bracket,"" she said. ""How can we make sure they feel safe, supported, recognised and visible when it comes to these really big, public events?"" Sign up for ABCQueer's monthly newsletter, delivering the ABC's best stories and content for LGBTQIA+ folks and their allies. Australia did make Lonely Planet's top ""15 most gay-friendly places"" in 2021, but only with Sydney coming in at number 15. ""That reflects where we're at,"" Louise Terry, president of Gay and Lesbian Tourism Australia (GALTA) said. ""We're certainly known as a destination … but I think in terms of direct marketing, there's still some way to go."" GALTA works to educate and connect operators with the LGBTQIA+ travel market, which Ms Terry describes as ""resilient"" and ""travel ready"". Ms Terry said being inclusive was a ""matter of being consistent"" from displaying a welcoming LGBTQIA+ website, to social media references, and hiring and training staff that were prepared to include all. Dr Stephenson said a ""rainbow flag"" symbol was a good start but it needed to go further. She said an operator could be inclusive by having an understanding of the barriers travellers face, engaging community groups, supporting pride events, having diverse marketing and being aware of other friendly, local services. ""At the heart of Australia, we do have the intent and just need to display it a bit better,"" she said. Whitsundays sailing and cruising company marketing manager, Jamie Meurant, hosted the Husbands That Travel, to offer ""a bit of guidance"" to LGBTQIA+ travellers. As a member of the LGBTQIA+ community himself, Mr Meurant said the Whitsundays and Queensland at large was a ""very comfortable and safe place"", but it was not always clear to travellers. ""Unless you have connections to this area, you may not know that we're very gay and lesbian friendly,"" he said. Mr Meurant said as a small business ""it's really important to show your support for all of the communities that support you"".

250,"When this railway station closed in 1985, one man refused to leave",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Why Peter Savage devotes himself to ensuring his beloved Kalangadoo railway town doesn't disappear On a clear night, the sounds of a steam train and Deep Purple can be heard coming from the old Kalangadoo Railway Station. It is many years since the station in South Australia's south-east last welcomed a train, but the sounds are not a ghostly echo from the past. They come from a dusty audio system operated by former station master Peter Savage. ""I go to the pub, come back here and just crank it up. Sit down on my bloody chair and let it wash over me,"" Peter says. A Kalangadoo boy ""born and bred"", Peter has an undying commitment to the station, which was built in 1907 and was once a bustling hive of activity. ""Kalangadoo, she was a major point of distribution and receiver for the rail,"" Peter says. Timber, potatoes, livestock, passengers travelling to Adelaide, everyone relied on the train to get anywhere or anything. ""This is why the town's here, because of the railway,"" he says. ""You had two passenger trains a day, the Bluebird up and down. And then the night train every second day. ""We were all the go back in the day, mate."" Fond memories travelling the Bluebird with his grandma and watching his father join the railways after World War II prompted a young Peter to seek work at the station. Starting as a youth porter in 1973, he worked his way up to freight clerk. It was in 1985, as Kalangadoo station master, that Peter and his beloved station suffered the same fate as many others in Australian railway towns. ""All the country rail networks started to deteriorate. They weren't maintained,"" Peter says. ""[The government] also made it harder for people to use it, jacking up freight rates and cutting out services. ""So out of all the blokes that were here, I was the last of the Mohicans. I was the last to shut the door, turn the lights out and see ya later. ""I never thought I'd leave the railways, but I haven't I suppose, I'm still here."" Fate would bring the station back into Peter's life in the late 1990s, and since then he's tried to keep it in as original a condition as possible — overcoming change of ownership, trespassing kids, and a termite problem. ""I try and do my bit here keeping it nice and tidy … There's not too many of us buggers that are interested in the railways,"" he says. As well as being his personal sanctuary and men's shed, Peter opens the door to any passing visitors who may be interested in his town's past existence. ""With Kalangadoo off the beaten track, nobody much knows that I'm here,"" he says. ""We're the end of the world here."" Peter and his staff were told the station would cease operations in 1985, although the train kept running for a while afterwards. ""I refused to go, so they shut the station, and I was here for nine months after the station got closed down,"" Peter says. ""It was a very funny period. They took all the phones away. ""All the infrastructure got taken out, all the ticket machines."" Peter didn't see much point in transferring to another station that would likely shut, or move to Adelaide as suggested. ""I thought bugger it, I'll just ride the storm,"" he says. When he eventually left in 1986, he took with him all the gear from the station that he could, unwilling to let his town's history slip away. ""I ended up at the mill after that. Walking past the railway station every day to go to the mill,"" he says. The station was vacant until 1999 when the mill Peter worked for, AusPine, took it over as a retail outlet for timber. The mill allowed Peter to turn one of the rooms into a little museum with some of the gear he had salvaged. When the adjoining timber yard closed in 2011, the local council allowed him to take over the whole station. Now retired, Peter can be found at the station most days. ""It's just somewhere to chill out and visit memory lane I suppose,"" he says. Peter has spent two decades buying back memorabilia from the old railways department. When the station closed in the mid-1980s a lot of the material was dispersed and sold in Adelaide. Peter's managed to track down everything from uniforms, staff logbooks and 1800s maps to old phones, tickets and luggage records. The most valuable piece in Peter's collection is the Kalangadoo Station seal — he has one from 1953 and the original from 1887, when trains first passed through the tiny town. An unexpected piece of memorabilia is the artificial leg his father used in the station master's office. ""He actually lost his leg on the main line … poor bugger,"" Peter says. ""He was shunting the train on a wet day, rubber boots ... slipped underneath the wheels. Boom. ""I was here at the time of course as freight clerk … that was a bit of a freak-out."" The memories come quick and fast to Peter. ""You'd meet a few characters on the train, especially the night train … You never knew who you were going to sit next to,"" Peter says. ""It was very popular, the rail at that stage. People weren't in too much of a hurry to go anywhere … Back then time didn't seem to matter. ""People can't be buggered sitting on the train all day to go somewhere [now]. Times have changed."" Peter's collection isn't just proof of the station's history, it's evidence of the town's. ""If you haven't got this material, [Kalangadoo] would just disappear,"" he says. He's sad to see other stations — once bustling hives of activity — now rusting away. He passes them on the little carriage he's put together from old parts. ""I've got all the railway maps and know where things are. I just chill out and go for a drive,"" Peter says. ""[I] park up at the Penola Railway Station, go to the pub and have a couple of beers and then jump on the 'putt putt' and come home."" Peter's got plans for some new interpretive signs around the place and a potential repurposing of the rail. Realising he won't be around forever, he's also got a succession plan in place. ""I've got my young bloke in Melbourne. I've told him he's going to be the owner of a railway station at some point,"" Peter says. A station Peter still isn't prepared to leave. ""I'd like to spend a bit of time fishing but I'm stuck at the bloody railway station waiting for this non-existent train to come through.""

253,analysis: Why Tasmania's 2026 Commonwealth Games bid could work,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The gravel oval of Queenstown and other great Tasmanian venues for the Commonwealth Games Sport — some people think of it as nothing more than the pointless chasing of a ball around a field. Others can see past the shouting, sweating and ridiculous outfits and understand that it is, alongside science and the arts, one of the few chances for human beings to show what they are capable of, to reach beyond their abilities and surpass expectations. Tasmania wants that chance too — and it seems is prepared to pay a stupid amount of money for the opportunity, after announcing it is ""formally requesting"" it be given consideration to play a part as a host for the 2026 Commonwealth Games. Yes, you read that correctly: Tasmania wants to host the Commonwealth Games, four years from now. Some might say that managing to host a three-day cricket match without too much going wrong is hardly enough evidence on which to deduce that Tasmania could competently run an event with upwards of 5,000 athletes and officials over two weeks — not to mention the hundreds of thousands of spectators. Hobart and Launceston could host the 2026 Commonwealth Games under a bold bid to take the athletic showpiece to Tasmania. Some might say Tasmania has none of the sports infrastructure needed for such an event. Some might point out the lack of hospitality staff, rental cars, public transport, airport capacity, suitable arterial roadways or available accommodation. Some, no doubt, will suggest there are better things a government should be spending money on. Some might comment, quite correctly, that 2026 is only four years away and too soon to be able to pull together an event of such an epic scale. These are likely the same people who want NASA to stop exploring space. Tasmanians think big: Perhaps there is no better example than their relentless pursuit of the Guinness World Record for the most water skiers to be towed behind a single boat. They tried, they failed, they came back again, they failed again but they DID NOT GIVE UP and, eventually, triumphed. One of the key players behind the glorious achievement summed it up when he said it was largely because of the desire to do ""stupid stuff"" that it happened at all. What a beautiful metaphor. The list of sports that make up the Commonwealth Games is ever-changing. So, incorporating some new or slightly tweaked events should not be a problem, while making use of the state's existing facilities. Additions to the program could include: Don't forget, when it comes to putting on a show that gets people talking, no-one does it better than Tasmania. Fireworks, synchronised dancing and waving athletes are all very nice but with the eyes of the world on you, it's time to ramp it up — and who better to take it to the next level than the same people who put inverted Christian crosses around the Hobart city centre for art? Picture the world tuning in to the live coverage of the Tasmanian 2026 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony, as choreographed by the team from MONA's Dark Mofo. If Mofo can get thousands of people to watch a man be buried underground for three days in the middle of a Tasmanian winter, imagine what they could do with half a million of taxpayer dollars and unlimited council permits. Brisbane's mascot from 1982 was Matilda the kangaroo. That was all well and good, but predictable and typically so. Tasmania — the home of the first green political party — could honour that tradition by choosing as its Commonwealth Games mascot an endangered species, signalling to the world it cares about precious wildlife and is prepared to stand by its principles. Behold, the Tasmanian Commonwealth Games mascot for 2026: the handfish. Best of all, hosting the Games would be a chance for Tasmania to exact revenge for the slight on the tiny state by mainland Australia 40 years ago which — for some — still burns. At the 1982 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony in Brisbane, an aerial shot shows hundreds of kiddies marching in unison and forming the shape of Australia … with Tasmania nowhere to be seen. And that was not a one-off. Back in 1956, Australia's Olympic athletes paraded proudly on home soil in their terry-towelling tracksuits with Australia embroidered on their chests — again, sans Tasmania. Whoever is brought in to design the official Australian uniforms and the opening ceremony has the perfect chance to right a horrible wrong — and leave mainland Australia completely off. Just have Tasmania. BOOM! The irony is, it'll probably be a bloody mainlander who gets that job.

254,Philippines opens its border to travellers for the first time in nearly two years,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus The Philippines has lifted a nearly two-year ban on foreign travellers in a lifesaving boost for its tourism and related industries as its Omicron-fuelled COVID-19 surge eases. From today, foreign travellers from 157 countries that have visa-free arrangements with the Philippines — who have been fully vaccinated and have tested negative for the virus — will be welcomed back and will no longer be required to quarantine upon arrival. The Philippines government also ended a risk classification system that banned travellers from the worst-hit countries. ""We will begin the next chapter in the road to recovery,"" Tourism Secretary Berna Romulo-Puyat said. She added that the border reopening would restore jobs and generate revenue across tourism-related enterprises and communities. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic The Philippines imposed one of the world's longest lockdowns and strictest, police-enforced quarantine restrictions to quell a pandemic that caused its worst economic recession since the 1940s and pushed unemployment and hunger to record levels. More than a million Filipinos lost their jobs in tourism businesses and destinations in the first year of the pandemic alone, according to government statistics. Tourism destinations, including popular beach and tropical island resorts, resembled ghost towns at the height of pandemic lockdowns, and a volcanic eruption and typhoons exacerbated losses. The reopening had been set for December 1 but was postponed as the highly contagious COVID-19's Omicron variant spread. Less than a thousand new cases were added daily during the Christmas holidays, when large crowds of shoppers trooped back to malls and restaurants, despite constant government warnings. The subsequent surge peaked above 39,000 infections in one day in mid-January, but has since eased. Health officials reported about 3,600 infections on Wednesday, with 69 deaths, and have declared the entire archipelago, except for one southern region, at ""low to moderate risk"". More than 60 million of nearly 110 million Filipinos have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and 8.2 million have received their booster shots in a campaign that has been hampered by vaccine shortages and public hesitancy. President Rodrigo Duterte warned Filipinos in televised remarks on Monday that ""we are not over the hump"" and urged the unvaccinated to get immunised soon. ""If you're unvaccinated and you die, well, I'll tell you, 'Good riddance',"" the tough-talking president said. ""You can walk around and, if you get contaminated, you will be awfully very, very sorry for yourself and your family.""

255,Tasmania to bid for 2026 Commonwealth Games,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tasmania set to bid for 2026 Commonwealth Games Hobart and Launceston could host the 2026 Commonwealth Games under a bold bid to take the athletic showpiece to Tasmania. Commonwealth Games host cities saw an increase in tourism by up to 25 per cent four years after hosting the games, a report found last year The Games don't come cheap, and the cost of staging them would be in the hundreds of millions Tasmania would also need federal money to help construct suitable venues Premier Peter Gutwein has written to the chief executive of Commonwealth Games Australia, Craig Phillips, formally requesting that Tasmania be given consideration as a host for the event. State Sport Minister Jane Howlett said the state was ready to make the most of the opportunity. ""Our government is committed to delivering more elite sporting content for Tasmanians to enjoy — and importantly, provide pathways for local sports men, women and children,"" she said. The 2022 Games will be held later this year in Birmingham in the England midlands after Durban in South Africa was stripped of the hosting rights in 2017 over a lack of progress. Birmingham had been scheduled to host the 2026 event, but was called on to accelerate preparation in order to deliver the games this year, leaving 2026 vacant. Melbourne has reportedly been approached to host in four years' time, but the Victorian government is remaining tight lipped about its plans. Ms Howlett said her government would even consider Tasmania co-hosting the event. ""We are confident that we can work collaboratively with Commonwealth Games Australia on the opportunities Tasmania presents as either a host or co-host."" Last year, a PriceWaterHouseCoopers report determined Commonwealth Games cities saw an increase in tourism by up to 25 per cent four years after hosting the games. However, the cost of staging a games would be in the hundreds of millions. The bid for the 2026 games comes after Hobart successfully hosted the 5th Ashes test, and could be used as leverage by the Tasmanian government to encourage a federal spending spree in Tasmania. Tasmania is pushing hard for entry into the AFL and the A-League, but the lack of suitable stadia, including a fit-for-purpose rectangular stadium, has been a stumbling block to the state's plans. It was also a key factor in Tasmania missing out on women's football World Cup fixtures, with the tournament due to be played in Australia next year. A Commonwealth Games bid would continue the Tasmanian government's push for more elite sport and high-profile events in the state, and further its desire to use new sporting infrastructure to help drive the state's economy out of the pandemic. Last year it took ownership of the Derwent Entertainment Centre and completed a $60 million refurb of the arena, which now houses Tasmania's NBL team, the Jack Jumpers. The Commonwealth Games Federation last year unveiled a new strategic roadmap that provides hosts with more flexibility over the event, in an effort to make hosting more desirable. It may mean hosts can spread athlete villages over multiple sites and have more flexibility in choosing sports that would help make the games a success. Australia last hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2018 on the Gold Coast.

256,People with elderly parents in China say they are 'not treated equally' as Australia's border reopens,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus Melody Meng's parents in China have been vaccinated with two shots of the widely-used Sinopharm vaccine, but they still won't be allowed to enter Australia after border restrictions ease on February 21. Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has recognised Sinopharm as one of the vaccines for foreign travellers, but only if they are under the age of 60. This means Ms Meng's elderly parents are not considered fully vaccinated and cannot enter Australia to visit their grandchildren in Melbourne. ""Every time my daughter [has a] video chat with her grandparents, she says 'I miss you so much, when can you come to Australia?' And my son has not even met his grandparents,"" Ms Meng said. ""In China, the brand of vaccine you can get depends on the region you live in, so [my parents] do not have a choice."" According to the World Health Organization, clinical trials of Sinopharm were not designed to demonstrate efficacy against severe disease in people with comorbidities, or in the over-60s. However, Australia is the only country that considers over-60s vaccinated with Sinopharm to be unvaccinated for the purpose of travel. Like Ms Meng, Jannelle Yang has been separated from her parents for two years. They too are over 60 and have received two Sinopharm shots. ""I used to confidently tell my daughter that as Australia recovers from the pandemic, her grandparents will come back, but I cannot say that anymore,"" she said. ""Australia says it welcomes everyone who is 'fully vaccinated', but my parents are fully vaccinated, just with a vaccine not recognised in Australia, for reasons beyond their control."" Ms Yang said her parents could only receive a booster shot of Sinopharm because it was the vaccine they had already received. ""So it's a dead loop, there is no solution at all for our situation in China or Australia. We feel helpless."" Pre-pandemic, the largest group of overseas visitors to Australia was from China — accounting for more than 15 per cent of arrivals between July 2018 and June 2019. Australia is preparing to welcome fully vaccinated international tourists once more in less than a fortnight, but where are the tourists likely to come from, and how easy will it be for them to return home? Chinese visitors were by far the biggest spenders too. They spent a total of $11.92 billion during that period, compared to $3.99 billion by American visitors and $2.05 billion by Japanese tourists. ""Chinese visitors are big spenders [and] they love Australian products,"" said Chrystal Zhang, a tourism expert at RMIT University. ""They take back a lot of Australian products — the vitamin products, the wine, all the other things."" But strict border closures enforced by both Australia and China in response to COVID changed all that. By November 2021, Singapore, the UK and India were the main source countries for international visitors, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Dr Zhang said that pre-COVID, several Australian airlines and nine Chinese carriers had operated direct flights between Sydney or Melbourne — and not only major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, but also regional hubs like Xi'an and Qingdao. It was ""very exceptional"" to see an airline market between two countries accommodate more than 10 airlines, Dr Zhang said. ""So that, again, is a showcase of the booming of the tourism market between Australia and China, but COVID has posed significant challenges,"" she said. Today, only two of the previous nine Chinese carriers — China Southern and China Eastern — are operating flights to Australia. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic China is the only major nation that has continued to pursue a ""COVID-zero"" approach. Since COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan two years ago, strict lockdowns, travel bans, mass testing and contact tracing have meant the virus has largely remained under control in the world's most populous country. Part of this tough approach includes wide-ranging border controls aimed at restricting who can enter or leave China — measures that have been further strengthened in response to the global spread of the Delta and Omicron variants. For example, the government has built a heavily-fortified fence along the country's borders with Myanmar and Vietnam during the pandemic in an effort to prevent people bringing the virus into China. Its Civil Aviation Administration recently announced that only 408 international passenger flights would be allowed into China per week over the colder months between October 31, 2021 and 26 March, 2022 — a reduction from 644 in the summer. So while Chinese citizens can theoretically leave the country, there are significant practical barriers to doing so. On top of limited flight options, Chinese tourists may also be deterred from overseas holidays by lengthy quarantine periods upon return. After arriving in China, travellers must pay to enter quarantine at a hotel or government facility for 14 days. In some parts of the country this is followed by an additional seven days of self-isolation. Dr Zhang said quarantine would ""definitely be a barrier for the Chinese to think about visiting overseas destinations"". ""But I don't think that would be long-term,"" she added. ""As we see this kind of light at the end of the tunnel of this pandemic, things will improve."" Sydney woman Vivian Wu has been separated from her parents in China throughout the pandemic. She got her hopes up when Australia decided to include foreign-born parents as immediate family members for the purpose of exemptions to border regulations in October 2021. Asia has managed to keep Omicron largely at bay. Once the variant arrives, the region could be uniquely vulnerable. ""It is really good that they [the government] included parents to the 'immediate family' exemption category last year, but in fact they are not treated equally,"" Ms Wu said. Her parents have been immunised against COVID-19 with a full course of Zhifei Longcom — a vaccine not recognised by the TGA. China, Indonesia and Uzbekistan are the only countries to have approved Zhifei Longcom for use. ""I think there should be a differentiation between people who are not vaccinated at all and people who received full courses of a vaccine that's just not recognised in Australia,"" Ms Wu said. Given the federal government considers them unvaccinated, Melody Meng intends to pay for her parents to arrive into Australia and go through hotel quarantine before being vaccinated with Pfizer. While her parents are willing to do expensive hotel quarantine at either end, Ms Meng said hotel quarantine in China would likely deter many other potential visitors. ""China is the single biggest contributor to Australia's tourism industry, and also a big portion of Australia's migrant population ... but the current government policy is making our lives very difficult,"" she said. Even for those who have had recognised vaccines, financial concerns might impact people's ability to travel overseas. The World Bank projects a slowdown of the Chinese economy in 2022, driven by what it calls a ""severe and prolonged downturn"" in the property sector and the broader impacts of COVID-19 on economic activity. This year marks 50 years since Australia established diplomatic ties with China, but the relationship has rapidly deteriorated in recent times. Dr Zhang also said ongoing political tensions between Canberra and Beijing could discourage Chinese tourists. Nevertheless, she said, ""the desire to come back to Australia, according to some of the research, is still very high"". Australia's ""unique culture"" and landscape were drawcards for Chinese tourists, she said, adding that Chinese tourists would return eventually. For Jannelle Yang, however, the ordeal of family separation may prove too much. ""My parents are elderly, and if there is no hope for a solution, we have to consider moving back to China permanently for reunion,"" she said. ""But this is not we want, we've lived in Australia for a long time and our roots are here."" In a statement, the Department of Home Affairs said: ""Individual travel exemptions can be requested by travellers who do not meet the requirements of an 'automatic exemption' cohort or who are unvaccinated."" The Department of Health has also been contacted for comment.

257,Regional Victoria excited about return of international tourists — but no jumping for joy just yet,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus It wasn't long after Sea Lake transformed from a ""normal regional farming town"" to an international tourism destination that its burgeoning economy was struck down by the COVID pandemic. With international travellers set to return to Australia from February 21, the door has reopened for the Mallee town in Victoria's north-west to capitalise on its unique market. However, Sea Lake locals aren't celebrating yet. Rohan Mott opened Skymirror Gallery Cafe & Accommodation just two months before international borders first slammed shut in 2020. Mr Mott said before the pandemic, international tourists who flocked to the region to see the nearby Lake Tyrrell were a significant portion of his clientele. However, Mr Mott said although the border is reopening, many of those tourists will still be unable to visit. ""Our biggest market was China — I don't expect to see a lot of Chinese travellers return anytime soon,"" he said. ""There's strict quarantine restrictions for them when they return home from Australia, and different countries have different requirements ... I don't expect to see a flood of people, that's for sure."" Victoria Tourism Industry Council chief executive Felicia Mariani said travel restrictions in other countries — including China and New Zealand, the state's two biggest markets prior to the pandemic — would have a severe impact. ""China is going to have some complications in its re-engagement with Australia ... and with New Zealand, hopefully they will be easing their restrictions soon, but at the moment they are simply not allowed to travel to Australia,"" she said. ""So, after two years of not having any international visitors, the dynamics are going to be really different."" The chair of Advanced Sea Lake, Alex Newell, said while tourism might not bounce back immediately, having a concrete opening date for international travel was ""a good start"". ""You've got to start somewhere, and the gates have to open one day, so the sooner the better,"" he said. Operators in other international tourism destinations such as the Grampians and the Great Ocean Road were also optimistic about the return. South-east of Melbourne, Destination Phillip Island general manager Kim Storey said she was glad to have a firm return date, with international tourism vital to the island's economy. ""It accounts for half a million visitors to the Penguin Parade and other various attractions,"" she said. ""The important thing with international visitation is that it's a year-round visitation — often happening during the week, so it's a real support to our businesses in general."" Ms Mariani said while tourism operators could expect travellers from neighbouring countries in the Asia-Pacific relatively soon, it could be some time before ""long-haul"" tourists from the northern hemisphere begin returning to Australia. ""It will take longer just because it takes time to organise long-haul travel,"" she said. ""People are going to want to understand the nuances — it's great that they don't have to quarantine upon arrival here, but what about when they go back home?"" Ms Mariani said tourists who travelled from further away often provided the most benefit for regional Victoria. ""They have a great propensity to stay longer, travel further, and disperse more widely across the state to visit regional destinations,"" she said. While it may be a gradual return in Sea Lake, Mr Newell said the borders reopening signalled an exciting future. ""Domestic tourism has really kicked off with COVID, and that has sort of generated a whole new stream of tourism which has been really, really positive for our town,"" he said. ""What I'm excited about now is we've never actually experienced what the current domestic tourism level looks like in addition to our historical international tourism stream. ""It will take time, but it's a really good thing. ""So I'm excited for not just a return to normal, but for where it's going to go in the future.""

258,analysis: The impact of Australia's closed borders: These four graphs tell the story,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Australia will have new rules for its international border in coming weeks. From February 21, our border will reopen to travellers who have been fully vaccinated. It will be a major step towards returning to more traditional travel patterns. It comes after travel restrictions were eased for fully-vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents in November, which saw overseas arrivals and departures pick up noticeably. However, there's a long way to go before Australia's travel and airline industries return to ""normal"", given the damage they have suffered. The graphs below tell some of the story. When our international borders closed in 2020, the number of travellers passing through our major airports dried up quickly. Government data show what happened to international arrivals and departures in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports. See the graph below. You can also see what happened to domestic travel. After international borders closed and strict lockdown rules were enforced, domestic flights also fell dramatically. However, they picked up in late 2020 as we emerged from the original lockdowns, and that momentum continued into 2021. The mood in Australia was relatively buoyant then. We did not have a large-scale vaccine program at that stage, but we had largely kept COVID-19 out of the country and many people felt relaxed about travelling domestically. However, when the New South Wales government lost control of the Delta variant in June last year it sent half of the country's population back into lockdown, and domestic air travel was hit hard again. See the graph below. Altogether, when you look at the total decline in airline passenger movements over the last two years, it is striking. According to government data, the combined number of international, domestic and regional airline passengers in the 2020-21 financial year hit levels last seen in 1991. See the graph below. So what has been happening recently? According to provisional data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), in December we had the highest volume of overseas arrivals and departures since international travel restrictions were introduced in March 2020. With Australia's international border closed for almost two years, there's one question on the lips of tourism operators, accommodation providers and hospitality venues: When will international visitors come back? There were 197,000 overseas arrivals to Australia, and 229,000 overseas departures from Australia in December. Jenny Dobak — ABS director of migration statistics — said the increase could be attributed to government decisions to ease international travel restrictions late last year. That occurred on November 1, 2021, when fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents were allowed to travel to and from Australia without an exemption. However, there's long way to go before we see pre-COVID travel patterns. “While the number of border crossings have increased since travel restrictions were eased in November, there are still far fewer crossings than before the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Ms Dobak said recently. ""For example, in December 2019, there were 1.9 million overseas arrivals and 2.2 million overseas departures, 10 times larger than December 2021 volumes.” See our full coverage of coronavirus We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

259,Dine on the vine: Why people are picking grapes for free ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Vineyard workers wined and dined in exchange for labour amid worker shortage Swapping a few hours of voluntary work picking grapes in exchange for lunch has become a successful labour solution for a West Australian vigneron. Faced with a shortage of backpackers to pick his grapes when Australia's borders closed, Duncan Harris realised he needed to think of a new way to find staff. Last year, Mr Harris began offering locals the experience of spending several hours picking and then crushing grapes at his vineyard on the outskirts of Perth in the Swan Valley. The work was paid for by a long lunch in the vineyard. ""There are a lot of people who would love to go and pick grapes, it's part of their bucket lists, normally they want to do it in France, but here they can do it at home,"" Mr Harris said. Over several weekends and public holidays, groups of six to eight people, usually from nearby suburbs, harvested all 30 rows of his vines at Harris Organic Wines and Spirits. ""We were oversubscribed, we've now got repeat pickers from last year, and we've got people who have come back already this year,"" Mr Harris said. ""Grape picking can be hard work but there are lots of tricks that you can learn along the way to make it so much easier."" Mr Harris charges pickers a $10 booking fee and, in turn, gives a $10 credit on wine sales. Winemakers in the Swan Valley are about one-third of the way through vintage, with picking slowed this year due to a shortage of workers. Swan Valley Winemakers Association president Lauren Pileggi said larger vineyards had planned to bring workers across from the eastern states on February 5, when WA's borders were scheduled to open. ""It means the employment pool that we have been able to select staff from has been smaller,"" she said. ""It has thrown quite a few people's plans up in the air. I know quite a few wineries have said [labour] has become an issue this year."" Ms Pileggi said the heat experienced in Perth over the past couple of months had ripened fruit quickly, however quality was unaffected. ""The overall outlook for the 2022 vintage is that it's going to be another quality vintage and we're all excited about it,"" she said.

260,Man falls three storeys from balcony on Gold Coast and survives,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Man falls three storeys from balcony on Gold Coast and survives A man in his 20s is lucky to be alive, after falling about 10 metres from a Gold Coast hotel balcony overnight. Paramedics were called to the Surfers Paradise backpackers' hotel just after 9pm after reports the man had fallen from a fifth-storey balcony onto a second-storey roof. The man suffered head injuries and a fractured leg, but was transported to the Gold Coast University Hospital in a stable condition. The Queensland Ambulance Service's Paul Young said the 28-year-old was lucky to have landed on a ""metal overhang roof, which cushioned his fall"" from direct concrete. ""Otherwise it could have been a different story,"" he said. Mr Young said it remained unclear exactly how or why the man fell. He said rescuers had to get over a three-metre wall to get the man out because of the nature of the apartment complex. ""We were led to believe he had alcohol on board and he was near a balcony,"" he said. ""There were a lot of bystanders there. I believe it's a backpackers' hotel . QAS received a lot fo triple 0 calls."" The man is recovering in hospital. A 16-year-old fell nine metres from the St Tropez Apartments last September and was taken to hospital in a critical condition, having spent the night at the apartment with friends.

261,Qantas boss doubles down on comments likening Western Australia to North Korea,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus Qantas boss Alan Joyce has doubled down on comments he made last week comparing Western Australia to North Korea, saying the state's hard border had divided the country ""a bit like Korea is divided"". Mr Joyce told the ABC he was not describing the West Australian government as a dictatorship, but he stood by the comment. ""I said, 'Unfortunately our country is divided, a bit like Korea is divided,'"" he said. ""And it feels like we have a part that is like North Korea, that is very restricted in parts of what the people can do in terms of travel. ""And I think that is the way people feel."" Mr Joyce made the initial comment while talking about WA's hard border on a Melbourne-based Nine Radio talkback show. ""In Western Australia, there isn't a plan for when that is going to open up. It's starting to look like North Korea,"" he said at the time. The airline chief executive has not shied away from criticising the state's closed border since a planned reopening of WA on February 5 was cancelled indefinitely, with little more than two weeks' notice. Qantas had about 20,000 people booked on flights into Perth in the first week alone, aircraft had been prepared, staff paid and flights scheduled. ""And then it all got thrown up in the air,"" Mr Joyce said. He said it had been a huge blow, financially, and to Australians generally, and trust had been damaged. He said businesses did not like uncertainty. ""And costing us, essentially, tens of millions of dollars by not opening up the borders means we are going to be more conservative on whatever other date is proposed out there,"" he said. Asked about the ""North Korea"" comparison last week, a spokeswoman for the Premier said the government was focused on protecting the health of West Australians and keeping businesses operating safely. ""These type of trivial comments from some in the east are hardly new,"" she said. ""Omicron has changed everything, and the McGowan government is putting the health of Western Australians first to try to minimise the disruption and impact it can cause, which has devastated industry, cost lives and jobs, in other jurisdictions."" The spokeswoman said efforts by the government had supported businesses, including Qantas. ""Throughout the pandemic, Qantas has benefited from our decisions that have kept our FIFO-based resources sector operating, which meant FIFO flights continued during COVID. ""Qantas has also benefited from our record intrastate travel boom, which has been driven by the West Australian government's significant investment in making flights more affordable."" Mr Joyce warned there would be ""unintended consequences"" for Wa if the hard border remained closed and, he said, profitable businesses and talented people would leave the state. The Premier's plan to reopen the state on February 5 lies in ruins, and there's a risk the backflip could weaken public goodwill — the key to WA's COVID-19 strategy, writes Jacob Kagi. ""You've had a lot of businesses already saying they are basing people outside of Western Australia,"" he said. ""To run a national business, Wesfarmers — and even my chairman, Richard Goyder, who is chair of Qantas, the AFL and Woodside — has actually said he needs to move to the eastern states for a period of time. ""It's in Western Australia's interest to open up, to get those businesses to be able to operate nationally, otherwise they are going to lose talent, they are going to lose people, they are going to lose that investment locally."" Mr Joyce said the damage could be long term if the business sector was not given some sort of plan soon. Wesfarmers' managing director, Rob Scott, did not address whether he would be leaving WA, but in a statement said he welcomed the shortened quarantine periods for travellers that were introduced yesterday. New rules for close contacts and isolation in WA are in place, as the state tries to limit the spread of Omicron while keeping the economy going. Here's what's changing. ""This will make it easier for families and businesses to undertake critical interstate travel, and will also reduce the impact of COVID-related absenteeism,"" he said. ""It will also reduce the length of time people will need to stay out of the state, when travelling for business. ""This is a step in the right direction as Western Australia adjusts, in a pragmatic and safe way, to life with COVID."" From today, the quarantine period for approved arrivals into WA has been halved to seven days of self-isolation.

263,Meet the blue-and-red nomad road tripping across the outback,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Two-minute-noodle-loving parrot road tripping across Australian outback Darryl Warren is on the trip of a lifetime across outback Australia and his choice of travelling companion is more accustomed to travelling by air than on four wheels. But his pet parrot, Ruby, never complains. She's loving life on the road. The colourful pair, from Rosedale in Victoria, is on a spur-of-the-moment road trip after visiting Darryl's family in Brisbane. ""I just thought, 'Let's keep driving',"" Darryl said. ""We're in Longreach now. Then we're going to head to Mount Isa, go across the Stuart Highway and then down to [Uluru]."" So far, they've racked up 3,600 kilometres on their 10,000-kilometre adventure. The days can be long in the car, but Darryl says Ruby loves nothing more than hitting the highway. ""She's my companion. She's pretty much been on my shoulder since she was six weeks old,"" he said. ""She's never been in a cage; she loves to travel. She's just glad to be in the car."" Darryl said his feathered friend had a playlist of songs she liked to listen to on the long drives. ""She likes John Williamson and Paul Kelly. Maybe it's the tone of the guitar … but she'll sing along or whistle and talk and carry on,"" Darryl said. ""As soon as she sees cars coming towards us, she'll yell out 'How ya going mate?' ""She can be quite a character."" Unlike other Eclectus parrots, Ruby has a surprisingly diverse palette. ""She eats dry two-minute noodles, passionfruit, chillies … and one of her favourite foods is steamed chicken,"" Darryl said. ""It was a bit horrifying at first, but now if she sees a bit of chicken or the steamer on, she's onto it."" Darryl has rigged up his eccentric car so that it's fit for a queen with a beak, complete with a bird swing and food bowls. And everywhere this duo goes, attention follows. ""She gets her photo taken at least three or four times a day … she's quite the social butterfly,"" Darryl said. ""She's very female-friendly … when I'm shopping, I've got to remember that she's there because if a lady comes up close, she'll jump shoulders. ""She's so brightly coloured, she sticks out.

264,Board game Monopoly is famous for its London landmarks. Now it's Bendigo's turn,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Bendigo landmarks to feature in global boardgame Monopoly Bendigo's historic and modern sites, like Pall Mall, Rosalind Park or the Great Stupa could soon feature on a new customised Monopoly, as the global family-friendly board game gets a Central Victoria makeover. Bendigo tourism operators and advocates hope fun, promotional tools like the local Monopoly board game will help bring visitors back to the regional city. Monopoly was created in 1935 and its creator Winning Moves, under license from Hasbro, is now making a Bendigo version where people can buy, and sell, Bendigo's attractions on the way to being a real estate mogul. Local attractions will replace Mayfair and Park Lane from the original London Monopoly board, and will accompany a customised ""Community Chest"" and ""Chance"" playing cards that will reflect the city of Bendigo. It has excited the region's tourism advocates and Bendigonians can vote for which locations and landmarks they would like to be featured on the edition of the famous board game when it was released by October. James Reade is the CEO of Bendigo Heritage attractions and said he would be voting for the Joss House Temple and Bendigo Tramways to be immortalised in a Monopoly board. ""The Joss House is over 150 years old this year and it really tells the story of how Bendigo has formed and the diversity in Bendigo at the time,"" Mr Reade said. ""The tramways have been running since continuously 1903. That's after the running of the first tram in 1890. So, lots of history. ""And as a kid, you're bouncing around the Monopoly board; it will be a good learning opportunity to promote and share the stories of Bendigo's history and culture as well."" Michael Counsell from Winning Moves said it was looking for places that had culture, history, and location to adapt into the board game. ""We customise the whole board. What will go onto the edition will be decided by the people,"" Mr Counsell said. Mr Counsell said the hardest part of his job was whittling down the positions to 22 locations on the board. ""We do break the board down into a few different walks of life whether that's family days out, sports, culture, hospitality, so there are certain sectors that we do want to represent,"" he said. The news coincided with the federal government's announcement that Australia's borders would reopen to double vaccinated tourists by February 21. The Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions said total tourism expenditure in Victoria was $12.8 billion in the year ending June 2021, a 50 per cent drop from 2020. The Tourism Industry Council says Victoria lost $20 billions over the last two years of the pandemic. The council's chief executive Felicia Mariani said reopening the borders to international travellers would not provide immediate relief for tourism operators, but it was a step in the right direction. ""When you go overseas it takes time to plan a trip, that's why having a date is so important,"" Mr Mariani said. ""Operators can prepare, and people overseas can have the confidence to plan a trip."" Bendigo locals can vote for which locations and landmarks they would like to be featured on the edition of the famous board game via the official Bendigo Monopoly Facebook page or through emailing info@winningmoves.com.au.

265,"War of words erupts between Rex, Qantas over Broken Hill route ",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Rex, Qantas come to verbal blows over Broken Hill route The deputy chairman of Rex Airlines has hit back at Qantas after the national carrier announced it was starting flights into Broken Hill. The last time Regional Express was challenged by another commercial carrier in far western New South Wales, Greece was hosting the Olympics. Rex's John Sharp said the move was clearly retaliation for its recent expansion into metropolitan routes. ""Qantas obviously isn't happy with Rex going into the domestic airline business, flying in competition with them in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Adelaide,"" he said. ""They don't like that and they've made lots of complaints to various people about our behaviour in moving into that market. ""So in retaliation they've been moving into our regional market, our traditional market."" It follows a blow QantasLink CEO John Gissing landed yesterday when he suggested Rex were all talk. ""We hear a lot about that airline,"" he said. ""Some people in aviation call them the cockatoo airline, lots of squawking. But sometimes you can't work out what they're actually on about."" Mr Gissing welcomed the battle of bookings and said his company was not worried. ""This is good, this is competition. Competition is great for regional Australia, competition is what our customers want to see,"" he said. Pre-COVID there were 28,000 passengers a year flying between Sydney and Broken Hill, but currently it is sitting around 8,000-9,000. Rex's John Sharp said if Qantas was planning on putting on 10,000 seats with a smaller market, how long would they last? ""They're swamping the market,"" Mr Sharp said. ""The question is whether they'll hang and keep offering the service. ""Or whether, after a short period of time after they've satisfied themselves that they've given Rex a good punch in the nose, they'll walk away from it."" Broken Hill's only travel agent, who will be organising flights for both Rex and QantasLink, said the planned routes were still in their infancy. Cheryl Cuy believes it will be up to customers to do the talking, with the longevity of both airlines remaining in the city reliant on the numbers of passengers. ""I would hope that more tourists would use it. It will probably take them a while to build up, but after that we'll see how it goes,"" she said. As it stands, Qantas has no additional plans to expand operations to routes from Broken Hill to either Melbourne or Adelaide.

268,Karijini Experience cancelled over COVID-19 risks to traditional owners,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus The Pilbara Tourism Association says a decision to cancel the popular Karijini Experience in WA's Pilbara region is understandable but hopes people will still explore the stunning area. Last week, Banjima Native Title Aboriginal Corporation (BNTAC) announced the festival, which was planned to run from April 13 to 17, would be cancelled due to the ongoing uncertainty and potential risks the virus could pose for Indigenous people. The event, which has been running since 2013, is held on the Banjima people's traditional lands and showcases culture, food, music and art in the picturesque Karijini National Park. Ashburton shire president Kerry White said the cultural event was a major drawcard for the region, with more than 1,500 people in attendance last year. According to data from the Nintirri Centre, the event's previous organiser, last year's Karijini Experience saw $939,000 injected into the local economy. Ms White said the shire was disappointed over the cancellation but understood the community's safety was a priority. The Karijini Experience was also cancelled in 2020 due to the pandemic. Pilbara Tourism Association (PTA) president Barry Harrison said a lack of staffing in the region was an issue that would make the large festival hard to run. ""I believe the parks people have got some issues with staff numbers, and probably for the event to go ahead was always going to be difficult,"" he said. ""[The cancellation] is disappointing but understandable."" BNTAC chair Slim Parker said he understood and shared the disappointment of those who were looking forward to attending the popular event. ""The beauty and magic of our homeland — yurlu — is always there with or without the showcase and spectacle,"" he said. ""We hope everyone remains safe and well and look forward to more certainty in future celebrations of Banjima culture with you all."" Ms White said she hoped people who had planned to attend the Karijini Experience and booked accommodation would still visit the region. ""We have seen an increase in tourism in the Shire of Ashburton and wider Pilbara region since the outbreak of COVID, and we anticipate that these numbers will continue to rise as more people discover the beauty and history of the region,"" she said. Over the weekend, WA Health named the Auski Roadhouse, located 82 kilometres from Karijini National Park, as a COVID-19 exposure site. A positive case was at the roadhouse on Great Northern Highway between 3pm and 4:15pm on January 28. Anyone who visited the roadhouse during this time is being urged to monitor for symptoms and to get tested and isolate if any develop. In the past two weeks, five COVID cases have been recorded at BHP's Yandi iron ore mine, located almost 180 km north-west of Newman. Mr Harrison said he expected there would be more cancellations when case numbers rise in WA. ""It's in the back of everyone's mind. We've been so lucky, everything in Western Australia has been relatively untouched,"" he said. ""Moving forward, there are going to be cancellations, but, hopefully, with our vaccination rates getting up there, people over east still want to come and travel.""

269,"COVID-19 curbs come into force in Indonesia, foreigners can only enter through select airports",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Indonesia will tighten social restrictions in Jakarta and Bali, as well as in two other cities on Java island, in a bid to contain a spike in coronavirus infections. The Transport Ministry said under tightened curbs, overseas tourists can only arrive through Jakarta and Bali airports, as well as via Batam and Tanjung Pinang in the Riau Islands near Singapore. Australians are one step closer to booking their next Bali holiday. But there are a few COVID-19 conditions to meet, including a mandatory five-day stay at a luxury resort. The South-East Asian country has seen a jump in cases driven by the Omicron variant, with more than 36,000 infections reported on Sunday and the bed occupancy rate at hospitals in the capital reaching 63 per cent, up from 45 per cent in January. Senior cabinet minister Luhut Pandjaitan, who oversees the pandemic response in Java and Bali, announced tightened social restrictions in greater Jakarta, Bali, as well as in the city of Bandung in West Java and Yogyakarta in Central Java. Under the new regulations, supermarkets, malls and restaurants will operate at 60 per cent capacity, while capacity at houses of worship will be reduced to 50 per cent, he told a streamed news conference. Three provinces, including Jakarta, Banten and Bali, had already exceeded infection rates seen during the wave driven by the Delta variant last July, but hospitalisations had remained relatively low, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said. ""Don't panic when you see an increase in cases,"" Mr Budi said. Indonesian officials have warned the surge in cases may not peak until late February. The country became the global epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-2021, with a massive wave of cases driven by the Delta variant seeing its hospitals overwhelmed. It has officially recorded more than 4.5 million cases and 145,000 COVID-related deaths, however experts warn the true numbers could be much higher given inadequate testing for the virus. Reuters/ABC Editor's note 08/02/22: This story originally reported that Indonesian authorities had banned foreign tourists from entering Jakarta airport. However, the Indonesian Transport Ministry later corrected this in a subsequent statement. Overseas tourists are still able to enter the country through Jakarta.

271,Sunshine at last for tourism industry with international border set to reopen,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus Tourism operators and industry representatives across Queensland have welcomed the decision to reopen Australia's international border in a fortnight, but some caution remains. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Australia would open its border to all international visitors on February 21, as long as they are double vaccinated. Currently only Australian citizens, permanent residents, their family members and some vaccinated visa holders can travel to Australia. Visitors from New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Japan have been exempt from the restrictions for several months. Nikki Giumelli, who runs a jetboat business in Cairns, said having a definitive reopening date for international tourists was a huge relief for the struggling Far North Queensland tourism industry. ""Historically it's been so important for our destination and moving forward,"" she said. ""I think it's what's going to really trigger some excitement in the industry to give us the confidence to start marketing, to start scaling our businesses back up again."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Tourism Tropical North Queensland (TTNQ), the region's peak tourism body, estimated the loss of overseas visitors had cost the far north economy about $3 million a day. TTNQ chief executive Mark Olsen said it had been frustrating watching other countries capitalise while Australia's international borders remained shut. ""Ninety-five per cent of the outbound travel from Japan was going to Hawaii,"" he said. ""We would've loved the opportunity to be in the market earlier but we had to keep our community safe so we're excited to get back out there. ""It has been a really long wait."" But, Mr Olsen warned the recovery from the COVID-19 downturn would not be immediate and that it would take time for business to return to pre-pandemic levels. ""It doesn't just happen naturally,"" he said. ""Once the borders are open, we need to get the flights back, we need to get the relationships back with our international partners — so there's a lot that needs to be done."" From February 21, Australia will open its international border to all arrivals but there are still some restrictions in place. Those comments were echoed by Tourism Whitsundays chief executive Rick Hamilton, who said he did not expect a ""huge influx"" of international arrivals on February 21, and predicted there would be a period of transition. ""I think we'll see over time, and hopefully for the peak season in June, all the leisure international [travellers] coming back into Queensland,"" he said. ""But there is just a bit of caution in regards to that. ""The borders are coming down, but there are obviously still some restrictions in certain countries about people going back [home]. ""For example, New Zealand … Kiwis can come here, but to go back to New Zealand there is 12 days of quarantine."" But, Mr Hamilton said he hoped this announcement would give businesses who had struggled through the pandemic hope for the future. ""It's such terrific news after two years of some tough times for the industry,"" he said. Whitsunday charter boat operator Tony Brown, who also heads up the local industry group for operators, said about 98 per cent of charter boat customers were international visitors. He said some operators hadn't run boats in two years. ""The impacts have been massive,"" he said. ""When compared to the Global Financial Crisis, I think we lost around 15 per cent. We're about 85 per cent down over the last two years."" Mr Brown said the industry needed to work out how it would attract international customers again, as travel agents who used to book the services prior to the pandemic were no longer working. ""The whole infrastructure, the way agents sold us right around the country, they've disappeared,"" he said. ""That side's been completely broken. We're all starting from scratch. ""But people are raring to go … across the world everyone wants to travel. This is a fantastic outcome."" Further south on the Gold Coast, Acting Mayor Donna Gates said the announcement was historic. ""It's great news … I view it as the city's own Valentine's Day albeit a week late,'' she said. ""Just having the date will send a wave of confidence across the international travel and student market. ""We are ready to welcome back our much-loved international students as well as the broader international travel market."" She said the council supported the requirement for International travellers to be double vaccinated. ""This regulation sends a strong message to anyone yet to get vaccinated,"" she said. ""If you truly want your freedom back, get vaccinated for yourself, your family and your passport.'' — additional reporting by Tara Cassidy See our full coverage of coronavirus We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

272,Vaccinated tourists welcomed back as international border to reopen in two weeks,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Almost two years after the government closed Australia to the world, the international border is set to reopen to those who are fully vaccinated. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said after new medical advice, the new border rules would come into place on February 21. ""The condition is you must be double vaccinated to come to Australia,"" he said. ""That's the rule. Everyone is expected to abide by it."" The news will be welcomed by tourism bodies, which have been crying out for movement on the border closure that has hampered some businesses. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said unvaccinated travellers would still need to apply for a travel exemption to come to Australia and have to undergo hotel quarantine if they were granted permission to enter the country. Mr Morrison said the government's definition was that people need to have a full course of a vaccine, which in most cases is two doses but for some international vaccines is only one, to be considered vaccinated. For example, the Johnson and Johnson vaccine — which is approved for use in Australia — involves only one dose. The expert panel on vaccines, ATAGI, has flagged though that it is considering whether to still use the term ""fully vaccinated"" or instead move to ""up to date with vaccinations"" like is used with childhood vaccines. If the definition is changed, it could mean that booster shots are included when considering if someone is ""up to date"" or not. Mr Morrison made it clear, with a reference to the recent Novak Djokovic saga, that even if people had the correct visa to enter Australia, if they were not fully vaccinated — or had an exemption — they would not be allowed to enter. ""I think events earlier in the year should have sent a very clear message to everyone around the world that (that) is the requirement to enter into Australia,"" he said. With Australia's international border closed for almost two years, there's one question on the lips of tourism operators, accommodation providers and hospitality venues: When will international visitors come back? Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the announcement meant Australia was ""finally back open for business"". ""This is fantastic news for our people and our customers,"" he said. ""There are a lot tourism operators in city centres and the regions that have been doing it really tough over the past couple of years and this will see more tourists come to their town, spend money and get local economies going again. ""We will be looking at our schedules to see if we can restart flights from more international destinations sooner or add capacity to those routes we are already flying. We have the flexibility to ramp up flights in response to demand."" There are around 660,000 people working in the tourism industry in Australia. The government shut the international border to everyone except Australian citizens and residents in March 2020 amid what was then the emerging coronavirus pandemic. It was an unprecedented step up from the travel bans that had been in place for anyone from China, Iran, Italy and South Korea in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. The government has slowly begun to reopen to certain countries and people, first with the New Zealand travel bubble and most recently allowing tourists from Japan and South Korea, along with some visa holders, back into Australia.

273,Qantas challenging Rex in Broken Hill after 18-year run for regional carrier,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Qantas challenging Rex in Broken Hill after 18-year run for regional airline Regional Express Airlines' 18-year monopoly on flights to and from Broken Hill is over, with QantasLink emerging as competition for the carrier. According to the Qantas website, the second airline will be flying in and out of the Silver City starting in early April. Rex has been the only carrier operating in the region since 2004, with Horizon the last competitor. From April 8, the airline will operate two weekly return flights between Sydney and Broken Hill with its 50-seat Q300 aircraft. According to QantasLink CEO John Gissing the new plans will not only benefit locals but bring tourists to far western New South Wales. ""Broken Hill is a unique Australian town, and as the national carrier we are thrilled to be adding it to our route map today,"" he said. ""The new route will make it easier for travellers to experience Broken Hill's rich history, growing cultural scene, and spectacular natural surrounds."" Broken Hill Mayor Tom Kennedy said it was an important step for the future of the city on a number of fronts. ""Air travel is of vital importance to our community for tourism, health, and education, and I'd like to thank Qantas for providing locals with more options and more flexibility by offering their services out of Broken Hill,"" he said. It follows Rex's continued expansion over the last year into traditional metropolitan routes like Sydney to Melbourne. In November last year, budget international carrier Bonza signalled its intention to operate out of Broken Hill. However, without further upgrades to the city's airport the company's fleet of Boeing 737-8s would be unable to land. The ABC has reached out to Rex for comment.

""For a lot of our businesses on the Gold Coast, this was a make-or-break summer for them,"" she said. ""We've had two long years of living and operating within this pandemic and the difficulties of doing that. ""I think we were all banking on a $280-million summer."" But it was a slow start, with many businesses facing staffing issues as COVID-19 spread through the city.

Michael Stephens, manager of The Breakers in Surfers Paradise, said it had been the ""best Christmas in years"".

Ms O'Callaghan said after years of hardship and the erosion of confidence among businesses and travellers alike she was taking the positives where she could. One silver lining, she said, was the pent-up desire to travel to the Gold Coast.

It has been almost two years since the nation's international border was closed and the tourism sector has been hit hard by both the drop in revenue from overseas visitors and domestic border closures. Federal Government's national security committee will meet on Monday to discuss the issue and the latest information from health experts. ""That is a priority for us,"" Ms Andrews told Insiders. ""We don't have all of the information that we need to be able to take the decision to open, but we are very close."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic The government has already received preliminary advice that some international arrival restrictions are no longer necessary, given high vaccination rates across the country. Government sources say Omicron case numbers are beginning to decline in almost all jurisdictions, apart from Western Australia, although the number of deaths remains high. There are calls for the country to fully reopen to tourists and to allow all visa holders to enter and leave the country without the need for exemptions. Ms Andrews said international tourists who do not meet the COVID-19 safety precautions could be deported, drawing comparisons to tennis star Novak Djokovic's case. ""To be able to enter Australia, if you are a non-Australian, you need to have a valid visa and you need to demonstrate that you are fully vaccinated or that you have medical evidence to say that you cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons,"" Ms Andrews said.

276,Lovingly restored 1900s tram back in action after almost 30 years of effort,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Restored Geelong No. 2 tram to take first passengers in nearly 70 years A tram from the 1900s, lovingly restored after spending its twilight years as a feeding trough, will bring to life a slice of Victorian history when it returns to the tracks. Canberra-based enthusiast Warrington Cameron worked for decades to restore the Geelong ""number two"" (No. 2) tram to its former glory after rescuing it from a farmer's garden in 1991. In its heyday from 1912 to 1956, the tram travelled more than 1.7 million kilometres and helped countless passengers arrive at their destinations. The No. 2 was put out of use when trams were disconnected in Geelong in the 1950s. Almost 70 years later, the tram will launch at the Ballarat Tramway Museum on Sunday. It will glide around the city's Lake Wendouree, giving travel enthusiasts the opportunity to experience what life was like in Australia during the early 20th century. It took Mr Cameron 28 years to buff, shine, and varnish the tram, with the help of a team of specialists including brass and steel casters, mechanical engineers, sign writers, and spray painters. Parts were shipped in from China, the United States and Belgium so the tram would be fully operational. Mr Cameron donated the No. 2 to the Ballarat Tramway Museum, where it will operate only on special occasions to ensure the piece of history does not wear down. The museum's Neville Britton was the project manager behind getting the tram up to scratch. ""Ballarat really has been gifted the tram, as you see it today,"" Mr Britton said. ""We are most grateful for the generosity of the restorer in providing it to the Ballarat Tramway Museum,"" Mr Britton said. ""There were seven trams that were built to commence the Geelong operations in 1912, and this is one of those seven … and it's the only one that remains."" Mr Britton said he was glad to finally be able to launch the tram after receiving it last year, with COVID causing disruptions. ""It's so great to be able to operate these heritage vehicles,"" Mr Britton added. ""We can actually operate this tram; it's been restored to operable condition, rather than just being a static display … we can let people experience was travel was like 100 years ago."" John Whiting, on the museum's board of directors, said delays due to COVID-19 had kept the museum's doors closed on and off. Operators hope to fully reopen to the public in October, after renovations and display changes, but Mr Whiting said they hadn't been complacent during the closures. ""Like everyone, we've been in swings and roundabouts with opening and closing depending on what the COVID restrictions are,"" Mr Whiting said. ""It will be open in a smaller capacity for the launch of the Geelong No. 2, but then it will close again,"" he said. ""The rest of the tramway museum will be scaled back a little bit because we've also got the relay of the mainline track in Wendouree Parade – which is a big project that is coming up in April and May.

277,Turning to tourists to protect a pocket of pristine wilderness,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Turning to tourists to protect the pristine bush of East Gippsland It is a remote haven, sometimes misty and mysterious, and other times offering a cool and welcoming refuge from the heat. You have to wonder why it is seldom visited, even by the locals. The forests of East Gippsland, Victoria are home to all sorts of treasures, not least giant old growth trees measuring tens of metres around the base. It is this sort of vegetation that a small group of locals are now fighting to protect. The bush in this part of the world usually hits the headlines due to anti-logging protests. But the Emerald Link project, championed by the Goongerah Environment Centre and the Wilderness Society, aims to protect the untouched forests through tourism. It would see natural wonders like a giant manna gum in a proposed logging coupe opened to tourists, allowing people to see the natural beauty for themselves. One part of the project has already gained support. In a 2018 election commitment, the Victorian government committed $1.5 million to plan a 120-kilometre hiking trail linking Mount Ellery with the coast at Bemm River. A government spokesperson said market research for the Sea to Summit hike was completed last year and would be released ""soon"". This information is expected to flow into a ""feasibility process"" over the coming six months. Isaac Carné appreciates the area's isolation and natural beauty. He is the Emerald Link's communications advocate, but has travelled a long way to be in that position. Mr Carné grew up in Spain and came to Australia nearly 10 years ago. ""I grew up going into the mountains with my dad, and living in nature was something that I had never done,"" he said. He now lives in Goongerah, a town of ""50 people max"" and surrounded by bush. ""I think the best way to describe what it is like living here is to tell people that the closest shops are 70 kilometres away through a really long winding route,"" Mr Carné said. ""So that makes you think very carefully when you go to town — what do you need to spend for the next two weeks … without having to go to the shops. ""I think that makes you more resilient."" Mr Carné said living in Goongerah has brought him a sense of comfort and belonging. ""Travelling around Australia in a campervan before living here showed me the incredible places that this country has,"" he said. ""The wildlife, the different scenery, and the different ecosystems that you can witness — I knew from that trip that I wanted to live amongst nature, and Goongerah is amongst the forest."" Mr Carné said the Emerald Link project was a feasible response to the decline of the logging industry. ""[It's about] looking at a future of possibilities rather than a future of problems,"" he said. ""Let's come up with a proposal that still utilises the natural assets we have, but in a way that's really inclusive and in a way that we can maintain them for future generations.""

279,Fancy a trip to Bali? It'll now include a mandatory five-day stay in a luxury quarantine resort,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus Five days in a luxury resort in Nusa Dua, Sanur, Jimbaran or Ubud shut away from the outside world might sound like the ultimate getaway for some. It'll be standard practice for Australians booking a trip to Bali in the coming weeks or months. From Friday, Indonesia has opened Bali to all foreign tourists, including Australians, who have had at least two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Since mid-October, only tourists from a selection of countries were allowed to fly direct to Bali, but Australia was not on the list. In reality, though, there are still no direct flights from Australia to Bali and no word on when they will be approved. The first commercial tourist flight in almost two years landed in Bali yesterday, with eight Japanese travellers arriving on a Garuda flight from Tokyo. Garuda is planning one flight a week from Tokyo and Singapore Airlines will begin weekly flights from Singapore on February 16. Jetstar has tentative plans to resume flights to Bali from Sydney and Melbourne on March 1, but says the dates could be brought forward if and when Indonesia gives the green light. Qantas is scheduled to resume flights in late March and Virgin Australia still has no firm date. But even when Australians finally land at Ngurah Rai Airport, a holiday in Bali won't be quite as simple or carefree as it was before. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic All foreign tourists will need a certificate proving they have had two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine at least two weeks before travelling, and a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours of travel. Fully vaccinated international passengers arriving in Bali will have to spend five days at one of five designated quarantine hotels. All are five-star resorts or hotels in Nusa Dua, Jimbaran, Sanur or Ubud. They have been set up as ""quarantine bubbles"", where guests are not confined to their rooms but are allowed to move around freely and use facilities including swimming pools, gyms, and in-house restaurants. Hotel employees dealing with those in quarantine will also have to stay inside the resort for the duration of the quarantine period. Tourists will need to return a negative PCR test on their fourth day of quarantine before leaving to explore the rest of Bali. Travellers will also need proof that they have travel insurance worth at least $US25,000 ($35,000) to cover the cost of any medical care or evacuation in the event they fall ill with COVID-19 while they're in Bali. Tourist visas will no longer be available on arrival — instead, travellers will need to obtain a visa before they fly. Once on the ground in Bali, international travellers must undergo another PCR test at Ngurah Rai airport, and wait for a negative result before they are taken to their hotel. Anyone who tests positive will be sent to an isolation centre at their own cost, or taken to hospital if they have severe symptoms, and will not be allowed to leave until they test negative. Everyone on the holiday island must use a check-in app — PeduliLindungi — to visit local shops, hotels, restaurants and other sites. Even Bali's famous Kuta Beach has a QR code for visitors to check in before they can walk onto the sand. Bali officially reopened its airport to foreign travellers on October 14, but until yesterday not a single commercial flight had arrived on the island from overseas, and hotels had few if any confirmed bookings from foreign tourists. Before the pandemic, Australians made up the biggest number of international tourists in Bali, with about 1.23 million Aussies visiting the holiday island in 2019. Chinese tourists were a close second, accounting for about 1.17 million visitors. The loss of about 6 million foreign tourists a year has had a devastating impact on Bali's economy. As many as 70 per cent of the Balinese population earned a living from tourism, either directly or indirectly. Tens of thousands have lost their jobs and income. Many have been forced to return to farming or more subsistence ways of life. The key to reopening the island to international tourism has been Bali's high vaccination rate. In tourist areas including the three ""green zones"" of Nusa Dua, Sanur and Ubud, 100 per cent of the population has had two doses of a vaccine. Even further north, away from these areas, the double vaccination rate is still between 72 and 90 per cent, far higher than in most other provinces of Indonesia. Hotel owners and tourist operators are impatient to see Australian tourists return. ""Australians make up about 30 per cent of our whole market,"" said Aviadi Purnomo, who owns the Tanjung Sari hotel at Sanur. ""We're very excited. We heard from the news that … Australians [can] travel out of Australia, which is very good."" Mr Purnomo has had numerous inquiries from Australians wanting to book hotel rooms. But any tentative bookings have so far been cancelled or postponed until Australian travellers can return. Jetstar this week said it was waiting on further details from the Indonesian government, on specific entry and quarantine requirements, before reassessing its flight plans. Garuda slashed its flights to Australia after the pandemic hit and the airline faces financial difficulty. Currently, there are two flights a week from Sydney to Jakarta, but none to Bali. Late last year, the Australian government cancelled its global ""do not travel"" advice, opening the door to international travel for the first time since March 2020. The current advice for travel to Indonesia is level 2, ""Exercise a high degree of caution"". Its Smartraveller website warns Australians visiting the country to be aware of risks. ""Foreign nationals have died from COVID-19 in Indonesia, including in Bali,"" it states. ""There's limited availability of testing and infection control facilities. ""Critical care for Australians who become seriously ill, including in Bali, is significantly below the standard available in Australia. Medical evacuation may not be possible. ""The Australian government cannot guarantee your access to hospital and other health services in Indonesia. ""If you test positive for COVID-19 on arrival or on day 6 of quarantine, you will be transferred to a hospital for treatment at your own expense.""

280,New Zealand announced its citizens can return home. But not all are rushing to book flights,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  New Zealand has announced its plan to ""reconnect with the world"" over the coming months. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Thursday announced the country would ease COVID-related border restrictions in five stages, starting from late February. The plan will reunite families separated by some of the strictest border rules imposed anywhere in the world throughout the pandemic. It is also hoped that industries like tourism and higher education will receive a must-needed boost from the changes. So, what does it mean for NZ citizens in Australia? And what might it mean for trans-Tasman travel going forward? Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic For the past two years, foreigners have been largely barred from entering NZ altogether, while citizens have had to apply for a spot in hotel quarantine or an emergency exemption. Spots in so-called managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) are randomly assigned to only a select number of applicants, leading the opposition Nationals Party to deem it the ""lottery of human misery"". The system was last week brought into focus with journalist Charlotte Bellis speaking out against being denied entry to NZ, despite being heavily pregnant. She was later offered a spot in MIQ via a special exemption, after her predicament made global headlines. While Australia and New Zealand had established a travel bubble during the pandemic, it has been paused and suspended on numerous occasions due to renewed coronavirus outbreaks. NZ had previously planned to reopen for quarantine-free international travel in mid-January, but delayed the move due to the spread of the Omicron variant overseas. Now, with some 94 per cent of NZ's eligible population having received two doses of the vaccine, the government will allow thousands of stranded Kiwis to return home. Fully vaccinated New Zealand citizens and visa holders from Australia will be allowed to enter starting from 11.59pm on February 27. They will be required to self-isolate for 10 days. ""New Zealanders from Australia are coming home on February 27 and all planning heads towards that,"" Ms Ardern said. From March 14 onwards, vaccinated New Zealanders and residents from the rest of the world will also be allowed to self-isolate. Partners and dependents of NZ citizens and residents will also be allowed to enter, as will those participating in working holiday schemes and some skilled workers. Offshore temporary visa holders elsewhere in the world and up to 5,000 international students will then be allowed in from April 13. But it might not be until July that all Australians, including tourists, will be allowed to return to New Zealand. ""We anticipate this stage will begin no later than July. I want to place strong emphasis on this being the latest we expect this to begin,"" Ms Ardern said. ""There is a high likelihood of this date coming forward as we progress through the next stage of the pandemic."" All other international visitors will be allowed to enter New Zealand from October. MIQ will remain mandatory for travellers deemed ""high-risk"" by the government, including those who are unvaccinated. Unvaccinated travellers will find it difficult to get to NZ in the first place given vaccine mandates imposed by Air New Zealand, Qantas, Virgin Australia and other airlines. NZ armed forces personnel will begin the process of withdrawing form MIQ, with Ms Ardern adding that some hotels would return ""to traditional use to support the return of our tourists"". It has major implications for the hundreds of thousands of NZ citizens living overseas, including in Australia. Pre-COVID, Australia and New Zealand citizens had enjoyed free movement between the two countries since the 1920s. As of mid-2018, there were an estimated 568,0000 New Zealand-born people residing in Australia — representing the fourth-largest migrant community. Christel Broederlow lives on the Gold Coast and runs a Facebook group for the Māori community living in Australia. She said Thursday's announcement had been met by New Zealanders in Australia with ""elation"", but that many remained anxious the situation could change again at short notice. Many New Zealanders were desperate to return because they have lost their jobs in Australia during the pandemic, she said, adding that many aren't eligible for government assistance because they have not been in Australia long enough. ""It's it leaves them stranded, a lot of them that sold everything, that sold their homes and their flights only for New Zealand government to announce their postponement."" In 2020, Ms Broederlow and her husband had planned to move back to New Zealand to be closer to her ageing father, but their plans were ruined by the border closures. Despite Ms Broederlow's father since being diagnosed with lung cancer, she has not been able to visit NZ. ""I believe the New Zealand government hasn't seriously considered the health and wellbeing, or mental wellbeing of the people — New Zealand citizens — that have been left stranded in Australia and also the world."" Melbourne-based Martin Newell's mother was recently hospitalised for heart failure in NZ. ""That was exceptionally stressful, not just being able to jump on a plane and be with her,"" he told the ABC. Tourism was New Zealand's largest export industry and a huge proportion of their tourists were Australian before the pandemic hit. With Australia's international border closed for almost two years, there's one question on the lips of tourism operators, accommodation providers and hospitality venues: When will international visitors come back? Almost one in 10 New Zealanders were directly employed in tourism. There were 1.5 million arrivals from Australia — accounting for 40 per cent of international visitors to NZ in 2019 — who spent some $NZ2.7 billion ($2.5 billion). And it goes both ways. New Zealanders were the second largest market for visitor arrivals into Australia in 2019. Daniel Gschwind, head of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, welcomed the planned relaxation of NZ's border rules. ""It's really important for our industry, and I would think for many families spread across the ditch here, it's very important to get our connection going again,"" he said. ""We're practically one market. New Zealand is often treated as almost part of our domestic network. ""It is quite, almost bizarre, that we're cut off from New Zealand while we engage with the rest of the world,"" Mr Gschwind said. In a statement, Tourism Industry Aotearoa welcomed the the announcements but said the government must be prepared to remove self-isolation requirements as soon as health risks eased. Spokesperson Ann-Marie Johnson said New Zealand remained off the radar for international travellers while the requirements were in place. “The need for self-isolation is questionable, especially if Omicron becomes endemic in the community as modelling suggests,"" she said. ""With risks equalised between New Zealand and overseas, the rationale for keeping self-isolation rules in place no longer exists."" A survey by Tourism New Zealand in mid-2021 showed that more than 80 per cent of Australians actively considering travel to the country were wanting to do so for a holiday, while 21 per cent intended to visit family. ""I would so like to go home and hug my dad and you know, see how he is face-to-face,"" Ms Broederlow said, adding though that she was not rushing to book plane tickets because they are anxious about the possibility of getting stuck in NZ. The country faces a growing Omicron outbreak — although small compared to Australia's — with 147 new COVID cases reported on Thursday. Spread of the virus is expected to continue as more international travellers arrive. Ms Broederlow and her husband have decided to remain based in Australia for fear of being separated from their sons and other family here in the future. ""There's just too much uncertainty and it's gonna take a long time to revive the crippled tourism between the countries and economies,"" she said.

281,'Why can't I?': Aussies heading overseas to dodge government ban on cruise ships,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Thousands of Australians are travelling overseas to board cruise ships to get around the federal government's ban on the industry which has been in place since the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban came into effect in March 2020 after the notorious disembarkation of the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney, which triggered the country's first major COVID-19 outbreak, leading to at least 900 infections and 28 deaths. In December last year, the government announced it was extending the ban until mid-February due to the fast-spreading Omicron variant. Tired of waiting for the industry to restart in Australia, travel blogger Pippa Madden is heading overseas for a cruise holiday. ""I've got 11 cruises booked from this March out to 2024,"" the aspiring cruise guide said. She was perplexed by the ongoing ban in Australia at a time when the country was lifting restrictions and opening up. ""I've been really devastated actually because if I choose to cruise, why can't I?"" she said. Travel agents said there were many more frustrated holiday-makers flying out of the country to get around the cruise ban. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic ""People are legitimately anxious and ready to cruise, they want to get on a ship,"" said Belle Goldie, owner of agency iTravel in Western Sydney. ""There's built-up angst and anger against what's happening here with the cruise and travel bans and they are cruising overseas for that reason."" Ms Goldie has herself been on a number of overseas cruises in recent months. ""It was, in a one word, magical,"" she said. ""I wasn't prepared for the emotions I felt getting on board a ship again for the first time in two years."" The cruise ban is due to be lifted in a fortnight but there has been no official confirmation from the federal or state governments that this will happen. ""The states are waiting for the government to develop a set of national guidelines and the federal government is waiting for the state to take the lead in the cruise resumption,"" said Joel Katz, managing director of Cruise Lines International Association Australasia (CLIA). ""As an industry we are caught between the federal government and the states so we are saying to them, let's just sit down and talk about the pathway forward."" The CLIA estimates that the ban has already cost the Australian economy $10 billion. And with months of preparation needed before a voyage, Mr Katz said it could be April or May before cruises from Australian ports resume. ""Even if the ban is lifted on the 17th of February, which we are hoping will happen, it's going to take many months for those ships to come back to Australia,"" he said. Businesses reliant on the cruise industry are struggling to stay afloat. Sydney based chandler Inter-Marine, which specialises in servicing cruise ships, has lost 90 per cent of its business. Being asked to supply parts to cruise ships operating in Europe, the United States and Asia has rubbed salt in the wound. ""We have friends and colleagues all around the world and the rest of the world has been cruising for nearly a year now,"" managing director Graeme Blackman said. ""Australia is the largest continent shoreline in the world, we can't even do domestic bubble cruises here. ""I don't think there's been enough dialogue with the cruise ship owners and operators … those ships have been ready, probably for about 18 months."" Big changes onboard was something Ms Goldie noticed on her recent cruises n the United States. ""I personally felt very safe at vaccinations, mandatory testing, sanitisation, ventilation and things like that going on with the cruise lines,"" she said. An inquiry into the Ruby Princess debacle found that NSW health officials made a number of ""inexplicable"" errors in allowing passengers, many of them coughing and showing visible signs of infection, to disembark in Sydney without being tested. Many then took trains, buses or flights to get home, spreading the virus across the country and overseas. Almost two years on, NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said he was keen to see cruise ships return. ""We will do whatever we can to get cruising back as safely as possible and as quickly as possible,"" he said. Late last year, Flinders University's head of microbiology and infectious diseases, David Gordon, said while travellers had to ""make their own decision"" about whether they felt comfortable booking a cruise, some people would inevitably be at risk. ""There are a substantial number of people who, at least at the moment, should still think seriously about embarking on a cruise,"" he said. ""I guess the reason for that is, that if there is some COVID [that] somehow gets onto the cruise ship then you're stuck on the cruise ship and there's a higher likelihood that it might spread,"" he said. ""Whereas, if you go to Rome and the Colosseum and someone [who] walks through the Colosseum has COVID, you're not putting yourself in an environment where there's going to be an ongoing and escalating risk that you're going to be continually exposing yourself to.""

282,NT tourism industry for Red Centre seeks clarity over new movement restrictions,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus A key Aboriginal organisation has welcomed the reintroduction of movement-restricting biosecurity zones in the Northern Territory, but the tourism industry wants more detail about what it means for them. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt announced on Wednesday that people will be restricted from leaving or entering remote communities for a fortnight as COVID-19 case numbers continue to grow in the NT. The chief executive of the Central Land Council Les Turner has welcomed the decision to restrict movement through remote communities. ""Would have been good to do it a bit earlier,"" Mr Turner said. ""A lot of our people are still moving around through communities and as you've seen with the outbreak, it's spreading everywhere. ""We're hoping this window of opportunity will give time for vaccinations to be conducted and increase the vaccination rates especially with the younger population."" Mr Turner said the NT government's lockdowns, lockouts and lock-ins in remote communities were not working to contain the spread of the virus. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Tourism Central Australia chief executive Danial Rochford said he was still trying to clarify what the biosecurity zones meant for his industry. He said his reading of the determination meant the resort town of Yulara near Uluru was excluded from the restrictions. ""If you fly into Yulara you're fine because you don't go through a designated area but if you drive from Alice Springs to Yulara you enter a designated area,"" he said. But it was unclear if a tourist in Alice Springs might be able to head out to one of the nearby national parks. ""My reading of the determination is no, but we are seeking clarification on this."" The Biosecurity zones include Tennant Creek, a major town on the main highway through the Northern Territory. The Member for Barkly and opposition frontbencher Steve Edgington said the community was taken aback by the restrictions. ""I think Barkly is in shock,"" he said. Mr Edgington said he was concerned the COVID figures in the region may be higher than the Territory's official tally. ""We were facing quite a chaotic situation … and that's why the biosecurity arrangements are now in place,"" he said. ""I believe the situation right across the Barkly [has been been played down].""

283,"Kiwis in Australia can return home this month, tourists to be allowed back in 'no later than July'",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  New Zealanders who have been stranded in Australia, unable to win a place in their country's hotel quarantine system, will be able to go home from February 27. Their fellow citizens stuck in other parts of the world will have to wait until March 13 to make the journey. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the changes during a speech this morning and detailed a new plan for how she intends to reconnect New Zealand to the world. The country still has strict border policies in place and citizens located across the world have been forced to enter a lottery to win a place in New Zealand's hotel quarantine system. Today, Ms Ardern announced that policy would now change. ""The tools we used yesterday to help battle this health crisis, they won't stay the same,"" she said. She said there was ""no question"" the managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) system ""has been one of the hardest parts of the pandemic"". Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic From the end of the month, instead of facing a bottleneck at hotel quarantine, returning New Zealanders will be allowed to isolate at home. It's expected Australian tourists, and other travellers from visa-waiver countries, will be allowed in ""no later than"" July. Visa holders, including international students and migrant workers, will be allowed in and to isolate at home from mid-April. Non-visa holders can expect to enter New Zealand in October. New Zealanders returning from Australia, as well as other eligible travellers, from February 27 will need to self-isolate for 10 days. ""We do see self-isolation requirements changing over time. We expect there to be a reduction to seven days,"" Ms Ardern said. She said self-isolation would remain in place in the short term, but left the door open for that requirement to removed by the time tourists were welcomed back. “We do see those requirements changing, lowering and eventually being unnecessary,"" Ms Ardern said. Ms Ardern said officials expected that by the end of February Omicron would have spread further across New Zealand and arrivals from Australia would ""not materially change"" the risk in the community or the trajectory of the pandemic for the country. Today, New Zealand recorded 147 new cases of COVID, including 44 at the border. Some decisions within this plan will be reviewed on February 20, but the initial dates relevant to returning Kiwis are ""fixed"". And because New Zealand's reopening plan has changed before, Ms Ardern was asked how travellers could have confidence the steps laid out today would actually happen. She said boosters made all the difference. ""We have no intention of changing these dates. We want people to be able to plan,"" Ms Ardern said. ""We're asking New Zealanders now get boosted, prepare, because we've set those dates going forward. ""These are very firm dates we’ve set. New Zealanders from Australia are coming home on February 27 and all planning heads towards that."" Yesterday, Ms Ardern announced New Zealand would shorten the window for booster eligibility from four months to three, just as the nation achieved the milestone of having 94 per cent of its population over 12 fully vaccinated. New Zealand's hotel quarantine system — referred to as MIQ — has received international media attention this week due to pregnant journalist Charlotte Bellis writing a letter condemning the system after she was denied a spot and forced to remain in Afghanistan. Her case has since been resolved, with the ministry explaining her application was originally closed due to the timing of her intended travel. New Zealand journalist Charlotte Bellis, who is pregnant and trying to get home from Afghanistan, is offered a place in hotel quarantine. Bellis said her case was just one of many. And pressure over the strict system and regular denial of emergency allocations has been building. When Ms Ardern opened her address today, she defended the longstanding policy. ""The anguish of MIQ has been real and heartbreaking, but the choice to use it undeniably saved lives,"" she said. ""MIQ meant not everyone could come home when they wanted to, but it also meant COVID could not come in whenever it wanted to either. ""And that’s meant we've been able to build our defences to become one of the most vaccinated countries in the world."" Ms Ardern said the plan for the country's hotel quarantine system into the future was for it to remain in place for high-risk travellers, such as those who were unvaccinated. She said the military would not be used to support the system any longer and that a ""national quarantine service"" would be established in New Zealand in the future.

284,"A mysterious artist handed a sketch to Annabel Crabb one night in Rome — four years later, she knows who it was",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Annabel Crabb was handed a sketch from a mysterious artist one night in Rome. Now the mystery is solved It's a story that emerged with a ""message in a bottle"" quality, tying together ABC personality Annabel Crabb and Tasmanian artist and bookshop owner, Alexander Okenyo, in a way neither of them could have expected. It all started in 2018, before COVID travel restrictions, when Crabb and her partner, Jeremy Storer, were travelling overseas with their three children. While Crabb and her family were in a restaurant in Rome one night, a fellow diner approached them on his way out with his wife and handed Crabb a small sketch on a torn piece of receipt paper. ""We didn't have a long chat, he just handed over the drawing. And I was so taken by it that I sort of was focused on it and not him … so I didn't really pick up that he was Australian,"" Crabb said. She said she loved the sketch so much that she made sure to put it somewhere where it wouldn't be damaged — in her stamp envelope in her wallet. Crabb said she had thought about the sketch for years, wondering who the mysterious artist was. There were some brief internet searches not long after she received the sketch, with no luck. Recently, she pulled out the sketch again. ""I thought, 'I never did find out who that artist was',"" she said. ""I was looking at this little drawing and remembering how much I loved it, and I sort of thought, why don't I just ask the podcast group?"" Crabb posted a photo of the sketch, and one of the artist's signature, in the Facebook group for Chat10Looks3 — the podcast she hosts with fellow ABC presenter Leigh Sales. ""They are the best investigative detectives! I didn't know why I hadn't thought of it before,"" Crabb said. In mere minutes, the mystery was solved. The artist was not someone from Europe — as she had originally thought — but Tasmanian artist and bookshop owner Alexander Okenyo. Alexander Okenyo owns the Black Swan bookshop in the southern Tasmanian town of New Norfolk. He told ABC Radio Hobart he was shocked to discover the sketch he did during his Italian holiday in 2018 had made its way to the internet years later. ""I was sketching a lot on that trip, and I was struck that night because I noticed the kids were drawing at the dinner table … and that actually inspired me,"" he said. ""I remember everything from that night, it was so vivid. I just remember spotting this beautiful family just doing their own thing."" When Okenyo was identified as the artist, Crabb posted the news on her Instagram page. ""I've carried it in my wallet ever since and I love it and have always wondered who he was,"" she wrote. ""This morning I posted the drawing in the Chat10Looks3 group and within about two minutes they identified the artist as Alexander Okenyo — an Australian! ""Hey Alexander, was this indeed you? And if so — thank you so much for this little piece of perfection which I will keep always. ""Going to Rome seems like a fever dream now. I hope you are well and that you had a great holiday in 2018."" Alexander's wife Sarah Okenyo saw the post and rushed to tell her husband that the family he had sketched in Rome all those years ago was, in fact, Annabel Crabb's. Okenyo then started receiving messages from friends and family who had also seen the post. ""I know who Annabel is, but I had to look her up to be sure,"" Okenyo said. He said he was a big fan of Crabb's work, but did not realise it was her that night. ""I didn't know it was her … it was just about how lovely they were together,"" he said. ""It's just so funny to see it come back four years later."" Okenyo said when he looked at the sketch online and saw Crabb's trademark cat-eye glasses, it all made sense. ""It was funny to see her iconic glasses — right there in the sketch."" Okenyo posted to social media about the discovery. ""I do specifically remember how lovely your family was with each other,"" he posted on Instagram. ""Sarah and I were just starting our own and sitting there with her, very much in love, people gazing, watching your family chatter and interact was heart-warming. ""Also, hearing Aussie accents overseas can be very nice!"" Okenyo said the full circle moment had reminded him of the coincidences he often encountered with strangers in his home state. ""These kinds of things happen in Tasmania all the time,"" he said. He said the chance encounter made his 2018 trip all the more memorable. ""The whole thing has been quite fun, I think there is something in it that reflects how lovely and full circle things can be,"" he said. Crabb said the discovery excited her family and her followers on social media, and was a reminder of the joy in crossing paths with fellow Australians overseas. ""He did this thoughtful, beautiful sketch that I love so much … and of course, he's also this charming, lovely artist from Tasmania."" As for the sketch, Crabb is hoping to preserve it long-term. ""It's still in my wallet,"" she said.

285,Want to try bungee jumping without leaping off a cliff? Virtual travel offers thrills without the spills ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Virtual reality tourism is accessible, inclusive and takes the risk out of a COVID-disrupted getaway As COVID-19 continues to disrupt many Australians' travel plans, some of those looking for a risk-free escape are turning to virtual reality tourism. And while it may sound like a downgrade from the real thing, tour guides and designers of these experiences say it's becoming increasingly sophisticated. But what is virtual reality tourism?  Dr Ryan Yung, a travel and tourism researcher, defines it as the ability to ""be physically in one location but your mind is in a different location."" It can now be accessed by anyone who has a PC, laptop or mobile phone through YouTube or via virtual tours online. And the experience can be enhanced by using a fold-out Google Cardboard viewer or, for those willing to spend more money, technologically advanced virtual reality headsets. So is virtual tourism any substitute for the real thing? It's hard to compare the two but virtual tourism does have some unique benefits, Dr Yung tells ABC RN Breakfast. ""Some of the more popular attractions in virtual tourism [eventually] will be … places which would be physically impossible to visit,"" he says. ""If we wanted to visit Rome, for example, in the medieval times, it's possible to do so via virtual tourism."" Some virtual experiences are also trying to integrate sensory elements, although Dr Yung says there's still much more work to be done in this area. ""With smells, they use pods, which emit synthetic smells ... similar to what you'd find in a shopping mall, when you walk past a cookie stand or something with artificial smells."" ""With taste at the moment, there is no real substitute, but I believe some researchers in Singapore have come up with a technology where they can trick your mind through smell. It's been dubbed ""the successor to the internet"" — but what do you know about it? ""This is where you're drinking mineral water but, through the trick of colour and smell, you can basically fool the mind into thinking [the person is] tasting something."" Virtual tourism could open up destinations for those who couldn't access them otherwise. ""A lot of the technology that's behind it [came in] years before COVID hit, and it was to overcome a lot of issues with barriers with accessibility and inclusivity,"" Dr Yung says. ""So people who were not mobile were able to still get some experience of the outside world."" It offers other opportunities too. For example, for those who are risk adverse, virtual tourism could be a way to take part in extreme sports safely, he says. ""[People] I've spoken to said something like … 'I would love to do something like bungee jumping but my natural fear would never let me do something like that'."" ""But [with] the comfort of VR, knowing that you physically will not be doing the bungee jump but you're able to experience something like that, that could be a substitute for the real experience. ""I've heard people say they want to see the Great Barrier Reef, but they are so afraid of water … so that could be [an opportunity] in the near term."" Virtual reality can also be used to travel freely without any risk of social or cultural stigmas, he adds. ""There are certain behaviours [that] certain cultures expect of us when we travel overseas, or when we're out in public. And when we are hidden deep behind this virtual lens, then [virtual tourists] are able to explore different mannerisms or cultures that you normally wouldn't be able to,"" he says. So for those looking to scratch their travel itch, virtual tourism is opening up the world once again, says Dr Yung. ""This is one small positive that has come up with COVID in alerting research and development [and encouraging the] acceptance of the technology by everyone else.""

286,Visa holders left out of border reopening 'frustrated and annoyed',travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Late last year, Australia's international border was finally edged open, prompting reunions and relief at airports around the country. But as images of families tearfully embracing were beamed across morning news programs, Emma Cochrane couldn't bring herself to watch. The mother of two and her chef husband have called Perth home since 2018, and are on a bridging visa as they wait for their permanent residency to be processed. Bridging visa B holders aren't included in the list of people allowed to freely enter and return to Australia, which includes citizens, permanent residents, international students, and backpackers. There is also a travel bubble with Singapore, Japan and South Korea. ""We're, in effect, stuck in limbo land,"" Ms Cochrane told 7.30. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic ""We can't get our family here, and we can't go see our family overseas. ""I can't risk going overseas and risk getting stuck. My husband's got a job here; his company relies on him to come back to Australia."" Should she leave Australia to visit family in England, Ms Cochrane would need to apply for an exemption to get back in — something most other visa holders don't have to do. She has applied 14 times for exemptions to both leave and to have her triple-vaccinated parents come to Australia. All of the exemption requests have been denied. ""I'm frustrated and annoyed that bridging visa holders aren't included in this,"" she told 7.30. ""Australia risks losing skills, critical skills… because they're being so inflexible with this exemption. It just doesn't make any sense to me."" Home Affairs told 7.30 that remaining travel restrictions ""balance the need to safely reopen… with the need to protect Australians from COVID-19."" The statement also said border policies have contributed to low death rates, a strong economy, and high vaccination rates. Fully vaccinated tourists — who may be the relatives or friends of Australian citizens and residents — also aren't allowed into Australia. Last week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a Brisbane radio station he hoped the international border would be opened to tourists ""well before Easter"". Sydney University Professor and former race discrimination commissioner Tim Soutphommasane said closed borders don't make as much sense as they once did at the start of the pandemic. ""With a highly vaccinated population, with vaccines that are proven to provide strong protection, the case for fortress Australia has become much weaker,"" Mr Soutphommasane told 7.30. ""Our society [has] been built by migration and migrants make an important contribution to our economy, to our society, indeed to our culture. ""If we keep our borders closed, if we prolong this fortress Australia stance, we do risk becoming a pariah in the international community."" Epidemiologist Catherine Bennett from Deakin University also argues the risk from people arriving from overseas has significantly lowered as the Omicron variant spreads. ""If you are talking about the border as a levee wall, and you've got as much water on the other side… it doesn't make a difference to the risk for the individual or to the countries as long as we're still monitoring people who aren't vaccinated,"" Professor Bennett said. For Emma Cochrane, she doesn't want her daughters to grow up not recognising or knowing their grandparents. ""Life's too short. I'm glad Australia's moving in the right direction, it's just not quick enough and it seems like it's leaving people out."" Watch this story on 7.30 tonight on ABC TV and ABC iview.

287,Plans for one of Australia's longest and highest rail trails on track as local councils back it in ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Plans for a 214-kilometre rail trail through NSW's south-east will be drawn up after local councils agree to work together on the project. The Monaro Rail Trail project aims to transform disused rail corridors from Queanbeyan to Bombala into a path for cyclists, walkers, charity rides and disability scooters. The group behind the idea, Monaro Rail Trail Inc, last week signed a memorandum of understanding with the Snowy Monaro and Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Councils, allowing the three parties to proceed with developing detailed plans for the trail. It's considered the first formal agreement for the project. ""It's really formalising the arrangements we've had basically over the last 18 months,"" the group's president Ken Lister said. ""We've been meeting on a fortnightly basis with both councils and to organise such things ... as liaison with landholders and also to secure funding from the state and federals governments for construction."" Planning for the proposed trail has been divided into three main sections: Tralee to Michelago, 11.5 kilometres south of Nimmitabel Railway Station to MacLaughlan Meatworks, and Bombala to Jincumbilly. It will run through towns like Bredbo, Chakola, Bunyan and Cooma. Two consultants have been sent out to inspect the old railway lines to create a trail development plan, which will then be used to formally apply for grant funding through the NSW and federal governments for the build. ""These two really experienced consultants are walking various sections of the rail trail to do the detailed design work,"" Mr Lister said. ""The outcome of that, with cost estimates and route details, will be incorporated into a business plan."" Rail Trails are becoming an increasingly popular concept for regional and rural communities with abandoned railway lines due to their potential to become a tourism drawcard for country towns. Rail Trails Australia currently lists 12 established rail trails in NSW, including the 21-kilometre Tumbarumba to Rosewood trail in the Riverina. Four other trails in NSW are partially opened, while 18 others are looking to be developed, including those in the New England and Northern Rivers regions. According to Rail Trails Australia president Damian McCrohan, the Monaro Rail Trail will provide an economic boost to the region. ""There's a huge potential with this rail trail,"" he said. ""Cyclists can't move as fast as driving through, so they like to stop. They need to recharge. ""The coffee fill-up is essential, and they like to stay there and spend their money."" If the Monaro Rail Trail is successful in submitting its plans and gathering funding, it will be considered one of the longest rail trails, at one of the highest altitudes, in Australia. The group behind the project estimates that $50 million will be needed to build the entire trail. There's a lot of work ahead, but supporting businesses in towns still recovering from the Black Summer bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major motivation for the Monaro Rail Trail group to see the project through. ""There's a great need for economic development, particularly in the Bombala area,"" Mr Lister said. ""There are good people down there struggling with drought, bushfires, COVID, and this would be probably one of the biggest economic booms to be able to keep the Bombala community going. ""But places like Nimmitabel, Bredbo and Michaelago, people tend to drive right past them, and many have got bikes on their vehicles.""

288,How A-listers helped 'aircraft paparazzi' survive a drought,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Hollywood stars seeking refuge and a place to work during the coronavirus pandemic provided plenty of glamour and an economic boost to Queensland. But seeing American actors Tom Hanks, George Clooney and Julia Roberts arrive wasn't a thrill for avid Gold Coast plane spotter, Matthew Coughran. He was more interested in their planes. ""We got Tom Hanks arriving.That was something different [but I] couldn't care who the person was on the plane,"" Mr Coughran said. ""The plane itself is the most important part. We're aircraft paparazzi."" In 2002, Mr Coughran saw actor and keen pilot John Travolta touchdown in Sydney. ""I got a photo of him getting out of the plane but he was kind of an obstruction of the plane,"" he said. The 31-year-old has been an avid plane spotter since he was just six years old, inspired by his grandfather who was in the air force. Now, his mother shares his passion. ""I absolutely love coming out here to Gold Coast Airport and getting all the domestic and international arrivals,"" Mr Coughran said. More domestic and international flights are slowly returning to the airport as COVID restrictions ease. ""For a period we had no aircraft coming into Gold Coast Airport, so it was very difficult and hard. ""The planes flying over you, it's a completely different feeling and experience. ""For me it makes you forget about everything that's going on the world and you can take photos and just enjoy. ""It's always been a goal to get every registration of every aircraft."" Apart from Hollywood heavyweights, a visit by the Malaysian royal family and its colourful aircraft had plane spotters out in force. ""That was a pretty cool arrival."" Along with friends, Mr Coughran recently launched SydSquad, a live plane spotting feed on social media. ""I did Brisbane on Australia Day and did the Gold Coast on Saturday. We're averaging 500 to 1,000 viewers each time and it's fun. ""We had Americans, Canadians, we even had someone from Uganda, which I found pretty cool. ""I'm glad I can show off the Gold Coast."" Top of his plane wish list is a one of a kind. Built in the 1980s, the Antonov An-225 is the heaviest aircraft ever built with the largest wingspan. ""It's a six engine aircraft [and] there's only one in the world. It flies all around the world carrying cargo.""

289,"In a spot: Residents told campervans, large vehicles can park 'indefinitely' in suburban streets",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Campervans, large vehicles can park in residential streets indefinitely, if within size requirements The battle between campervans and residents is one that has gone on for decades — holiday-makers search for spots to park their vehicles while locals aim to defend their precious views and streets. But it turns out many large vehicles, including campervans, caravans, buses and other trailers, can be parked in residential streets indefinitely in Queensland. Provided they are within certain height and length requirements, owners can park them for as long as they please. Vehicles must be under 7.5 metres long and weigh less than 4.5 tonnes, and therefore not deemed a heavy vehicle. The restriction rules out large motorhomes, caravans and trucks, but a number of smaller campervans, caravans and small buses still make the cut. A Queensland councillor says while this might frustrate residents who've lost parks for weeks on end, those motorists are entirely within the law. Gold Coast City Council's Hermann Vorster says the coast is one location that sees frequent complaints from residents about campervans and other large vehicles blocking up residential streets. But the council is often unable to act. ""Gold Coast roads are no different to any roads in Queensland and under the Queensland road rules, so long as the vehicle is registered and not parked in a regulated zone with timed parking, it can remain there indefinitely,"" he said. Mr Vorster said vehicles that exceeded the specified tonnage and metres did not belong in residential areas and owners would face fines if they were illegally parked. ""It would be hard to find anywhere to park indefinitely in most areas,"" he said. ""And you may find yourself at the pointy end of residents' complaints and a council officer visiting."" He said camping in vehicles and timed areas offer different restrictions and therefore the rules don't mean tourists can sleep in the vehicles. ""The road rules are quite separate from our local laws, which deal with illegal camping, so if people have a sleeping bag and are asleep in the back of their vehicle it's a pretty clear indicator that they're camping and it's not just simply parking going on,"" he said. ""So there are rules around camping, but if the vehicle's stored up on a site — say with friends and family — then, yeah, that's fine. ""Under the Queensland state government's road rules, you're treated no differently than any other passenger vehicle. ""But if you do breach those limits, then different rules apply to you now."" According to Mr Vorster, the Gold Coast Council investigated whether the local government could implement its own set of regulations to better field constant complaints from residents. ""What we discovered is that it would be unlawful for councils to introduce regulations over and above what the road rules provide, because the Queensland road rules have precedent on anything that council could do,"" he said. ""So we are aware of the complaints, and we did try and regulate in the space. ""But the state government had the final say and they wanted to preserve one set of rules across Queensland so if people were travelling from Cairns to Coolangatta, they weren't caught by a change that they weren't aware of.""

290,Australia's own Celtic stone circle alive with 'energy' and mystique after 30 years,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Australia's own Celtic stone circle alive with 'energy' and mystique after 30 years Just as mystery shrouds the origins of some of the world's most famous standing stones, like Stonehenge in England, there are hopes a similar mystique might one day surround the Celtic monument in the northern NSW town of Glen Innes. ""I'd like to think in another couple of hundred years or so, people will be saying, 'Oh, so what was this all about', which would be lovely,"" the chair of the Australian Standing Stones Management Committee, Judi Toms, said. But with the monument turning 30 tomorrow, the origins of the stones perched at 1,100 metres above sea level overlooking the town won't fall out of living memory anytime soon. And the popularity of the television series Outlander, in which a WWII nurse travels back in time to meet a handsome Scot after touching a standing stone, has added to its tourist appeal. In 2018, Glen Innes hosted an Outlandish festival, capitalising on the Scottish fervour surrounding the series. ""You could possibly have thought this was a set of Outlander at that weekend; everyone was dressed so appropriately, the energy was just fantastic,"" Ms Toms said. And while there were no official reports of anyone disappearing after touching the stones, Ms Toms maintained an air of mystery. ""I don't have the final numbers, so I don't know if everyone stayed here or did get relocated,"" she said. ""But there are really people who have that connection with energy lines and do get a sense of life and energy from our stones."" The Celtic Council of Australia chose Glen Innes as the home of a National Celtic Monument to pay tribute to Australia's Celtic pioneers. The first stone was erected in 1991, followed by an additional 36 stones over the following year, all quarried locally. Several thousand people turned out to witness the raising of the first stone by a local tug-of-war team. The stone was then blessed by the local Catholic priest. Items representing various Celtic countries were placed among the foundations — topped off by the contents of a bottle of whisky. The Irish priest is reported have been less than impressed, lamenting: ""For shame, for shame to be so wasteful. It should have been filtered through the kidneys first!"" Ms Toms said Glen Innes tourism owed a lot to the establishment of the national Celtic monument. It plays hosts to many ceremonies throughout the year, including dawn services at the winter and summer solstices, as well as the annual Australian Celtic Festival, which in April this year will celebrate Brittany, Cornwall and Wales. Glen Innes Council can't put a figure on the monument's value, but says it adds considerably to the $45 million visitors spend annually. ""A place can really stand on its own if it has a point of difference, and this really is a point of difference,"" Ms Toms said. At the 30th birthday celebrations on February 1, four new guardians of the stones will be appointed, bringing the total number to 27. This is a ceremonial position but one which aims to maintain the integrity of the monument. ""It's very important for us to oversee the importance of the stones and make sure it's not encumbered by modern-day things, and the site is actually kept with a sense of protocol and history,"" stone guardian Raelene Watson said. ""A lot of visitors have commented, and I know I feel it myself, there's like a presence here, especially within the stone, it is very calming.""

291,"'Fortress Australia' has started to open. So, where the bloody hell is everyone?",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Bondi in summer isn't exactly what Moa Hoflin imagined. ""It's very quiet,"" the 21-year-old Swede told the ABC. ""I knew that Australia had been closed for a while, but I did think it'd be a little busier."" Sitting at the near-empty Bondi Beach Backpackers, a stone's throw from the famous beach, Moa is a rare entity these days. She's a backpacker on a working holiday visa — part of only a small number who have arrived in the country since Australia partly reopened its borders in December. And her new-found friends, Ida Markusson and Antonia Nehlin, also from Sweden, are part of that other elusive group: international students. Once international visitors were an all-too-common fixture in Bondi — and across the country — now the three young women are the first wave of arrivals in what government and industry hope is the return to some semblance of pre-COVID travel to Australia. However, with the border closed for almost two years — and events such as the Novak Djokovic saga generating international headlines — there is one lingering question on the lips of tourism operators, accommodation providers and almost every hospitality venue in the country: When will they come back? Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Last month, the government reopened the door to backpackers on working holiday visas and international students and earlier announced travel bubbles with countries such as Singapore. The government has since announced it will open the borders to all fully-vaccinated International tourists on February 21. It came as a welcome surprise to industry insiders, with some predicting it could take as long as six months to open, with a best-case scenario of a pre-Easter opening tipped by most. As a stopgap, in January the government dangled a carrot to prospective backpackers and international students to come to Australia by scrapping the $600 fee to apply for a visa. And, with about 23,500 backpackers and 150,000 international students holding a valid visa currently not in Australia, the Prime Minister had a message for those watching and waiting. ""Come on down,"" Scott Morrison said. In the very same week, the US joined the European Union in warning its citizens not to travel to Australia, issuing a ""code red"" over the current Omicron wave. It was a move that shocked many in the tourism industry and has the warnings remain valid in February. According to Margy Osmond, the chief executive of the Tourism & Transport Forum Australia, the ""code red"" decision was the latest in a long line of hits to the industry and Australia's global reputation. ""Restoring consumer confidence is pivotal,"" she said. ""And that certainly didn't help. ""But, if you're going to convince people to come back here, it's not going to happen overnight. We need certainty from governments on things like RATs and the borders in order to first encourage backpackers back and then the tourists when the borders open."" Ryan Hanly, the chief executive and co-founder of Australian backpacker-focused travel group Travello, agreed. For him, the recent decision by the West Australian government to scrap the reopening of its border was an example of the uncertainty backpackers faced when coming to Australia. ""From my talks with colleagues overseas, the way the rest of Australia is looking at WA on opening up is the way the rest of the world is looking at Australia,"" he said. ""I don’t think most of Australia realises that, with the exception of, perhaps, New Zealand, we are the laggard in the world in terms of tourism."" Mr Hanly — whose company books travel experiences for backpackers — says he welcomes the government's announcement to scrap the visa fee, but has not seen any discernible increase in bookings since. He says young people will make the journey back to Australia but the big question is: When? ""There's pent-up demand, no doubt,"" he said. ""I have colleagues this week who sent me photos of packed hostels in Sri Lanka, for example. ""Young people will always want to come to Australia, I have no doubt about that. But we think it'll take at least two to three months to see any increase in arrivals. ""In the meantime, we just need that certainty and not see any surprises like what we saw in WA"" Working holidaymakers bring in $3 billion each year, provide an essential workforce, and tend to spend more and stay longer than other travellers. Australia needs to do more to ensure they return. A spokesperson for the federal government's Department of Home Affairs said recent demand for the working holiday-maker visas had been ""strong"". The department said 2,032 working holiday-makers had arrived in the country from December 15 to January 17, and there were 18,378 living and working in the country. According to the department, this time in 2021 there were 49,542 working holiday-makers in Australia and, in 2020 — before COVID hit — there were 141,100. The ABC spoke to a handful of backpackers from Europe and the UK who had had their visas approved or were waiting on approval about their plans to come to Australia. Some said they were ""terrified"" and ""uncertain"" about travel in the COVID-19 era. Others were ""excited"" and said Australia's hard border or the threat of COVID-19 had no impact on their desire to explore the country. Others raised concerns about the cost of flights from Australia to Europe, with less demand meaning flights were generally more expensive. For Frenchman William Gibouri, from Brittany in the country's north-west, the only thing stopping him from coming to Australia was the delay in processing his visa. Mr Gibouri, 29, told the ABC he had been waiting patiently for signs that Australia's border was reopening. He applied for his visa in late November and wanted to get to Australia by March. ""It's still pending approval,"" he said. ""And I have friends who applied in December but are wanting to come in September who have already got theirs approved."" Mr Gibouri — who wants to do farm work or work at a winery — says Australia's hardline stance during COVID-19 has had no impact on his desire to come to Australia. He says only WA's decision to keep its hard border has impacted him, as he plans to start his trip in Perth. ""I want to discover Australia, buy a four-wheel drive and be free,"" he said. Several other backpackers who spoke to the ABC also said they'd faced delays getting their visas processed. The Department of Home Affairs said it was aiming to finalise new and existing applications ""as soon as possible"". It said it had received 9,665 applications so far in January. When COVID-19 hit Australia, images of international students queuing for free food circulated around the country. Thousands of backpackers left the country as Australia went into lockdown and work dried up, with Mr Morrison at the time urging backpackers who could not support themselves to ""go home"". More recently, after almost two years of closed borders, the international coverage surrounding the tennis star Djokovic has highlighted Australia's stance on vaccination and protecting its border. Andrew Hughes — a marketing lecturer at ANU’s Research School of Management — said there was ""no doubt"" a lot of damage had been done to ""brand Australia"". He said only ""time"" and ""word of mouth"" from backpackers and travellers coming to the country would turn it around.

292,"From blood-stained killing waters to slice of paradise, welcome to Australia's best beach",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Misery Beach, on Western Australia's south coast, named Tourism Australia Best Beach 2022 For a place called Misery, it's a little slice of paradise. Little-known Misery Beach, 20 kilometres south of Albany on Western Australia's south coast, has been named the best beach in the country by Tourism Australia. It beat beauty spots including Alexandria Bay on Queensland's Sunshine Coast and The Neck in Tasmania to take the top spot for 2022. Tourism Australia's beach ambassador, Brad Farmer, said Misery Beach was world-class. ""It is a stunning beach,"" he said. ""It just ticks all the boxes of what the typical beachgoer is looking for — uncrowded, crystal-white sand, turquoise waters and a very dramatic granite backdrop. ""Albany is a fascinating place to go exploring for other beautiful beaches in that south-west region."" Mr Farmer said the story of how Misery Beach got its name was one of the compelling reasons for the accolade. A major whaling station operated just two beaches away until 1978. Whale offal would wash ashore, staining the white sand and clear waters blood red. Menang elder Vernice Gilles said during her childhood the beach was not good for swimming due to the whale blood and fat in the water. ""They would dump all the whales' teeth,"" Ms Gilles said. ""I remember walking on the beach and seeing piles and piles of whales' teeth."" Ms Gilles said Misery Beach was historically good for spearing fish and camping. ""When the old warriors were hunting they would drive the kangaroos towards the beach and into the ocean where they could spear and catch them, so that was an important area,"" she said. Two years ago, WA slammed its doors shut and went its own way. Those days may be numbered, despite the state's delayed reopening. The Tourism Australia list has not been without controversy over the years. In 2020 it ranked inland Wagga Beach – 270 kilometres from the New South Wales coast – at in ninth spot. Mr Farmer said many of Australia's famous beaches were ""fatigued and overexposed"". ""I'm really looking at the nooks and crannies and the stories and the communities that make a 'best beach',"" he said. ""People are looking for quirky and out-of-the-box beaches."" Western Australia's hard border had increased interest in the state's beaches, Mr Farmer said. ""The longer you lock us out the more we want to come,"" he said. ""There's a lot of cabin fever and a lot of envy. ""As soon as you open the border, you'll get an onslaught of visitors who love WA's coastline."" While Misery Beach has been relatively unknown nationally until now, Albany's Brad Mostert said he had long been a fan. ""The colour of the beach, the sand and everything — it ticks all the boxes,"" he said. ""There's not much more you could ask for."" Fellow beachgoer and Canadian tourist Cat Wyszomirski agreed. ""(It's) unlike any other beach I've seen,"" she said. ""It's amazing.""

293,How farms have become an oasis for campers looking to escape,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," ABC Rural As pandemic-weary campers leave cities in droves, searching for serenity and space in the bush, farmers are signing up as hosts for an extra source of income. In the grips of a terrible drought that forced them to sell 40 prime milkers to the meatworks, dairy farmer Libby Rough listed with Youcamp to help pay for groceries and school costs. ""We didn't get a milk cheque for three months and friends had come and said, 'You should put this [farm] on a booking system',"" Ms Rough said. They opened Hidden Pocket, named for its private position on the Mary River at Moy Pocket near Kenilworth in the Sunshine Coast hinterland. Just four camping sites have helped turn the farm's fortunes around, earning the family more than $50,000 since American-owned Hipcamp bought out Youcamp in August 2020. Hidden Pocket is booked out months in advance and has twice been nominated for awards. ""We pride ourselves on having a campground where thousands of people are not camping on top of each other,"" Ms Rough said. ""We provide fire pits, we provide kayaks — although I did lose six in the floods — we also provide tyre tubes and so people come here, and they get to relax. ""Occasionally they might get [phone] reception."" Since 2019 the number of people using the camping platform has increased by 450 per cent. ""Hipcamp is essentially a marketplace where we connect landowners, farmers, and their land with people who really want an outdoor experience ... campers, glampers, caravan people,"" Hipcamp general manager James Ho said. ""Ironically, for us, I think we've overall been a net beneficiary of the pandemic; our user base has almost tripled in the last 12 months alone. ""In fact, we've seen this past summer, our biggest summer holiday on the record. Our host base has more than doubled in the last 12 months as well."" For the Rough family, the money has paid for infrastructure that they otherwise could not have afforded, including farm fencing and fixing the road that milk tankers use to access their dairy. ""Those kind of jobs are really essential to our business because you can't have a milk truck driver saying I'm not coming in because the road's not good enough,"" Ms Rough said. When a group of guests, who are required to be fully contained, used the bush as a toilet — Hipcamp followed up on her complaint and charged the campers $300 for the clean-up. ""The [other] reason why we went through Hipcamp is because of insurance; you would be stupid to open your property up to camping without insurance."" An unexpected bonus has been the friendships they have made with return visitors. ""It's been a really, really good thing because we don't get a social life and sometimes Pete will come down and talk to them as well. He says he's not into it, he says [that] it's my thing — but I've caught him talking to people. Anyone who wants to talk about cows,"" she said. The Queensland Farmers' Federation (QFF) has released a discussion paper titled Unlocking Queensland's agritourism potential. It estimated agritourism could be worth up to $4.5 billion a year to the state by 2030 but found the lack of consistent local government planning guidelines were a barrier to farmers wanting to diversify their businesses. It took paramedic Jessica Cunningham and her husband Ryan, a full-time engineer, six months to navigate the red tape required to begin $70,000 worth of renovations on a century-old Queenslander they now lease on Airbnb. ""We kind of probably somewhat naively just thought it'd be a matter of clean up the old girl and start her up,"" Mr Cunningham said. ""But once you sort of start getting into the council side of things and trying to find out the answers to certain questions, it can be a bit of a bit of a process."" Lacey's Creek Homestead and Vineyard has helped make their small grazing property in the foothills of the Great Dividing Range pay for itself. ""It has been absolutely essential. Obviously, the industry's changed over the last 100 years and small farms like ours are really no longer viable on their own,"" Mr Cunningham said. In an age where fewer city dwellers have country cousins, the connections agritourism builds are important. ""For those who are interested, both my wife and I take great pleasure in showing people around the farm and taking them out to the cows,"" Mr Cunningham said. ""Showing them the fireflies down by the creek and taking them up to some of the really nice lookouts, we try and tailor the experience to what our guests are after.""

295,Long haul: Riverland couple revel in dreamboat passion project,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Riverland couple transform old lifeboat into luxurious river cruiser At their home in South Australia's Riverland, James and Sandra Schober are getting on with some renovation work, updating their nearly century-old kitchen. This job was put on hold for several years, while the pair pursued a passion project — transforming a 1960s lifeboat, salvaged from a sea-going ship, into a luxurious river cruiser. For Mr Schober who has spent his life on this stretch of the Murray River, bringing the old boat back to life was a dream project. ""I love the river; was born on it,"" he said. ""We grew up about 400 metres away from the river, so it was pretty much my backyard. ""When I should have been inside the house doing homework, I was probably out there fishing or swimming."" His love of fishing and swimming on the river grew into a love of boats — and a decent collection of tinnies. But Mr Schober saw something special in the old lifeboat. Mr Schober said he had his eye on the 28-foot open-ended lifeboat since he was five years old. The boat was aboard a cattle ship called Qatar in the 1960s. It later found its way to the Port Adelaide dockyards, where it was bought by Waikerie man Bill McClelland at auction. It then sat at Mr McClelland's property until Mr Schober negotiated its sale in exchange for a week of carpentry work. ""I wanted something I could sleep on and cook on,"" Mr Schober said. ""Originally I was just going to put a helm in the middle of it and some running boards around the sides, and some deck chairs and stuff. ""But then I went to Port Adelaide and saw all the big flash boats in the harbour, and I found a factory that actually built the top of the boats. ""That actually changed the whole dimension of the lifeboat."" Transforming the old vessel into a luxurious 35-foot river cruiser took 14 years — all of which has been lovingly documented by his wife. Ms Schober said she was unsurprised that her husband had taken on such an ambitious project. ""James does all sorts of interesting and fun things,"" she said. ""It's been a wonderful journey."" Mr Schober said it was the design of the lifeboat's hull itself that inspired his idea. ""Any boat that you would buy in that size has a big v[-shaped] bottom, designed for the sea, and that gets up on plane,"" he said. ""But this one is just perfect for the river, where we run into sandbars and there's actually no leg to it. ""The bottom of the boat, is the bottom of the rudder, so I can pretty much skim over anything and not get caught."" Many hours of work over many years saw Mr Schober's dream slowly become a reality. In 2008 he decided to build it to survey — a higher standard than recreational boats — and turn it into a river cruise charter business. This meant hiring a naval architect to draw up plans and do regular checks and surveys. ""I reckon I've got about 10 years left in my body for doing building work,"" Mr Schober said. ""So, I just wanted something that was just a bit easier on the body. ""Who wouldn't want to get paid to go cruising on their own boat down the beautiful river that we've got?"" The project was not without its challenges, with the couple agreeing it was like they had added an extra child to their small family. ""Blake, our youngest, was actually born when we started,"" Ms Schober said. ""Those whole 14 years maybe we didn't get to do lots of things like camping with the kids. ""But there are no regrets. We all had a great time. ""The kids really enjoyed going out and seeing what dad was doing ... and helping him where they could as well."" In 2014 the Schobers launched the boat ""Qatar"". The following year they started Rivergum Cruises. These days the couple juggle their carpentry and fruit growing businesses with operating river cruises for tourists and locals on their lovingly restored boat. ""For the first few years we really were only sort of doing one [cruise] a week or one a fortnight when we got group bookings,"" Ms Schober said. ""However, in the last couple of years COVID-19 has sort of been a blessing for us because people are travelling and looking for things to do in their own state. ""So, we've actually been really busy."" We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

296,Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting a step closer to purchasing Great Keppel Island lease,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Paperwork underway for Hancock Prospecting proposed purchase and redevelopment of Great Keppel Island A proposed redevelopment of Great Keppel Island, also known as Woppa, by Gina Rinehart's company Hancock Prospecting is one step closer to going ahead. The once iconic resort off the central coast of Queensland has had many false starts from various companies trying to bring it back to life after it closed in 2008. At the end of October last year, Hancock Prospecting became the latest company to announce it had plans to redevelop the resort on the Island, and that it had begun the process of transferring the lease. At the time the government had not received any information about the sale. But on Friday, Queensland's Department of Resources confirmed it had received applications from GKI Resort Pty Ltd (Tower Holdings) — the company that currently owns the resort's lease — to transfer it to GKI Investments Pty Ltd (Hancock Prospecting). However, in a statement the Department said there were several more steps to undertake before the lease transfer could be finalised. ""An independent financial and managerial capability assessment of the incoming purchaser is required as part of the transfer of the leases,"" it said. ""The Queensland Government is committed to the responsible development of our island resorts for the jobs and business opportunities this creates in regional Queensland. ""[It] has committed $30 million for common-user infrastructure on Great Keppel Island to help support tourism."" In a statement, Hancock Prospecting said that the transaction was subject to conditions being satisfied. ""Including suitable Commonwealth, state and local government approvals being provided that allow viable redevelopment of the island,"" it said. ""Hancock Prospecting's work on these approvals is ongoing and Tower Holdings application to transfer the leases is part of Hancock Prospecting's due diligence process."" Tower Holdings was contacted for comment by the ABC. The application comes after the Woppaburra people were formally recognised as native title holders for the Keppel Islands in December.

297,"NT COVID-19 hospitalisations drop slightly, as daily case numbers double",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The number of people in Territory hospitals with COVID-19 has dropped slightly, although the daily number of new cases has doubled. There are now 72 patients hospitalised with coronavirus across the NT, 10 of whom need oxygen, three of them in the ICU. That is a slight drop from the 78 patients hospitalised with the infection on Monday, although today there is one more person in intensive care. A total of 517 cases were recorded today, up on Monday's figure of 286. Of the 517 new cases, 430 were confirmed using rapid antigen tests. There are now 3,200 active COVID cases in the NT. The number of people in Northern Territory hospitals with COVID-19 has doubled in the past week and tripled in 10 days; but experts say this increase isn't unexpected. Today's case numbers were reported in a media release, with no government ministers available for a press conference. Several lockdowns and lockouts are in place to help stem the spread of coronavirus in vulnerable communities. A lockdown is in place in Milikapiti until January 27, and in Gunyangara, Utopia Homelands and Wurrumiyanga until January 29. The East Arnhem Aboriginal community of Galiwin'kuu will remain in lockdown until at least January 31, with another 31 cases recorded in the community today.

298,Travel agents picket MPs offices over stalled cruise ship industry ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Travel agents picket MPs officers over stalled cruise ship industry Travel operators across the country will picket federal MPs' offices today in a bid to get the travel industry back up and running. Last month the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt, said that ships would be banned from entering Australia until at least February 17. The chief executive of the Gold Coast-based Bob Wood Cruise Group, Jay McKenzie, said uncertainty around the stalled cruise ship industry was crippling her business. ""If we look back to November last year we had Greg Hunt, the federal minister, saying we would have cruise ships back in Australia before Christmas,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, come the middle of December they decided to extend the cruise ban until February 17. ""We have a real concern that within the next three or four weeks they're just going to roll that ban over again."" The Robina-based agent said many different sectors of the travel industry rely on cruising, including booking agents. ""There are companies like mine which is a destination management company,"" she said. ""We look after the various ships when they come into the ports along the Queensland coast and around Australia. ""We've got one of the largest providers of cruise ship entertainers based here. We've got produce growers, wineries, tour guides and they're all based here on the Gold Coast. ""They're all desperate for the industry to restart."" Ms McKenzie said the industry needed a road map to provide certainty so cruise line companies can begin the process of scheduling cruises. ""It takes two to three months to get a cruise ship into Australian waters,"" she said. ""Even if they do say on February 17 that the ban is not going to be extended, we won't see a ship here until the end of May, beginning of June."" During the pandemic travel agencies had access to JobKeeper and targeted grants, but the chief executive of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents (AFTA), Dean Long, said more support was needed. ""What we are looking for is around $230 million to support the travel agents sector and the travel community,"" he said. ""That's broken up into two tranches: One a business support package which will assist in cash flow; the second part will be a skills retention package which is about $100 million to help their businesses re-engage their employees."" Mr Long said Australians are holding more than $8 billion in international travel credits and there was a shortage of agents to process travel arrangements. ""We've lost over 15,000 employees through the first 24 months of this pandemic,"" he said. ""Without additional support we are looking at losing another 10,000."" Annie Ajayi lives on the Gold Coast and worked as a travel agent for more than 18 years, until recently. ""It's just been a roller-coaster ride,"" she said. ""My mortgage kicks back in this month and I've had to take a full-time position outside of travel.""

300,"9,000 tourism jobs lost in Cairns during the pandemic, peak body says",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus Nine thousand tourism jobs – more than half of the local industry's workforce – have been lost in Far North Queensland since the pandemic began, according to the region's peak body. It has been a dire two years for the tropical city of Cairns – known as the home of the Great Barrier Reef and world-heritage listed rainforests – with southern lockdowns and international border closures smashing an industry once worth $2.5 billion annually. Tourism Tropical North Queensland chief executive Mark Olsen said the region's tourism industry employed 15,750 full and part-time staff before the pandemic began. But with the loss of the federal government's JobKeeper program, many workers had been forced to leave the industry for good. ""Without international visitation, we've lost about 9,000 staff over the last 22 months,"" Mr Olsen said. ""At first it was the frontline staff — those on the part-time and casual roles, but as the pandemic extended on, we started losing highly skilled staff. ""Even in the last few weeks, we've seen businesses have to stand down some of their most senior staff because the cash flow is so tight. ""We've lost a lot of skill and experience that has guided the region, which has been one of the most successful tourism destinations, over the last 30 years."" Quarantine-free international travel for the fully-vaccinated into Queensland came into effect on Saturday for the first time since the spread of COVID-19 led to the closure of Australia's border almost two years ago. But an influx of international tourists could be some time away. The federal government is limiting overseas arrivals mainly to returning Australian residents, working visa holidays and international students. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Cairns restaurateur Craig Squire has been serving up modern Australian cuisine since 1994. Normally his waterfront restaurant would operate seven days a week, but he has been forced to cut back due to a lack of staff, many of whom are waiting on COVID-19 test results. He said the normally busy Christmas holiday period had been anything but. ""The first week of January, we had five staff out waiting on test results, so that really put a dampener on what would have been a quite a successful trading week,"" Mr Squire said. ""We had to close for several days because we just didn't have enough staff to operate the business. ""It's been a terrible January — there's big losses."" Mr Squire said one of the biggest impediments to his business had been the mandating of vaccination for those dining in restaurants. ""The concept that the unvaccinated can't go to restaurants and cafes but can go to gyms and hairdressers and food courts, even licensed food courts, it just doesn't stick,"" he said. ""It basically started as a coercive measure to get more people vaccinated — we're at 90 per cent fully vaccinated in Cairns now so surely we can let go of that.

301,"After more than a year of booming tourism in Margaret River, are things slowing down? ",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus There are fears tourism is slowing down in one of WA's premier food and wine regions, with some operators saying it is becoming harder to rely on Perth tourists to prop up the industry. Margaret River is one of many regional towns that has experienced a tourism boom throughout the COVID-19 pandemic as West Australians holidayed at home in lieu of interstate and international travel. However, after the WA Government scrapped plans to re-open the state there are concerns about what the future holds for tourism businesses which had a quieter than expected Christmas. Russell Hogan runs beer and wine tours in Margaret River and said while he saw a big number of visitors tour throughout the pandemic, things were slowing down. ""We've relied on the Perth travellers for the last two years and that's starting to diminish,"" he said. ""We're down about 75 per cent on what we would normally run at this time of the year and over the last three months and I don't see that improving anytime soon until our borders do open up."" He said many of those who spent the summer in the South West did not fork out for tours, instead opting to spend their family time at places like the beach. ""It seems to us that they would not spend as much as they would normally spend through the school holidays, and when they did come down to Margaret River they didn't do anything that was costing them money."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Perth travellers have kept Tony Barugh's tour company alive during the pandemic but he said he was not sure what the future held for businesses like his. ""Perth has really supported Margaret River in a big way. I've been very pleased. I have been able to break even over the past two years,"" he said. ""At the moment it's very quiet. It's like almost winter really at the moment — a few days off here and there and going out with only small numbers."" For some businesses there is a feeling of strong resentment that WA's borders will remain shut indefinitely, but for others there is a sigh of relief. Busselton Margaret River Tourism Association's Sharna Kearney said while plenty of people were still visiting the region, tour operators were experiencing a lull. ""Accommodation providers and hospitality venues would all say that they've been very busy over this period, but tours and attractions and experiences haven't been doing as well as they would normally,"" she said. ""I think there's fatigue from the Perth market. ""They've either done a cave or they've done the Busselton jetty or they've done a wine tour, so they're not as interested in doing it again."" Ms Kearney said as COVID-19 clusters emerged around WA, people were more hesitant to do activities with others. ""I think we're probably in for quite a rocky period in terms of tourism over the next six months,"" she said. Ms Kearney said interstate visitors would be crucial in lifting these businesses up. ""Unless we are able to open those borders at some time in the coming months then it is going to spell the end for those operators,"" she said.

302,Slow going as fuel crisis exasperates Cocos Islands community,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Locals, tourists on remote Cocos Islands exasperated by ongoing fuel crisis Locals and tourists on a remote Australian archipelago say they are frustrated, after the islands ran out of fuel more than a month ago. On December 16 the Cocos (Keeling) Islands community, in the Indian Ocean, was notified the islands had run out of unleaded petrol. The islands are 2,750km north of Perth. The popular tourist destination is expected to receive a fuel delivery on January 29. Activities such as snorkelling, boating, fishing, diving tours and car hire rely on unleaded petrol. Kylie James is the owner and operator of Cocos Island Adventure tours and said the fuel crisis was frustrating. ""Tourists have booked a long way out expecting they're going to come to the island, get their car hire, do a motorised canoe tour, do a fishing charter,"" she said. ""Obviously the fuel shortage means some of these things aren't an option."" She said while some tourists were frustrated, most understood it was out of their control. While the nearby territory of Christmas Island has a diverse economy with phosphate mining and government industries employing the majority of its residents, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands economy is almost completely reliant on tourism. Viva Energy is responsible for the delivery of fuel to Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The company said a series of unfortunate events had led to the fuel shortage. ""The issues that led to the stock-out include urgent and unexpected maintenance of tankage used to supply fuel to the island,"" they said. As a result, only one of two tanks were available for the pre-Christmas delivery of fuel to Cocos (Keeling) Islands. A Viva Energy spokesperson said a review of unleaded fuel stock at the end of November showed there was sufficient fuel on the island, and they expected the stock to last until the end of December. ""Much higher-than-normal demand, coupled with the tank outage, stripped the stocks in just a few weeks,"" they said. A fuel delivery was expected on December 28 but was delayed by a month. The company said issues which led to the delay include congestion at Fremantle Port and weather. ""This is a very unusual situation,"" the company said. ""Viva Energy has taken concrete steps to investigate the issue and is planning to hold additional contingency stock on the island."" The volume of fuel to be delivered has also been increased. Kaylene Krause, a local accommodation provider, said she had heard from many guests that they were disappointed by the fuel shortage, having paid a lot of money to get to the tropical islands. ""To get to Cocos Keeling Islands and then to have their car hire cancelled, or boat tour cancelled ... and the only other way to get around the island is by bicycle,"" she said. ""It's put immense pressure on all CKI operators, some more than others who are losing big dollars with this situation."" According to a 2020 review of tourism on Cocos (Keeling) Islands, there are 547 people who live on the island, with roughly 2,500 people visiting the island each year. A fuel shortage is not the only problem facing the island with the delay of cargo ships carrying non-perishable food, flight cancellations and Australia Post express mail taking up to five weeks for delivery. ""It really is quite staggering especially that Christmas Island gets so much more services to their island,"" Ms Krause said. Fi Barker recently visited Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island with her family and friends. She said the island was paradise. The reason the family visited Cocos (Keeling) Islands was the dream of catching a prized fish. ""Part of the reason going to the two islands is dogtooth tuna; it's the ultimate pinnacle for a free diver,"" Ms Barker said. ""You need to be diving to 30 metres consistently; so you need to be a very competent free diver."" A month before their trip, they tried to hire a boat. ""We talked to lots of different providers on the island and they all said, 'Sorry we're not operating' or 'I've actually left the island because I can't run my business because we've run out of fuel',"" she said. The family got creative to try and get out on a boat and scrounge some fuel. ""But we didn't want to pursue this too hard, because these locals have lost their livelihood because of this fuel crisis,"" Mrs Barker said. She said she would visit the island again and try to catch a dogtooth tuna. Ms James said one of the greatest things to come out of the fuel crisis was the community coming together. ""We've had people come out of the woodwork with little bits of pieces of fuel they've had that they've been able to spare, and they've said, 'This is to get through one of your canoe tours',"" she said. With diesel fuel cars still able to operate, the community have been ferrying guests around the island. ""While it's been an inconvenience, the local people on the island have really tried to mitigate it all by offering more services so people can get around better,"" Ms James said.

303,Border Force stops you for a search and wants your phone — what can you do?,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Border Force asks to search your phone when you are travelling back to Australia — what can you do? As Australians travel overseas again, with COVID-19 border restrictions easing, on the way home they could be stopped by Australian Border Force (ABF) officials for a search of their belongings. Say Border Force officials want to search your phone, and take it into another room while they do so — can you refuse? Yes, according to both an ABF spokesperson and a lawyer, but that could lead to you being detained. The ABF spokesperson says individuals can refuse to comply with a request for an examination of an electronic device, but you might be ""referred for further law enforcement action"". Daniel Hannay, director of Hannay Lawyers, said if you refused a search, the ABF had the power to detain you and then search those items. The agency has powers to examine any goods at the border, including electronic documents and photos on mobile phones and other personal devices, the ABF spokesperson said. ""ABF officers may question travellers and examine goods if they suspect the person or goods may be of interest for immigration, customs, biosecurity, health, law enforcement or national security reasons,"" the spokesperson said. When it comes to being stopped and searched at the airport, are there certain things customs officers can and can't look at, like laptops or USB sticks? ""Information seized from passengers' phones has contributed to the success of many domestic law enforcement operations targeting illegal activities. ""The ABF exercises its functions and powers at the border in order to protect the Australian community and deliver its mission to enable legitimate travel and trade."" The spokesperson said if a passenger had any concerns about questioning or examination, they were entitled to raise these with the officer or their supervisor at the time of questioning and could provide feedback through the Department of Home Affairs website. ""All complaints are acknowledged, taken seriously and, where necessary, investigated,"" the spokesperson said. After examining an item, ABF officers may copy a document where they are satisfied it could contain information about prohibited goods, an offence against the Customs Act, or a security matter. A document is considered to include information stored on mobile phones, SIM cards, laptops, personal electronic recording apparatus and computers. There is no requirement for a person to be present when a document, such as one on your phone, is being copied. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Mr Hannay said after the search, if you're let through, you could later ask the ABF to delete the data stored. ""You can make an application and apply to Customs to have whatever has been extracted, deleted,"" he said. ""If they search, if there's a reasonable suspicion, and then you're allowed through, well then the basis of that would be that they found nothing on there that's subject to Customs' control or a breach of an offence under the Crimes Act. ""If it's the case, that it is a seize and search, and then they search those items and there's something on there that they think amounts to an offence on the Crimes Act, then they will keep those items. ""The reality is [in that case] that you'll most likely be charged with an offence under the Crimes Act or one of the Customs Act or Duties Act by the Australian Federal Police."" Mr Hannay said it then became a question of whether or not you wanted to defend those charges later in court. Mr Hannay said any Commonwealth agency had the power to access that data, and they had the power to provide it to a state agency.

304,Have you ever felt rain on a clear day? It might have been cicada pee,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Isolated water droplets coming from trees could be cicada 'rain', otherwise known as pee Sitting under a tree at Galvins Gorge on an epic Gibb River Road journey through Western Australia's Kimberley region, Broome resident Gus Levitzke and his friends felt water droplets start to fall on them. There's a good reason the Kimberley's dry season is named as such, as there's virtually no rain from April to September, so the group suspected it might be spray from the nearby waterfall. ""We thought, 'How's the waterfall getting all the way over here,"" Mr Levitzke said. ""Then we looked up and we couldn't see any water coming out of the rocks, but it was coming from the trees and then we noticed it was coming from bugs, a lot of cicadas actually, each squirting out one at a time."" Mr Levitzke said his initial reaction was ""a lot of disgust and a bit of confusion"" as the group started throwing out theories. ""There were jokes about excrement, or mating calls or a mating dance, perhaps,"" he said. ""You don't really know about these things do you?"" It was days before they reached reception and were able to research exactly what the cicadas were spraying down on them. ""We had our suspicions and we kind of just joked about it for a few days and then when we got back to Derby we figured it out and yeah, [there was] a bit more disgust,"" Mr Levitzke said. ""It was wee, it was bug wee."" Mr Levitzke said he's told the story at parties for a laugh, and most people hadn't heard of the phenomenon known as ""cicada rain"". But the curator of entomology at the Western Australian Museum, Nikolai Tatarnic, said with 348 species found all over Australia, more people would have been peed on by cicadas than they would likely care to admit. ""If it's the heat of summer and there's a lot of singing going on and you're under a tall tree, there's a good chance there'll be cicadas up there weeing down on people,"" Dr Tatarnic said. Cicadas are from the Hemiptera order, otherwise known as ""true bugs"", comprised of 80,000 species which all have sucking mouth parts and mostly feed on tree sap. According to Dr Tatarnic, while other true bugs urinate what is referred to as honeydew, named for its sweetness, cicadas were the only bug which create a rain-like experience for those caught below them. He said cicadas were particularly partial to the water excreted from tree leaves which they have to drink a lot of to derive a little bit of nutrients, with the excess water excreted as urine. Dr Tatarnic said cicadas thrive in hot weather, using the tree sap to stay cool. ""Cicadas are tiny little animals; they don't sweat like we do, they can't cool off, they don't have air conditioning, so instead they have to pass a lot of fluid through their body,"" he said. ""They're constantly passing a stream of liquid through them so they can stay up in the tree and keep singing for a mate."" Cicadas aren't just unique for the ""rain"" they produce; they also have unusual life cycles. They spend most of their life underground as larvae, feeding on plant roots then emerging en masse only to survive for a matter of weeks above ground. For periodic cicadas, this weirdly always happens on a prime number. ""You might have three-year cicadas or five-year cicadas or seven-year cicadas and in North America there's a 17-year cicada,"" Dr Tatarnic said. He said the evolutionary explanation for the strange gestational periods was that it made it hard for predators to predict when they could have their next cicada feast. ""It's not a prey source you can predict and it's not worth learning what that cicada sounds like or where to be for them,"" Dr Tatarnic said. As for cicada rain, Mr Levitzke's advice for those who get caught in a downpour is to embrace it. ""Just go with it; you're in the Kimberley now and it's all part of it,"" he said.

305,Ebony bought a house in WA. But she can't get into the state,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  It was supposed to be the start of a new chapter, but instead of joining their belongings in Western Australia, Ebony Anderson and Eurwyn Jones have been left stranded in Darwin. The bulk of their possessions were collected by movers on January 19, the day before WA Premier Mark McGowan announced its border reopening would be delayed indefinitely. Ms Anderson, who is 20 weeks pregnant with the couple's first child, said her stomach dropped watching the announcement late Thursday night. ""You just feel sick, it's horrible and it's frustrating,"" she said. The couple has been planning to move back to WA since March 2021 and have been forced to change and re-change their plans several times as WA's borders tightened against the NT. All Ms Anderson's family live in WA and they want to raise their kids on the west coast. They've bought a house in Perth, which settles on February 18, but now it doesn't look likely they'll be able to pick up the keys. Ms Anderson and Mr Jones have applied for a G2G pass for the two of them, hoping to enter WA via SA in the next few weeks. For now, Ms Anderson said they're ""living out of a suitcase"" in a friend's apartment as their previous leave had expired. The couple, who are travelling with their dogs Maisy and Dobbi, need to drive to WA because their pets can't fly into Perth. Premier Mark McGowan warns further restrictions will be considered as Western Australia reviews the impact on the Omicron COVID-19 variant in the eastern states. Originally, Ms Anderson was hoping they could drive into Kununurra, but under WA's new border rules this entry point was only for ""transport, freight and logistics and border community residents"". This means that, if approved, they've had to drive 3,500kms down the centre of Australia before quarantining in a safe location in WA. If they don't get their application to enter WA approved, Ms Anderson said they ""would essentially be homeless"". Then Friday threw another curveball at the couple: Ms Anderson tested positive to COVID-19, which means they now must wait for her to recover. Ms Anderson said she has booked doctor's appointments in Perth, which will now have to be delayed or rescheduled in Darwin. ""I feel like a ticking time bomb, all I want to do is get into my new home,"" she said. ""I should be nesting right now and making my house a home, reuniting with my family."" Despite the ongoing uncertainty, Ms Anderson said she felt fortunate that she was able to see her family six months ago. Her fiance Mr Jones, who is from the UK, hasn't been able to see his family for nearly four years. ""I don't want to complain, I feel like so many people have been torn apart from their families for so much longer,"" Ms Anderson. ""I have to stay positive; I don't have a choice."" The Northern Territory's Chief Health Officer says the peak of its current COVID-19 outbreak may be here in just two weeks, urging people, until then, to socialise in small groups and take care when travelling. NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner said he ""understood"" the WA Premier's motivation in delaying the reopening of its borders. ""If Mark [McGowan] feels that WA is not ready, I can completely understand the decision,"" he said. ""WA has to make the best decision for them and their health system and to make sure they can cope with [coronavirus]."" Mr Gunner said eventually, all jurisdictions would need to learn to live with COVID. ""COVID is globally endemic and we are going to have to manage COVID [but] the point is to be able to [open borders] where your health system can cope with it,"" he said.

306,Planning a holiday overseas? Don't count on getting much help,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Queensland travel agent warns of staff shortages as quarantine-free travel opens A veteran Queensland travel agent is warning of a looming ""supply crunch"" as agents struggle to meet the demand from the high number of people planning an overseas holiday. From 1am today, quarantine-free international travel into Queensland for fully vaccinated people resumed. Travellers will not have to quarantine, provided they are fully vaccinated and have a negative COVID-19 rapid antigen test (RAT) result within 24 hours of entering the country. The principal of Main Beach Travel on the Gold Coast, Mike Dwyer, said one in three travel agencies had closed since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020. ""For a business like ours, we had a team of 32 people and we've lost almost half of our team,"" he said. ""We're already struggling to service existing demand which is really just the tip of the iceberg."" The industry veteran said people who wanted to travel overseas needed to start thinking about it sooner rather than later. ""About half of our incoming calls are from travellers who are stranded overseas needing help to reorganise their flights home,"" Mr Dwyer said. ""I am really concerned about our industry and the lack of travel agencies and the lack of support for the industry. ""As the demand ramps up, we are going to hit a supply crunch, because there's not enough agents to help people make their plans."" Mr Dwyer opened his business in 2000 and said his focus is on servicing outbound travellers. ""There's a huge pent-up demand,"" he said. ""Aussies have always been great travellers and many people have had their plans cancelled over the last two years. ""There's lots of people with family in Europe who they haven't seen for two years."" The travel business owner said quarantine-free travel would now give more people the confidence to book a holiday. ""One of the biggest impediments for travelling overseas has been the fear of coming home and quarantining for two weeks,"" he said. ""Removing that restriction makes it a lot better for people wanting to get overseas. ""I think people have lost faith in the consistency of the rules so there will be a lot of nervousness still."" Mr Dwyer said COVID-related challenges meant more people were choosing to book through a travel agent rather than handle the bookings themselves. ""We already have people travelling and what we know is it is much more complex than it was previously,"" he said. ""Every country has its own set of rules and regulations. ""On top of that, the airlines have specific requirements about being tested either 24 or 48 hours before a flight."" When it comes to inbound travel, the chief executive of Queensland Airports, Chris Mills, said he was expecting a trickle, and not a flood, of international travellers to arrive in tourist destinations including the Gold Coast. ""It's going to happen, but it's not going to happen this month,"" he said. ""What we're expecting [is] from February onwards; we're working with the airlines to get them back on restoring connections with countries that are in pretty good shape.""

307,Life plans dashed and people left homeless as WA border change causes travel chaos,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Molly Richter was all set for her new life with her fiance in Western Australia. Now, an 11th-hour decision by Western Australia to keep its border closed has left her stranded in Sydney with just a suitcase and no home. The decision has created chaos for tens of thousands of people who were expected to arrive in WA from February 5 onwards. American woman Ms Richter, 43, fell in love with her fiance Paul Woolerton six years ago. Premier Mark McGowan warns further restrictions will be considered as Western Australia reviews the impact on the Omicron COVID-19 variant in the eastern states. They have sustained a relationship across international borders, visiting each other and staying in touch constantly online. In 2017, Mr Woolerton proposed to her on Rockingham Beach in Perth's south, and she was booked to leave for Australia back in July 2020. A year and a half later, she has only now been able to get a flight into Australia, and she could only go via Sydney. An earlier direct flight to Perth was cancelled back in October. Australia has only recently opened its international borders, but Mr Woolerton's home state of WA stayed resolutely closed to the rest of the country and world. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Premier Mark McGowan had set an opening date of February 5, but last night he announced that had been suspended indefinitely. ""I've sold my car, I've broken my apartment lease, I quit my job,"" Ms Richter said. ""Everything I own is either in my house with my partner in Perth, or in this room and my suitcases with me, and on February 5 by booking here at this rental unit ends. ""Where am I supposed to go? I don't know anybody in Sydney."" Ms Richter, who flew to Sydney from her home state of Colorado, said she had tried to obtain an exemption with a G2G pass, but the app the WA government uses to approve entry to the state for essential workers or on compassionate grounds had not been updated. Mr McGowan said last night there would be exemptions for ""returning West Australians with strong recent connections or direct legitimate family connections in WA"". Western Australia once again has been left indefinitely closed off to the rest of the world. How did it come to this, and where do we go from here? While Ms Richter's visa into Australia has been approved, she does not know if the WA government will recognise it as confirmation of the legitimacy of her relationship with her fiance. She is pleading with the government to show leniency. ""I followed the instructions, I waited until the promised date and I based everything on the promise,"" she said. ""My partner is working in Perth and providing the income for the one house we have there, and it's not sustainable for us financially or mentally for me to be stuck in Sydney. ""I have nothing and no-one in Sydney."" Her fiance Mr Woolerton said being West Australian right now felt ""a bit shameful,"" given how the situation was being portrayed. He urged the government to apply compassion when deciding on exemption criteria. ""Compassion goes a long way,"" he said. ""I understand [the Premier] doesn't want holiday makers here … that's not what we're actually after. ""We're actually just trying to put our family back together."" Pam Nicholas and her husband had been planning on moving from Seaford in Victoria to WA. She moved east five years ago to live with one of her daughters, but before that had spent 30 years in Western Australia. ""We've been wanting to go back to WA for a while, and when we heard that the border was reopening we pushed forward with the sale of our house. We've sold our house, we bought a house unseen in Mandurah,"" she told ABC News Breakfast. ""I'm in a room full of boxes and bubble wrap. ""We're ready to go, the cat's been sorted out, the flight and her cattery and injections all done."" The Premier's plan to reopen the state on February 5 lies in ruins, and there's a risk the backflip could weaken public goodwill — the key to WA's COVID-19 strategy, writes Jacob Kagi. Ms Nicholas said she and her husband had both received booster doses and had been as cautious as possible. But she said it was unclear at this stage whether they would be covered by the new expanded exemptions. ""We don't know … it's this uncertainty,"" she said. ""I think Mark McGowan's done a fabulous job in WA protecting people, but it's Omicron."" Flight Centre chief executive Graham Turner told ABC Perth the company had put off legal action against the WA government when it announced the February 5 opening date. Now they are reconsidering. “We’re certainly talking to our constitutional legal team in Melbourne,” Mr Turner said. “We put it off because the Premier told us categorically, at least I thought it was categorically, that the border would open on February 5. “It is disappointing, and we will reconsider, but we will probably wait until he announces a new date.” While travellers have been left frustrated, others have expressed support for the border decision. Sarah Davies has Ehlers Danlos syndrome, a genetic disorder of the connective tissues. They are more medically vulnerable to COVID-19 and Mx Davies said they would have to isolate indefinitely once the borders open. Mx Davies said people in the disabled and medically vulnerable community had been very nervous as the border opening would have a large impact. Epidemiologist Catherine Bennett says community cases already occurring in Perth might mean the spread of Omicron will determine when WA can reopen. ""It would mean we would have to go into self-imposed lockdown for months and months and face losing our family members and some of us face dying,"" they said. Mx Davies did not think the borders should stay closed indefinitely. ""I’m very relieved that we're able to put some extra time and money into building up our hospitals, and getting everyone onto that third booster dose, so we're reducing the pool of people that COVID can move among,"" they said. ""If we look at what’s happening over east, people are dying … I don’t think it’s a sacrifice we need to make. ""I really think our government needs to value all of us, not just the people who can afford to go buy the medicines, the RAT tests, and that’s what I see Mark McGowan doing — keeping a promise to keep us safe."" She said she trusted the Premier to ensure families were not separated because access via compassionate grounds had been expanded.

308,"Lockdowns, record heat won't stop this German retiree from walking around the world",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  COVID lockdowns, record heat won't stop German retiree Kuno Penner walking around the world Jakob Penner, or Kuno as he is better known, has become a bit of a social media star. The German retiree left his home five years ago, armed with only a small cart of supplies and a goal to walk around the world. ""I think everybody would like to see the world and I just do it,"" he said. ""Most people when they are retired, and they think they are old and weak and cannot move and they are sitting at home, watching TV — I don't like it, I would like to see the world."" Mr Penner has crossed 25 countries covering 41,000 kilometres from Germany through much of Europe, the Middle East, India, and South-East Asia. In February 2020, just before the world closed down due to the pandemic, Mr Penner planned to spend three months walking from Cairns to Sydney. He found himself locked down in a friend's house in Brisbane, where he applied for an extension to his visa. His next plan to walk to Melbourne and then fly to New Zealand was again impacted by lockdowns. With another visa extension, he has walked all around the east coast, down to Tasmania and then across the Nullarbor into Western Australia. Last week, Mr Penner found himself in the middle of the Pilbara's record-breaking heat. ""Never I have seen 50 degrees. I was on the road, just north of Carnarvon, near the Minilya Roadhouse,"" he said. The sleepy beachside town of Onslow reached 50.7 degrees Celsius last week, while many other Pilbara towns sweltered through their own record-breaking temperatures. Mr Penner said when it was hot, he had to take extra precautions. ""I have a long rest in the hottest hours of the day, between two and five o'clock was the hottest. I have a piece of plastic to make a shadow and I rest,"" he said. Mr Penner said the people he had met during his travels around Australia had stood out to him the most. ""It is the kindness of the people, they ask me 'Do you need anything, can we help?'"" he said. ""If I would see an old man with a grey beard going across maybe the Nullarbor, I would ask him if he's crazy, does he know what he's doing, if he has enough water, if he has enough food. ""If not, it can be very dangerous. I think we have a responsibility about other people."" Mr Penner is taking a short break in the Pilbara to get repairs done to his cart before he completes the journey across the top end of Australia, weather permitting. He has six months to be back in Cairns before he finally makes it across to New Zealand.

309,"live: Sydney news: Union says Qantas deal could slash wages in half, unqualified doctor sentenced",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Sydney news: Union says Qantas deal could slash staff wages in half Here's what you need to know today: The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has accused Qantas of trying to ""force through"" a deal that could slash wages by 50 per cent for staff. The airline filed an application to the Fair Work Commission to terminate its enterprise agreement with long haul cabin crew. It said the move was a ""last resort to change restrictive and outdated rostering processes"" after a negotiation process with international flight crew. Australian Council of Trade Unions president Michele O'Neil said some staff could lose half their pay if the application is approved. ""If the company succeeds in terminating the agreement, then it permanently rips up their current paying conditions that have been negotiated over many years,"" she said. Qantas said it was taking the necessary steps to restart the international travel network in a post-COVID world. A woman who was not qualified to practice medicine but worked more than 100 shifts at a Sydney hospital has been sentenced to serve a two-year jail sentence in the community. A Sydney court heard Zhi Sin Lee failed her Doctor of Medicine degree at the University of NSW in 2020. However, she still accepted a role as a medical intern last year at Bankstown-Lidcombe Hospital in south-west Sydney. She worked 126 shifts between January and August before the hospital terminated her employment after it was revealed she was not registered. The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency charged Ms Lee with falsely claiming to be qualified to practise. She pleaded guilty in November, and on Thursday at the Sydney Downing Centre, she was sentenced to two years' imprisonment to be served in the community, and fined $10,000. Ms Lee will also pay the health regulator's legal costs. Strike Force Walumil has been formed to investigate the death of a baby boy whose body was found in a freezer. Police officers were called to a home in Corowa, a border town suburb west of Albury, after concerns were raised for the welfare of a three-month-old boy. They searched the home and found the baby's body wrapped in plastic inside the freezer. The home was declared a crime scene and is being forensically examined. A 40-year-old woman was arrested. She has since been released from custody. NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Mick Willing has left the force after more than 30 years on the job. Mr Willing was one of three contenders for the recently-filled commissioner position, which was taken by Karen Webb. Acting Commissioner Webb informed colleagues of Mr Willing's departure on Thursday afternoon, in a brief email. ""I wish to advise Deputy Commissioner Michael Willing APM served his last day with the New South Wales Police Force, Wednesday 19 January 2022,"" she wrote. ""I'd like to take this opportunity to wish Mick and his family all the best in their future endeavours, and thank him for his service."" Mr Willing, the former head of the homicide and terrorism squads, was tipped as the favourite to succeed former commissioner Mick Fuller under the premiership of Gladys Berejiklian. But last month, Premier Dominic Perrottet chose to appoint Ms Webb, who will be officially sworn in next month.

310,From accommodation to navigation — caravan hosts hit the road,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  When Catherine and Brett Hein took over as operators of a Renmark caravan park three-and-a-half years ago, never could they have envisaged the journey they were about to take. They experienced the height of the interstate grey nomad travel boom and the challenges of closed borders and COVID restrictions. Despite this, what is clear is that the Hein family have left a lasting imprint on the local community and travellers alike. After previous ventures in park management along the Great Ocean Road at Wye River, Halls Gap in the Grampians and the Hopkins River in Warrnambool, the Heins decided it was time for a new adventure in their home state. ""We loved the river, loved the Riverland; the whole region is a beautiful place to live and to visit,"" Ms Hein said. ""It was just a really great experience for the family"" she said. In the heart of the Riverland, the park is a comfortable 24 kilometres from the Victorian border and is a mainstay for interstate travellers. ""People from all the eastern states; people from Western Australia, the Northern Territory, would all pass through,"" Ms Hein said. But like many tourism operators across South Australia, managing the ever-changing market due to the pandemic was a challenge. ""You have all the angst with so many people travelling that all of a sudden can't get across the border,"" Ms Hein said. ""[The challenge was] having to adapt and invent new things to really look after the people from your own state."" In 2020 and 2021, the couple hosted a camp oven festival, celebrating the wholesome camp-side tradition with a cook-off competition for best damper, best mains and best dessert. Meanwhile, Mr Hein took to social media daily, sharing serene river scenes, sunrises and sunsets to engage their clientele who could not yet make the trip over. When the pair announced they were sailing ship from the Riverland to begin a new adventure in the Barossa region, they sparked a rush of well wishes from enamoured guests and locals. Folks from far and wide wished them all the best on their new journey, thanking them for their unwavering hospitality, and congratulating them for being great ambassadors for the region. ""It was so beautiful,"" Ms Hein said. ""When you are somewhere primarily for work, you don't feel like people notice your value,"" she said. ""The outpouring of support and so many people saying how much they'll miss (Brett's) photos every morning is really, really heartwarming."" Packing into their newly renovated 1976 Quest caravan, the Hein family are now ready to switch roles and explore Australia, this time as holiday-makers themselves. ""We'd like to go to Port Lincoln ... we love it down there,"" Ms Hein said. ""Possibly head to Warrnambool ... we've only been back once since we left there,"" she said. And while they will no longer be living and working at their beloved Riverland caravan park, this is certainly not the last they have seen of it. ""We're planning a trip up on the March long weekend,"" Ms Hein said. ""So, we're taking our little retro van that we've done up ... and actually get to stay in the park as visitors,"" she said. ""... overlooking the lagoon, watching the birds, maybe see a koala."" ""I'm really looking forward to that."" ABC Riverland will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday.

311,From Colombia to Carnarvon: Meet the coffee roaster inspired by a cycling trip,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  How a honeymoon cycling trip across South America inspired a northern WA coffee roastery When you travel to a regional town, do you expect to find decent, locally roasted coffee? If you enjoy coffee that tastes of something other than the bitter grittiness of tinned coffee, you might be relieved to learn that there is someone between Perth and Broome who roasts the beans locally. Over the past few years, Donna Cuthbert has been busy raising her two kids and experimenting with roasting coffee beans from her home in Carnarvon, which is a 10-hour drive north of Perth. Now, the uniquely flavoured coffee can be seen in cafes along WA's Ningaloo coastline. The idea to bring exotic coffee flavours into the coffee cups of people in regional WA was inspired by a cycling trip through Central and South America. On their extended honeymoon in 2015, Donna and her husband, Nick, spent more than a year cycling through some of the world's most famous coffee-growing regions. ""The majority of the farms that we went through and stayed at were coffee-growing farms, or at least somehow connected to the coffee industry. So it really opened our eyes, and we're really big coffee drinkers,"" Ms Cuthbert said. ""You can't even go five minutes in Colombia without being offered an espresso."" When she first started importing coffee from South America, Ms Cuthbert experimented with 50-gram batches at a time, using a popcorn machine in her kitchen. It did not take long for the word to spread about the creative coffee flavours Ms Cuthbert was able to bring out through her home-roasting experiment. ""I didn't go into it on the first day thinking this was going to be my business; it was actually a hobby. And then it grew into it, it was kind of an organic growth,"" she said. ""But I never really thought that it would get this big."" The coffee beans are now roasted in a shiny new machine that allows for larger quantity batches to keep up with the demand for her signature blends. According to Ms Cuthbert, it was the hole in the market and the lack of availability of specialty coffee in regional areas that allowed her business to grow organically from the ground up. ""Roasting coffee is all in the senses … you can hear and smell when the beans are ready. It's all part of the art of roasting,"" she said. ""What I love is being able to give people something different, something really vibrant, tasty and fresh … with a lot of flavour. ""And I think it surprises people that they can get that in a regional area.""

312,"Uncertain but optimistic, international students return after two years locked out",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus After more than a year stuck in his home country of Nepal, waiting, frustrated, for Australia to reopen its borders, Sushan Khatiwada has finally touched down in Darwin to resume his studies. The international student spent the past pandemic year studying his Charles Darwin University course online, paying fees but missing out on what he was sorely hoping for: ""university life"". ""The reason why I chose Australia — and I chose Darwin and I wanted to come to this university — was to experience the diversity, because there are students here from different nationalities, different cultures,"" he said. ""But, when I was studying online, I missed all of this."" Mr Khatiwada enters an Australia still tackling surges in COVID-19 cases, but with a federal government seemingly far more ready to reach out to its international students than when the pandemic began. Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday announced foreign students and backpackers who arrived in the next two months would be eligible for rebates to their visa fees, a saving of more than $600. ""That's great news,"" Mr Khatiwada said. ""Because those who have been studying online for like one semester, two semesters, have been paying a lot of fees and other things. ""So, even though the rebate visa fee is [only] like $600, it means a lot to many students … to get that rebate is definitely helpful."" In 2020, the Morrison Government received heavy criticism for not offering immediate assistance to foreign students who lost their jobs due to COVID-induced industry lockdowns. In some cases, students had been forced to join soup-kitchen queues just to keep food on the table. Spanish national Macarena Santos, a teaching student at Charles Darwin University, applauded the Commonwealth's move to waive fees ""if this was the first step of future steps"". ""It's good, of course. It shows they are thinking a little bit about international students,"" she said. ""But, there are so many things … like making sure we have access to health and food and things like that. If we cannot work, that we [still] have access to the basic things. ""And not only the basic things, but to thrive as students, to have the best experience possible."" In the coming weeks, more than 130 new and returning international students are expected to touch down in the Northern Territory to prepare for their studies to resume. Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Students Sam Jacob said that, with Omicron cases climbing, there was no guarantee those beginning their studies would be able to access face-to-face education come March. ""I think you'll find that students are just relieved to be back and in a community that welcomes them, in and around the university, even if some of their classes are online and some are on-campus,"" she said. In an attempt to help prop up a number of industries facing worker shortages, the federal government will provide a fee rebate to any students or backpackers who come back to Australia in the next few months. Ms Jacob also welcomed Mr Morrison's new pledges to foreign students, but said she hoped ""we don't revisit any of those times where perhaps messages were blunt or uncaring"". ""I think international students have been very forgiving of the pandemic and its impact and all of the last-minute decisions that had to be made in a rush [by] a whole lot of people who didn't have experience in pandemic management,"" Ms Jacob said. ""We're two years in now. We have a more mature message from the government. We have a better relationship with the key people we need to."" The university said this year's intake of international students to the Northern Territory included people from India, Nepal, Pakistan, China, Canada and the United Kingdom.

313,Green light to expand world-first wave pool into Queensland tourism hub,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Surf Lakes gets green light to expand Yeppoon wave pool into tourism hub A world-first wave pool in regional Queensland is one step closer to becoming the state's next surfing mecca. The Surf Lakes site sits inland from Yeppoon and already has rave reviews from pro surfers, including Mark Occhilupo, who have been testing the technology since 2018. The next big break for the central Queensland site is expansion into a tourism hotspot with the company's development application, including glamping sites and restaurants, this week approved by Livingstone Council. It is a surreal achievement for Surf Lakes founder and chief executive Aaron Trevis, who grew up in Yeppoon and learnt to surf at Farnborough Beach. ""I'm really thrilled,"" he said. ""It's great to have that started in my hometown. ""I'm currently over in the US talking to licensees over here and it's quite satisfying that we launched it in Yeppoon and we're taking Aussie waves to the world."" Mr Trevis expects between 100,000 and 300,000 visitors annually to the tourist park once it is up and running, which would make it one of the biggest tourism attractions in central Queensland. Although Surf Lakes has multiple projects across the globe, Yeppoon's tourism facility is the first to get all the relevant approvals to open commercially. Now approvals for stage one are in place, Mr Trevis and his team are looking at the feasibility of re-building the wave pool prototype versus upgrading it — which would take less time. ""[The wave pool] needs a new liner, the machine needs to be upgraded, there's no entrance facilities. A whole range of things that need to happen,"" he said. Mr Trevis said Surf Lakes is also trying to find partners willing to invest. ""We've proven the technology, but the machine was only ever built as a prototype, so it needs a lot of work to be reliable as a commercial unit,"" he said. Stage one of the development, which has been approved, includes camping and glamping sites, cabins, a restaurant, a learn to surf lagoon, skate park, scuba pool, and solar farm. Stage two will expand accommodation to include a boutique hotel, aqua park, and village green. Mr Trevis joked that ""not everyone wants to camp under their surfboard like I'm willing to do to get a good wave"", so there will be a range of options to stay on site. Eventually there will be 52 cabins, 100 caravan or camp sites, and a 75-bed boutique hotel. Mr Trevis can not put a date on when work will start but said locals could expect to see some movement at the site in coming months. Livingstone Shire Mayor Andy Ireland said the development would put the Capricorn Coast ""on the national and international map for world-class tourism facilities"". Cr Ireland said one of the most appealing aspects of the proposal was the inclusion of a solar farm, reducing its environmental footprint. ""We certainly encourage development, encourage progress, but we're also conscious of the pristine environment we live in,"" he said.

314,'Nervous' visitors holiday with 'a bit of fear' as cancellations continue in NSW,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Accommodation providers from popular tourist destinations on the NSW South Coast say cancellations are skyrocketing and visitors are keeping to themselves. With more than one million Australians now having had COVID businesses relying on summer trade are doing it tough due to isolation requirements for staff and customers. Tathra Beachside managing director Carmen Risby said the holiday park was dealing with cancellations every day. ""We are getting people packing up in the middle of the night because somebody had a symptom on their campsite,"" she said. ""They're just so nervous they don't even wait for a test — they just leave."" It is a familiar story — as Greater Sydney and the ACT went into lockdown last year, a wave of cancellations were felt by businesses in popular tourism destinations like the Snowy Mountains. ""We already knew that we weren't going to be making much money this year because we were looking after people who had cancelled a year prior,"" Ms Risby said. ""More than 50 per cent of the people that are here are on credit transfers from the year before or the year before that."" CHOICE travel expert Jodi Bird said while most businesses had improved their cancellation policies in recent months, there was still some confusion among customers as to whether they were entitled to a credit or refund. ""We're not seeing it to the same extent as we did [during lockdown], but there are still people struggling with what to do,"" he said. ""It's always a very unique circumstance where you might have COVID or you might have to isolate, whereas before there was just a blanket [travel] ban."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Despite hundreds of cancellations ahead of Christmas, Tathra Beachside is nearly full — but Ms Risby said you would not know 500 people were staying at the park. ""It's [usually] about making connections and having lots of fun or meeting new people,"" she said. ""But this year has not been like that. ""It has been families keeping to themselves and people keeping in their own groups."" Ms Risby said the caution around COVID-19 was impacting local businesses, which were seeing a lot less foot traffic than usual. ""They're going out to dinner much less, they're going out to coffees much less,"" she said. ""People are holidaying with a bit of fear in the back of their mind."" Another factor causing stress among businesses are the staff shortages being felt across Australia. Australian Regional Tourism chair Coralie Bell, from the Shoalhaven, said the impact on businesses was worrying, particularly in regional areas. ""What we're seeing is that operators are getting burnt out and pretty exhausted,"" she said. ""I absolutely am worried about the longevity of these businesses — that they absolutely won't make it through winter.""

315,Decommissioning of dam wall at Imperial Lake begins with push for recreation area re-use,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Imperial Lake's dam wall decommissioning begins, long-running push for recreation area continues Essential Water says it has begun decommissioning the dam wall at Imperial Lake, near Broken Hill, with the company open to hearing from anyone about its future use once works are completed. The company said the lake's dam wall had been deemed ""high risk"" by the Dam Safety Committee and that they could either repair or decommission it. It previously stated that repairs would cost between $5-$20 million and the best commercial decision would be to decommission it. The company's head of water operations, Ross Berry, said decommissioning works started yesterday and outlined what the process involved. ""There's a small V cut-out in the front of the dam wall. About 25 metres will be lowered to a point so the dam can hold about 1.5 metres of water,"" he said. ""It's about 4 metres of water [at the moment]. That would be about the maximum level."" He said once works were completed and the Dam Safety Committee had inspected the site, talks about acquiring the lake could begin. ""We're open to anyone to have a chat about what the future might hold for Imperial Lake,"" Mr Berry said. ""Whether that's open to the public, whether that's a reserve. Completely open to discussions."" He said the works were expected to be completed by the end of April and would make it easier for any interested party to acquire the site. One such interested party is Broken Hill City Council, with Mayor Tom Kennedy making the acquisition of the lake as a recreation spot a key priority during the current term. A motion discussing that proposal, and facilitating a meeting with local state MP Roy Butler and Essential Water about it, was one of 39 matters passed in a single Mayoral Minute at last week's first meeting of the new council. Local resident Peter Nash, who in 2018 pushed for council's acquisition of the lake while chair of the city's 25in25 committee, welcomed the start of the decommissioning works and the renewed push to acquire the site. ""I don't think there's a shadow of a doubt that the average person in Broken Hill would love to see Imperial lake redeveloped,"" he said. ""To do as many possible things as we can — from swimming to kayaking, stand-up paddle boarding, a walking track, a bike track, barbecue facilities, fantastic playgrounds. ""Over the last three or four years of visiting other regional and remote communities it's only enhanced my opinion that we need to strive really passionately for this."" But Mr Nash said getting local MPs on board would be key. ""We need to send very clear messages to our state and federal representatives that this is something the community 100 per cent supports,"" he said. ""When our elected members understand that this is something the community supports they will go into bat for us."" Parkes MP Mark Coulton declined to comment and Barwon MP Roy Butler has been contacted for comment.

316,Goanna recovery hit by record visitor numbers and road deaths in national parks,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Rare heath goannas killed by vehicles as visitor numbers increase in national parks Wildlife rangers on South Australia's southern Eyre Peninsula are heartbroken after 10 vulnerable heath goannas were killed by vehicles in two national parks over the holiday period. Record numbers of people visited Lincoln and Coffin Bay National Parks with more than 6,000 visitors to each park last month. But the increase in visitors brought a setback in recovery for a top-order predator reptile that takes nine years to reach breeding age. National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) senior ranger Simon Oster said, while it was wonderful to see so many visitors, it was sad to see the significant amount of wildlife killed by motorists. ""We'd usually see maybe one goanna road death a month during their active period over the warmer months, so to have such a high number killed in a few weeks will have a significant impact on conservation efforts,"" he said. He urged motorists to slow down to the sign-posted speed limits to observe the wildlife that might be crossing the road. NPWS ecologist Katrina Pobke said the premature loss of every heath goanna (Varanus rosenbergi) impacted upon decades of conservation efforts. ""Heath goannas were once common in South Australia; however, now there are only a handful of locations across the state where they survive, with unknown population sizes believed to be potentially less than a few hundred in these parks, with more work needed to know for sure,"" Ms Pobke said. She said it took at least nine years for the goannas to reach sexual maturity and only one in 12 survived their first year facing birds of prey and introduced predators such as feral cats and foxes. She said one of the reported deaths was a female with a swollen belly, which rangers suspected was carrying eggs. ""If a female goanna carrying eggs is hit by a car, four or more goannas may be killed in one collision due to the eggs perishing as well,"" Ms Pobke said. ""To lose so many in a matter of weeks to inattentive or speeding drivers is devastating. ""It's a real setback for this endangered species and the next generation of young goannas."" She said the goannas had largely disappeared from farms after foxes were introduced. Ms Pobke said national parks aimed to protect native animals and visitors should obey speed limits. ""We can't understand if people were doing the right speed limit how they'd come to grief and hit this wildlife,"" she said. ""It isn't just goannas either — the rangers do get called out for kangaroos and recently some emus as well."" She said rangers believed the deaths were accidental.

317,'Build it and they will come': First fast charger for EVs represents new field of dreams on Nullarbor,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Nullarbor's first fast charger for electric vehicles installed at Caiguna Roadhouse The first electric fast charger has been installed on the remote Nullarbor, described as one of the final frontiers for Australia's growing number of battery-powered vehicles. Caiguna Roadhouse, one of 10 outback roadhouses dotted along a 910-kilometre stretch of the Eyre Highway, has become the first to embrace electric vehicles with a carbon-neutral charger. The installation powered by vegetable oil — used to fry food like hot chips — comes more than a decade after what many motoring enthusiasts say was the first known crossing by an electric vehicle. The $75,000 Biofil system was crowd-funded and plugs a 720km gap between proposed fast chargers in Western Australia and South Australia. It was invented by retired Perth mechanical engineer Jon Edwards and means electric motorists can recharge their vehicles in less than an hour instead of needing to stay overnight. ""The average number of EVs crossing the Nullarbor over the last five years is five per year,"" Mr Edwards said. ""I'm expecting that to increase significantly. ""Once these guys [electric vehicle owners] know there is fast charging, they will start making plans for trips. ""I'm expecting that to be 20 ,or even 40, within 12 months or so."" It typically takes about 20 litres of oil to charge a car and Caiguna Roadhouse has now begun stockpiling the waste product. Troy Pike, who manages the Caiguna, Cocklebiddy and Madura roadhouses, said he initially thought it was a joke when he heard the proposal. ""I had a bit of a laugh … I called them crackpots,"" he said. But he now believes it is only a matter of time before banks of fast chargers are installed along Australia's Highway 1. ""I think it's absolutely great, it's a step in the right direction,"" he said. ""Being a fuel man, selling diesel and petrol, it's going to end sometime and it's better to be on the front foot than the back foot. ""It's an evolving thing and it's snowballing quite largely around the world. ""I think for the initial period we might get one [vehicle] a month [using the fast charger], but it's the same old thing: build it and they will come."" Nigel Ball travelled from Perth for the fast charger's unveiling in his Tesla that has the personalised number plates RIP OIL. The self-described environmentalist brought a bottle of champagne to christen the charger, saying he plans to cross the Nullarbor once WA's border reopens. ""There's no way I would have done it before — sleeping in every roadhouse along the Nullarbor is not my idea of fun. ""Stopping at them for breakfast, lunch and dinner is fine, which is what these are all about."" Among more than a dozen electric cars that journeyed to Caiguna for the opening was husband and wife rally car drivers Jurgen and Helen Lunsmann. The couple competed in last year's Targa West rally in a Tesla and say the fast charger is a major milestone. ""I think the Nullarbor is one of the final frontiers when it comes to electric vehicles,"" Mr Lunsmann said. ""The lap of Australia is an ultimate goal for those pioneering, early adopters of EVs, and going forward more people are going to want to travel east-west, so the Nullarbor is one of those bucket-list trips. ""This is a fair bit of history. It's the first time anyone crossing the Nullarbor will be able to charge at more than what you would be able to do at home. ""Having the fast charging means your charging will be the same as a rest break, which is ideal. ""The smell of the chips from the exhaust of the generator will probably drive a fair bit more business into the roadhouse."" Figures released last year by the Electric Vehicle Council showed there were 6,900 electric cars sold in Australia in 2020, a 2.7 per cent increase from the 6,718 sold in 2019. The 2020 figures show electric cars accounted for 0.7 per cent of total Australian car sales. Elsewhere, the market share change from 2019 to 2020 was: Mr Lunsmann said the transition to electric vehicles in Australia would take decades. ""It's not a switch you can flick, it's going to be a gradual transition and infrastructure needs to grow to match that transition,"" he said. ""That's what this project is all about, the start of that growth of infrastructure — build it and they will come … it's our field of dreams on the Nullarbor.""

318,The challenges of filming Back Roads in remote Tasmania,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Joe O'Brien reveals the challenges of filming Back Roads in remote Tasmania A group of strangers thrown together for seven days for an episode of the ABC's Back Roads — what could possibly go wrong? On this shoot, there were four of us. Producer Lou Turley is a funky dresser, full of smiles and energy to burn. You need that as a producer because the success of these shoots largely depends on your organisational skills. Ben Cunningham, the cameraman who looked like he stepped out of a Paddy Pallin catalogue, had just come from spending three weeks on his belly crawling in mud filming the love dance of some exotic crab in the Northern Territory. He loves being in the ""wild"" and I love his passion for it. The youngest of the crew Eren ""Pinky"" Sener, in his 30s, was this towering, black-bearded, beaming man with a love for pink: pink tape, pink belts, pink scarves, pink anything. He also loves hugs. As soon as I met him, he greeted me with the warmest of hugs, not just a brief hug, but a bear hug. Coming from a six-foot-something bearded stranger with a passion for pink, it was a bit freaky to begin with, but then reassuring and welcoming, and so I leaned into it. There was a lot of excitement on the first night because we were meeting up with one of our key characters for the shoot, hiking guide Wes Moule who meticulously took us through what we needed. In another life, I would be Wes. He walks around in shorts every day, donning a funny hat and wraparound sunnies whilst hiking in the glorious Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, largely by himself, dropping off food for hikers — in his own heaven. This was nirvana for me, being paid to go on a hike with a legendary guide in the Tasmanian wilderness. But the next day the reality of the shoot quickly slapped us in the face — it was wet, cold and cloudy. Lou was such a trooper. The closest she'd been to a hike was a stroll through the National Gallery of Victoria. Her pack looked about as big as her and twice as heavy. About five minutes into the opening section of the hike, whilst guiding the cameraman backwards along the raised timber walking track, she teetered over the edge and onto her rear, only cushioned by the wombat poo lying in the spongy button grass plains. Like a schoolyard bully, I laughed and joked but then felt terrible — it was her birthday, after all. Stream more of Heather's adventures on iview. Fortunately for me, later on I presented her with some homemade protein balls complete with candles in a couple of them, and she said it was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for her. The hike ended up being pretty full-on and we were stopping frequently to get all the necessary shots. In the end it was cut short after ""spirited discussions"" about how it was all going to pan out. These shoots are planned meticulously and a spanner in the works, like the shortened hike, can ripple through the week like a dodgy communications line on a live television cross. This is when I realised I was in the presence of people who truly cared; not about when dinner was, or how long they were going to be out in the field or when they were going to get time to call home. They each wanted the opportunity to ensure their contribution to this program was the best it could possibly be. We finished the hike in as much cloud as we started and didn't get the ""money shot"" of the majestic Cradle with Dove Lake in the foreground. We then travelled to various towns throughout the week, chatting to the locals and telling their stories (you'll have to watch the show for that). In the end,  Lou wiped the wombat poo from her butt, kept working the phones, rewriting, recreating and rescheduling to ensure all the locals were happy and in the right mood for a chat when it was time. Ben got shots of me when I wasn't even aware the camera was there, possessing an intuition that creates authenticity, and Pinky gave us all a big hug. Eventually the cloud cleared on the final day and Ben and Pinky scooted back up to Cradle Mountain to get the final drone sequence that will give you goose bumps; the camera moves over a small hill to reveal the stillness of Dove Lake and Cradle Mountain in all its majesty, the anchor point for the show. I've seen the cut of our Cradle Mountain episode and I was filled with joy. I hope you enjoy it too, and just remember the team that puts it together are just as remarkable as the story itself. Joe's episode of Back Roads in Cradle Mountain is available to watch now on ABC iview.

321,"What you can do with $20, a tank of fuel and a sense of adventure",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Holidays within reach if you travel for only 24hrs and get creative, says single parent and budget traveller Twenty dollars, an esky full of food, a tank of fuel and a sense of adventure is all that Bendigo single parent Amy Kinder needed to start exploring the world around her. Getting on the road and seeing different parts of Australia is something that Ms Kinder always wanted to do. But being time-poor and on a single-parent wage, she thought it was almost impossible. ""As a single parent, I was time poor and cash poor. Family members were going on overseas holidays and doing these amazing things. ""I just felt it was never going to be achievable because I couldn't afford it, and couldn't justify it."" But a change in attitude and desire to travel inspired Ms Kinder to look at holidays in a different way. ""I realised how cheap it can be. Take the esky and pack my food, that can turn it into a really cheap adventure, and only go for 24 hours,"" she said. Ms Kinder, who has been joined by her daughters aged 19, 18 and eight, said the adventures had given them something to talk about during the pandemic. ""They absolutely love it. It is the downtime and quality time they get with me in my happy space."" Getting out on the road and exploring wasn't an easy step for Ms Kinder but it was something she was determined to do. ""I remember the first time I was taking my baby away, it was just her and me, and having to make all the decisions by myself, it was pretty spontaneous with no real planning or timing involved, it was very nerve-wracking,"" she said. Since the first trip, Ms Kinder has built her confidence and said when seeing Australia, you are only limited by your imagination. ""In 24 hours I can watch a sunrise, a sunset, I can hike up a mountain, and walk along a beach. I can look at these amazing places for free."" Sometimes Ms Kinder pays for accommodation, but most of the time with the car seats pushed down and a double mattress, Ms Kinder calls home for the night. She looks for places to set up her car for the night in locations that have a view others would envy. Mum's gone again is a Facebook page where Ms Kinder shares her adventures with other single parents and people wondering how they can do what she does. The page has attracted a healthy following and armchair travellers can be inspired to pack their bags and get out and about. ""This is not rocket science. This is really doable. I am nothing unique, I am just a regular mum at home. ""It really is not that hard. You've just got to be open to the idea of it."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Central Victoria's weekly email newsletter. Australia is a fantastic place to explore and Ms Kinder's travels are inspiring. ""I have been on a 24-hour adventure, taking off with no main plan until I got to the end of my driveway,"" she explained. ""I've taken the kids for a tour around Tasmania and the four of us slept in the car and in accommodation. ""For solo trips I have travelled to Port Lincoln in South Australia and taken my time travelling the coast to get back to Victoria. I've toured around New Zealand as well."" In all of her adventures, Ms Kinder doesn't take risks. She is very aware of the dangers a single woman travelling could face, but she counters that by making smart choices. ""I took my mum for a tour and I showed her a few of the places I was parking in,"" Ms Kinder said. ""She was worried about how safe I was being. When she realised where I was, she said, 'This is a pretty safe location'. ""There was lighting near where I was parked or it was in the middle of the main street in Mansfield or next to a playground in Tasmania, it gave her confidence and she was really proud of me."" As for her latest adventure, Ms Kinder is exploring Queensland for the next few weeks.

322,'A win would be nice': Tasmanians gather to watch historic Ashes Test in Hobart,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tasmanians gather to watch historic fifth Ashes Test at Bellerive Oval in Hobart Thousands of people have flocked to Bellerive Oval to witness the first men's Ashes Test to be played in Tasmania. Day one of the five-day test match is a sell out, and among those lucky enough to get their hands on a ticket is Hobart's Matt Siely and his five-year-old son Cole. Cole is part of the junior program with the Glenorchy cricket club and will get to play on the oval during the lunch break, sharing a surface with his idol Pat Cummins. ""He's been practising and eating a lot of vegetables this week to improve his bowling skills for today's game,"" Mr Siely said. ""I'm very excited to be here; who knows when we will ever see a test match in Hobart again."" Dressed head to toe in English colours, Sharon Heaton travelled from Devonport with her husband and two friends to see her side take on Australia in the historic match. ""A win would be nice, my husband wouldn't get as much stick at work,"" she said. Ms Heaton was able to get tickets for day one and day three, but accommodation was harder to come by. ""The only place we could get accommodation was in Ridgeway with the wallabies, it's very different to Devonport out there,"" she said. West Hobart mother Kate Headlam admitted she was not the world's biggest cricket fan, but said seeing Australia play in her home town was a once-in-a-life-time opportunity. ""My husband is a much bigger fan; I just stop at the exciting bits,"" she said. Ms Headlam scored tickets at the last minute after a friend was unable to attend. ""Since I got the tickets yesterday, I've been really excited; having [the Ashes Test] in Hobart is unbelievable,"" she said. But some cricket fans, like Brighton father Jordan Broughton, have chosen not to attend amid rising coronavirus cases in Tasmania. ""Nobody loves cricket more than me, however, lives are more important,"" he said. Mr Broughton thinks it is important for Hobart to have world-class events to help struggling businesses, but he's disappointed that smaller events were cancelled as a result of the pandemic. ""The Cygnet Folk festival can't go ahead, the Taste Festival just wasn't the same this year,"" he said. Mr Broughton said despite having had his COVID-19 vaccine booster, he would watch the test from his living room. ""It's not the virus I'm worried about; I'm concerned about potentially passing it on or having to isolate,"" he said. In a show of support for Tasmania's first Ashes test, prominent Hobart landmarks will be lit up in green and gold until next week, including the Town Hall, the Rose Garden Bridge, Franklin Square fountain and the Elizabeth Street mall. However, unlike Dark Mofo — which is held in the middle of winter — people will have to wait until around 9:30pm for the best shots of the light displays. ""Because it's a day-night test, it's a perfect time for cricket fans to see the city landmarks lit up on their way home from Bellerive Oval,"" a Hobart City Council spokesperson said. ""It creates a wonderful atmosphere."" The Tasmanian government has spent $5 million of taxpayer money in order to host the event, but Premier Peter Gutwein has previously said he expected the financial return would be much more. ""We'll get a $27 million return, that's what's estimated ... there'll be some smaller and other ancillary costs associated with the broadcast,"" Mr Gutwein said. Each day has the capacity for 14,000 people to attend but there are strict COVID-safe measures in place such as face masks, hand sanitiser and social distancing. While Tasmanians may be divided on whether the Ashes Test should have gone ahead, for father and son Brendon and Callum Barry it will be a weekend they will never forget. ""I waited forty years to go to a Boxing Day test. This will be my second Ashes test but to be at a home ground and with my son is great"", Mr Barry said.

323,Swapping Santiago for Cygnet: Virtual Tasmanian pilgrim walk attracts global audience,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tasmanian Way to St James pilgrim walk attracts global audience as virtual event A pilgrimage that started in Tasmania in 2016 has attracted participants from across the world who will unite in peace and solidarity this weekend. The Way to St James, a pilgrimage in the Huon Valley from Mountain River to St James Church in Cygnet, inspired by Spain's Camino de Santiago, moved online last year because of COVID-19. It attracted 350 participants last year, but this year about 1,400 people from various corners of the globe have indicated their interest in taking part. ""They come from five continents across the world ... we have people in America and Canada, we have people in the UK and in South Africa and Namibia, people in Argentina, people walking in Aruba ... [and] a lot in Europe,"" Way to St James committee member Leanne Pritchard said. ""Some are walking on particular walking paths, others are walking in parks and nature in their neighbourhood."" A group of pilgrims in Croatia will walk together on Hvar Island as part of the event and finish at the local St James Church. There are also people across Australia taking part. Participants in the two-day event can choose to walk 15 kilometres each day, or as little or as far as they are able to, and are encouraged to share their walk on social media. It will start on Saturday with a blessing by Father Michael Tate in Mountain River, which will be streamed live. The final ritual from Cygnet's St James Church on Sunday will also be broadcast online. Laura Roelofs, from Turnhout in Belgium, said she would take part with her horse, Nikita. Ms Roelofs walked the last 120km of the Camino Frances in Spain in 2018, which she said had a huge spiritual impact on her. ""I always knew I would go back to walk longer distances. Then COVID happened so at the moment I don't know when my next Camino in Spain will take place,"" she said. ""Back in 2018 a fellow pilgrim told me, 'The Camino is not only a big walk to the city of Santiago, but first of all a personal journey in your heart'. ""This is why I participate in this global Camino. And because it is from home I can take my beloved horse who loves to go on an adventure in our beautiful forests."" Jose Mari Ardanaz will join from Pamplona in Spain, a city that is one of the main starting points of the Camino de Santiago. ""My idea will be walking up to the Alto del Perdon [Mountain of Forgiveness], one of the famous places in the Camino de Santiago,"" Mr Ardanaz said. ""There is a big monument of pilgrims from the top, so I will hopefully be joining [the other pilgrims] live from the top of the mountain."" Ms Pritchard said she was inspired by the others taking part in the virtual pilgrimage. ""One of the pilgrims in Canada posted that they are walking in minus-24 degrees,"" she said. ""It's really inspiring to have people braving the elements across the world."" Fr Tate, who founded the Huon Valley pilgrimage, said the virtual version seemed to have ""tapped into a real need around the world"". ""Our pilgrimage is for any person of any faith — or indeed, none at all — open to a meditative walk through natural surroundings, so as to join in a common endeavour around the world to restore body, mind and spirit in these anxiety-ridden times,"" he said. The Camino de Santiago is a series of paths that fan out beyond the Iberian Peninsula and spread across Europe. Whichever route a pilgrim takes, they all end at Santiago's cathedral, reportedly home to the tomb of St James who, according to Catholic tradition, brought Christianity to Spain and Portugal. Cygnet's Spanish-style St James Church inspired Fr Tate to start the Huon Valley pilgrimage in 2016. Ms Pritchard has walked every Way to St James in Tasmania, and walked the Camino de Santiago in 2018. ""I went solo from Tasmania over to Spain and I was really a bit focused on doing it for myself, but the richest part of the experience was connecting with others,"" she said. ""When you go on those walks [in Spain] it doesn't matter who you are, how old you are, where you come from ... there's a real sense of community where no one judges, everyone's welcome."" She said many of those who have signed up for the virtual Way to St James had done one of the Camino pilgrimages in Spain. ""It's a real thing that is unifying these pilgrims across the world at a time when there's not a lot of good news around at the moment, so it's a positive thing that they can have in their lives."" Ms Pritchard said she would start her walk from Mountain River. ""I might do a little bit of the actual Tassie walk and take some photos and share those so that people who are walking all over the world can see what our Tassie Camino is like,"" she said. Mr Ardanaz said even though participants were far apart, ""we are all in Camino"". ""During COVID, all the Camino community has come together as one,"" he said.

324,Queensland's COVID-19 border restrictions are set to be dumped. How will it work?,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has effectively thrown open the state's borders to the rest of Australia by lifting the remaining restrictions from this weekend. The announcement came earlier than expected — the changes were previously flagged for when Queensland reached the 90 per cent double vaccination target for those 16 and over. The state is currently about 88.1 per cent fully vaccinated, but Ms Palaszczuk said: ""The time is now right as we head towards hitting that 90 per cent next week."" Domestic border restrictions for people entering from a hotspot will no longer be in place. That means people coming into Queensland from domestic hotspots, either by road or by air, won't need to fill out a border form, nor will they need to provide a negative COVID-19 test result of any kind. There will be no requirement to quarantine. ""Now is the time for the barricades to come down, and for the police to come home, to continue on their normal operational duties on the front lines,"" Ms Palaszczuk said. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic From Saturday, January 15, at 1:00am AEST. So don't try sneaking over at 12:45am. Queensland's Chief Health Officer says there will be ""thousands of cases"" of coronavirus in the state in coming weeks, so the state government is urging you to put together a COVID preparation kit. Restrictions will remain in place for international travellers until the 90 per cent double vaccination target is reached, which is expected to be next week. Authorities are still concerned about new COVID variants arriving from overseas. Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said: ""We do still have to look very carefully at international arrivals, and particularly unvaccinated international arrivals."" There are a host of requirements until that point in time, which can be found here. Those who are 16 and over and who haven't received both doses of a vaccine will now find it easier to cross into Queensland, but once here they will find their activities heavily restricted. A slew of venues and events continue to have strict vaccination requirements, meaning the unvaccinated will not be able to enter. ""We are still wanting to make sure that only fully vaccinated people are entering those venues and those events that are more likely to see fast transmission happening,"" Ms D'Ath said.

325,EU seeks to suspend visa-free travel with Vanuatu over 'golden passport' scheme,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  EU seeks to suspend visa-free travel with Vanuatu over 'golden passport' scheme The European Commission has proposed a suspension of a visa-free travel agreement with the Pacific archipelago of Vanuatu because of the nation's scheme offering passports to rich foreigners. The proposal was announced on Wednesday local time. If it is backed by EU states, it will be the first time the EU has imposed sanctions on a country for running ""golden passport"" schemes. The commission has repeatedly warned the scheme could pose security and money-laundering risks. ""The commission has concluded that Vanuatu's investor-citizenship schemes present serious deficiencies and security failures,"" it said in a statement. Under the scheme, foreigners can obtain Vanuatu citizenship and a passport in exchange for a minimum investment of $US130,000 ($178,000). That in turn gives them visa-free access to the EU under a visa-waiver agreement the country has with the 27-nation bloc. The lucrative ""cash for passports"" scheme helped keep Vanuatu's economy afloat when the pandemic hit and the country's tourism industry was on its knees. In 2020, the citizenship program accounted for 35 per cent of the government's revenue. Approved Vanuatu citizenship agent Catherine Boudier said suspending visa-free travel to the EU would have a huge impact on citizenship sales. ""A lot of the [citizenship] enquiries and why the clients have been contacting us is to be able to travel in Europe,"" Ms Boudier told the ABC. ""I personally think it's very serious."" Vanuatu Business Resilience Council chair Glen Craig said the effects on Vanuatu's economy would be ""immediate"" and ""drastic"". ""Especially in COVID times, the Vanuatu economy is almost solely being propped up by the citizenship program,"" Mr Craig said. ""For the EU to be looking at such a suspension right now, in a fragile, small South Pacific country, on the grounds that they've given, we think it's pretty poor form."" Mr Craig said suspending the visa-free travel arrangement would impact on local services like health, education and governance. ""If I was in the finance and economic management department of the government I'd be very stressed right now about how we can afford to pay doctors and nurses and keep hospitals open,"" he said. The commission has proposed suspending visa-free travel for all holders of Vanuatu passports released since May 2015, which is when the investor program started to operate in earnest in the country. The moratorium would be lifted if the program was properly amended. Are you in the market for a second passport? One that can get you into scores of countries — including Europe, the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore and Russia — without needing a visa? The EU executive said the scheme was risky because it essentially accepted all applicants and did not sufficiently screen them, despite some appearing in Interpol's security databases. Tess Newton-Cain, the project lead at the Pacific Hub for the Griffith Asia Institute, said one issue the commission had raised was that citizens from countries that were not granted visas into the EU, were using a Vanuatu passport to enter instead. ""They seem to have a concern that these these passports, the Vanuatu passports, are allowing people to do an end run around a process that they would otherwise fall foul of,"" Dr Newton-Cain said. Vanuatu's embassy in Brussels was not immediately available for comment. The commission said it was monitoring countries with visa-free access to the EU which were effectively operating or planning to set up investor-citizenship schemes, including Caribbean and Pacific islands and eastern European states Montenegro, Albania and Moldova. Most EU states have their own schemes offering passports or visas to wealthy foreigners, but the commission considers most of them in line with EU rules, with the exception of programs set up by Cyprus and Malta. Both states are facing legal challenges from Brussels which require them to change the programs or stop running them to avoid the risk of a fine.

326,Tasmania's border reopening wasn't the boom these businesses were expecting,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Bookings for Adam Hely's King Island hire car business were ""stronger than ever"" as interstate visitors prepared to flock to the island's golf courses and tourist attractions. But a COVID-19 outbreak on the island, as well as a Public Health directive to reconsider travelling there, meant operators were being flooded with cancellations, instead of raking in the money. ""Predominantly we're just taking cancellations,"" Mr Hely said. ""We've been employing people for the last two years. To simply take bookings [and then] to cancel bookings without getting the actual hires out there [is devastating]. ""We've been tearing up money for two years and we got a bit excited we were going to be back in the game and now we're in a dreadful position in regards to all the cancellations that have been made."" Mr Hely, the president of the island's tourism association, said the story was the same all over the tight-knit community. ""The golf clubs were fully booked, the hotel accommodation, the tour companies; everyone was looking forward to an absolute bumper of a year,"" he said. For southern Tasmanian venue owner Bernadette Wood, the border reopening has also provided logistical challenges. Despite a surge in interstate bookings, late cancellations mean the number of weddings going ahead at one venue was down between 10 and 40 per cent. At her two restaurants, almost one third of her staff are unable to work due to having COVID or being deemed close contacts, and local diners are staying away. ""We're definitely seeing that there's not many locals frequenting that area, I think locals are very much staying to their own areas and not going out much,"" she said. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic AMP senior economist Diana Mousina said those stories were borne out by Google mobility data that showed retail and recreation activity for the first week of January had fallen to the lowest level since September last year. ""It could be some Christmas or New Year impacts that have had led to the shift down in the data, but I think it's more reflective of the very high increase in cases that Tasmania has had pretty much in the space of two or three weeks,"" she said. ""I think that there will be a hit to activity for Tasmania from the high increase in cases, but I think the same thing will happen across the other states and territories as well."" A more in-depth picture of how Tasmania's economy has performed since the reopening will become evident in coming months when retail and employment statistics are published, Ms Mousina said. Louise Grimmer, a senior lecturer in retail marketing at the University of Tasmania, said business owners were telling her it was ""very quiet in many sectors"". ""Even though we are not in a formal lockdown, effectively, consumers are acting as though we are,"" Dr Grimmer said. ""Particularly in terms of visitation to physical stores and cafes and restaurants, we are seeing a reduction in spending across many categories such as clothing, footwear and accessories, household goods including furniture and appliances. ""I think it's a worrying time for local Tasmanian businesses and it will be important for government at all levels to acknowledge the reality of the situation and step in with financial and other types of support so that businesses can get through this difficult period of uncertainty."" Dr Grimmer said businesses would need a combination of government assistance and community support to get through the latest downturn. ""We were brilliant at doing this in 2020 and 2021, when many local businesses thrived, and it will be important that we try to do our best to again support local stores in 2022,"" she said. What are the rules on masks? What is the deal with checking-in? So many questions. We have all the answers here. Tourism Minister Sarah Courtney said businesses in some parts of the state had been impacted by the spread of COVID-19 and encouraged businesses to contact Business Tasmania for advice and support, on top of the yet-to-be-announced support package. ""We are seeing a large degree of variation with the impact on businesses across Tasmania. While indeed there are some businesses who have been impacted negatively, I know that there are businesses that are thriving because of visitors coming into the state,"" she said. A support package for businesses is set to be announced by the state government later in the week. Labor has called for a specific package to help King Island businesses, something Mr Hely said was sorely needed. ""I'd hope that package to be substantial enough to see those businesses get through to the other side and a substantial marketing campaign, so we've got something to look forward to,"" he said.

327,Questions raised about whether Novak Djokovic lied about his travel history on border entry form,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Questions are being raised about whether Novak Djokovic lied on an official Australian border entry form about where he had travelled to in the two weeks before he flew to Australia. Anyone flying to Australia from overseas must fill out a health survey as part of their application to enter the country. On that form it asks if the person has travelled, or has plans to travel, in the 14 days before they arrive in Australia. In documents released as part of Djokovic's Federal Circuit Court Case, he declared on his survey that he had not travelled in the last fortnight. But a number of social media posts and news articles from the end of December show that that may not have been the case. To have been within the border entry rules, Djokovic would had to have been in Spain, where he flew out from (via Dubai) to get to Australia, for two weeks from late on December 22. He left Spain on January 4 and arrived in Australia late on Wednesday, January 5. The Federal Circuit Court has released the full interview transcript with one of the world's most famous tennis players and the Australian Border Force. However, in videos and photos on social media, Djokovic appears to have been in Belgrade, Serbia, at Christmas time, where he was filmed playing tennis in the street. Djokovic's lawyers have been contacted for comment. The ABC asked the Australian Border Force (ABF) if it was investigating whether Djokovic's travel declaration information was accurate. A spokesperson said the ABF did not comment on operational matters. ""All passengers travelling to Australia are required to provide important health and travel information, including contact, flight and vaccination details,"" they said. ""This important information identifies their eligibility to travel, helps state and territory governments determine quarantine arrangements (if required), and supports relevant state and territory health departments to conduct contract tracing. ""Providing false or misleading information or documentation to the Commonwealth can lead to visa cancellation and/or attract penalties, including under criminal law."" In the early hours of Wednesday (AEDT) Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told reporters that he does not have any information on whether Djokovic had visited Spain before travelling to Australia. Asked if he knew whether Djokovic had entered Spain in December, potentially invalidating Djokovic's travel declaration, Mr Albares responded: ""I have no record of this presence of Djokovic."" He added that he had not been contacted by the Australian government about such information. The tennis star's fate remains hanging in the balance as Immigration Minister Alex Hawke continues to consider whether to use his ministerial powers to cancel the world number one male tennis player's visa. If that happens, it could mean Djokovic is banned from entering Australia for three years, although ban periods are done on a case-by-case basis. A judge handed Djokovic a reprieve, but now outsiders are looking in, questioning whether Judge Kelly's Australia — like democracies everywhere — is on the slide. ""As noted yesterday in the Federal Circuit and Family Court, Minister Hawke is considering whether to cancel Mr Djokovic’s visa under section 133C(3) of the Migration Act,"" a spokesperson for Mr Hawke said. ""In line with due process, Minister Hawke will thoroughly consider the matter. ""As the issue is ongoing, for legal reasons it is inappropriate to comment further."" After a request from the Serbian Prime Minister, Ana Brnabić, to speak to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the two leaders had a phone call on Tuesday. Mr Morrison's office said it was a ""constructive conversation"", while Serbian media outlet RTS reported that Ms Brnabić asked that Djokovic be ""treated fairly"" and emphasised the importance of him being given time and conditions to train for the Australian Open. Djokovic maintains that he intends to defend his title at the Australian Open, which starts on Monday. He trained at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne on Tuesday after being released from Immigration detention on Monday afternoon.

328,"When WA reopens, will the Pilbara be cut off?",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The Pilbara tourism industry says it needs concrete answers from the West Australian government as to whether the region will be cut off from the rest of the state, as the region's vaccination rates remain low. WA is expected to relax its hard borders on February 5. In November, Premier Mark McGowan flagged tourists could be blocked from visiting regions with low COVID-19 vaccination rates and unvaccinated residents may be restricted from returning home. In the Pilbara, 59.5 per cent of people aged 12 and above have received their first COVID-19 vaccination, while 52.7 per cent have received their second dose. In comparison, 85.4 per cent of the eligible West Australian population has received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Mackerel Islands chief executive Drew Norrish said he was awaiting the state government's final decision and was quite nervous. ""We're hoping it still stays with the original advice and that people that aren't vaccinated will have trouble getting into the region and everyone else can free flow and fulfil their holidays,"" he said. Mr Norrish said the tourism industry needed to know if and when the borders would be closed so as to inform customers as soon as possible. ""Direct bookings we can contact straightaway but [for] people who bring coach loads of people into the region or are booked on tours and third parties we need months to really make sure that's not a messy outcome,"" he said. A spokesperson for the state government said, under WA's Safe Transition, anyone travelling into the Pilbara by air would be required to be double vaccinated. ""This is clearly something we want to avoid but, if the rates do not reach the levels we need, these measures may be unavoidable,"" they said. ""This may include proof of vaccination in various settings, among other options."" Mr Norrish said he was staying in close contact with tourists who had booked accommodation and tours to the Mackerel Islands, as well as the Karijini Eco Retreat, which the company also manages. ""We've all been through our terms and conditions and tried to communicate those with people as they book so that everyone's fully aware of what the range of outcomes could be,"" he said. Mr Norrish said tourists he had spoken to were clear it was up to them to be vaccinated to fulfil their holidays. Pilbara Tours managing director Phil Smeeton said the uncertainty surrounding the government's previous announcement had made him hesitant to plan for the upcoming tourist seasons. Pilbara Tours runs fishing tours, salt tours and team-building days around Port Hedland, with the company's peak season running from April to October. ""Ordinarily, we would start planning immediately when the season stops but this year, because of COVID, we've been hesitant to plan too much because it's a bit of a moving feast,"" Mr Smeeton said. The company was unsure how popular tours would be once WA's borders relaxed, he said. ""It might be that tourists will be hesitant to take tours, getting on buses, if they're trying to avoid getting COVID and it might well be that the state's not happy with unvaccinated travellers through the Pilbara."" Mr Norrish said he was planning for all eventualities and was expecting some bumpy periods during the next year. ""The availability of staff is one thing. Probably the nervousness will be, should COVID come into the workforce in remote places, and they're forced to isolate, that's a whole other potential set of impacts to service quality and things like that."" Mr Smeeton said the companies, which had been running for four years, were trying to come up with new solutions to adapt to the changing times. ""If the response from the tourist markets is a hesitancy around getting on buses, we have a capability [for people] to tag along to us with inter-vehicle communication so we can still do guided tours, but people will be able to travel in their own vehicle,"" he said. A spokesperson for the state government said it was doing everything it could to encourage people in the Pilbara to get vaccinated. ""These activities in the region are extensive and include mobile response vaccination teams that are continuing to offer door-to-door vaccination in all towns across the Pilbara,"" they said. ""Efforts include clinics extending hours and opening on weekends where possible."" The state government said, during January, mobile buses would visit the Pilbara to offer vaccinations in parks and other locations for vulnerable clients. ""Vaccinators are being deployed to WACHS-run (WA Country Health Service-run) remote Aboriginal communities to continue to offer opportunistic vaccinations to community members,"" they said. The spokesman for the City of Karratha said it was supporting the state government's vaccine rollout but was concerned that the Pilbara-wide rates were still so low. ""We are seeking advice from the state government regarding the particular segments of our community that are most under-represented in vaccination so that vaccination promotions and efforts can be targeted at those cohorts,"" he said. ""With the state border set to open on February 5, it is critical that all eligible people in the community act now to get their vaccination.""

329,Last-minute visitor cancellations the 'new normal' for tourism operators,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  As COVID-19 case numbers continue to rise rapidly across New South Wales, tourism businesses are getting used to customers pulling out at the last minute after coming in contact with the virus. Mark Stone, owner of Port Macquarie's Billabong Zoo on the state's mid-north coast, said it had been difficult to predict how many people would come through the gate each day. ""Traditionally you can understand when the busiest time will be,"" he said. ""We've had some really good days through the school holidays, and then we've had some that didn't meet what we thought would have been the expectation."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Mr Stone said he was trying to adapt to visitors cancelling their plans at the 11th hour. ""I guess that's living with COVID at this time,"" Mr Stone said. ""It's finding the new expectations, finding the new normal, and just trying to work with that."" Mr Stone said a horror run of floods, fires and the pandemic had created the most difficult few years in his role at the helm of the zoo. ""To go from drought to the fires, into two floods and then into this pandemic – it's been a very tumultuous few years. ""I've got staff that have never seen the zoo in normal times."" Julie Newman, owner-operator of Hunter Valley Tours, said she was getting calls ""on a daily basis"" from customers who needed to cancel their bookings because they had to go into isolation. ""When I have six or eight people or so cancel on me, or postpone, that can affect whether I can run an actual tour that day,"" she said. ""And that might be the only tour that I can run for a couple of days."" The vineyards are green and full of fruit at this time of year, but Ms Newman said everyone who made a booking wanted to make sure they wouldn't lose money. ""The uncertainty has been very hard for small businesses to survive,"" she said. Ms Newman said the COVID-disrupted summer season had prompted her to seriously consider offering other types of tours. ""I'm looking at horse studs, the mining industry and tourism around the Hunter River,"" she said. ""Diversifying into other areas is something I was looking at … so it may start to move forward now as things slow down.""

330,The future of travel looks very different this year. Here's what to expect,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  I fell in love with travelling at the worst possible time. But I was determined not to miss out during COVID ""Hey Mum, where did you take this one?"" Crouched over, knee resting against my cheek, I flick through page after page — faded smiles and laughs captured in motion, people leaping into the ocean and lapping up ice cream. This is what I want, I think. Soon enough, school is going to be over and it'll be my turn to see the world. And then? Well, COVID happened. For many Australians, spending time backpacking overseas is almost a rite of passage, an experience marking the transition into adulthood. Of course, the pandemic mostly put an end to this. But during 2020, I was lucky enough to escape. I had just moved to Melbourne for university when COVID struck. I had two weeks of classes before my residential college recommended we go home — back to regional Victoria. Moving back in with my family and barely able to leave the house left me craving travel more than ever. So, on the night before NSW closed itself to Victoria, a couple of friends and I crossed the border in an old four-wheel drive. We spent six weeks exploring the state; hiking through mountains and swimming in rivers, camping during thunderstorms and basking in sunshine. The time away rejuvenated us, ready for another semester. But once again, by the time it was university holidays, the travel itch had returned and I was ready to escape once more. Inspired by the backpackers we met on our journey, my friend and I thought we'd try our hand at agricultural work. We made our way up to the NSW mid-north coast and spent six weeks picking blueberries, discovering the difficulties of working in such a temperamental industry, while becoming close friends with the international backpackers staying at our hostel. We explored the national parks nearby, improved our surfing skills, and made the most of the local nightlife. As the harvest season wound up, we couldn't bring ourselves to head home right away. Instead, we headed even further north, up to an island off Queensland's far north, where we lived the traditional backpacker lifestyle — working in hospitality, living in a beachside hostel, spending time snorkelling and chasing waterfalls. It was an absolute dream. While on the island, I met other young Australians who were also backpacking around their own country. Crystal Shellshear, 22, and her friend Halili Halim, 22, left their lives in Brisbane to travel. ""We sold our car, sold our clothes, sold everything we owned and bought a backpack,"" she says. ""If I could've gone overseas, I would have. Before COVID, I didn't even consider travelling Australia. But now I'm so glad I did."" Crystal spent the past year travelling around the country, working various 'backpacker jobs', from hospitality, to child-care, to agricultural work. ""I've changed so much over the past year, and really come to realise what's important. I used to buy new clothes all the time, party all the time, I just had so much stuff,"" she says. ""I now know that I don't need all these pointless items, I've learnt how to save and consider things, and I've really come out of my shell."" She thinks that Australia is the perfect country to begin travelling adventures, as it is relatively safe. Plus, family is close, a luxury many international backpackers have missed, especially over the past few years. ""It's a special thing, being able to travel your own country. You really get a different view on it, you don't take it for granted,"" Crystal says. While Crystal spent her 2021 exploring Australia, I was back in Melbourne at university. However, I did manage to duck off to Cairns for a month during the winter break. During this trip I met Zoe Parsons, 19, and we clicked immediately. Zoe had also planned for 2020 to be a huge gap year filled with travel — from Europe, to Africa, to India. ""After high school, I felt the freest I ever have. I was so excited about the future and getting to explore the world,"" she explains. When COVID washed up on Australian shores, all her international plans were quashed. Determined to still get that travel experience, she and her partner set up a bed in the back of a four-wheel drive and set out on a six-month long adventure around Australia. ""I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. Australia is such a big, diverse country — not just geographically but also culturally. I don't think I realised properly how many different people and views and cultures there can be in one country,"" Zoe says. Spending time exploring Australia became a pivotal experience in her life. ""I think to travel home first and learn a bit more about the country you come from is a really powerful position to be in when you go out and explore other parts of the world,"" she says. ""I learnt so much about my sense of place and my sense of home. It really made me question belonging, and all the trauma and history of Australia. ""I discovered many things I love about this country, but also so much room for growth and improvement."" The pandemic had dramatically impacted the Australian travel industry, but it's also brought changes predicted to have positive flow-on effects for Australian backpackers. We are interested in your feedback on this story. Please click here to complete a short survey. Alex Hill, President of Adventure Tourism Victoria, says the Australian travel industry is in good stead for when international travel resumes, especially with the changes to the working/work and holiday visa. He predicts it to happen about June, 2022. ""We've made fundamental changes to backpacker legislation, which should change travelling for the better post-pandemic,"" he says. These changes largely surround visa requirements for backpackers. The maximum age for working visas has been increased to 35 years old for more countries, travellers from the UK are no longer required to complete agricultural work to receive their second and third-year visas, and the infamous 'backpacker tax' has the potential to be abolished. ""There's currently a critical lack of supply of workers. These changes will allow people to stay for longer, have a better time, and for the economy to bounce back more quickly,"" he adds. These changes are expected to have similarly positive repercussions, bringing the backpacker ""vibe"" back to Australia for those who are wanting to explore their own country first. ""I think the important thing is just to get out there,"" Alex Hill says. ""Our Australian cities are crying out for tourism, and there's a whole lot of money going into reinvigorating them at the moment. ""If you're feeling nervous about travelling overseas at the moment, book yourself a week-long holiday to a capital city you've never been to. Spend some money on day trips, hire yourself a car, and get that travel bug back that we've all missed in the last few years."" Katrina Barry, the managing director of Contiki Tours, is also feeling excited for the future. She says Contiki has used the pandemic to workshop and reinvigorate its tours, improving its ecological footprint and having a greater focus on COVID safety so it is well-suited to a post-pandemic world. ""In the past, it was all about borders, language and currency. Now it's all about testing, making sure things are safe and easy,"" she says. Contiki has also adjusted its domestic tours to appeal to an Australian audience, creating new trips around Western Australia, Victoria and the Northern Territory, which have been very popular over the last year and continue to be selling out into the new year. However, from May 2022, there has been a strong sale pattern into Europe. ""Young people have had enough — they want to get out,"" says Ms Barry. She says there are three trends appearing amongst young people who are planning to travel in 2022. Firstly, they are buying longer trips. Rather than an average length of three to four weeks, trips are often over a month. Many young Australians are also buying consecutive trips, extending their experience again. And finally, ""they're just going"". ""With our older audience, through the travel company Trafalgar, we're seeing a lot of lookers and not many bookers. However, with young people, it's been the complete opposite,"" she says. ""It's very exciting to see."" When I asked all the people I interviewed if they had any advice for young Australians hoping to travel, there was one resounding answer. ""Just get out there"". ""The most powerful thing you can do is just go. Try not to be too latched to plans — let the experience take you where it needs to,"" Zoe says. As the world opens up, I know I'm not alone when I say I can't wait to explore it. But if that doesn't work out, I'm incredibly privileged I am to have a huge, beautiful country right at my fingertips. And I now have my own photo album, too.

331,'I'm more scared to go home': Annabelle and Alexander decided to go ahead with honeymoon during the Omicron outbreak,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus Two years ago, Annabelle Brett and Alexander Tait were planning an overseas honeymoon but when that was up-ended by a global pandemic, Tasmania was top of their list. After a pre-Christmas wedding, the Gold Coast couple are travelling around Tasmania for two weeks. ""We stayed inside for a week in the lead-up to our honeymoon and tested twice negative on PCR and rapid antigens to make sure that we didn't bring it to Tassie,"" Ms Brett said. They have had a few restaurant cancellations because of COVID-affected staffing but they are not deterred by the almost doubling daily case spike in COVID in the island state. ""We thought it was going to be a lot worse,"" Ms Brett said. ""It was really taking off [in Queensland] and places were closing whereas coming down here, obviously some places are shut, but all the venues and hotels have been quite up-front with us about that. ""Everyone has been exceptional but you can see that they are quite strained."" During their travels around the state, they are modifying a few behaviours, like choosing to eat outside. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic The newlyweds are feeling relaxed about being in Tasmania with Omicron taking off. ""The vaccination rates are pretty high here — where we live on the Gold Coast the vaccination rates are exceptionally bad so I'm actually more scared to go home,"" she said. ""Tasmanians are being good about it, the rules seem solidly in place and people are just less awful here, I think."" When borders opened on December 15, a record 41 flights came into Hobart Airport bringing thousands of people and the scene was repeated at other entry points. It has become clear that the doors were also opened to Omicron. Before abandoning the daily list of exposure sites, the last website entry was a list of flights and ferry dates. With Omicron well and truly amongst us, mass cancellations might be expected but that is not the case. So far. Qantas and Jetstar are monitoring demand and have ""only made a very small number of schedule adjustments as a result of Omicron impacts"". Virgin Australia declined to comment and spokesperson for the TT-Line said demand for Spirit of Tasmania ferry services continued to be strong with an extra 17 day sailings scheduled for January. Tourism Industry Council head Luke Martin said early January had been ""a really mixed bag"" but a clear pattern was emerging of people going to the regional areas and parks like Freycinet. Most Tasmanians who catch COVID-19 will manage it from their own homes. Simon Boot was one of the first to test out the government's COVID@home ""virtual ward"" program. ""Cradle Mountain getting 2,000 people through a day is a pretty clear indicator for us about how people are moving around the state,"" he said. ""Strahan occupancy is really high, they are really good indicators ... people coming into the state are choosing to do different things."" He said a couple of venues had seen record weeks. ""Some hotels are very, very busy but having to close restaurants because of staffing issues,"" he said. ""Cities and regions are dealing with staff issues … it's a really challenging dynamic."" Not every regional outpost is feeling the tourism love with public health advising people to reconsider plans to go to King Island as an outbreak there reaches 80 cases. Peter Robinson operates caravan parks in Ulverstone and St Helens and said the local restaurants and taverns were ""losing workers by the day"". But bookings were still strong with a mix of Tasmanians and interstate visitors and he's had only a handful of cancellations in the last few days from ""people who don't want to get COVID"", mostly Tasmanians. ""Mainland tourists are not hiding from it, they realise we'll get it sometime. We are not used to living with COVID,"" he said. ""It has really hit home, it's fair dinkum and people are more worried."" He is running two teams of staff designated inside and outside with everyone masked up. He said staff were noticing changing attitudes, with abuse becoming more common as rules around testing and close contacts impacted on cancellation policies. Hobart woman Sally Eastwood is one of those heading to an east coast caravan park after pulling the pin on a trip to South Australia on Boxing Day when COVID in the family up-ended departure dates and fees mounted. What are the rules on masks? What is the deal with checking-in? So many questions. We have all the answers here. Her family is heading off to the east coast for a week, down from the original trip of four weeks, but is yet to find a park with space. ""I'm not nervous about travelling in Tasmania for the reason that I know we can come back at any point to home and access that help we need,"" she said. Like the newlyweds, the family will be taking extra steps to stay safe. ""It wouldn't be considered normal a few weeks ago but wearing face masks outdoors all of the time, unless we are at a beach, but wherever there are people — face masks the whole time and probably try to avoid being in indoor areas,"" she said. ""To travel in Tasmania doesn't bother me but once we get back, exposure to my elderly parents bothers me."" While some operators like Scamander accommodation owner Heidi Howe has most of January wiped clean with cancellations, others are getting fewer. Smaller operators like Gina Scott's Platypus Park Country Retreat near Bridport have had only a handful of cancellations so far. She believes Tasmanians are getting trepidatious. To help ease concerns, her business has closed reception and introduced a contactless check-in where customers fill in a register in another room and then call. ""I give them instructions on how to find their accommodation and watch them walk or drive to their room,"" she said. ""It's contactless and... It works, and it keeps everyone socially distanced. ""We had someone recently say they hadn't had a holiday for three years but we are having one here and specifically choosing a small place with very limited numbers. ""It's going to be testing. We've gone around for two years straight back to where we started from, now we are all very cautious."" One of the area's bigger operators, the Barnbougle links golf course, has accommodation for 180 and general manager Penny Sattler has been surprised how few cancellations there have been. But Omicron is adding to stress levels. ""We seem to be picking up, but that could change any second,"" she said. ""We are feeling more optimistic only because it's been so hard for so long, if we don't try to be optimistic, we are pessimistic."" The course has also found it hard holding staff and has recruited more heavily than usual. ""We are just doing the best we can and hope every day we have enough. It's a family business so all the family is on call and will fill whatever gaps we've got,"" she said. Russell Drayton's family has owned and operated caravan parks for years and he is a past president of the Caravan Parks Association of Tasmania. He said bookings were not back to where they were because there was still uncertainty and people won't travel. ""The tourism industry has copped a doing over the last 2-3 years,  we'll bounce back and get going again sometime."" As experienced by hospitality, tourism experiences like the West Coast Wilderness Railway says keeping enough staff is the main challenge. Anthony Brown is the general manager of West Coast Wilderness Railway and chairman of Destination West Coast. He said tourist numbers were ""bigger than ever"" but the railway had not been without cancellations. ""The challenge now is the impact of COVID, and borders reopening is making people nervous,"" he said. ""I took a cancellation yesterday from Tasmanians not keen to travel now that the chance of getting COVID is strong. ""It's on a lot of people's minds, it's inevitable.""

332,"In 1973, four people went missing in a chamber the size of the MCG. Now it's an international drawcard",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Underwater world People come from all over the world to dive the Limestone Coast's enchanting sinkholes. It wasn't that long ago that farmers were threatening to fill them in with rocks. Ian Lewis could have been deemed a ""suicide freak"" 50 years ago. Growing up around Mount Gambier's volcanic region on South Australia's Limestone Coast, he became fascinated by its sinkholes — gaping voids in the Earth's surface. ""Then one day one of our scout masters took four of us to some caves … and that changed my life,"" he says. Underwater exploration of the caves was still relatively new when Ian took up scuba diving in the late 1960s. ""There was a small group of cavers with a very low profile, just exploring caves and starting to map them,"" Ian says. The first, of course, to discover these sites were the Boandik people thousands of years ago. These waterholes provided a place of refuge and continue to be a crucial part of Boandik history and mythology. Since the colonisation of this area, these large holes dotted throughout the region were used as watering holes for stock and later as places to dump barbed wire, old cars and decaying animals. ""They were holes in the ground; you either threw stuff in or pumped water out,"" Ian says. It wasn't until the 1960s that people became adventurous and started swimming in the sinkholes. ""At that time there was no regulation about diving; scuba diving had been around as a sport for about a decade or a bit more overseas,"" Ian says. Without the proper safety measures or knowledge, 11 people died in the sinkholes in the late '60s and early '70s. Four people went missing in 1973 in The Shaft — a chamber the size of the MCG and the region's darkest and deepest recorded sinkhole. You drop in via a tiny hole in the middle of a farmer's paddock south of Mount Gambier. ""All these people were coming from all over the place and dying on [the farmer's] land,"" Ian says. ""The attitude of the public was then: 'Who are these divers? They're mad going into these dark holes ... we don't know where they're going to go ... the farmers are liable ... get them out of here ... they're all suicide freaks.' ""A lot of people threatened to shut the sinkholes down or fill them up."" In response, a large group of enthusiasts who said they could dive responsibly agreed to regulate the activity and formed the Cave Divers Association of Australia. ""Credit to everybody who pulled it together and sorted out the training and things like that,"" Ian says. ""Now it's become an international drawcard for the South East. ""Local people started to realise it's bringing a number of people in here and we don't have this death rate."" The Limestone Coast refers to the large expanse of limestone spanning South Australia's south-east. ""From Bordertown and Kingston and Naracoorte in the north, all the way through to Penola and down here to Mount Gambier, Port MacDonnell and the coast and Carpenter Rocks and so on, the whole landscape is covered with limestone,"" Ian says. Its formation dates back 60 million years to when Australia was breaking away from Antarctica. ""This whole area was under an ocean about 30 million years ago and that deposited more than 100 metres of limestone on the sea floor over a long time,"" Ian says. ""[The] limestone is made up of the remains of shells and bones and things from millions and millions of sea creatures."" Since his early love of caving, Ian has spent 60 years studying South Australia's underground water as a hydrogeologist. Over the years, rainfall over three fault lines has broken the region's limestone to form 50 sinkholes, 15 of which still hold water. ""The limestone's got cracks in it and it dissolves fairly easily in water. Caves develop from the rain coming through and the water soaking into the limestone and dissolving caves,"" Ian says. ""Five thousand years ago there were two major eruption series that blew lava and ash straight through the limestone, up the fault lines, and built Mount Gambier and Mount Schank."" The main fault lines run up through Naracoorte and its World Heritage-listed caves and from Victoria's Prince Margaret Rose Caves into the Mount Gambier volcano area and out towards Tantanoola and Mount Burr range. A third fault line runs from Nelson in Victoria across Mount Schank and the Kongorong Plain, south of Mount Gambier, which is home to most of the region's sinkholes. The two geological regions of underground cave channels to the north of Mount Gambier and sinkholes to the south intersect in the township itself, forming attractions like Umpherston Sinkhole and the Cave Gardens. The water eventually makes its way to Ewens Ponds and Eight Mile Creek, also explorable, and out to sea. ""Nowhere else in this continent is there such a fabulous reservoir of fresh water that's available for agriculture and everything else — the fact that you can drill a hole anywhere here and get water ... you just can't do that around the rest of Australia. ""We're the envy of every farmer in Australia."" The geological term for sinkholes containing water is cenote. ""That's a Mayan word from Mexico because of the limestone peninsula there, and that was their name for their sinkholes with water in which they used to live on 1,000 years ago,"" Ian says. Diver and Mars One contender Josh Richards moved to Mount Gambier in December 2020 to capitalise on the region's diving opportunities. ""Worldwide there's really not much, not like this,"" he says. Josh Richards relocated so he can dive regularly. ABC South East SA: Bec Whetham While the Nullarbor 1,517 kilometres away has the largest slab of limestone in the world, most of its caves aren't cenotes anymore — there's no lakes in them. You have to go down deep to find water. The only other comparable sites are in Florida and the Yucatan Peninsula in eastern Mexico. Cenotes are a popular attraction in Florida and Mexico. Supplied:  Del Sel Photography ""But [the water here] is much gentler than what you see in Florida and Mexico, so it's a lot harder, much, much harder,"" Josh says. ""The sinkholes here are far more complex and they're a lot squeezier — it's a lot of taking off equipment and wriggling through places instead of swimming down these big tunnels. ""Places like Florida and the Bahamas, they've got these huge caves with massive tunnels, the sort of thing you could drive a semi-trailer down."" Water soaks slowly into the limestone here and moves slowly towards the sea. Divers like Josh use the slow movement, the drift, as a guide for exploring new underwater channels. ""That's how we're finding a lot of these places, by searching out that flow and either following it or to push against it to see where it's coming from,"" Josh says. ""The stuff that we've got here in the Mount, because of the geology, because of those earthquake fractures and because of all the slow water movement, the caves are really young."" It was the sinkholes here that hooked Adelaide anaesthetist Richard ""Harry"" Harris onto cave diving. Richard's unique skill set of diving and medical expertise helped save a soccer team of 12 boys in July 2018 who were trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. His efforts earned him 2019 Australian of the Year honours. Cave diving is perilous at the best of times but finding and freeing 12 boys and their coach from Tham Luang posed extreme challenges. But his first experience cave diving on the Limestone Coast in 1986 was far from inspiring. ""I didn't really enjoy it that much. I was a poor medical student and I had a pretty crappy old wetsuit,"" he says. ""And it was July when I went down there, so it was cold and miserable."" It took 14 years and a dive at Kilsby Sinkhole in 2000 to spark his love of the region. ""That just completely blew my mind and changed my whole view of what freshwater sinkhole diving can be like. ""That was the moment that I really became obsessed with cave diving. ""It is spectacular."" The Limestone Coast has remained his local haunt since — there's little he hasn't explored. ""It's beautiful and it's very special to me, and it's world-class. There's no question. ""There's so much to see — the biology, the geology, the hydrology, there's lots of stuff to pique your interest."" While the sinkholes get a lot of the glory these days, it's Tank Cave, 10 kilometres of interconnected underground tunnels, that pulls in the serious divers. ""It's just truly beautiful … I doubt whether I've seen every corner of it myself,"" Richard says. ""Tank cave is the golden fleece for cave divers in the South East when they're training. That's always the gold that we have in mind. ""It's the most complex and potentially hazardous cave. ""Because it's got so many junctions and navigation issues around it, you really need to be very well trained."" While challenging, Tank Cave is nothing like Richard's experience in Tham Luang cave in Thailand which he says involved sump diving. ""Sump diving is a combination of dry caving and then short stretches of underwater sections and then you're back into a dry cave and hiking and dragging your gear through that sort of cave again. ""Nothing in Mount Gambier is really like that which is why the Mount Gambier caves are so beautiful. ""They're just permanently flooded which means the water is crystal clear, unlike the chocolate milk we were swimming through over there."" While Ian Lewis says many people don't realise the uniqueness and geological wonder of the Limestone Coast, things are changing. ""Slowly people are starting to understand after 50 years of research and talking about it and films and diving and publicity and everything like that,"" he says. The exploits of Richard Harris and others in 2018 shone a light on the region which of course helped. ""It was very weird at the time, but I'm really glad that it's done something to promote the South East and the caves that I love,"" Richard says. The owner of Kilsby Sinkhole, Graham Kilsby, has gradually commercialised his family's water hole into a popular snorkelling and dive site, gin distillery and star attraction of SA Tourism Commission adverts. ""I felt a pang of anxiety about what was going to happen to that cave … but getting to know Graham pretty well over the last few years, I understand now that he is as passionate about that cave as any of the divers,"" Richard says. ""He's done a fantastic job at bringing the South East into the world's eye with the way he's marketed and managed that site."" While some cavers may fear the sites are becoming overcrowded, Richard believes in the importance of visitors for conservation. ""The beauty of it is now all these people who aren't cave divers can come and witness the thing that made me so passionate about the caves. ""The more you understand what you're looking at, the more you learn to appreciate it. ""What you don't know or can't see, you can't understand or protect."" The early exploration of Ian Lewis and others has helped prohibit the dumping of rubbish into the region's sinkholes and dry caves. ""People started to learn that the groundwater you pump out of there for your houses or for your farm or for your animals, is the same stuff that has been polluted by the same people,"" Ian says. ""More understanding of when the groundwater moved like that allowed us to make much better rules for extracting water and draining water away from Mount Gambier."" The sinkholes that attract the most tourist attention these days are places like Little Blue Lake, Ewens Ponds and Kilsby Sinkhole — which can also be enjoyed with a swim on the surface. Even locals will spend summer afternoons after school or work camped on Little Blue's edges or floating in the cool water. It's the diving bit that isn't for everyone. Those brave enough are often navigating entirely by feel, relying on their equipment to keep them alive metres below the surface. A white-out is when the limestone breaks down, forming different types of nasty silt. ""It will hang in the water for a really long time, especially if there's little flow to clear it,"" Josh says. ""It basically whites it out, like you can't see a thing. ""We get black-out here as well, but that's generally areas where there's a lot more mud and sort of organic material."" Richard says divers are trained to dive in zero visibility and that he actually enjoys it. ""It's like a problem-solving exercise and it can be quite meditative — as long as you know things are under control. Obviously, it can be frightening if things aren't under control. ""But it's not the bogeyman that it sounds like once you're comfortable in that environment. ""Once you're happy under water, those things become quite fun."" He knows he's part of a special cohort. ""There's a very common theme; we're all kind of nerdy, slightly introverted people. ""Most of us, I think, describe not being good at team sports and preferring outdoor activities like hiking or climbing. ""It's possible that we're a bunch of weirdos, but I maintain that they're a good bunch and certainly a lot of fun to hang out with."" Josh Richards says of the 5,500 members in the Cave Divers Association of Australia, 600 are fairly active. ""And then there's a much smaller group who are really active; people like me who have moved here so we can dive all the time,"" he says. For Ian Lewis, it's hard to imagine his life starting anywhere else. ""If I didn't live in the Mount Gambier region, didn't know about caves, I might have lived in the Snowy Mountains and been a mountaineer or something and explored whatever environment I grew up in,"" he says. ""I'm just absolutely rapt that I grew up in this one, it's such a unique one.""

333,Taking care of business in the face of surging COVID infections,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus Businesses in New South Wales' south-east are trying to embrace the busy tourist season while navigating the effects that come with rising COVID-19 infections. The region has recorded 144 new cases today, with 89 of those in the Bega Valley, 31 in the Snowy Monaro, and 24 in the Eurobodalla. It comes a day after the south-east recorded its highest daily total since the pandemic began, with 186 infections announced on January 5. It is a bittersweet situation for businesses, who are trying to operate at full capacity over summer while managing the impacts of surging COVID-19 case numbers. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic ""Now's finally the first time in two years we've been consistently busy,"" Anita Nimmo, co-owner of Dudley's Café in Jindabyne, said. ""But everything is having to shut because everyone keeps getting COVID."" The traditionally busy summer period for south-east NSW was hampered in 2020 due to the Black Summer bushfires, and again in 2021 once COVID-19 took hold. Ms Nimmo is grateful to be open this summer as a high number of tourists return to the Snowy Mountains, but the high rates of transmission are having a direct impact on her business. ""We've got two staff out at the moment who are positive, so we're running out of people to work,"" she said. ""It's been two years; we can't keep doing nothing so we kind of have to live with it."" Ms Nimmo is hoping she will have enough staff to stay open for the time being, but is calling for the government to provide rent assistance or subsidies to businesses who are forced to close due to staff shortages caused by COVID-19 ""We've still got bills to pay ... so if we don't open, we won't be here,"" she said. ""If there's no more government money coming then everyone has to stay open and wait for herd immunity."" Businesses on NSW's far south coast are also welcoming the busy summer trade while dealing with COVID-19. The skipper of Reel Affair Fishing Charters in Merimbula, Phil Mitchell, was having a bumper summer after being booked out over the Christmas and new year period. But he has had to cancel tours temporarily after being diagnosed with COVID-19 and, as the sole operator, has no colleagues to run the charter boat in his place. ""I'm the only skipper of the boat, so I don't have anyone unfortunately,"" he said. ""I've had to shut the business down and it's cost a lot of money."" Towns on the NSW far south coast have seen a large volume of tourists visit from Victoria, Sydney and Canberra, comparable to pre-pandemic levels. Mr Mitchell is unsure if the high numbers will sustain for the remainder of summer, as COVID-19 cases continue to surge across NSW. ""This year was shaping up to be a good one because everyone was allowed out,"" Mr Mitchell said. ""People are still here, the town is still busy ... but people coming up later might be a little bit hesitant if our numbers keep jumping up."" ""It's out there anyway; I don't think it's ever going to go away.""

335,Lakes Entrance floating obstacle course opens to thousands ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Lakes Entrance locals armed with pumps set up new inflatable water park Locals armed with pumps and piloting tinnies have shown up to help set up a floating obstacle course at one of Gippsland's tourist hotspots. The Lakes Entrance Aqua Park was due to open before Christmas to capitalise on the town's summer tourist season, but freight delays caused by the pandemic meant the uninflated obstacles for the water course did not arrive until December 29. Company owner Will Yeap said the set-up was expected to take five days, but local interest helped speed up the process. ""We had locals that got their dads to bring their boats, tinnies, and there was a lot of help which was fortunate … we managed to open in about two-and-a-half days,"" he said. The water park has replaced the tourist paddle boats that had been operating on the lakes for nearly 40 years. The East Gippsland Shire Council has said the park would be a more significant drawcard for tourists. Mr Yeap last year said the park hoped to bring between 5,000 and 10,000 tourists to the area in its first year. Despite the delay to opening, he stands by those numbers. ""We opened on Friday at 3pm. There was a couple of hours of soft launch to train our staff, and there was a very quiet afternoon,"" he said. ""On Saturday and Sunday we got about 700 or 800 people. It far exceeded our expectations."" Mr Yeap runs a similar water park based on Canberra's Lake Burley Griffin, but found Lakes Entrance was proving much more popular. ""Lakes is doing almost double of Canberra, after its third year running,"" he said. ""It's such a prime location where everybody will walk over the footbridge to the surf, and everyone can see us,"" he said.

336,"Thousands were bound for Lorne's Pier to Pub this weekend, so organisers turned it virtual",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Organisers of two popular annual events in a regional Victorian tourist hotspot have cancelled with just three days to go due to rising COVID-19 case numbers. The Pier to Pub swim and Mountain to Surf run attract thousands of competitors and spectators each January to the Surf Coast town of Lorne. But ahead of this year's competitions this coming Friday and Saturday, the Lorne Surf Life Saving Club has announced a shift to virtual competitions ""out of an abundance of caution"". Event spokesman Mike Napolitano told ABC Radio Melbourne organisers felt bringing 25,000 people to Lorne ""was probably not the right thing to be doing"". Mr Napolitano said many volunteers had ""either succumbed to COVID or had to isolate, so we've had to really reassess how many volunteers we'd have for the event on the weekend"". ""The volunteerism we have in Lorne and the surf club to help support these events is key to their success and the safety of the competitors and spectators,"" he said. ""The other thing that's happening in the town is the health services down here — the local Lorne hospital, which we're extremely lucky to have — [has] also got a lot of pressure on it at the moment. ""Similarly, the local traders, cafes, restaurants, and all the services a town like Lorne needs to survive, they're also doing it hard with staff."" The organisers' decision was announced on a day Victoria recorded a record-high 14,020 new infections. During the nomination process race entrants were given the option to choose between a full refund or to compete in a virtual competition in the event of a cancellation. In a statement, the Lorne Surf Life Saving Club said competitors would now have until January 31 to complete the events virtually and record their time. Random prizes and medals will still be awarded, and T-shirts will be sent to those who compete virtually. Refunds would be processed in the next two weeks for those who requested them, the club said. Mr Napolitano said many families had been participating in the run and swim for ""decades"" and ""those people I have no doubt will be disappointed this decision has been made"". ""But having spoken to a lot of people in the past two hours, they understand this decision has been made in the best interests of the community,"" he said.

337,"Calls to lock down Darwin Aboriginal community as NT COVID cases drop to 58, reporting period changed",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  There are calls to lock down an Aboriginal community in Darwin where two people have tested positive to COVID-19 in recent days, as the Northern Territory recorded 58 new COVID cases overnight. Of the NT's new number, 20 cases are linked to overseas or international arrivals, 17 are close contacts of previous cases and there are two cases of community transmission. Investigation is still needed to identify the source of 19 additional cases. There are 21 people with COVID-19 in hospital in the NT, including 13 in Alice Springs, four in Tennant Creek Hospital and four patients in Royal Darwin Hospital. No patients with COVID-19 are in the ICU. The 58 new cases have been recorded in Greater Darwin, Alice Springs, Katherine and Tennant Creek. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic The two new cases for Alice Springs are known close contacts of interstate travellers. There are seven new cases for Katherine, including a Katherine Hospital worker whose infection was uncovered during routine screening, and who likely became infected from a patient at the facility. The source of the two Tennant Creek cases is under investigation. No cases are linked to Jabiru or Nhulunbuy. The update on case numbers was issued via press release, with no government ministers available for a press conference on Monday. That's despite several leaders of Bagot Community in Darwin telling the ABC they fear a surge in cases is inevitable, with two COVID cases recorded in the community since Friday. They say they fear the worst because the NT government has appeared to be absent from the community and silent on key information, despite the local cases. In the statement, the NT government said it had moved to a new ""24-hour reporting period"" with a cut-off of 8pm on the night before for all COVID-19 updates. Previously, the cut-off was 8am on the same day. This means that while the number is lower than the 95 recorded in the NT on Sunday, Monday's count is only for a 12-hour period. The statement said the changes were made due to ""larger case numbers and the extra work this has created for contact tracing and case validation"". A Territory-wide indoor mask mandate is still in place. On Sunday, NT Health Minister Natasha Fyles described the NT's record-high caseload of 95 as ""concerning, and did not rule out future restrictions such as a lockdown or lockout. On Sunday, there were 2,135 COVID-19 tests processed in the NT. Meanwhile, residents of Darwin's largest Aboriginal community say they have been left in the dark and forced to implement their own restrictions after two people tested positive to COVID-19 a few days ago. Late on Friday, a resident of Bagot Community, about 7 kilometres from the Darwin CBD, became the first person in one of Darwin's Aboriginal communities to test positive for the virus. A second case was detected in the community on Sunday. The cases come as Aboriginal peak health bodies call for more stringent COVID restrictions as the NT's daily COVID-19 cases continue to trend upwards. Natalie Howard, a member of the Bagot Community Advisory Group, said residents were afraid because authorities had not made contact with anyone to instruct them to isolate or get tested despite the two cases. She said they feared a surge in cases was inevitable. ""We've been told nothing,"" she said. ""We need help. ""We may look at locking down our own community."" She said members of the advisory board had taken it upon themselves to drive from house to house to encourage people to isolate. Marita Mummery, who is also on the community's advisory board, said COVID testing was difficult for most residents with the community's sole health clinic – Danila Dilba Health Service — closed for the holiday period. She also questioned the government's sense of urgency to prevent the spread of the virus after she had to call authorities to alert them that family members of a positive case needed to be tested, which she said has not yet happened. ""Come and assist us to lock our community down. We don't need visitors coming in to spread the virus more,"" she said. Resident Valemina White said she wanted a testing and vaccination clinic stood up in the community. ""We have lots of old people who are afraid … We need our old people because they hold our knowledge,"" she said. The community's full vaccination rate currently stands at about 60 per cent. John Paterson, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Medical Service Alliance of the NT, backed calls to lock the community down. He said that following the swift government response to recent outbreaks in Katherine, Robinson River and Binjari — which saw health teams rush in to test, trace and isolate close contacts and boost vaccination rates – it was disappointing to see a different approach being taken in Bagot. ""What has worked for us here in the past in the Northern Territory and why we've been able to keep COVID out for so long was because we went quick and we went hard,"" he said. ""What we have at Bagot is a very medium-sized community with a population with underlying illnesses and a population that is very vulnerable, very sick, and all it would take is a virus that spreads very quickly such as Omicron and the Delta to bring that whole community to its knees."" A Northern Land Council spokesman said the council supported calls by communities, including Bagot Community, for lockouts, ""where those calls are made in an informed and reasonable way"". The spokesman also called for better communication from the NT government and its agencies to regional and remote areas, for information to be provided in local Aboriginal languages where possible and for an adequate supply of vaccines, tests, masks and other PPE in communities. The NT Health Department has been contacted for comment.

338,"With La Niña bringing the rain, these natural wonders are set to put on a show",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Waterfalls across northern NSW you don't want to miss this wet summer With a wetter than average summer forecast, sightseers can expect to feel the spray of waterfalls and the roar of river systems full to the brim across northern New South Wales. From Ellenborough Falls on the mid-north coast to Wollomombi Falls near Armidale, here are some spectacular spots to visit these holidays that'll leave you speechless. At 200 metres high, Ellenborough Falls is the tallest single-drop waterfall in NSW. Located near Elands, the falls are about an hour's drive from both Taree via Bulga Road and Wauchope off the Pacific Highway near Port Macquarie. You can view the falls from two easy-access platforms, one is located right near the car park and picnic area, the other is a 10-minute stroll down a timbered walkway to ""the Knoll"" directly opposite the waterfall. If you want to get closer and enjoy a hike, you can take a 641-step descent down to the base of the falls. Take your time to catch your breath on the way down and keep an eye out for the birds and animals that make this special place their home. Crystal Shower Falls in Dorrigo National Park offers the chance to walk behind a waterfall. ""This rainforest comes to life in the wet,"" National Parks and Wildlife Service Coffs Coast area manager Glenn Storrie said. ""With rainfall expected over summer, the waterfalls including Crystal Shower Falls will be pumping."" Just an hour's drive west from Coffs Harbour, the 4.4-kilometre walk starts from Dorrigo Rainforest Centre and winds through a towering forest. From the suspension bridge across the valley, there are fantastic views of the water gushing into the pool below. ""Don't miss the short side track leading behind the waterfall into a rocky cavern, where you can look through the veil of falling water,"" Mr Storrie said. Located less than half an hour's drive or a short helicopter ride from Armidale, a trip to Wollomombi falls offers a chance to traverse the raging Wollomombi River and admire the majesty of two impressive features. Located in the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park, Wollomombi Falls can be viewed from a number of locations, including a 4km walk around the rim of the gorge where you can take in the Chandler Falls as well. Sydney's Rob and Margie Collins were taking in the wonders of the Waterfall Way, which runs inland from Armidale to Coffs Harbour and visited Wollomombi Falls, in December. ""Spectacular, amazing, the gorge is so impressive,"" Ms Collins said. ""The tip would be to come after we've had record rainfalls."" While in the Armidale area check out the Dangars Falls, just 17km south-east of the city. The picnic area offers dramatic views of the water as it cascades 120 metres into the ravine below. Fed by the Salisbury Watercourse rather than a river, it is best viewed after rain. Killen Falls is home to one of the last-standing remnants of the big scrub rainforest which once blanketed the Northern Rivers before being cleared by cedar cutters. While swimming is not safe, the waterfall is still a scenic spot worth viewing this summer with predictions of high rainfall and therefore water tumbling over the cliffs. The 10m waterfall on the Emigrant Creek catchment at Tintenbar is just a short 20-minute drive from Ballina. You can witness the falls for yourself from a viewing platform just 300m from the car park or for experienced bushwalkers there's a steep 1km trek to the base.

339,analysis: Working holidaymakers are set to return to Australia this year — but will they want to?,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Working holidaymakers will be one of the first international visitor markets to return to Australia in 2022. But as global travel slowly resumes and many young people start thinking about working overseas again, global competition for this market will be intense. Australia will need to out-compete other destinations to bring working holidaymakers back, particularly those from Europe. There were more than 300,000 working holidaymakers in Australia per year before the pandemic. The absence of these workers resulted in a loss of more than $3.2 billion in visitor spending in 2020. It has also created critical labour shortfalls, particularly in regional Australia. With borders reopening, the Australian government needs to rethink its working holiday program. It needs not only to make it easier for young travellers to come back, but also to have a better understanding of their goals and expectations of a fulfilling working holiday experience. The working holiday visa program was established in 1975 as a cultural exchange initiative. Working holidaymaker visas are available for young people (mostly aged 18 to 30) and typically last for one year, though there can be opportunities to extend this. Australia now has reciprocal agreements with 45 countries. Backpackers keen to return to Australia investigate ways to qualify for additional working holidaymaker visas. The program has remained open throughout the pandemic to people from eligible countries. Yet, visa applications declined by an astonishing 99.5 per cent in 2020. People were free to apply for working holiday visas, but the closed borders prevented them from actually coming. Working holidaymakers spend more and stay longer than any other international visitor. On average, they spend $10,400 per trip and stay 149 nights. In comparison, other international visitors to Australia [spend $5,211 per trip and stay 32 nights, on average. One-third of working holidaymakers come from the UK, Germany and France. However, there is a growing demand in Asia. In 2019, almost 29 per cent of working holidaymakers were from Japan, South Korea and China. Combining study with a working holiday is particularly attractive for young people from Asia. As such, reactivating this market after the pandemic is critical to rebuilding Australia's international education sector. According to Tourism Australia, the most popular jobs for working holidaymakers are waiter, farmhand, construction worker and childcare worker. New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland were the most affected by the absence of these visitors — the three states accounted for 83 per cent of working holiday jobs in 2019. But this doesn't mean working holidaymakers stay in capital cities. In fact, they disperse more widely around the country than other international visitors. These travellers have been sorely missed in regional Australia, which has suffered from crippling labour shortages during the pandemic. Cairns, Port Douglas and other areas in northern Queensland have been the most severely affected. This year, the Queensland government launched the $7.5 million ""Work in Paradise"" scheme, offering a $1,500 incentive to lure young Australians to work in tourism and hospitality jobs in regional Queensland. Extending this program to overseas workers could be instrumental in bringing foreign working holidaymakers back to Queensland as borders reopen. As a first step to restarting this market, the Australian government has removed the visa application charge for those working holidaymakers who were previously granted a visa but were unable to come to Australia because of the pandemic. They have also relaxed some visa requirements, such as allowing working holidaymakers to work for one employer for up to 12 months (up from six months previously). This is aimed at encouraging holidaymakers to take jobs in the tourism and hospitality industry. Australia and the UK have also just signed a free trade agreement that will extend the reciprocal working holidaymaker agreement between the countries. This includes increasing the age eligibility from 30 to 35 years and visa duration for up to three years, and having no job-specified work requirements. But luring working holidaymakers back will require more than just loosening the rules. We need to delve deeper into what motivates these young people to take a working holiday trip, particularly to Australia. In the past, these travellers have worked in low-skilled, low-paid jobs. This experience has also been seen as a ""gap year"" between high school and university. But those in Generation Z have different life aspirations than previous generations. Many are increasingly focused on kick-starting their careers, and taking a year off to travel abroad may be less attractive. So, for destinations like Australia, it's important to offer opportunities for young people to use their working holiday to gain critical skills and experience for their careers, not just make money to travel. The Gold Coast-based Global Work and Travel Company, for example, now offers overseas internships so young people can advance their professional skills while gaining international travel experience. Some backpacker accommodations have also closed or shifted to other purposes during the pandemic. So, one thing local leaders can do is ensure there is adequate low-cost accommodation to support returning travellers. The government also needs to make it affordable and easy to travel to Australia. Subsidising airfares to get them here, making it easier to find job vacancies, and providing low-cost or free transport out to the regions would help. Employers also need to ensure holidaymakers are well-treated and have an enjoyable work experience. This requires stronger mechanisms to ensure employers are complying with the legal requirements around fair pay and adequate workplace conditions for those on temporary visas. Sexual harassment, requests to wear a bikini, being asked to lure other backpackers into exploitative schemes, and an hourly wage of just $2.50 — these are the stories of backpackers working under the Federal Government's visa scheme. Improving the working holiday experience can have long-term benefits for the country. Research shows that many visitors develop a deep emotional attachment and affinity for Australia during an extending working holiday stay and return multiple times throughout their lives. They can develop an understanding of Australian society and our economic and business practices during their experience. As such, they can help build future trade and investment opportunities between Australia and other countries. So, making working holiday travel easy, fun and safe is not only vital to getting Australia's tourism industry back on track — it's critical for the country's long-term engagement with the world. We need to make this a priority in 2022. Sarah Gardiner is Deputy Director at Griffith Institute for Tourism, Griffith University. This piece first appeared on The Conversation.

340,'We met this old guy called Les': Milestone walk for wilderness regular 'Gandalf',travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Les Whittle, 'Gandalf' of the Overland Track, notches up 20th walk Les Whittle never intended to be notching up a 20th walk on Tasmania's iconic Overland Track. In fact, after his first time on the remote track in the early 1970s he said he would never do it again. ""Who would ever want to do something like this?"" Mr Whittle thought, at the end of the walk. After a 40-year hiatus he did the walk again, and says that ""the bug got him"". ""I didn't plan to keep walking it; it's crept up on me,"" he says. ""I did a couple just to be with friends and family and now I find I'm enjoying it. ""There's a challenge in starting at one end and coming out at a very different spot in Tasmania."" In late January, the 72-year-old former counsellor will set out for the 20th time on the 65-kilometre track that starts at Cradle Mountain and weaves through some of Tasmania's tallest mountains. The walk takes four to six days, with walkers basing themselves at a series of huts for the night. Mr Whittle has done the walk with his children, colleagues and walkers he has met on the track in the past and kept in touch with. ""I've been invited to do this next walk with a couple of people I met on the track 12 months ago,"" he says. ""They planned to do it and they said, 'We met this old guy called Les and he was good company. We'll invite him to join us'."" Mr Whittle walked the Overland Track three times in 2021 and has been doing it at least twice a year for the past five years. His daughter, Jessie, says she thinks her dad is a ""little nuts"". ""But I'm super proud of him,"" she says. ""I just love seeing people do what they love and pursuing their passion and for Dad that's the Overland Track."" Ms Whittle shares his passion for the outdoors, but she likes to enjoy it by running and is planning to run the track in early 2023. ""We're both getting the joy of being out in nature, but we get it in different ways with Dad taking his sweet time and me flying through in 10 hours,"" she says. ""It's a different journey to the same end."" Mr Whittle recently walked the track by himself for the first time. ""I pushed it and did longer days and skipped a few huts and I was able to do it in just over three days,"" he says. It meant walking up to 24 kilometres a day. ""I came out thinking 'I'm not as lazy as I thought. I can do it',"" he says. Mr Whittle has been called Gandalf on more than one occasion while on the track and says the Lord of the Rings nickname may have more meaning than just his white beard. ""We'll go with the beard, but sometimes they pretend that I'm old,"" he says. ""I'm meant to actually be smarter and wiser than I am."" One of his quirks while on the walk is dressing up at the halfway mark, which for most people is New Pelion Hut. ""It's a bit like a passenger liner crossing the equator and celebrating. I reckon crossing the halfway mark of the Overland Track should be celebrated,"" he says. ""So I'll take something crazy like wear a tie or take a Christmas pudding for a treat and get dressed up for the evening meal. ""Some people have said, 'Hey, there's an old man in there and he's got a beard and he's wearing a tie'."" Mr Whittle says the tradition has caused embarrassment for his family when they have joined him on the walk. While it's hard to pack food for a six-day walk, Mr Whittle has got his menu down pat. ""I'm getting better at cooking good food on the way,"" he says. ""The signature dish in more recent times is the sweets for after the main course. ""I've learnt to make a self-saucing chocolate pudding at New Pelion Hut still using fresh eggs that haven't broken on the track."" Mr Whittle says the scenery on the Overland Track is always changing. ""In late spring the array of flowers is just amazing. It's staggering what we have up in our alpine areas,"" he says.

341,Barney Miller's on a mission to inspire with 'life-changing' adventure around Australia,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Couple from regional NSW inspire people with disabilities to fulfil their travel dreams Barney Miller has conquered some of the country's biggest waves, now the quadriplegic surfer is fulfilling his dream of driving around Australia. More than two decades ago, Mr Miller broke the C6 vertebra in his neck in a car accident and was diagnosed with a form of quadriplegia. After years of intensive rehabilitation, the 42-year-old has regained movement in his arms and can breathe independently. Mr Miller and wife Kada left their home in Sawtell on the NSW mid-north coast at the start of the year to drive around Australia. From sailing with dolphins off the coast of Monkey Mia in Western Australia to swimming with whale sharks, the couple has made their dream holiday a reality. ""It's been a life-changing adventure,"" Mr Miller said. Mrs Miller said their modified campervan was equipped with ramps, hand-controlled levers to control the brakes and acceleration, and other features that enabled her husband to drive. ""The one thing he is going to tick off [his bucket list] is that he drove all the way around Australia. He won't let me drive,"" Mrs Miller said. She said their adventures had inspired others to support loved ones with disabilities to fulfil their dream holidays. ""We've met quite a few people on the road who have said: 'My uncle, my cousin, someone that they know, is in a similar situation and has dreamed of doing something like this,"" Mrs Miller said. ""Just to see us being able to do it has given them that encouragement to know that it's possible."" Australia's travel industry has become increasingly accessible and more inclusive for those with disability. But preparation and contacting tourism companies in advance was key for Mrs Miller to ensure her husband could participate in various activities and tours. ""There's been quite a few places that have put in the effort to be inclusive,"" Mrs Miller said. ""And if they're not, find another one."" When the couple contacted a joy flight operator in Broome, Mr Miller said the organisers had never flown anyone in a wheelchair, but the company obtained all the certifications required to ensure he would not miss out on the experience. ""They did everything to make sure I could get on the plane. It was super incredible,"" he said. ""One of my friends and the pilot lifted me into and out of the plane. ""It's a hard thing to ask for help sometimes, but it is incredible how much help you can get when you ask."" Despite the challenges, Barney and Kada Miller hope their trip will inspire others to make their dream holidays a reality. ""You don't have to be limited by anything really, it's just a matter of perspective,"" Mrs Miller said. Flying for work or to go on a holiday was a traumatic experience for Emma Gallagher, who has autism. ""I just found it very overwhelming. I would often have to travel with another person who would support me because I wasn't able to get through a whole trip on my own,"" Ms Gallagher said. ""Now, I have the independence to travel on my own if I need to."" Ms Gallagher works with not-for-profit Autism Spectrum Australia, which has been part of a recent project at Sydney Airport to make air travel more accessible and inclusive. A sunflower lanyard is available for those with non-visible disability to discreetly identify to staff – who have undergone specialist training — that they may need assistance. Visual stories about how to prepare for air travel as well as an online feature that maps noises, smells and lighting around the airport are among the new measures. The changes have helped travellers such as Ms Gallagher and others make catching a flight a more enjoyable experience. ""Being able to use those resources, that sensory map, to find the quietest part of the terminal so that I could just chill out until I got on the plane,"" she said. Ms Gallagher said the benefits of the initiative went beyond those with disability, and also assisted elderly people, those with dementia and those who spoke English as a second language. ""A lot of the resources are developed in plain, easy-to-read English, and it's designed to support as many people as possible,"" she said. Getting to the destination isn't the only challenge. Western Australia-based holiday planner Kass Langdon specialises in supported tours and trips for individuals and groups. But she said the biggest issue was a supply shortage in specialist equipment, such as cars and certain aircraft, prompted by numerous factors including the COVID-19-induced economic downturn and a surge in demand for assisted holidays. Ms Langdon said the waitlist for certain transport could be more than 12 months. ""It's very difficult for people to find the right accommodation and the right transport for them,"" Ms Langdon said.

342,analysis: Air travel is at the end of an era and it will get most expensive from here,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Why COVID-19 means the era of ever cheaper air travel could be over After its worst two years since the second world war, 2022 is looking brighter for the global airline industry. For passengers, though, the chance to travel at low cost again may prove short-lived. In 2020 international passenger demand was less than 25 per cent that of 2019, according to the International Air Transport Association. This year's data isn't yet available, but the hiccups of the Delta and Omicron variants make the association's forecasts of 50 per cent of 2019 levels look optimistic. With international and domestic routes reopening, airlines are offering a range of special deals on airfares. These deals are partly to entice back uncertain travellers and partly to compensate passengers for costs required to travel internationally, such as fees for COVID tests. But don't expect the cheap fares to last. They are likely to have a brief life span, as the industry come to grips with post-pandemic realities minus the government support that enabled so many, contrary to predictions, to survive. Now comes a reckoning, as surviving airlines seek to return to viability, repair their debt-laden balance sheets and future-proof their operations, with no guarantee they'll get the same government support when the next crisis hits. What this may mean is abandoning the business model of wafer-thin profit margins that delivered ever cheaper airfares from the 1970s until the beginning of 2020. Up until the 1970s the airline industry was highly regulated. Domestically, this was often done by governments to protect state-owned airlines. Australia's ""two-airline policy"", for example, restricted competition on major routes to just two airlines — the government-owned Trans Australia Airlines and a private competitor (Ansett Airlines for most that time). Internationally, airfares were kept high by price cooperation through the International Air Transport Association (IATA), often described as a cartel. There were two ticket pricing levels — first-class and economy. Until 1970 the biggest commercial jet aircraft was a Boeing 707, which could accommodate 180 passengers at a squeeze. Airfares had to be high to cover the high cost of operations (especially jet fuel). Most airlines accepted the IATA fare levels. Discounting was rare. Then in 1970 came the Boeing 747 jumbo jet, which more than doubled flights' passenger capacity, from 180 to 440. This led to many changes in aviation operations and costs. Jumbo jets also enabled greater seat-pricing flexibility, with the introduction of business and premium economy classes. When I began work as a travel consultant in 1981 the regulation of air fares was beginning to unravel. The official IATA economy return fare from Sydney to London was about $3,500. But you could find fares on selected airlines for about $2,500. (This was still several months' wages for most, with Australian average weekly full-time earnings in 1981 being $311 for men and $241 for women.) In the 1980s and 1990s, travel agents began to set themselves up as ""bucket shops"" specialising in offering discounted air fares to fill empty seats on less popular airlines. This was how Flight Centre started. It opened its first shopfront in Sydney in 1982, followed by stores in Melbourne and Brisbane. (It now has more than 650 shops in Australia, and more than 550 in 10 other countries.) Lower costs and plummeting air fares made the IATA's fares increasingly irrelevant. With the global rise of low-cost carriers, many of which were not IATA members, the IATA finally abandoned so-called ""YY"" fare-setting in 2017. Government regulation was also unwinding. Australia's two-airline policy ended in October 1990. Deregulation permitted more competitors, and airfares were driven by the market rather than set by regulatory bodies. By 2019, a return fare between Sydney and London on a reputable airline could be bought for about $1,250, less than Australia's average full-time adult average weekly earnings of $1,658. A Sydney-Perth return fare that cost about $1,100 in 1981 could be bought in 2019 for less than $300. These price falls depended on airlines embracing a business model based on lower profits per customer but flying a lot more customers, cutting fixed overheads by using larger-capacity aircraft. This business model contributed to the number of global tourists increasing from about 166 million in 1970 to 1.5 billion in 2019. But it also meant airlines needed planes full of passengers to make a profit. By 2019 the average pre-COVID profit margin per passenger on a long-haul international return flight was about US$10. It's difficult to see how running on razor-thin margins can continue to be the industry model. During 2022 it is likely we will see consolidation within the industry, with the airlines that survive looking to diversify into other businesses, such as catering or insurance. Low-cost carriers may still be viable, but only by convincing customers to pay for ""ancillaries"" beyond the airline seat, such as in-flight snacks, extra luggage capacity or a booking a hire car. Although most airlines are committed to limiting price increases, there is no escaping the fact they have two years of massive losses to make up and the continuing extra cost of COVID-related regulations to absorb. Higher margins with lower passenger volumes looks the more probable model. David Beirman is Senior Lecturer in Tourism at University of Technology Sydney.

343,"Green light for $40 million Rottnest redevelopment, with hotel to be named using Whadjuk Noongar language",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Rottnest Island Lodge construction by Place Development to start next year after green light A $40 million redevelopment of the Rottnest Island Lodge has been given approval, but there are conditions to ensure the site's significant Indigenous history is acknowledged. The popular holiday island, off the coast of Fremantle in Western Australia, is known by the Whadjuk Noongar people as Wadjemup. The approval is conditional on an Aboriginal cultural heritage plan for the site and using Whadjuk Noongar language to name the new 102-room hotel, while the Whadjuk people will also provide advice and monitor the project. This will help acknowledge the island was used as a prison for almost 4,000 Aboriginal men and boys from across Western Australia between 1838 and 1931. The former Tentland camping ground for tourists, now known as the Wadjemup Aboriginal Burial Ground, is where at least 373 Aboriginal men are buried in unmarked graves. It is the largest deaths in custody site in Australia and the largest known burial ground of Aboriginal people. A consortium led by Place Development has been given the green light to start redeveloping the Lodge from mid-2022, with completion due in 2025. As well as 102 accommodation rooms, there will be food and beverage outlets, a cafe, a restaurant with a focus on Western Australian produce, a wellness centre and two pools. The developers will have to have a Whadjuk Aboriginal Monitor present on site during excavation works or ground disturbance activity. They will also need to engage heritage practitioners to advise on the build. The former 29-cell prison, known as the Quod, adjoining the Lodge, which was closed as holiday accommodation in 2018, is not part of the redevelopment project and will not form part of the new hotel. Tourism Minister Roger Cook said he was pleased the project had been approved. ""This is an opportunity to re-create the Lodge in harmony with its outstanding natural setting, ensuring that it complements the historic built environment of the precinct, and respects the Aboriginal history of the area,"" he said. ""Importantly, the conditions applied to this redevelopment will help ensure the significant heritage of the site is acknowledged. ""It is important for Wadjemup to embrace its future with deep respect for the past."" Ian Macrae is the deputy convenor of volunteer group, The Rottnest Society. He expressed general support for the redevelopment but thought it was too tall, reaching more than 7 metres in part. He believed that was unnecessary. ""It could be dealt with [by] the development hugging the contours and being stepped down, rather than just sort of jutting out over the contour,"" he said. He was also concerned the refurbishment and protection of the Quod would not happen. ""There is a need for the Quod to be addressed, to protect its heritage and reinforce it, and that's just been put off into the future,"" Mr Macrae said.

344,'Hopeless situation': Regional health system buckles as COVID-19 PCR test demand soars,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Sancia West and her seven-year-old twin daughters are bracing for a long wait for a COVID-19 test in regional NSW after they were deemed by health authorities as close contacts of a positive case. As COVID-19 daily cases soar into their thousands, a six-hour wait at testing clinics has become the norm in recent days as the state's health system is inundated with close contacts, people with symptoms and those who need a test to travel interstate. Queuing outside at a testing clinic in Gosford, on the state's central coast, Dr West said she had has asked health workers to prioritise daughter Elizabeth, who has autism and intellectual disabilities. ""That's not the kind of health system that we aspire to have or that we expect to have here,"" Dr West said. ""If we can get in quickly and hopefully be tested that should make it easier, otherwise, I'm going to have to use the usual parent tricks of taking lots of snacks and an iPad chock full of cartoons and hope that the weather holds out."" But Dr West, who has a PhD in nursing, is disappointed these pressures are being experienced almost two years after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. ""It's something we shouldn't have gotten to this far into the pandemic,"" she said. In parts of regional NSW, people are queuing for tests as early as 4am. Some are sleeping in their cars overnight. In Coffs Harbour, on the state's Mid North Coast, the main testing facility was turning people away after reaching full capacity on Tuesday morning. Some drove north to Grafton in a bid to get a test, Clarence Valley woman Nicole Lancaster said. She was among those who got to a testing clinic in Grafton before 8.30am when security began turning people away. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic ""We waited and waited and waited. We were all sunburnt, dehydrated,"" she said. ""There was an old lady in front of us — she would have been about 80 — she got quite faint, sitting there for nine hours on a camping stool. ""The staff were amazing, security guards were amazing. It's just a totally hopeless situation."" On the NSW south coast, Jessica Dawson runs a testing clinic at South East Regional Hospital, Bega. She said most tests had been done on people planning to travel interstate for holidays. ""About 65 per cent are people from the area, travelling usually to Queensland, sometimes Tasmania,"" she said. With Queensland today scrapping the day-five PCR test for visitors, many already in the Sunshine State hope they can now enjoy a more relaxing holiday. But that's no comfort to people like Julie Purcell, stranded south of the border because of the escalating pressure on the NSW health system. She arrived in Sydney from London on December 11 and hoped to reunite with family in Brisbane on December 25 – the day her mandatory quarantine period ended. On December 23, Ms Purcell followed Queensland's requirement to have a PCR test 72 hours prior to her flight to Brisbane — but her negative result came back almost 100 hours later, blocking her ineligible to cross the border. ""It's a hard one to swallow when you've travelled all the way from London to make it for Christmas in Brisbane and you don't make it,"" she said. She decided to drive from Sydney to cross the border, stopping at Port Macquarie – where she decided to bypass the queues and pay $150 for a private test. She called on the Queensland government and others around the country to improve collaboration about COVID-19 entry requirements. ""The experience is very unpleasant,"" Ms Purcell said. ""I think the planning should have been better in the sense that there's not enough resources in NSW to do the test and get the test back within the 72 hours.""

345,"New year, new lease on life for Maldon's gold rush ghost village",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Life returning to central Victorian goldfields ghost town Porcupine Village A major redevelopment of a gold rush-style ghost town is taking shape, with plans to open to tourists next year. Porcupine Village, Maldon, in the central goldfields near Bendigo, was a popular tourist attraction in the 1990s with about 40 ramshackle buildings designed as a rustic mining settlement in the 1850s. But since 2007, it's been an eerie shell of itself, empty, locked and unloved until it was sold in late 2020 to an entrepreneur with big visions for the site. ""It's been sitting here with padlocks on the buildings,"" said village manager, Doug Baird. ""We opened it up and almost everything is still there, which is pretty amazing."" The original owner created some of the buildings while others are originals brought in from around the state. Local construction workers are now bringing back to life the town's attractions, including a pub, bowling alley, school, jail, dance hall, general store and hairdresser. ""This more replicates a village which would have popped up on the goldfields to service the gold miners,"" said Mr Baird. Mr Baird said the village has also attracted the interest of teachers. ""The education sector will be a big part of the village. We've already had inquiries from schools who are keen to do Australian history lessons out there,"" he said. ""The whole place is pockmarked with original diggings, and we're going to set up miners tents and camps to give people a real taste of what the region would have been like in the 1850s."" Business organisation Maldon Inc's Clif Edwards said the revamped attraction would complement the rest of the town. ""Maldon is the first notable town, which means the National Trust of Victoria made much of the town heritage in 1966, due to the industrial and gold history,"" he explained. ""This will bring back what it was like living in the area in the 1800s. ""While the accommodation and pub is beautifully renovated at Porcupine Village, so much of the rest of it is not glossed over. ""It's not pretty pictures of the gold rush days. It's raw, which is what I like. it's got dirt on the floors, it's got mud."" Mr Baird is hopeful the village could also attract stars to the area, as the site already has a growing list of film appearances. ""The TV series The Man from Snowy River was filmed here in the '90s, as was the movie The Legend of Ben Hall,"" he said. ""Since we've been here we've rented it out for a couple of music videos and even a short film.""

347,"opinion: Some of Australia's 150 'big things' are still standing, others are grappling with identity crises",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  From the Big Banana to the Big Oyster, Australia's 'big things' are still striving to put small towns on the map On a balmy night in 2006, on the back verandah of a face-brick suburban home in Tully, a small town on Queensland's Cassowary Coast, a group of men stood around a few oversized amphibian limbs made of polystyrene, debating the anatomy of frogs. Roger, who was charged with carving the creature — which now clings to a giant golden gumboot in the town's centre — defended against accusations its left foot was on backwards. Ron was not convinced. In some ways it was an absurd assignment, but it was driven by a powerful desire to put Tully on the map. Because ever since cars began crisscrossing Australia, regional towns have had to compete for drive-by business, and ""big things"" — a big banana, big pineapple, big prawn — have meant the difference between visitors stopping here or there. But how relevant are big things today? With regional tourism opening up again after long COVID lockdowns in NSW and Victoria, what do these giant attractions mean to small towns and the locals who maintain them? Are they really the best way of telling the stories of our regions, or is there a less kitschy, more thoughtful way of attracting visitors? There are more than 150 of these enormous beasts scattered across the country. Some are furry, like the Big Merino in Goulburn NSW, others have razor sharp claws. At the Dadswells Bridge in Victoria there is a giant koala with piercing red eyes that glow at night. In Taree NSW, a big oyster has laid claim to the roof of a used car dealership. With so many of these oversized installations strewn about you might think they form part of a national tourism initiative. But big things are a grassroots phenomenon, each one dreamt up and built by small groups of passionate people. Most depict crops or exports — a reminder that in regional Australia, industry and identity aren't easily separated. Australians have been fascinated by ""big things"" since the 1960s, but the decades-long practice of building novelty attractions has begun to reach a crisis point. Of course, big things were once popular creatures. Tasked with the noble purpose of signifying their place, they stood proud beside regional highways. People from neighbouring towns and far off cities stopped to marvel at them, spend a few bob and even climb inside to check out the view. But today many are in a sorry state of disrepair. As Amy Clarke, a senior lecturer in history at the University of the Sunshine Coast, has observed, the original big things of the '60s and '70s have become something of an endangered species. New highway routes and dwindling local patronage mean many big things are under threat. Desperate to save them from the scrap heap, many owners have relocated, added rides and restaurants or launched crowd-funding campaigns to keep them alive. For a lucky few, like the Big Pineapple, this seems to be working — they're receiving the required upkeep. The fate of other big things, though, is less certain. Without visitation their coats have discoloured, their fangs have lost bite. Many are falling apart. But their reasons for being have not gone anywhere. Small towns still rely on drive-by business and, for many, tourism infrastructure is crucial. Perhaps surprisingly, some small towns are still building big things in a bid to boost tourism. There's the Big Thermometer in Stanthorpe (2018), the Big Melon in Chinchilla (2018) and the Big Bogan in Nyngan (2015). In 2007, the big things phenomenon inspired a documentary called Big Dreamers, which focuses on Tully and its big frog-clad gumboot. At the time, the once prosperous sugar cane region was experiencing something of an identity crisis after Brazil dumped its sugar surplus on the global market. Tasked with finding a solution to the economic gap left by sugar cane, a group of local men decided to build Tully's big thing, in the hope of driving tourism. Their choice of mascot was a 7.9m tall gumboot, emblematic of Tully's record rainfall of 7.9 metres in 1950. Big Dreamers depicts big things as objects of curiosity and their small towns as strange foreign lands. The film poster's graphic design, with its carnivalesque typography and red drapes, echoes Tully's struggle for identity as a sideshow in a travelling circus. Yet for towns like Tully, the struggle is real — and big things are built with even bigger expectations. Though their designs vary wildly, each big thing is built for the same reason: to express the identity of an area and put it 'on the map'. In the contemporary design world, we call this a ""sense of place"" — the distinct character of an area, its landscapes and local stories. But as a designer, I can't help but see the story of Tully as evidence of a dated, colonial approach to placemaking by a group of older white men — of a failure to evolve. For me, big things are a missed opportunity for design, and risk reducing our regions to cartoons of commodity. Surely in 2021 we can do better? Sensitive responses to landscape, consultation with First Nations people and heritage interpretation are all becoming expected parts of the critical design process. Even small structures benefit from this; when they're designed thoughtfully, lookouts, visitor centres and toilet blocks can become tourism attractions in their own right. Recent regional projects like the Kalbarri Skywalk in WA or the Warumbungles Visitor Centre in NSW have attracted glowing online reviews from tourists for their unique visitor experiences and critical acclaim from the design community for their subtle abstractions of surrounding landscapes. So why then, did that group of men in Tully choose to build a giant gumboot? It's not as if they were oblivious to big things' kitsch reputation. Nor were they under any false impression that a gumboot could fill the economic gap left by the sugar cane industry. Even Tully's townspeople were sceptical. As one concerned local neatly put it in the film: ""What hope do we have when [with] everything that is wrong in our industry, in our town, the best we can come up with is a frog on the edge of a tacky gumboot?"" In a 2010 radio interview, Ron Hunt, the man who first proposed Tully's big thing, was asked to reflect on the effect of his creation. Ron described the boot as a success, but not in an economic sense. ""It gets people to break their trip and come into town,"" he said. ""They may only buy a cup of coffee or nothing at all, but they come into town ... and that's what matters."" Ron acknowledged the presence of the ""naysayers"" while the gumboot was being built, but said that once it was on site, ""people were coming up and asking how they could help"". And help they did. The cost of the boot blew out from $35,000 to $90,000, and local townspeople contributed a further $60,000 of trade and labour to see the project through. Since then, the boot has weathered two cyclones and required several restorations — the most recent in 2015 cost a further $50,000. Each time, Tully has rallied behind their big thing to ensure it remains a pivotal part of their tourism offering. In that way, perhaps big things can be viewed as unique expressions of community. Each one depends on the energy of individuals, motivated by their love for their town. As Camille Hardman, the director of Big Dreamers, explained, each big thing ""has never been built before and will likely never be built again"". Each one is created in a ""confined environment with no money or materials"", she said, and ""depends solely on local tradesmen"". Judging big things against contemporary tourism infrastructure, then, may be missing the point. Sure, elegant visitor centres appeal to tourists and designers, but what of the local people they represent? A record rainfall of 7.9m may not seem like obvious boasting rights to some, but for Tully, the title of ""a really wet place"" matters. Big things are truly unique because they aren't part of a national tourism initiative. They aren't funded through government budgets or developed in consultation with big teams of experts. Their form, materiality and the stories they tell are selected by the people who decide to make them. For all their kitschy cringe, these oversized artefacts deserve their place in our collective culture, even if for some it's fading. And the lucky few that survive and thrive will continue to put their town on the map.

348,Sydney Airport says 80 flights cancelled as COVID-19 puts strain on airline staff,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Dozens of domestic flights have been cancelled across the country on Christmas Eve as COVID-19 requirements put a strain on airline staff. A Sydney Airport spokeperson said at least 80 domestic flights had been cancelled across all airlines. Jetstar confirmed a large number of its staff had been forced to get tested for COVID-19 and isolate, resulting in some late adjustments to its schedule. A Jetstar spokesperson said the airline apologised for the impact of the changes and was working with passengers to find replacement flights. ""Unfortunately like many people in Sydney and Melbourne, a large number of our frontline team members are being required to test and isolate as close contacts given the increasing number of cases in the general community, and as a result we have had to make some late adjustments to our schedule,"" the spokesperson said. ""We appreciate the frustration this causes, especially as customers are travelling for Christmas, and sincerely apologise for the impact these changes are having on travel plans. ""We are working to minimise any delays and re-accommodating passengers on flights as close as possible to their original departure times across both Jetstar and Qantas services."" A Virgin Australia spokesperson said all passengers would make it to their final destination on Friday and nobody would be left stranded for Christmas. ""All impacted guests were contacted prior to travel and automatically moved onto alternative services that are departing as close to the original departure time as possible,"" the spokesperson said. Epidemiologist Alexandra Martiniuk  warned crucial industries faced ""massive disruption"" in the coming months as more and more workers were taken out of action after being deemed close contacts. Staffing headaches emerged across many Sydney workplaces this week after a recent surge in COVID-19 case numbers, with 5,612 infections confirmed on Friday. Those deemed a close contact, such as someone from the same household, must isolate for seven days and return two negative PCR tests before being allowed to return to work. ""Even if Omicron was so mild it caused zero hospitalisations, the disruption to our society and health system in terms of workers isolating is massive, especially in crucial workplaces such as food, healthcare and transportation,"" Professor Martiniuk said.

349,"Cyclone-ravaged Kalbarri residents fume over insurance delays, but Christmas could bring cheer",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Kalbarri tourism businesses still recovering eight months after Cyclone Seroja damage Eight months after Cyclone Seroja tore through the Mid West holiday township of Kalbarri, it still bears the scars of the cyclone's fury. A drive along the foreshore reveals destroyed hotels, tarps on private house roofs, and security fencing barring entry to damaged properties. Many are frustrated at lengthy delays with insurance companies accepting building quotes and difficulties obtaining and accommodating builders. Tourism operators, meanwhile, worry opening borders will mean another hit for tourism as holiday-makers once again set their sights overseas. But those who are open for business expect a busy Christmas holiday season ahead and look forward to having international visitors see the new Kalbarri Skywalk for the first time. The holiday units at Sunsea Villas were among many riverfront properties to bear the full force of the cyclone. The 170kph winds ripped off the units' asbestos roofs, rendering them uninhabitable. The owners vowed to rebuild, but Sunsea spokeswoman Jessica Thorpe-Gudgeon said insurers were dragging their feet. She said the insurance company had invited one initial building quote and then rejected it, took months to organise another quote, and again rejected it before finally agreeing to a builder. It was only last week that a builder could finally plan for the rebuild to begin. ""We've been closed, we're still closed,"" Ms Thorpe-Gudgeon said. ""There's been no income and we've had to lay off any workers that we had working there."" Ms Thorpe-Gudgeon expected the rebuild to finally begin in January and the property to reopen between April and July next year. Kalbarri Visitor Centre tourism advisor Raya Smyth said many damaged properties were now starting to be repaired. ""Obviously a lot of accommodation was damaged during the cyclone and a lot are operating at a lower capacity; however, a lot of roofs are going back on, a lot of accommodation is being fixed,"" she said. ""So it's great we've got a bit more accommodation to offer in the town."" Those still able to open their doors expect to be fully booked over Christmas and the school holidays. Northampton Shire president Liz Sudlow said it did not take long for tourists to return after the cyclone. ""I think the town has been quite busy,"" she said. ""Certainly the October holidays were really busy and even July was still quite busy, so I see no reason why the January holidays won't be a really busy one."" At the visitor centre, Ms Smyth said Kalbarri's natural beauty remained intact and continued to entice visitors. ""The scars on the foreshore are obvious, the tarps,"" she said. ""But I don't think that takes away from our beautiful foreshore, the coastal cliffs, the national park and all the beauty we have in Kalbarri."" Some tourism operators impacted by the cyclone lament missing out on the tourism boom COVID presented and worry reopening borders will see tourists go elsewhere. ""I think everyone is itching to get out of WA — they've seen all their backyard,"" Kalbarri Edge Resort acting manager Jayson Mehnert said. ""I think the industry anticipates that there will be more of an exodus than people coming over from the eastern states. But others, like Ms Smyth, are excited to see visitors return. ""It's going to be incredible welcoming international tourists back, particularly on our Skywalk,"" she said. ""It opened in June 2020 and not one international traveller has stepped foot on it yet."" While frustrations and lengthy rebuild times are dogging many, most agree the town will bounce back and emerge stronger than before. ""Many people have said to me, 'It's a marathon, not a sprint',"" Ms Sudlow said. ""Certainly I think it will be a long, long time — probably a couple of years — before the town is really back up and running. ""Obviously, while there are challenges, it presents opportunities to rebuild better than ever.""

351,"analysis: Most Australians aren't confident to book travel during COVID. And when you read the fine print, who can blame them",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Cancelled travel during COVID? You may not be entitled to a refund under consumer law Are you feeling anxious about going on holidays this summer? It's not just you. Only one in four Australians are confident about booking travel plans, according to a recent survey by the consumer group Choice. That's hardly surprising. Lots of us now have a story about battling the travel industry during COVID. Personally, I've called off three interstate trips due to snap lockdowns and border closures. I've also done the last-minute dash over the border to avoid getting stuck on perpetual holiday. Every time, this has seen me miss out on using short-term rentals, gallery tickets and flights that I'd largely already paid for. Getting refunds has felt a bit like a Christmas potluck. Two years into this pandemic, few companies are now willing to offer them. Travel credits are rife, along with re-booking fees. Battling the corporate bureaucracy for a refund or credit can be infuriating. Some are willing to fight it. One woman I spoke to went on a five-hour bicycle ride while on hold to Qantas about her unwanted flight credit. (Her persistence eventually led to a refund.) As consumers, it can leave us angry when a company doesn't give us a refund or credit during COVID. This mindset is understandable – we're paying for services we aren't getting. But consumer law is far more complex than this. It may surprise you but, in a pandemic, one interpretation is that it actually doesn't ensure you a refund. And that's leaving us – as well as business owners – mired in ambiguity. The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) is 302 sections long, so you're forgiven for not having read it. Sections 51 to 64A set out what we're entitled to when we purchase a product or service. Much of it is the common sense we all assume – for instance, that we should receive undamaged goods as described, and that we can't be slugged with hidden fees. The consequences for companies or service providers when they don't comply with these consumer guarantees are set out in sections 267 to 273. This is what concerns us when it comes to COVID refunds. The law here says consumers can take action against suppliers for not providing a service, unless there has been: Sound familiar? Basically, one interpretation of the law is that if a company like Jetstar can't fly you to Brisbane because you're in lockdown in Melbourne, that's out of the airline's control, and your legal ability to take action as a consumer is extinguished. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is the watchdog that oversees these laws. A spokesperson there made the point to me that consumer guarantees typically sit alongside ""contractual rights and obligations"". That's the fine print we usually glaze over when we pay for a plane ticket or book a holiday home. ""In ordinary circumstances, the consumer guarantees in the ACL sit side by side with contractual rights and obligations, although the contract cannot exclude or modify the ACL consumer guarantees,"" the ACCC spokesperson said. ""In the specific circumstances – such as the imposition of travel restrictions by governments – where the ACL consumer guarantees don't apply because of a stated exception in the legislation, the contractual rights and obligations remain."" Essentially, when it comes to a COVID cancellation, the only bargaining chip you're left with is that fine print that you didn't read. Take this investigation I recently did into short-term rental provider Airbnb. The US company considers itself as a third-party website that lets individuals – ""hosts"" – list their properties on it to rent out as holiday homes. When the pandemic hit, Airbnb brought in a policy that anybody who had an existing booking could get a refund if they couldn't travel due to COVID. But that ended after just a few months in March 2020 and now the company's default COVID refund policy is whatever terms you book under. Airbnb lets its hosts pick from a range of cancellation policies. Some give you a full refund until the day of arrival, whereas under others you can't get any cash back as soon as you hand it over, no matter how far in the future your arrival date. Some people I spoke to for that story were miffed that they couldn't get refunds under their booking terms when they couldn't travel due to a snap lockdown or border closure. ""My natural feeling is that a refund would have been most appropriate in that situation,"" is what one person said to me. A lack of regulation has created ""buyer beware"" situation where some people are being denied refunds for short-term rental bookings that they can't use during COVID. And this is lining the pockets of the head companies. But as we've learned, the default is the fine print in this situation. There are ways around this. Lots of Airbnb hosts are offering full refund policies, and some without them have been going above and beyond during COVID to get people refunds they're not technically entitled to under the contract. I had this exact scenario happen to me. I didn't pay much attention to the fine-print (yes, we've all done it) before booking an Airbnb with friends this year. I then got caught in a snap lockdown with a cancellation policy that only entitled me to half the money back. Luckily, I had an understanding Airbnb host who went to the head US company and asked for a full refund for me. I eventually got everything back in dribs and drabs. While that was great, it came down to goodwill, not guarantee. As consumers, we're vulnerable to this power imbalance during COVID. The ACCC released guidelines for the travel industry in mid-2020. They make the point that, even during COVID, travel providers have to stick to consumer law for things under their control. For instance, a company can't sell you a plane ticket, and then deny you a COVID refund if your terms and conditions said you get one. The ACCC actually took Qantas, Flight Centre and APT to task over this exact issue and the companies changed their policies. But the very fact these standards for the travel industry during COVID are described as ""best practice guidance"" highlights the limitations at play. For instance, the ACCC guidance says it ""expects"" that companies issue credit notes to customers that are for the same amount they paid for the booking. But there are many providers who now charge people to redeem credit notes, meaning you end up with a lower level of service. There have been rumblings about enquiries into this lack of clear legal guidance for the travel industry during COVID. Australians travelling overseas for the first time since international borders reopened are paying hundreds of dollars for travel insurance — but the fine print reveals some very big COVID-related exclusions. There is something of an informal inquiry going on currently. Commonwealth officials are working with the body that overarches the ACCC and each state and territory's consumer protection agency on issues impacting consumers during COVID, including travel sector woes. ""Should this work identify any potential changes to the Australian Consumer Law, the agreement of Commonwealth, state and territory consumer ministers would be required,"" a federal Treasury spokesperson told the ABC. Sounds pretty uncertain doesn't it – especially heading into an election year when legislative processes are likely to be severely curtailed. Dealing with COVID cancellations hasn't been easy on business owners either. Aggression from angry customers is taking its toll on some of them. Some travel industry companies have actually had to take on more staff – during a downturn and revenue freeze – to deal with the extra administration of rescheduling and refunding services. One Airbnb host I interviewed was spending hours a day asking the company to fully refund her customers. She did this because she believed it would help the reputation of her coastal town – and instil consumer confidence so that people didn't spook and not book to begin with. Some travel companies actually want further regulation, just so they can have a clear cut law that helps them deal with consumers. Given they don't have this clarity yet, is it any wonder they are now putting strict terms into T&Cs to protect themselves? Other companies are telling customers to rely on travel insurance to protect them against COVID losses. However, as I found when I looked at this issue, most insurance companies are offering very limited coverage for people impacted by border closures or lockdowns. One travel sector company I spoke to said they wanted the situation to be considered as a mutual risk between business and customer. They say Australians are now fully aware that travel plans can be up-ended, and should take some responsibility too. ""They booked knowing that COVID was a thing. And they booked knowing what the COVID cancellation terms were,"" they said. ""COVID isn't anyone's fault. Everyone's doing their best to try and muddle through."" Those who believe ""the customer is always right"" may find all of this galling. In the interim, the ACCC is advising people to do their research about a destination's COVID situation before booking, check the terms and conditions, and to contact consumer rights groups if they think they've been misled during COVID. It's tempting to just book and hope for the best, especially after two years of pandemic stress. But it is worth at least glancing through that fine print to know in advance what will happen if COVID throws another curve ball that disrupts your travel plans. And, if enough customers demand it, maybe more flexibility will creep into contracts in favour of the traveller.

352,Victor Harbor's new causeway opens as demolition date nears for original,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Victor Harbor's new causeway opens as demolition date nears for heritage-listed original Victor Harbor's new causeway has been officially opened to the public as the original structure alongside it is readied for demolition following more than 150 years of service. The $43 million concrete and steel replacement was opened during a ceremony at the seaside town this morning, with Premier Steven Marshall describing it as an ""exciting"" moment for SA ahead of the holiday period. ""The old causeway, which has served the people of Victor Harbor and southern Fleurieu Peninsula for such a long period of time — great infrastructure — was really getting to the end of its useful life,"" he said. ""When it was a windy day, it meant that it couldn't actually be accessed and I know that caused people a lot of stress."" He said tour operators and a Granite Island cafe were among those affected when winds were so strong that the causeway was deemed unsafe for pedestrians, along with the 120-year-old horse-drawn tram from the mainland. The famed clydesdale horses are expected to start operating on the new causeway from Boxing Day, requiring first to undertake what Mr Marshall described as ""a little training"" before they were ready to start hauling tourists more than 600 metres to the island, and back. ""We know this is a much-loved piece of infrastructure for our state and we know this is a much-loved place, Victor Harbor, and there will be tens of thousands of people over the next couple of months down here,"" Mr Marshall said. But its build has not been without controversy, particularly because it spelt the end for the much-loved existing causeway that, despite being heritage-listed, is flagged for decommissioning from February. Documents released under FOI show in 2010 engineering firm GHD recommended Victor Harbor causeway should not be demolished, but SA Government says the report was a heritage assessment. When the Department of Transport announced plans to demolish it, a petition was launched to save the old causeway that quickly amassed more than 10,000 signatures. Up until then, repair works had been undertaken periodically with an engineering firm commissioned by the department in 2010 to undertake a conservation management plan. ""There should be no new construction, demolition, intrusions, accretions, alterations or other changes to the causeway or its locality, which would adversely affect its appearance, form, structure, setting or visual relatedness with either Granite Island or the Victor Harbor foreshore in the vicinity of its abutment,"" the 2010 report stated. It said the causeway was one of the town's ""central and special attractions"" and was widely ""recognised and publicised as one of Victor Harbor's principal attractions"". But by 2019 the same engineering firm, GHD, recommended it be replaced. Victor Harbor Mayor Moira Jenkins said the opening of the new causeway would offer the people of Victor Harbor some ""continuity"". ""The ends of the old causeway will be kept as viewing platforms, so people will be able to walk onto the old historic causeway and actually look at the difference between that and the new causeway, and it will be safe for people standing there,"" she said. ""And the horse tram can keep going over, rail hail or shine."" She said the new causeway also included the ""longest piece of Aboriginal artwork in the state."" Artwork by five Ngarrindjeri-Ramindjeri artists has been sandblasted into the concrete deck, stretching from one end of the causeway to the other. The old causeway will remain open to pedestrians until decommissioning works begin, with the project expected to be fully completed by the end of 2022. Further works to build a new boat landing facility for the causeway are also expected to take place during 2022, with the Department of Transport warning it could create some intermittent ""short term closures"".

354,Virgin Australia cancels multiple Darwin flights days out from Christmas ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Darwin resident Harriet Murphy had booked a seat on the Christmas Eve red-eye flight to make it home to Melbourne to see family. But just days before she was scheduled to fly, she was told her direct flight had been cancelled. Her original flight would have got her home early on Christmas Day to be with family. ""Virgin changed my flight so that I would be flying to Perth instead and spending 16 hours at the airport before arriving in Melbourne at about 5pm,"" she said. ""I'd be missing the whole family Christmas lunch."" With the Northern Territory's borders now officially open for travel, many Territorians are looking forward to travelling interstate or welcoming relatives back home after months apart. But last-minute cancellations are causing chaos for those planning to see family and friends interstate. It is unclear exactly how many Darwin routes have been cancelled, but in a statement,Virgin Australia said it had to cancel ""a small number"" of Darwin services due to ""operational requirements"". Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic The ABC has been contacted by several people in similar situations, including some who were rescheduled on flights departing days later so that they would miss Christmas entirely and family groups who were split up and rescheduled onto different routes. ""There's a lot of us who haven't seen our families in a really, really long time,"" Ms Murphy said. ""It's Christmas you know, a lot of us are clearly booking flights to get home for Christmas and it's like they're not really noticing."" Ms Murphy said she had to book on a different airline at a premium price to make sure she could see her family. A spokesperson for Virgin Australia apologised for the changes and said they were working to make sure Christmas travel plans are not disrupted. ""We apologise to any guest impacted by a cancelled Darwin service and we are working tirelessly to ensure all guests reach their final destination in time for Christmas,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are currently in the process of moving guests onto a number of alternative services, including an additional direct flight we have scheduled from Darwin on Thursday."" Ms Murphy said it was frustrating no real reasons were provided for the changes and rescheduling another flight was ""too little, too late."" ""I spent two-and-a-half hours on hold to Virgin, ringing them to cancel my flight, and they told me it would take 90 days for my money to come back to me, which is pretty disappointing.""

355,Queensland reaches key turning point in pandemic as state braces for 'huge spike' in COVID-19 cases,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  With the days of 'COVID-zero' over, Queensland is at a critical point in its pandemic response and the focus needs to shift from case numbers to hospitalisations, experts say. COVID-19 is spreading rapidly across Queensland. On Tuesday, the state recorded its highest daily number of COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began, with 86 new infections reported. That figure would have come as a rude shock for many Queenslanders who have become accustomed to ""doughnut days"" over the past two years. But the sudden surge in infections, driven by the reopening of the state's borders earlier this month, has shown no signs of slowing down, with the highly contagious Omicron variant now the dominant strain in Queensland. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Case numbers have been doubling every two days and Queensland's Chief Health Officer, John Gerrard, has warned the worst is yet to come. ""If we double cases every 48 hours, we will expect thousands of cases [daily] in January,"" he said. Queensland University of Technology professor of public health and disaster management Gerry FitzGerald, who served as Queensland's chief health officer for three years, said the state was at a key ""point of transition"" as it entered the next phase of its pandemic response. 'We spent the last two years really trying to aspire to zero COVID in Queensland to allow us to buy time to get people vaccinated,"" Professor FitzGerald said. ""We've now reached the stage where we've done all we can in terms of protecting the community ... all the good work is done now in terms of getting vaccinated ... we can't wait for 100 per cent vaccination because it will never happen. ""So, we're just going to have to be brave. It's a change in mindset, I suppose. ""We've got to live with the fact that the disease will spread ... [and] many of us will be exposed to the virus"". The director of Griffith University's Institute for Glycomics, Mark von Itzstein, agreed that Queensland was at a critical point in its pandemic response. In latest reporting period: Queensland's vaccine rollout: Latest case information from Queensland Health. ""Whilst the number of cases are increasing, we knew this was going to be the case,"" Professor Von Itzstein said. ""That's the reality. ""We are now at a point where we need to focus on the number of hospitalisations and the number of people going into ICU, rather than the number of cases. ""As has been experienced down south, particularly in New South Wales, whilst the number of cases have stabilised, the number of hospitalisations have not increased. ""The experience Australia has had to date is that the number of cases has been relatively low by comparison to around the world. ""And now with the vaccination rates as high as they are in this country, we are not seeing case numbers translate into hospitalisations and that's great news."" The Chief Health Officer has previously said Queensland would likely move toward reporting COVID-19 hospitalisations only, instead of total case numbers in the near future. ""As we go forward, we will be focusing less and less on the individual cases and more and more on the trends and looking to see if we are getting exponential increases in numbers in the community and/or in the hospital,"" Mr Gerrard said. ""People who are vaccinated don't get very sick. ""The vast majority [of cases] in the future will be managed at home."" Professor von Itzstein said Queenslanders concerned about climbing case numbers should be reassured by the state's high vaccination rates. Currently, 89.9 per cent of Queenslanders aged 16 and over have had one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 85 per cent are fully vaccinated. The Premier's gift to Queenslanders this Christmas is opening the state's borders, bringing an influx of people as well as COVID-19. It means 2022 will look very different to the year that was. ""Vaccination rates have improved and continue to improve and that stands us as a community in good stead,"" Professor von Itzstein said. ""That will keep us from having major hospitalisation events."" Dr FitzGerald said the high immunisation coverage will help ease pressure on health services, even as Queensland's COVID-19 outbreak grows. ""The vaccine still seems to be protecting against severe illness ... it should protect both our health system and also people from dying from this disease to a large extent,"" Dr FitzGerald said. ""Unfortunately, people will die, but that's the next step ... opening up the state and just keep trying to push the message about vaccination,"" he said. Regional communities have also seen a rise in COVID cases. The Darling Downs, Cairns and Townsville regions have all recorded cases in the past week, as well as the small town of Emerald in central Queensland, which reported its first COVID case on Tuesday. Port Douglas — a popular tourism destination in the Far North — was also added to a growing list of exposure sites on Tuesday. Dr FitzGerald said he was confident vaccination would help protect regional and rural communities. ""Those communities need to basically get their levels of vaccination high,"" he said. ""We've seen it can be done — Goondiwindi [in the Darling Downs region] has exceptionally high vaccination levels. ""For tourism places, my best advice is they need to get organised and get everyone vaccinated because that's the best protection we can offer at this stage. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. ""The disease is going to start spreading around the state and there's very little we can do the stop that now."" Dr FitzGerald said it was vital Queenslanders continue to take simple steps to slow the spread of the virus to protect the vulnerable and the state's health system. ""Wearing masks in public places, just keeping distance, not going into crowded places, hand hygiene,"" Dr FitzGerald said. ""Simple, physical things [like that] will protect people from further spread. ""If we do those sort of things, we can stop the huge spike [in cases] that would worry everybody. ""I think now we've just got to focus on making sure that anybody who is vulnerable — with chronic diseases or the elderly — remain protected.""

356,Christmas plans under threat for Territorians waiting 'days and days' for COVID test results after borders reopen,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The Northern Territory government is promising to shorten the turnaround for COVID-19 test results, acknowledging the frustration of people left waiting ""days and days"". The NT reopened its borders and resumed quarantine-free travel for fully vaccinated domestic and international travellers on Monday, subject to compliance with a new three-test system. There are also testing directions in place for people affected by the ongoing Katherine COVID outbreak, which sent Tennant Creek into lockdown on Friday. But just days after the NT's reopening, there have already been reports of long waits for test results, forcing some people to spend days in isolation and disrupting their travel plans. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic On Tuesday, NT Health Minister Natasha Fyles said the government was aware of travellers into the Territory who had been tested up to 70 hours before their flight and still hadn't received their results by the time they arrived. She said the government was looking into a resolution, though she did not outline any concrete plans. ""We're specifically focused on our close contacts and getting those test results that we expect to be positive, but we don't think it's acceptable that the community should wait days and days for a test result when they've done their bit in getting tested,"" she said. ""So we are working on that."" ""It's not our laboratory — we can deal with thousands of tests a day — it's around the systems that support that."" Ms Fyles said in the meantime, incoming travellers could speed up the process by getting another test in the NT upon arrival. ""Show our border control people that you have had to the test, so a message saying you booked in for the test,"" she said. ""We are then booking you in for an appointment here in the Territory, and allowing you to go to your place of residence or where you may be staying, to isolate, [to] go and get the test in the Territory. ""If you do receive your negative result from interstate in the meantime, you're free to move about the community. And I would suggest you keep that appointment that's been made for you so you can meet your criteria of being tested within the first 72 hours. ""We are being reactive on our borders, acknowledging that interstate we're seeing significant testing delays, and … we're also experiencing that here in the Territory, and we're trying to overcome that."" Emma Kariotis, from Darwin, and 11 members of her family were travelling to Adelaide for Christmas across three caravans when they stopped overnight at Tennant Creek on Thursday, and found themselves caught in lockdown. The whole family, who are fully vaccinated, got tested on Friday afternoon as part of their application to leave the lockdown area and continue their trip. But as of Tuesday afternoon — four days after getting tested — they were still waiting to receive their results. ""It has been very frustrating,"" Ms Kariotis said. ""We've been kept in limbo, basically. ""It's 42C every day and we're in caravans, and nobody can tell us anything."" Ms Kariotis said her family had been contacting the NT Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and COVID hotline ""almost daily"" since Friday for information on their results or what else they could do to progress their application, without luck. ""They have no idea,"" she said. ""The CDC told us, basically, they're inundated and there's not much more they can do to help us, until [the results are] all uploaded. ""The COVID hotline themselves, they can't tell us anything – they don't even know how we can apply, once we get our results, to actually leave."" She said the wait for results had taken so long, the family would likely scrap their travel plans and head home to Darwin. ""It's not really worth travelling to South Australia now, after all this, [with] the chance they classify us as a high-risk area and then we'd have to do quarantine … once we get there anyway,"" she said. ""I'm not sure it's worth it, so we're probably just going to go home."" The NT government is expected to make a decision on whether to lift lockdowns in Tennant Creek and Ali Curung early on Wednesday afternoon.

357,Rescued family's bogged campervan retrieved from Simpson Desert by outback publican,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Campervan belonging to Perth family bogged in Simpson Desert recovered by outback publican A customised campervan belonging to a Perth family who got stuck in the Simpson Desert has finally been recovered, more than a month after the rescue. Perth couple Ori and Lindsey Zavros, and their two young children Zane and Zoe,  had been enjoying an outback road trip around Australia when their campervan became bogged following torrential rain. After spending a week stranded in the Simpson Desert -- about 150 kilometres north-east of Oodnadatta – they were winched to safety by helicopter on November 17. But their purpose-built campervan, complete with an entertainment system, was left behind – with the ground too muddy to dislodge it. Finally, this week, the campervan was retrieved, with the Zavros family sharing the news on their Facebook page. ""We are so happy to let you know the truck and camper are out of the mud and safe,"" they wrote. ""Next step is to figure out the best way to get her to Perth."" They said their insurance had covered the cost of recovering the vehicle. The campervan was recovered by Simpson Desert publican, Graham Scott, who said it took all day to dig the campervan out of the mud. ""Obviously we couldn't do anything when they first got bogged, because no-one could drive on that country, it was unpassable, so we had to wait until the country dried out,"" he said. ""It was fairly well embedded in mud but with a bit of digging and a bit of help from our Unimog, it popped out,"" he said. Mr Scott, who runs the Mt Dare Hotel, about 10 kilometres from the Northern Territory border, said it took “about four hours” to drive to the scene. “We spent about, let's say an hour and a half to two hours, digging it out, then pulled it out with our big recovery truck,” he said. “It is now back at Mt Dare waiting for arrangements to be made to get it back to WA.” Mr Zavros thanked Mr Scott for his efforts. ""Huge thank you to Graham, he's even offered to take it to Alice Springs for us. He's been really, really helpful."" After spending a month living with their in-laws, the Zavros family said they had finally moved into an apartment. ""Our whole life is still in the campervan, so we need it back as soon as possible,"" Mr Zavros said. ""We've had to buy a whole bunch of things because everything we own is on that campervan."" Mr Zavros said he had contemplated driving the vehicle back to Perth himself, but reconsidered due to quarantine requirements for interstate travellers entering WA. ""I'm hoping to get a transport company to put it on a backload from Alice Springs to Darwin, and then the same to Perth,"" he said. ""So, if any one knows of a truck that's going that way, let us know!""

358,"Yolandé, Hugo and their five kids are spending Christmas in COVID quarantine. They say the rules are 'ridiculous'",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus If Yolandé and Hugo Barnard were to fly into Australia today from the United Kingdom, where more than 80,000 new COVID-19 cases are being recorded every day, they would be able to go straight home and have a quarantine-free Christmas. The federal government has abolished restrictions on Australians arriving from southern Africa However, the Northern Territory still requires people who arrive on repatriation flights to quarantine for 14 days 187 people are in quarantine in Howard Springs after arriving from Johannesburg last week But the couple flew to Australia on a repatriation flight last week, so they are currently stuck with their five kids in the Howard Springs quarantine facility in Darwin until Boxing Day. ""I don't understand why there is that differentiation between commercial and repatriation flights,"" Mr Barnard said. ""It's ridiculous."" More than 180 Australian citizens and permanent residents will be spending Christmas the same way, after arriving in the Northern Territory from South Africa on December 12. They were caught there after Australia placed restrictions on arrivals from eight southern African countries in response to the Omicron variant. Not knowing when those restrictions would lift, they accepted help from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) to get home. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic The federal government has now removed restrictions on Australians arriving from southern Africa and, yesterday, the Northern Territory scrapped all quarantine requirements on international travellers. Despite the new rules, travellers on the repatriation flight from Johannesburg have been told by NT Health officials they will not be allowed to leave until their 14 days of quarantine finishes on December 26. ""It makes no sense for fully vaccinated and exempt people [such as children] to go into quarantine,"" Mr Barnard said. Before agreeing to put their family on the repatriation flight, the Barnards contacted the facility to ask that they be housed together. Instead, the family with five kids under nine is being housed in seven separate units, each with a single bed. They told the ABC the doors at the former mining camp are so heavy, some of their kids cannot open them. The parents have decided to allow their nine-year-old to sleep alone, while the five-year-old and the two-year-old share a unit, and the seven-year-old and three-year-old also bunk in together. They say one of the kids fell down the stairs trying to cross between units, and last week Ms Barnard spotted a snake under the steps of their verandah. They called facility staff and asked for it to be removed, but were told a worker would only attend if the snake bit someone. Because the kids cannot open the doors or be heard easily through the walls of the unit, Yolandé and Hugo have been taking it in turns to stay up on the verandah through the night in case they're needed, and they are only getting between three and four hours of sleep a night. ""It's not suitable for children,"" Ms Barnard said. ""Why can't I quarantine at home where my kids won't get hurt?"" When Australia followed the UK in putting restrictions on people arriving from southern Africa, Health Minister Greg Hunt said the decision was a ""strong, swift, decisive, immediate, but precautionary"" measure to stop the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Public health expert Seye Abimbola from the University of Sydney said the original travel ban was neither proportionate nor an effective control measure, and that reversing it was the right decision. ""It should never have been made in the first place,"" Dr Abimbola said. ""Someone coming from Belgium likely has as much chance of coming in with the new variant as someone coming from Botswana."" That's little comfort to the people who arrived before the restrictions were wound back. People currently confined in Howard Springs have told the ABC they were in South Africa for difficult personal reasons, including to support family undergoing chemotherapy, attend funerals for loved ones, look after sick parents or be with dying relatives. Throshni Naidoo, who was born in South Africa and has lived in Sydney for 22 years, went to South Africa in November because her father was unwell. While she was there, he died. Her brother died earlier this year from COVID-19, so Ms Naidoo was worried about leaving her mother unsupported in South Africa. However, when she was offered a spot on a repatriation flight, she took the opportunity, thinking there might not be another way to get home to her nine-year-old daughter and husband, who stayed behind in Sydney. That meant she had to miss a traditional Indian ceremony held 16 days after a person dies. ""I've probably had the worst four weeks of my life,"" she said. Now she will also miss Christmas with her family. DFAT told the ABC that all passengers on government-facilitated flights arriving in Darwin must undertake 14 days of mandatory supervised quarantine in Howard Springs, in line with Northern Territory requirements. A spokesperson for NT Health said people who have not been vaccinated are allowed on repatriation flights and 14 days of quarantine “ensures the most protective measures are in place for these flights”. Ms Naidoo said she was grateful DFAT helped her get back to Australia, but it pained her to see how the government's border ban had affected southern Africa just when trade and tourism were getting going again. ""It's hurt so many hundreds of thousands of people's lives,"" she said. The restrictions angered the region's business leaders and politicians who argued that South Africa was effectively punished for being transparent about detecting Omicron. Dr Abimbola said he was afraid other countries would see how South Africa had been treated and hold off on disclosing new variants in the future. However, epidemiologist Catherine Bennett from Deakin University, disagreed. She said the border restrictions were a ""sensible, balanced, and measured approach"", given the uncertainty around Omicron. ""It still made sense to pause the border, to slow the spread, but that was only expected to last a couple of weeks so we could understand more about this new variant,"" Professor Bennett said. Now that has happened, she thinks it is right to scrap restrictions for those countries. Professor Bennett believes good public health measures, including getting travellers to test negative for the virus prior to boarding a flight to Australia, and follow-up testing on arrival and 72 hours after they land, are now sufficient. The Northern Territory's public health laws allow its Chief Health Officer to make directions considered ""necessary, appropriate or desirable"" to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, Mr Barnard says it makes no sense to have different rules for people arriving on repatriation and commercial flights. ""These rules are inconsistent,"" he said. ""They cannot be considered necessary, appropriate or desirable.""

360,Travelling interstate this Christmas? Here's what you need to know about border rules,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Prime Minister Scott Morrison hoped borders would be open by Christmas so Australians could get ""their lives back"". But slow vaccination rates, growing clusters and the Omicron variant have caused some states to restrict or halt interstate travel. So, here is everything you need to know if you are planning to visit friends or family interstate this Christmas. Most states and territories require travellers to be fully vaccinated before entering. Click here to find out how to upload your vaccine certificate to different check-in apps. But before you jump on your flight, it is important to check the rules for re-entering, as your home state or territory rules may differ. And don't forget to check the government websites, as rules can change at short notice. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Step one: Download the check-in app of the state you are visiting. Step two: Go to your online Medicare account via the myGov website or the Express Plus Medicare app on your smartphone. Step three: Scroll down to ""Quick links"" and under ""Proof of vaccination"" click ""Go to Medicare"". Step four: On the next page, click ""View history"" and select ""Share with check-in app"". Step five: Choose the app of that state you are visiting and click ""Share"" then ""Accept and share"". Step six: Lastly, the check-in app will automatically open on your phone and you will need to click ""Accept"". And then you're done. The good news is, there are no requirements for entry into the state, so anyone from around Australia can join in singing Christmas carols in New South Wales — unless you have been in an area of concern, like an exposure site in the last 14 days. If you wish to enter the state coming from a place of concern and are allowed entry into the state, you may need to comply with stay at home rules, follow self-isolation rules and wear a face mask. People staying in New South Wales will be required to follow their COVID-19 rules, such as wearing a face mask, getting tested if you have COVID-19 symptoms, providing vaccination evidence and using their Service NSW app to check in to venues. Travellers around Australia, including people from hotspots, will be allowed to catch some sunshine in Queensland this Christmas. But people entering from a hotspot must: If your Christmas celebrations are just over the Queensland border, fully vaccinated border residents will be able to move freely across the border, though they will need a border pass — which can be applied for here. Will I need a COVID test to travel interstate over the Christmas holidays? Should you not be travelling from a hotspot, there are no restrictions on your entry, and no quarantine is required. Travellers spending time in the sunshine state will be required to follow local COVID-19 rules, get tested if they have COVID-19 symptoms, be able to provide vaccination evidence and use the Check In Qld app. Anyone with plans to catch any of the Christmas festivities in Victoria will be able to freely enter the state without a travel permit and regardless of your vaccination status. People staying in Victoria will be required to follow their COVID-19 rules, such as wearing a face mask, getting tested if you have COVID-19 symptoms, and using the Service Victoria app to check in to venues. Do you have Christmas plans in Australia's capital city? The territory is open for the festive season, but there are some conditions if you are visiting from a high-risk geographical location. Travellers coming from high-risk geographical areas or exposure locations in the last 14 days will be required to be fully vaccinated and complete an exemption form within 72 hours before arrival. If you are coming from an area that is not a risk, you will not be required to complete an exemption form or quarantine — but you will need to be fully vaccinated. Visitors spending the holiday season in the ACT will be required to follow their COVID-19 rules, such as wearing a face mask, getting tested if you have COVID-19 symptoms, providing vaccination evidence, and using their Check In CBR  app. Domestic travellers wanting to spend Christmas over the Bass Strait from a low-risk area will not be required to quarantine if they are fully vaccinated but will have to register their travel with the government. Visitors will be required to register their travel with the Tas e-Travel system — no more than one day before they arrive. But people visiting from a high-risk area will need to have a negative PCR test within 72 hours before arriving in the state. Travellers coming from extreme-risk areas will be required to quarantine in suitable premises. While visitors who are not vaccinated can still enter the state, they must first have approval via the Tas e-Travel system. For these purposes, Tasmania classes people with medical exemptions or under 12 years and two months of age as having been vaccinated. Once approved, unvaccinated travellers will be required to quarantine in a suitable premise and have a COVID-19 test on days one and five after arriving. A suitable premise includes a private residence, short-term rental accommodation or other premises approved by health officials. Once you have landed in Tasmania, you will be required to follow their COVID-19 rules, get tested if you have COVID-19 symptoms, provide vaccination evidence and use their Check in TAS app. The state is welcoming entry to all fully vaccinated travellers — but before you start packing your bags, you must complete an EntryCheck SA application 14 days before you enter the state. The South Australian government will access your entry and advise you whether you must quarantine or need a PCR test before entering the state. Once you have been cleared to enter the state, you will be required to follow their COVID-19 rules, such as getting tested if you have COVID-19 symptoms, providing vaccination evidence and using their COVID Safe Check-In app. From December 20, the Northern Territory will extend their Christmas day lunch invites to everyone in Australia who is COVID-19 fully vaccinated, and people unable to be vaccinated (such as children under 12 years). All travellers will be required to complete a Border Entry Form no more than five days before they arrive. They also need to return a negative PCR test within the 72 hours before entering the territory, a second test within the first three days of arrival and a third test on day six. Once you have arrived in Northern Territory, you will be required to follow their COVID-19 rules, such as getting tested if you have COVID-19 symptoms, providing vaccination evidence and using their The Territory Check In app. If you plan to visit the state last on Santa's stops in Australia, you will need to declare and register your visit if you are from a very low-risk area — currently, this only includes people from Tasmania. But not for long, as travellers from Tasmania have until midnight of December 20 before the state transitions to low risk, following a recent case. Visitors from low-risk areas can still travel to the state but will miss out on the family Christmas roast as they must quarantine for 14 days. However, if you arrive from Tasmania before December 20 and have been at a listed exposure site, you must also quarantine for 14 days and get tested within 48 hours. Queensland's recent surge in cases also means the state will lose its low-risk status and will be deemed medium risk from December 20 — and approval is required for entry. All incoming interstate travellers are required to complete a G2G Pass declaration. Whether travelling by air or land, you will have to complete a health screening on arrival and have your G2G pass ready. But if you travelling from anywhere else in Australia and are planning to visit friends and family for Christmas in WA, you may have to delay your festive celebration until February, 2022. Once you have been allowed entry into Western Australia, you will be required to follow their COVID-19 rules, such as getting tested if you have COVID-19 symptoms, providing vaccination evidence and using their SafeWA app. See our full coverage of coronavirus We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

361,"The joy, the excitement and the nerves: NT's border is finally reopening",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus After being separated from his fiancée for two years, John Weston is finally going to get the reunion he has been waiting for. ""She went home to visit her family before the pandemic hit and got stuck in the Philippines,"" Mr Weston said. ""We message and talk all the time, but not being with her has been really lonely."" Mr Weston lives in Gray, an inner-suburb of Palmerston. His fiance is finally booking flights home to the Territory, where a border reopening plan is in motion. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic On Monday, after months of tough border restrictions and complicated back-and-forth rule changes, nearly all travel constraints will be lifted for vaccinated travellers. However, it is a mixed bag of emotions for many Territorians contending with Christmas travel plans amid palpable border uncertainty, with some even cancelling holidays altogether. Midway through the pandemic, Teremayi Manozho moved with her family to the territory to escape endless lockdowns in Victoria. She didn't get a chance to stop into Queensland to see extended family and has been looking forward to spending Christmas with them. But Ms Manozho was concerned the territory's border could slam closed at any moment, which has stopped her from booking anything this year. ""Christmas has been diluted,"" she said. ""I have mixed feelings about the borders opening. On one hand, I want everyone to have loved ones with them [for Christmas] but there is still a bit of panic and uncertainty about what COVID will do to the borders. ""I just wanted to stay home in my own, safe space because there is so much confusion."" At almost 70 years of age, long-term Darwin resident May Hulme is questioning the timing of the Territory's reopening plan as Australia begins to contend with challenges presented by the Omicron variant. ""I think opening is good for finance and for family but, on the other hand, I am worried about [COVID-19] spreading,"" she said. ""I have a mask ready."" Ms Hulme said she would have loved to visit Queensland for the Christmas period but the ""yo-yo"" advice from government had put her plans on ice. ""I've been grounded for two years. I'm a traveller, so when I feel confident to go, I will,"" she said. Not much fazes Terry Boulton these days after living in the rural town of Howard Springs, on the outskirts of Darwin, for 52 years. He left his vintage red utility unlocked, windows down, wherever he went when there was no school and no power, and persists to this day, despite the town seeing strong growth in population and development. However, when his daughter cancelled plans to visit this Christmas, he was ""very disappointed"". ""It was because everything kept changing,"" he said. ""You've got to take everything in your stride, but the [reopening plan] has been a mess and I hope [the Northern Territory government] is sensible. ""I might go and visit them if it's not too difficult to go down next year."" One of thousands of Australians who missed out on burying their loved ones due to restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, David Ross has also missed birthdays, parties, and get-togethers. Mr Ross lives in Kununurra, in Western Australia, about 830 kilometres from his family and friends in Darwin. As soon as he realised he would be able to travel freely across the border, Mr Ross booked flights for Christmas. ""I'm finally going to be able to take my grandkids to the park,"" he said. ""If I'd had to isolate, I wouldn't have come, but now there is just so much less stress about seeing family."" Even though borders were coming down, Maz Braun said he had cancelled his family trip to Brisbane. ""We haven't seen the other side of the family for two years. We were 100 per cent looking forward to spending Christmas with them,"" he said. ""But, with all the last-minute changes, I'm still really confused about the border rules. We cancelled because it was too uncertain."" Mr Braun said reopening the territory was ""good for everyone"" as long as people did their part. ""We have a fragile community here, and I'm sure the majority of people will do the right thing, but I'm concerned a small part will run the gauntlet,"" he said. While Adrian and Barbara Coghill's grandson lives in Melbourne, he has decided to fly into Darwin to see his family in Howard Springs on Christmas Eve. ""We haven't seen him in six months, but it feels like six years,"" Ms Coghill said. ""We're very excited. We're still a bit trepidatious, because we don't know what will happen, but we're double-vaxxed and we hope [the border] will stay open."" ""I'm really excited I can resume life,"" Palmerston local Roger Curtis said. A remedial masseur, who typically spends more time travelling the world than on home soil, Mr Curtis says he has already booked flights to go to Singapore, where he plans to see former clients. ""As long as they don't put massive restrictions on the borders again, I'll be leaving in February,"" he said. ""This should have happened two years ago … it's fantastic news."" Darwinite Robert is travelling to New South Wales and Queensland with his wife to visit family he hasn't seen in months. He welcomed the easing of restrictions — coming into effect on December 20 — for entry into the Northern Territory, but said he still has reservations. After being caught up in snap border closures twice before, he said he has planned for another lockdown. ""We just don't know how opening will go in the territory and other states, and what rules will be put in place,"" he said. ""We're taking our laptops, just in case, so we can work from anywhere.""

362,Back Roads host Heather Ewart concludes her lap of Australia with her top tips for road trips for NSW and Qld,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Back Roads host Heather Ewart concludes her lap of Australia with top tips for road trips for NSW and Qld From Victoria's high country to the great Nullarbor in South Australia to cruising past pristine waters in Lucky Bay up through the mineral-rich landscapes of northern WA, we've already covered so many of the well-known and hidden gems that Australian highways have to offer. Now it's time to conclude our lap of Aussie road trips in the eastern states. There's something about a road trip through outback New South Wales or Queensland that can make you feel as though you're in the middle of a Banjo Paterson poem — and actually, you often are. Back in the day, the flat saltbush Hay Plain in the NSW Riverina starred in one of the renowned Australian bush poet's more famous works. He referred in far from flattering tones to ‘Hay, Hell and Booligal'. I'll declare my bias from the outset, I've always loved the Riverina, since my teenage years when I shared a student house with a few girls from big sheep properties up that way. Not a bit of it ever represented hell to me. They were prosperous times when merino wool ruled, and the Riverina was teeming with young jackaroos in dusty utes and ready cash to spend in town on a Saturday night. Debilitating droughts and a shift to other forms of farming changed all that, but the Riverina's rich history can still be felt when you start your journey from Deniliquin through to Hay, Booligal and Hillston. Join Heather Ewart as she visits remote towns and regions to discover some of Australia's most remarkable and inspiring communities. The Hay Plain is as majestic as ever, especially right on sunset, and when you hit the wide main street of Hay, its grand buildings speak volumes about a bygone era. As you drive towards Hillston, keep an eye out for any fundraising events featuring the Vagg family — Booligal station owners who love to recite Banjo Paterson, and they're good at it too. Further north in NSW, you'll still get reminders of Banjo, but you couldn't find a greater contrast to the Riverina than the aptly named Waterfall Way. Beginning at the charming coastal town of Sawtell, wend your way through some of the most scenic and magnificent countryside in the state. From the lush rainforests around Bellingen to the river valleys and rolling hills of Dorrigo and Ebor, spectacular waterfalls abound. Dangar falls in the Dorrigo National Park, and Ebor Falls and Wollomombi Gorge and Falls, to name a few, are a must. The road stretches 185 kilometres to Armidale and along the way near Ebor you might even spot a wild brumby or two, written about in Banjo poetry. Of course, Banjo's best-known work would have to be Waltzing Matilda, Australia's unofficial national anthem, and to learn more about where it originated, you need to cross the border and head for western Queensland and the friendly outback town of Winton. It's a place that punches well above its weight. Banjo penned Waltzing Matilda in these parts in 1896, so the town decided to set up a Waltzing Matilda Museum. When it burned down in 2015, they built a new one — bigger and better. Just out of town, Winton also boasts an impressive Age of Dinosaurs Museum created after a local farmer stumbled across dinosaur bones while mustering sheep back in 1999. Another personal highlight for me when Back Roads visited for our first series was taking a ride on the back of the then local mayor's motorbike two hours down the road to the tiny settlement of Middleton. This old Cobb and Co stop has a pub and that's about it. But what a historic pub it is and a favourite watering hole for many a traveller crossing western Queensland into the Northern Territory. If you were to head towards Far North Qld instead, give serious thought to taking the Savannah Way from Cairns to the Gulf of Carpentaria — a road I'd never heard of till I hooked up with a travelling hairdresser and her offsider at Innisfail back in 2016. From the coast to the tablelands and ending in the Gulf, you won't be disappointed by the entertaining local characters and variety of scenery. The small town of Forsayth is an ideal overnighter and make sure you allow time for a detour to see the natural wonder and ancient landforms of nearby Cobbold Gorge. Back on Savannah Way, as the land flattens out, I recommend rest stops at the old gold rush towns of Georgetown and Croydon, and when you hit Karumba in the Gulf, you'll be well and truly ready to try catching some barramundi — what the town is famed for, along with its prawn trawlers. I guess Banjo Paterson must have passed this way too at some point. He seems to have been everywhere else. Why not follow in his footsteps, take a break and just hit the road? I can guarantee you won't look back. Heather returns to the screen with a new series of Back Roads starting January 3, 2022 on ABC TV at 7:30pm. Until then, head over to ABC iview to watch the show's previous seven series.

363,"International arrivals to Victoria, NSW will no longer need to isolate for 72 hours",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  New South Wales and Victoria will ease their international arrival rules next week, removing the 72-hour isolation requirement for fully vaccinated travellers. From Tuesday, December 21, overseas arrivals to Melbourne and Sydney will be required to get a COVID-19 PCR test within 24 hours of landing, and isolate at home until they return a negative result. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Rules for unvaccinated travellers remain the same, with those 18 years or older required to do 14 days of hotel quarantine once they arrive. The two states now have consistent COVID-19 requirements governing their international borders. But, under NSW's guidelines, travellers must also get a follow-up test on the sixth day after their arrival, whereas those in Victoria need to get tested between days five and seven. The changes come around three weeks after NSW and Victoria tightened border rules, introducing a 72-hour isolation mandate in response to the Omicron variant. In a joint release, the premiers of NSW and Victoria said the changes were a result of high vaccination rates and would ""streamline"" processes for airlines and travellers. ""This announcement is about simplifying the process and making sure Australia's two biggest cities have a consistent approach,"" New South Wales Premier Dominic Perrottet said. ""With more than 92 per cent of Victorians 12 years and older double-vaccinated, Victorians have given themselves the strongest chance of living safely with coronavirus and enjoying more freedoms this festive season, while we continue to monitor the Omicron variant,"" Acting Victorian Premier James Merlino said.

364,'The War Memorial on water': Seaplanes on Lake Burley Griffin given green light by NCA despite pushback,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Canberra's National Capital Authority supports plan to use Lake Burley Griffin as seaplane runway despite backlash Canberra's biggest yacht club has slammed the National Capital Authority (NCA) for saying it will support the use of seaplanes on Lake Burley Griffin, despite more than 65 per cent of public submissions rejecting the idea. Two separate seaplane operators want to use the lake to fly between Canberra and Sydney, or Canberra and the NSW South Coast. After a demonstration last year the NCA — which controls Commonwealth land in the area of the lake — put the proposal to community consultation, before deciding whether it was viable. But despite just 21 of the 107 submissions supporting the idea, the NCA has given it the tick of approval. They believe that if concerns around the plan are ""appropriately managed"" the planes would provide a ""unique travel tourism link to the nation's capital"". But lake users have called today's decision ""the War Memorial on water"", drawing parallels between the NCA's decision to push ahead with an upgrade to the Australian War Memorial despite public opposition. Two operators — Sydney Seaplanes and South Coast Seaplanes — have shown interest in using the west basin of Lake Burley Griffin, near the National Museum of Australia, for the take-off and landing of their seaplanes. Sydney Seaplanes has proposed a commuter service between Lake Burley Griffin and Sydney's Rose Bay operating thrice daily, while South Coast Seaplanes has expressed interest in establishing tourism-focused operations between Canberra and the NSW South Coast once or twice a week. But the plan received criticism from lake users, including Canberra's largest yachting club, who raised concerns around safety. During the NCA's six-week community consultation phase, which ran from May to June this year, the body said it received 107 submissions from various stakeholders including yachting and rowing clubs, tourism groups, community organisations and public lake users. Of the 107 submissions, 21 supported the idea, 71 rejected it, eight submissions provided a neutral or mixed response, and six said more information was needed before making a decision either way. The authority also said a poll taken by a Canberra-based online news outlet which posed the question to its readers: ""Should we allow seaplanes to land on Lake Burley Griffin?"", showed there was community support for the idea. Of the 833 responses on the Riot Act's poll, 408 rejected the plan and 425 supported it, agreeing the seaplanes were a ""fun idea that would enliven the lake"". ""The response to discussion regarding the potential for seaplane operations on Lake Burley Griffin has been invaluable to the NCA,"" the authority said. ""Feedback from the community has provided a fulsome understanding of the range of issues that need to be addressed as this work progresses. ""Consultation has established that, while it is recognised that operations would enrich the appreciation of Canberra as the national capital and contribute to a diversification of the local economy, further work is required to address the concerns of existing lake users."" The NCA said it would ultimately support the proposal once these concerns had been worked through with the relevant stakeholders. ""Subject to all operational, safety, infrastructure issues and commercial matters being appropriately addressed and formalised, [the NCA] will support the introduction of seaplane operations on the lake,"" they said. As part of the push for seaplane operations on the lake, a demonstration flight was conducted in December last year, which saw a seaplane take-off and land on the lake's west basin. At the time, Sydney Seaplanes director Aaron Shaw said that planes would only spend 5-10 minutes on the lake, and that the impact on lake users would be ""quite minimal"". ""All flights will be over water in the lake so noise concerns would be minimised by the fact that the plane's not flying over built-up areas, flights are only in daylight hours,"" he said. Nevertheless, the NCA said many of the submissions raised a number of concerns including environmental impact and noise pollution, with the ""single biggest"" concern revolving around safety for lake users. ""The NCA is of the view that the potential impacts of seaplane operations on Lake Burley Griffin can be appropriately managed and that there are significant benefits in creating a unique travel tourism link to the nation's capital,"" the authority said. ""As always the NCA must focus on Canberra as the national capital being a place for all Australians, while addressing the legitimate and well-considered concerns of the local community and current users of the public realm. ""Following feedback received through the consultation process the NCA will continue to explore how seaplanes may be facilitated. Of critical note is how to address the potential conflicts between seaplanes and other lake users (both current and potential future users). In this regard, the NCA confirms that further investigation and work is required."" Canberra Yacht Club Commodore Sue Hart said the NCA's decision to support the proposal was a surprise, especially given the lack of support among the submissions. ""This is a little bit like the War Memorial on water, isn't it? The War Memorial process was the same, there was a significant body of opposition against the memorial refurbishment, and they are still proceeding,"" Ms Hart said. ""There's a significant body of opposition to this and they are proceeding, so you have to wonder about the transparency and the openness of the whole process."" Ms Hart said she wanted the submissions to be made public but had been told they would not be. She also reiterated her concerns around the safety of lake users should the plan go ahead. ""We are not opposed to the proposal per se, our concerns lie with the fact is going to land and take off on the busiest part of the lake up to three times a day,"" Ms Hart said. ""I have severe concerns about safety. Today we have 60 children out on boats and if a seaplane were to come in and land when we aren't aware of the timing, I have a problem with getting those children off the lake. ACT acting chief minister Yvette Berry said the government ""tentatively supported"" the project but would wait until further community engagement had been completed. ""We understand there could be some really good economic benefits, but there are some environmental issues we've identified, also, of course, lake user groups like sailing and dragon boats and rowing have all raised concerns so that needs to be considered,"" Ms Berry said. ""We're a tentative support for the project and we will see how it goes, but we really want the NCA to make sure they engage with those user groups and take into account those environmental impacts."" NCA chief executive Sally Barnes told ABC Radio Canberra the next step was to come up with shared user guidelines for the lake. ""The message was safety, safety, safety, safety so what we've said is we think it's great value to continue looking at this, work with the seaplane operators — one from Sydney and one from down near Moruya— but also to work with the lake users on how to share the lake in a very safe way,"" she said. ""We need to get the lake users around the table and work on how we can have these guidelines so everyone knows what to expect — when things will be happening, who's on the lake, who the contact details are and how we manage the landings and take-offs."" A working group tasked with creating these guidelines will begin meeting in February next year.

365,"A can of Coke costs $53 in Antarctica. The White Continent is open for tourism, but it's not cheap",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Luxury tourism is landing in Antarctica — but at what cost? Decked out with wooden flooring, timber bedheads and even leather couches in the dining room, Wolf's Fang looks more like a Nordic guesthouse than a remote outpost in Antarctica. For around $US48,000 ($68,000) travellers can fly to and spend six days at the luxury polar campsite — taking part in various activities like hiking, abseiling and skiing. Visitors willing to spend more can also fly within the continent, watch emperor penguins and visit the South Pole. Once the temporary home of only the toughest explorers and dedicated scientists, Antarctica has seen tourism steadily grow in recent decades. But there are concerns about the environmental impact on the White Continent. Last month, the first-ever Airbus A340 to land in Antarctica touched down on the camp's private blue ice runway. Capable of carrying up to 254 passengers, the chartered flight was ferrying 23 people and supplies to the camp for this year's summer tourist season. Wolf's Fang and another camp, Whichaway, are run by White Desert tours, which flies tourists out of Cape Town, South Africa, to an area of Antarctica called Queen Maud Land. They take a maximum of 12 guests on expeditions but even with such small numbers, the logistics of each trip are immense and expensive. ""For us, it costs about $US38 ($53) for a can of Coke once it arrives in Antarctica,"" says White Desert's chief marketing officer, Mindy Roberts, who has just returned from a visit to one of the camps. ""So the cost of our trips is high."" Potatoes and carrots for the camps' food are peeled in Cape Town before departure, ""because we've got specific weight restrictions on getting things into the ice and the peelers are heavy,"" she says. Other tour companies also operate in Antarctica, in some cases offering private campsites, cruises and skydiving. According to the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO), 74,401 visitors travelled to Antarctica with IAATO member operators during the 2019-2020 season — compared to 56,168 visitors of the previous year. Only 731 visitors were ""deep field"" tourists, travelling inland by air. Most Antarctic tourists visit by sea, often with expedition cruises that make brief landings ashore on the Antarctic Peninsula, south of Chile. It's one of the world's last great wildernesses but all that protects Antarctica is a single treaty, negotiated more than six decades ago. Is it up to the task? While many operators emphasise their commitment to sustainability and ecological sensitivity, some involved in Antarctic research have voiced concern that tourism in Antarctica remains largely self-regulated. Despite multiple nations — including Australia — having territorial claims to parts of the continent, Antarctica itself isn't governed by one single authority but rather by the Antarctic Treaty, which has been ratified by 54 countries. That means tourism and visitor behaviour is mainly controlled through guidelines outlined in the Antarctic Treaty system. Operators also need to fulfil certain requirements to gain membership to IAATO. Those include the need to conduct environmental impact assessments, and provisional members must carry an IAATO observer aboard to ensure they're adhering to the organisation's standards. With Antarctic tourism expected to rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic, there are questions around how much longer those guidelines can successfully minimise the impact of visitors to parts of Antarctica — and whether tourists should be travelling there at all. ""When you look at people's ecological footprint to get to Antarctica, it's already unsustainable,"" says Freya Higgins-Desbiolles, a senior lecturer in tourism management at the University of South Australia. ""I know that some people will say the environmental education that the visitors get will outweigh their damage, because they become advocates for protection, but I think that's a pretty dodgy argument. ""What I'd like to see is firm regulations rather than voluntary codes of conduct."" Ms Roberts says there's a big difference between the mass tourism of cruise ships and the bespoke experiences provided by smaller operators. ""The majority of people that come to us are influencers, they're powerful, they're captains of industry, they're royalty, they're celebrities — people that do have an ability to influence change,"" Ms Roberts says. ""Antarctic tourism can be done in a sensitive and sensible way … but it's keeping it small. ""Operations in Antarctica are not easy, and so I don't think you're ever going to have even tens of tourism operators that do what we do."" There are many ways human activity can impact the Antarctic environment — from the carbon footprint of planes and ships to the effects of visitors on local flora and fauna. Humans have accessed more than two-thirds of the Antarctica and the proportion of places not impacted by people is shrinking, say researchers who are calling for greater protection of wilderness areas. ""Most Antarctic tourism concentrates in a relatively small area in the north-west Antarctic Peninsula and in a discrete number of sites within that area,"" says Ricardo Roura, a senior advisor with the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition. ""Even if people behave as required, there might be issues to do with the concentration of activities and their cumulative effects."" Mr Roura was a guest on a cruise ship to the Antarctic peninsula in December 2019, at the height of the tourism boom before the pandemic. ""It was kind of crazy, the whole thing, the whole set of activities,"" he says. ""In some instances, we had to leave the site earlier to let others come in, that kind of thing."" But he says inland tourism is also cause for concern. ""They have a big chunk of the Antarctic as a playground if they have the time and the means to get there,"" Mr Roura says. ""If land-based tourism expands, then it will open quite a new set of issues to discuss and a new set of concerns for us."" Then there's the potential for pollution. While the Antarctic Treaty requires waste to be removed, and for operators to have no more than a ""minor or transitory"" impact on the environment, damage can be unavoidable in the case of an accident. In 2007, the MS Explorer struck an iceberg while cruising off the Antarctic peninsula and sank, causing an oil spill near penguin breeding grounds. All 154 people on board survived after being rescued by nearby vessels. In 2011, the International Maritime Organisation banned ships from using heavy fuel oil in the Antarctic and in 2017, it introduced the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters. Tourism researcher at the University of Canterbury, Daniela Liggett, says interest in Antarctica is here to stay. ""I think it will pick up again after the pandemic, there is still an interest in visiting Antarctica as one of the 'last continents' that is still reasonably untouched by human presence,"" she says. A spokesperson from IAATO told the ABC that preliminary estimates from May this year suggest about 60,000 people will visit Antarctica in the 2021-2022 season. Mr Roura says the competition within the industry to offer unique experiences is one of the driving forces behind the growing numbers. ""There is this frenzy sometimes that people need to land in lots of places, they need to see all sorts of wildlife, they need to see all sorts of things and maybe that's just not possible or necessary."" Another driver of tourist numbers? The desire to see untouched wilderness of Antarctica before it disappears. ""'Last-chance tourism' is going to be the phenomenon that's driving the demand for it,"" says Ms Higgins-Desbiolles. ""But by engaging in last-chance tourism, we're actually causing the very thing that's the problem.""

366,"'We feel heard': Remote parents, tourism groups, essential workers welcome NT backflip on border rules",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus Parents across rural parts of the Northern Territory who have been separated from their children for an entire school term are celebrating a last-minute change to the jurisdiction's border rules. A controversial rule, which the NT Government scrapped yesterday, would have banned arrivals from leaving Darwin, Alice Springs or Katherine for the first 14 days they were in the territory. Even if their home was on a remote station, in the middle of nowhere. ""My phone has been ringing off the hook,"" Sarah Cook from the Isolated Children's Parents Association, which advocates for the education of children in remote and rural areas, said. ""We feel heard. And I tell you what: that is a nice feeling."" From Monday, December 20, interstate arrivals will now be able travel to regional areas, as long as they avoid remote communities where fewer than 80 per cent of the eligible population is vaccinated. Travellers must also be fully vaccinated and return three negative PCR tests, one prior to entry and two afterwards. Can interstate travellers visit Kakadu National Park? Can essential workers return to work in a remote community after visiting family in Queensland? We answer your questions. Ms Cook — whose own son was trying to return to the remote station where they live for the Christmas holidays — says the change means families will no longer face lengthy and potentially expensive stays in the three towns before they could return home. ""These families are absolutely exhausted and all they want is their family to be back together,"" she said. ""When those families get their children home, they'll have no contact with the wider public. ""They'll be in isolation, because that's where we live."" In overturning the ban on travellers venturing outside Darwin, Alice Springs and Katherine, acting NT Chief Minister Nicole Manison described it as a ""minor"" change. The move followed about a week of sustained criticism from people outside the territory's major centres. Unions for some of the territory's major employers, including the NT Police Union, have also welcomed the decision, which will allow members working in regional and remote areas to travel interstate without being forced to spend a fortnight in a regional hub upon their return. However, Australian Medical Association NT branch president Rob Parker warned the move would increase the risk of COVID-19 entering remote Aboriginal communities. Dr Parker said the ban on people visiting remote communities where less than 80 per cent of the population aged five years and over was fully vaccinated was a good measure. The tourism sector had also been lobbying against the abandoned rules because they would have made tourism drawcards such as the Kakadu, Uluru-Kata Tjuta and Litchfield national parks out of reach for interstate visitors on short trips. Greig Taylor, who runs a 4WD tour business in some of those areas, welcomed the relaxed requirements. ""We're heavily reliant on interstate travellers and, when people hear those sorts of measures, nobody is going to come to Darwin to spend 14 days in Darwin or even Alice Springs to be able to head out to Uluru or Kakadu,"" he said. ""In a peak booking period, which this would be for us, we virtually received no enquiries since this announcement."" However, he added, frequent rule changes had only added to uncertainty in the domestic travel market. ""People are really confused, markets are really confused, so [what] governments need to do is set a reasonable set of measures and they need to stick to that and then we need to communicate that to [the tourism] markets,"" he said. ""Right now, with all these compounding factors, markets are very confused and they're very nervous."" The NT COVID outbreak currently stands at 94 cases. Four cases linked to the local outbreak were announced yesterday, including two Timber Creek residents who tested positive at Royal Darwin Hospital after passing through Katherine. On Thursday morning, the NT government was still yet to list exposure sites associated with the Timber Creek cases confirmed in Darwin.

367,"Days out from NT's borders reopening, COVID-19 rules change again. Here's what's happening",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Just days out from the Northern Territory's borders reopening, the government has again made changes to entry requirements for interstate travellers. From December 20, all interstate arrivals to the Northern Territory will have to comply with the same set of rules, regardless of whether they've been in Perth or Melbourne. Everyone will need to be fully vaccinated and return three negative PCR tests. But a new set of regulations, announced this afternoon, will affect people who want to travel to iconic locations — such as Kakadu National Park or Uluru — in the first two weeks after entering the territory. They'll also impact when remote residents and essential workers can return home. Here's a break down of the new changes. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Everyone entering the Northern Territory must be fully vaccinated. They also need to return a negative PCR test within the 72 hours before entering the territory, a second test within the first three days of arrival and a third test on day six. But, from Monday, no one will need to home quarantine in the Northern Territory, no matter where they have come from. Yes. Under the old rules, interstate arrivals to the Northern Territory needed to stay in ""high-vaccination zones"" for their first 14 days, which meant they were restricted to Greater Darwin, Alice Springs, and Katherine. This meant tourists were banned from travelling to remoter places, including Uluru or Litchfield National Park. But these rules have now changed. Interstate arrivals will now be allowed to visit national parks but are banned from entering remote communities where fewer than 80 per cent of eligible residents are fully vaccinated. There are 66 remote communities across the Northern Territory where vaccination rates are under this benchmark, and they're listed on the NT Health website. Yes. Returning residents — including boarding school students, essential workers and the families of essential workers — are allowed to go home, even if their community has a low-vaccination rate. But there will be some extra COVID-safe measures in place. New arrivals will need to do their second PCR test, the one they need to take within the first 72 hours of arriving in the Northern Territory, before they travel to their community. But they don't have to wait for the result before they head home to keep vulnerable residents safe. Travellers will have already returned a negative PCR test — their first test — before re-entering the Northern Territory. They'll also need to wear a mask in the community for the first seven days after arriving in the NT when they can't socially distance. Essential workers will also need to do a daily rapid antigen test while in the community for the first seven days in the territory. You may be fined about $5,000. New arrivals will need to have downloaded the G2G Now app before touching down, and Acting NT Chief Minister Nicole Manison has warned people's movements will be monitored. ""If you head into a community without getting your first PCR test, or if you fail to get your day six test, we will know and you will be fined,"" she said. NT Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker added that police had ""some controls"" and would be alerted if interstate travellers entered an exclusion zones. If you need to stop at a vulnerable community to fuel-up or get food while travelling home, Ms Manison says you won't be penalised. ""This is permitted, as long as physical distancing, hand hygiene and use of the territory's Check-In is observed at all times,"" she says. If you live on a cattle station, for example, and it's not possible to get a day six PCR test, authorities say you'll be allowed to test yourself with a rapid antigen test instead. But experts are urging people who are unwell, or have any symptoms, not to wait until day six, but to get tested straight away. The changes, which Ms Manison today described as ""modest"", have been made after significant backlash from the NT's tourism and business sectors. Tourism operators said the old reopening plan would have crippled the industry and ruined holiday plans and business groups feared the previous proposal would have led to people cancelling their Territory travels. The NT Opposition has also accused the government of a lack of consultation. ""It is a modest change, but we believe it strikes the right balance between bringing Territorians together and keeping the territory safe,"" Ms Manison said.

368,The boom region ready to ride a wave over predicted Australian property market slump,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  No property market jitters for Rockhampton and Capricorn Coast region with job growth and investor confidence intact Experts are predicting that despite a looming interest rate rise and an inevitable property market correction, one region of Queensland will stay steady. The Rockhampton/Capricorn Coast region, which has a combined population of 120,000, is banking on several multi-million-dollar infrastructure projects to weather any downturn. ""I think we're sort of on a different playing field than your capital cities,"" property agent Noel Livingston said following predictions that Australian home prices would peak next year but fall by up to 10 per cent in 2023. ""We don't have a price structure that's anywhere near as high as [metro areas]. ""And so consequently, things like interest rate hikes, won't hurt us as much. ""We also have a region that has an enormous amount of jobs on its plate at the moment with infrastructure projects. ""So I just think those sort of things will hold us up when the inevitable turn comes."" The economic momentum comes after many years of lobbying and planning for major infrastructure projects by regional leaders. As a result there has been a wave of approved and funded civil works worth billions of dollars that are either underway or set to start. These include: There is also a large list of proposed business developments headlined by the $187m Surf Lakes tourism park on Yeppoon Road with 350 construction jobs. And billionaire Gina Rinehart's plan to buy the Great Keppel island Resort for $50m with a potential $1b tourism project to be developed over a decade is also expected to bring hundreds of ongoing construction jobs to the area. Development approvals for the resort include a 250-room beach front hotel, 300 luxury apartments, 285 luxury villas, 9,000 square metres of retail shops and a 250-berth marina. The airstrip also has approval to be extended. At Rockhampton Airport, Alliance Airlines is building a three-bay 10,000 square metre aircraft maintenance and repair facility to support the company's fleet of 74 aircraft. It will be the largest civil aircraft hangar in regional Australia with construction to finish in November 2022. The new facility is expected to create 225 jobs and inject $30 million into the local economy every year. ""Queensland as a whole is a desirable state to live in at the moment too, so we've got a few things going our way,"" Mr Livingston said. Alliance has commenced secondary school visits in Central Queensland with a view to recruiting up to 25 apprentices to commence training in the fourth quarter of 2022, with much of this training to be in Rockhampton. Rockhampton has just recorded its lowest rental availability rate of all time, surpassing the mining boom and in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr Livingston said strong job growth was powering the residential market (the rental vacancy rate is 0.5 per cent) however there was considerable interest from cashed up buyers in southern states who were targeting the Capricorn Coast market. ""A lot of it in our market here is fuelled by the increased amount of people due to the jobs and people upgrading as a result of that,"" he said. ""But then you go to the coast, and the coast is certainly seeing southern money coming in bucket loads. It's an attractive price structure compared to what coastal areas of the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast is. And we're seeing people from Sydney, people from Victoria, buying there sight unseen."" A long-term Rockhampton businessman Gary Thomasson has been through numerous economic cycles in the past 30 years as the owner of a homewares store. ""Right now it's certainly at a very high peak. Yeah, business has never been better, to be quite honest,"" he said after another bumper sales week. ""All the things that are happening around the area are going to hold us in good stead for quite some time to come. ""There's not only the Ring Road. You've got Rookwood Weir and the offshoots I'm hearing about with the macadamia nut farming which is not only going to be farming, there's going to be a processing plant as well."" ""There's a lot of things. You've got the airport with Alliance. That's got to be a big positive for us with the maintenance set up. It's just going to be massive. He said while all sections of his business were growing he made special mention of the home improvements sector. ""The standout is the home renovations, new kitchens, that type of thing. People are doing a lot of them. What we provide like ovens and dishwashers, cooktops, those type of products, that category is, is exceptionally strong. That comes off the back of people not doing international travel. I think they've invested in it in their own homes and that type of thing."" The Central Queensland building industry is reporting strong demand for renovations and new homes but is suffering from national supply chain issues which have delayed many projects. In November Rockhampton Regional Council approved 111 building permits with the majority of those works being roof repairs from the 2020 giant-hail storm which resulted in more than 14,000 insurance claims worth in excess of $800m. The repair work involving an influx of tradesmen to the region is expected to continue into 2023.

370,NT tourism operators brand vaccination rules the 'worst Christmas present' as businesses try to stay afloat,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tourism chiefs want the Northern Territory government to ease strict rules for visitors and residents, which they say will ruin Christmas for tour operators and others in the industry. Among other regulations, from December 20 the NT government wants vaccinated people to remain in approved high-vaccination zones for 14 days on arrival in the Territory. Tourism Central Australia (TCA) chief executive Danial Rochford said the rules would stop visitors and residents from visiting key tourism destinations over the holiday period, including Uluru, Kings Canyon and the east and west MacDonnell ranges. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic ""I've got a lot of very anxious and very concerned tourism operators,"" he said. ""We're back to square one where businesses have really lost a lot of confidence and morale. I'm seeing a lot of mental health challenges.

""It would mean that people would be able to visit central Australia's key tourist icons,"" he said. He says it will be a significant blow to the tourism industry if the requirement is not reversed. ""We're hopeful that government will listen to the concerns of the industry,"" he said. Mr Rochford said many operators were distressed . ""It is the worst Christmas present the government could give us,"" he said. ""The rollercoaster ride that this is just unbelievable for many small business owners. ""They're all running out of money and we're very much hopeful that the survival funds will hit bank accounts before Christmas."" Mr Rochford is also calling on Alice Springs residents to approach the Chief Minister's office and the Minister for Tourism. ""This is the time for everyone to stand up and share their views and share their concerns. ""I think if we can collectively voice our views and government will listen,"" he said. Ms Fyles said that changes would be announced in the coming days to ""provide certainty to Territorians who do wish to visit family interstate during the Christmas January holiday period"". ""And of course for our tourism industry — whilst at the same time keeping our vulnerable communities and Territorians safe,"" she said. ""We've acknowledged that the tourism and hospitality industry has been one of the hardest hit one of the most devastated throughout the pandemic."" Ms Fyles said the Territory was transitioning from a pandemic footing to an endemic and the uncertainty would continue.

People who flew on the first flight from Newcastle to Brisbane since Queensland's border was reopened have been deemed close contacts — and will spend Christmas in quarantine. Queensland Health on Tuesday night identified Virgin flight VA1105, which landed in Brisbane about 12:03pm on Monday, as an exposure site after a passenger tested positive. Everyone on a subsequent flight that left Brisbane for Townsville at 2:05pm that same day, VA375, has also been deemed a close contact and must isolate. It comes as health authorities are probing whether a suspected Omicron outbreak in Newcastle was sparked by a person who breached self-isolation rules. NSW Health has been ordered to investigate the activities of the person by Health Minister Brad Hazzard, and NSW Police has confirmed it was making inquiries. It is believed the outbreak at The Argyle House, which has now topped 200 cases, was seeded on December 8 during an event attended by a person who had also been at a Sydney boat party six days earlier. Clusters were seeded at both events, with the Omicron variant detected in infected revellers. Mr Hazzard said the person who attended both venues may have broken rules ordering them to self-isolate for seven days after being deemed a close contact. NSW Health released an alert about the infected boat party late at night on Tuesday, November 7, less than 24 hours before the Argyle event began in Newcastle. Further COVID restrictions were lifted overnight despite the NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard admitting the relaxation of measures, including for the unvaccinated, will likely lead to a further surge in the growing case numbers. There were more than 800 cases reported yesterday, the highest daily figure in NSW since the end of lockdown. A quarter of them are in the Hunter region and most of those are linked to a super-spreader event at a Newcastle nightclub. But Mr Hazzard has told ABC Radio Sydney the lifting of restrictions for unvaccinated people, and scrapping of density limits and mandatory QR code checks at some venues, will see COVID cases continue to rise. ""It will, I think you're right, but what it also says is that people have to take individual responsibility. We are not concerned at the present time that the health system won't cope. In other words, to put it in the positive, we think the health system will cope,"" he said. One venue in the Illawarra on the NSW south coast says the decision to lift restrictions for the unvaccinated has put them in a difficult position. From today, NSW residents are permitted to enter businesses including licensed premises regardless of whether they have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Illawarra Hotel published a social media poll asking patrons whether they wanted unvaccinated people inside the bar. Owner Ryan Aitchison said they are concerned they will be targeted online if they choose not to allow unvaccinated patrons. ""Just from putting up that poll we got the most threatening messages we have ever had,"" he said. ""You are literally trying to please everyone and getting some horrific things said to you and knowing that is going to go straight to your reviews. It is a lot to stomach."" ""Businesses want to be well-reviewed online and the fact that we can be held to ransom by a small and very noisy section of society is not a good feeling."" Newcastle's tourism and hospitality operators say they are seeing cancellations as the city's COVID outbreak worsens. Businesses are cancelling end of year functions and restaurant bookings are also diminishing, Newcastle Tourism Industry Group president Kent Warren said. He said many people want to increase their chances of being with friends and family for Christmas. ""As much as we are disappointed it is understandable and what we are thankful for is that the consumers are moving themselves as opposed to waiting for the government to move which I think is right,"" he said. At around 200 cases and climbing, the COVID-19 outbreak stemming from a Newcastle nightclub is being billed as 2021's largest superspreader event in Australia. The latest outbreak started when a person infected with the Omicron variant visited The Argyle House nightclub on December 8. The life of Holocaust survivor Eddie Jaku will be celebrated at a state memorial service at Sydney Town Hall today. Mr Jaku, who described himself as the ""happiest man alive"", died aged 101 in October. Born in Germany and under the Nazi regime, he was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp and later to Auschwitz, where his parents were murdered. Having narrowly survived, he moved to Australia during the 1950s and became one of the founders of the Sydney Jewish Museum. ""This is my message, as long as I live, I'll teach not to hate,"" he wrote in his autobiography, published last year to mark his 100th birthday. Sunny with a late shower.

372,Tasmania's latest COVID-19 rules and restrictions — everything you need to know,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The border is open, the Tasmanian drawbridge is down and arrivals from COVID-19 hotspots are flowing in. After close to two years of travellers needing to go into mandatory quarantine, we now need to get used to the new rules and a way of life that has active COVID-19 cases in the community. If you need help understanding the rules and want to know where to look for other information, we've got you covered. Tasmania's border entry conditions depend on your COVID-19 vaccination status — fully vaccinated or not — and whether you have been in an area declared high or extreme risk. This page lists areas and their current risk status. All travellers to Tasmania, including returning residents, need to provide their contact and travel details before entering the state on the Tas e-Travel system, which has replaced the G2G pass. Travellers will need to return a negative result on a rapid antigen test a day before arriving in Tasmania, and declare the result on their e-Travel application. For Tasmanians returning to the state, and for others coming to the island, the requirements vary, depending on where you have been, how long you were in that area and your vaccination status. It's best to check the government's website in regards to your personal circumstances. You will need to wear a mask in all public indoor settings — inside all offices, shops, restaurants, pubs and clubs, public transport and supermarkets. You don't need to wear a mask in your own home and obviously, you can remove the mask when you're eating or drinking at a pub, cafe or restaurant. Masks will need to be worn at gyms and fitness centres, but not when undertaking vigorous exercise. You don't have to wear a mask when you're visiting someone else's house, but you might like to. People aged 12 and under are exempt from the mask mandate. The mandate was announced after worrying COVID case figures from New South Wales and that state's speedy relaxation of restrictions. ""I think they have taken their controls off a little earlier than what they should've,"" Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said at the time. More information about face masks and when you need to wear them can be found here. Yes. Are you feeling anxious about Tasmania's border reopening? There are some practical ways to ease your concerns and focus on the positives. Tasmanians and visitors are required to use the Check In TAS app when they visit a range of businesses, organisations and events in the state. This contact-tracing contingency is considered one of the keys to combating an outbreak, should one happen. Don't have a smartphone? You can check in by filling in a contact-tracing form usually found near the entrance of a venue. You could also apply for a Check In Tas card. The free Check In Tas smartphone app can be downloaded from Google Play or the Apple store. Visit the government website for more information about the Check In Tas app. The list of situations where you need to be able to prove you have been fully vaccinated is growing. If you're out drinking and dancing in Tasmania you need to be able to prove you are fully vaccinated — so, how can you do that? And what if you don't have a smartphone? Childcare workers, people frequenting and working in stand-up drinking venues, people working in aged care facilities, quarantine facilities, medical and health care settings and disability support care staff are among those being required to be vaccinated against COVID-19. We did this explainer on how to add a vaccination certificate to the Check In Tas app. More information on vaccination requirements and exemptions can be found on the government's website. Information about booking a vaccination and arranging booster shots can be found here. Tasmania's COVID dashboard will be updated each morning at 10am and will be where any new cases will be announced first. The Premier and health authorities may or may not hold a COVID media conference after new figures are announced but they have indicated they will stray from the early pandemic feature of the daily COVID press conference that many other states are used to. Modelling on the scenario of borders opening with increased public health measures and high level of contact tracing, completed before the emergence of the Omicron variant, has warned Tasmanians to expect: The Omicron variant is not factored into the modelling and may lead to a different outcome as it appears to be even more infectious than Delta, but also less severe and leads to fewer hospitalised patients. The island's medical and pathology services have been preparing for the opening ahead of time. Meanwhile, the government has identified ""eight behaviours and action"" it says will ""help lower your personal risk as well as the risk to our community"": When COVID-19 does start to make an impact, it will be important to stay informed. Symptoms may include fever, runny nose, cough, sore or itchy throat, breathing difficulties and loss of taste or smell. As demand for COVID tests continues to rise across the country, Tasmania is changing who is eligible for PCR testing. Here's everything you need to know. Testing rules changed from January 1, with only symptomatic people and people who have returned a positive rapid antigen test told to go get a PCR nasal swab at a government-run testing clinic. Close contacts of a confirmed case who have no symptoms don't need to go get tested. Information on where and how to book a test can be found here. If you have been tested due to having symptoms and are not in quarantine, you are urged to ""stay at home while you wait for your results and don’t go to work, school, shops or any other social gatherings"". It is understandable if you, or people you know, are feeling nervous about Tasmania's reopening: We made this to help. The Mental Health Council of Tasmania has created the Check In website to encourage all Tasmanians to look after their own mental health well-being and check in with friends and family. There are many useful mental health and support resources listed on this webpage. More information on the current restrictions and official advice can be found on the Tasmanian government's coronavirus website. Set the ABC News website or the app to ""Tasmania Top Stories"" from either the homepage or the settings menu in the app to continue getting the same national news but with a sprinkle of more relevant state stories.

373,"5,000 arrivals in a day: Hobart Airport predicted to have busiest day on record",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Hobart Airport is predicted to have its busiest day on record, as the state fully reopens its border to mainland Australia for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic started. Forty-one flights are scheduled today, with around 5,000 passengers arriving and 2,000 leaving. After nearly two years of restrictions, the state is now welcoming vaccinated visitors from COVID-19 hotspots. The first flight from Melbourne touched down in Hobart around 7:35am and since then scenes of hugs and tears have been repeated throughout the day as families and friends reunite. As many as 13 flights will make their way into Launceston, including seven originating from Melbourne. The first Spirit of Tasmania sailing from Melbourne docked in Devonport this morning, and an extra sailing has been added today. Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein told AM the first sailing ""was a great success"". ""We had zero people that were required to quarantine, zero people that attempted to come in unauthorised and so people are following the rules,"" he said. ""I'd just urge people right around the country that if you are coming to Tasmania, make sure you are fully vaccinated, and if you are coming from one of those high-risk areas, have a test, if not, we will pick you up at the border and if you are unvaccinated we will ask you to go home."" By early afternoon, police said two people had already fallen foul of the requirements. One arrived in Hobart from overseas via Adelaide and was sent straight to hotel quarantine. The other was not vaccinated and opted to return to Adelaide. ""Both these people have been issued a caution in regards to breaching the order,"" Inspector John Toohey said. ""We are taking an educative approach at the moment because we realise there have been significant changes."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic It's not just new arrivals who will notice the changes. Just under 300 people who had been confined to quarantine were released at the stroke of midnight. Tasmania's border reopening comes with the state having fully vaccinated 90 per cent of those residents aged over 16 years. However, just 65 per cent of the 12-15 age group have received two doses to date. According to Mr Gutwein, Tasmania will reopen as ""one of the most vaccinated places on the planet"". Tasmania's borders are opening and COVID-19 is coming, so what are the rules if you get infected and you are unvaccinated? Public Health director Mark Veitch said Tasmania had achieved a ""great"" level of vaccination coverage. ""That offers us far greater protection from COVID than we would have been at if the vaccination coverage had been, say, 80 per cent,"" Dr Veitch said. ""We've ensured as few Tasmanians as possible are exposed to the risk of serious consequences of COVID."" Travellers to Tasmania will remain subject to some isolation and testing requirements, some of which the Government was still tinkering with as late as Monday. People who return to Tasmania from hotspots after fewer than seven days away will need to get a COVID-19 PCR test within 24 hours of arrival, but will not need to isolate while awaiting the results unless they are symptomatic. Those who spend longer interstate before coming to Tasmania will need a negative PCR test no more than 72 hours before travel, if they have spent any time in a high-risk area within the previous 14 days. International arrivals will be required to quarantine for seven days, and to undergo two tests. Travellers who are eligible will also need to have been vaccinated. The Apple Isle has reopened to the rest of the country and the world. Have you got questions? We've got answers. Anyone at all who comes into Tasmania will need to have registered on the Tas e-Travel website and scan their pass as they enter. Mr Gutwein said travellers would face ""numerous checks"" to ensure they were clear on the rules, and extra biosecurity staff would be placed at interstate airports to provide information on the requirements. ""There will be additional police presence at our borders and, if you try to enter without meeting our requirements, you can face substantial fines or even imprisonment,"" Mr Gutwein said. ""Anyone caught flouting our rules faces an on-the-spot fine of $1,557 … you could also be summonsed with an offence resulting in up to six months' jail or a $17,000 fine.""

374,"Border rules dividing Katherine to be scrapped, more changes likely days out from NT reopening",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The Northern Territory government has flagged it will soon amend controversial border entry requirements which ban rural Katherine residents from returning home if they travel interstate. Health Minister Natasha Fyles says changes to the policy are on the horizon The Territory's border entry requirements are set to change on Monday. From then, there will be one clear set of rules for all arrivals: everyone needs to do three PCR tests but will no longer need to quarantine. To mitigate widespread transmission of COVID-19 to remote regions which have not yet reached a high vaccination rate, the new rules mean arrivals must stay in ""high-vaccination zones"" such as Greater Darwin, Katherine and Alice Springs for their first 14 days in the Territory. But residents of Katherine, still grappling with a spiralling coronavirus outbreak that led to the Northern Territory's longest lockdown, have been split by arbitrary lines on a map. Those who live in the very centre of town can go home without any issues. But those who live just outside of the Katherine township must first spend two weeks at a hotel in Katherine or Darwin at their own expense, even if home is only 100 metres away. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Earlier today, Health Minister Natasha Fyles said changes were expected to be made to the policy soon. Acknowledging the zone was ""quite a narrow area"", Ms Fyles said it would be broadened to encompass the entire Katherine local government area. ""We're very confident in the next few days we'll be able to make some changes that will allow families to come together, [and] provide certainty to Territorians who do wish to visit family and go interstate during the Christmas, January holiday period,"" she said. As confusion reigned over how the zone was marked across the township, residents have this week been rushing to cancel Christmas plans. The NT's border reopening is one week away. For many, it means no more quarantine just in time for Christmas. Trent de With was preparing to fly to Cairns with his family, but as a resident living outside Katherine's high-vaccination zone, he said a trip became unfeasible. ""We've had to cancel those plans,"" he said. ""Because if I return now from Cairns after December 20 I can't go to my own house, I'd have to go and book a hotel room which is two kilometres away from my house."" Katherine resident John Price told ABC Darwin Radio on Monday that the boundaries defining the town's ""high-vaccination zone"" looked as if someone had ""thrown darts at the dartboard'."" From his rural property, Mr Price said he could almost see the beginning of the border that marked Katherine's approved high-vaccination zone. ""I had a look at the map … and I live 500 metres away from the green zone,"" he said. ""Our street is considered Katherine rural, so therefore we can't [go] home. ""But a kilometre down the road is Knotts Crossing Resort and I can pay to stay for two weeks there."" On the other side of town, residents on Zimmin Drive are split completely down the middle of the road. Changes for Katherine residents are expected to be announced by the NT government in the next few days. Ms Fyles said the government was still working on the details of the potential changes. The new rules have been slammed by tourism groups, who say they will cripple the travel industry and ruin holiday plans. Ms Fyles said the tourism and hospitality industries had been ""one of the hardest hit"" during the pandemic, and the government was reconsidering its current rule banning tourists from low-vaccination zones (which currently include Kakadu National Park and Uluru) for two weeks. ""We're continuing to work very closely with industry groups, land councils, the community and health experts around those December 20 rules,"" Ms Fyles said. She said authorities needed to balance health advice with ""looking after the community more generally"". The government has also flagged that it might exempt essential workers who return from an interstate visit from having to spend 14 days in a high-vaccination zone before returning to a remote community with a low vaccination rate.

375,What travelling out of WA will look like after the border comes down,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Western Australia will reopen its borders at 12.01am on February 5, clearing the way for domestic and interstate travel. Whether you're planning a reunion with family in the eastern states or hoping to jet off to Europe for a holiday, there are a few things to consider before you get on a plane. You'll need to check the entry requirements of your destination. For domestic travel, you can check out this handy summary of state-by-state travel restrictions but keep in mind, these can change quickly. For international travel, you should check the official advice for the country you're flying into. Depending on the location, you might need to obtain a PCR test, show proof of vaccination, quarantine on arrival or purchase insurance. Australia currently has one green lane arrangement with Singapore, meaning West Australians can travel there without needing to quarantine. When you're booking flights, it's also worth considering the cancellation policy of airlines and travel agents. Some Australian airlines offer unlimited date changes while others are a little stricter. That depends on where you're coming from and how long you'll be staying. If you're coming from overseas and you're vaccinated, the good news is you won't have to quarantine for the first time since March 2020. You will, however, need to return a negative PCR test result within 72 hours prior to departure. You'll also need to do a second PCR test within 48 hours of arrival and a third test on day six. The domestic requirements are a little more complicated, falling within three categories: Scenario 1You are vaccinated and come to WA from interstate on a trip lasting five days or less. You'll need to show proof of a negative PCR test within 72 hours of departure. Scenario 2You are vaccinated and come to WA from interstate on a trip lasting more than six days. You'll need to do the above test plus an extra test within 48 hours of arrival in WA. Scenario 3You are vaccinated and leave WA but return within 5 days. You will not need a test before arrival, but you will need to do a PCR test within 48 hours of returning. You will still need to apply for a G2G pass to enter WA, regardless of where you're travelling from. It certainly does. Domestic travellers will not be allowed to enter WA without proof of vaccination. So if you're based in WA and you decide to fly to Melbourne for a holiday, you can't come back unless you're vaccinated. If you're an unvaccinated traveller entering WA from overseas, you'll have to quarantine for 14 days at your own cost in a hotel or a yet-to-be-built quarantine facility. You'll also be subject to quarantine caps imposed by the Commonwealth Government. The only exceptions to these rules apply to people with a medical exemption and children aged under 12. The state government is developing a new phone app that allows travellers to show proof of vaccination, use the SafeWA check-in system and register for a G2G pass. You can also show a printed copy of your COVID-19 vaccination certificate. PCR stands for polymerase chain reaction and involves a swab of your nose or throat to detect the presence of the virus. Currently, COVID-19 tests for the purpose of travel are not available at public clinics in WA. They must be done at private pathology clinics with a GP referral or pathology form. Premier Mark McGowan says his government is still figuring out how the system will work when the borders come down and demand for the tests explodes. There has been a lot of confusion over who is responsible for funding COVID-19 tests for domestic travellers. Last month, the federal Health Minister Greg Hunt confirmed domestic travellers did not have to pay for a PCR test if they required one because of a state or territory public health order, and only a text message was required for the result. The situation is different if you’re heading overseas. If the country you’re flying to requires an official PCR certificate, you’ll need to pay a fee for that. Before you return to WA, you’ll need to pay for a PCR test in the foreign country you’re departing from, with prices set by those jurisdictions. Rapid antigen tests,  which are cheaper and be purchased over the counter, could be another option. They're currently being given to truck drivers entering WA from other states and they have also been used in some industries, such as mining, with special permission from the chief health officer. The tests have been used widely in eastern states hit hard by COVID, including in schools, hospitals and aged care homes in Victoria and NSW. They allow for earlier detection and isolation of potential COVID cases, because they can be undertaken at home and return a result under 30 minutes. While the Premier Mark McGowan has said this could be a reasonable idea, he also stressed they are not as accurate as PCRs. He says the government is getting further advice and will consider all options in the lead-up to February 5. Forget flights and hotels — this could be the most important travel-related purchase you make. Major companies have started selling travel insurance again but there are many exclusions so make sure to check the fine print before you buy. Australians travelling overseas for the first time since international borders reopened are paying hundreds of dollars for travel insurance — but the fine print reveals some very big COVID-related exclusions. If you get sick while interstate, you'll be covered by Medicare. Hospital treatment is free in Australia for all Australian and New Zealand citizens, permanent residents and people from countries with reciprocal agreements. But that's not the case overseas, with treatment in some countries prohibitively expensive and payment required up-front. Before you book a trip, it's important to weigh up the risk of contracting the virus overseas and the impact that could have on your health and finances. It's also worth remembering that while we've been living in a COVID-19-free bubble, the situation is vastly different in other countries. In Norway for example, authorities are predicting between 90,000 and 300,000 new COVID-19 cases daily from early January without effective measures. The state government is concerned about WA regions that are lagging behind the rest of the state when it comes to vaccinations. The Pilbara has a double-dose vaccination rate of 46.1 per cent, the Kimberley is at 60.8 per cent and the Goldfields is at 65 per cent. You'll still be able to travel to those regions, but if they don't reach an 80 per cent vaccination rate by February 5, special restrictions will apply. Those will include the need for all travellers to show proof of vaccination to arrive by air. You'll also need to show proof of the jab to enter pubs, bars and bottle shops, dine in at restaurants and cafes and visit venues such as gyms and cinemas. If you can't show proof, you'll have to wear a mask at all indoor venues. Many of the state's remote Aboriginal communities are closed to visitors and this is likely to continue until vaccination rates improve. If you're planning a road trip through these areas, it's best to check the government's website first. The best thing you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones is to get a booster shot as soon as you're eligible. When making the border announcement yesterday, Premier McGowan said of the 212,000 West Australians eligible for a third dose, only 15 per cent had received one so far. If it's been five months since your second dose, you can make an appointment or go to a walk-in clinic for a booster. Additional restrictions will come into effect on February 5, including compulsory mask wearing in the following situations: See our full coverage of coronavirus We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

376,Regan has barely seen her fiance for two years. They'll finally be reunited when WA's border reopens,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Reactions to the WA government's border reopening announcement range from trepidation to elation. But for those separated from loved ones, like Regan Bembridge, February 5 could not come soon enough. On Monday WA Premier Mark McGowan announced the state would reopen its borders, almost two years after COVID-19 cut WA off from the rest of the world. Ms Bembridge took a job in Melbourne at the start of the pandemic and has been largely separated from her fiance Shaun Rodan ever since. ""I've been separated from my fiance for two years,"" she said. ""I took a job over here [in Melbourne] and then obviously was straight into lockdown and not able to get back. ""It's been really tough missing all of the important milestones; birthdays, anniversaries."" The pair have managed to visit each other a couple of times over the two years. ""It's a bit surreal that I can finally book a ticket without having to worry about two weeks quarantine or getting stuck or not being able to get back and missing work,"" Ms Bembridge said. ""It's just nice to know that things are kind of going back to some sort of normality and I can move freely. ""Someone told me earlier that everything was opening up and I literally booked a ticket for the 5th of February. ""So as soon as I could, I did, and I've got my ticket and I can't wait."" The news was also welcomed by The Rechabite general manager Anneika Britten, who is looking forward to the Perth venue being able to host interstate and international artists. Life will change dramatically when WA opens its borders to the rest of Australia and the world on February 5. Here's how. Western Australia will finally allow quarantine-free travel,  but there will still be strict testing requirements for anyone travelling into the state. International arrivals who have been fully vaccinated will need proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours prior to their departure. They will need to be tested again after 48 hours and on their sixth day in WA. The requirements are similar for domestic travellers, but they won't have to take a test on the sixth day. ""Really thrilled to hear we won't be operating at half capacity or anything like that, so we'll be able to bring acts from interstate and maybe even overseas and have that tourism business as well and be able to have the venue full and bustling again, it'll be great,"" Ms Britten said. ""Obviously safety is the utmost concern for everyone, but operating at half capacity when we had to was a bit of a struggle. ""A large building like this has pretty set amounts of people that are required to run it, so we really need to be busy to keep the business thriving and being able to operate at full capacity for these previous few months has been great."" Ms Britten said she was confident her business would be able to adapt to the state government's new app, which would also show people's vaccination status. ""Everyone that works in the industry is now pretty great at rolling with the punches,"" she said. ""So far the things we've had to contend with haven't been too difficult, so it's just about adapting really."" Broome tourism operator Candy Roberts said she lost about 70 per cent of her customers when the border closed in March, and West Australians had kept her business afloat. ""Parts were so challenging; [constantly] changing everything, cancellations and re-booking,"" she said. ""Refunds really took its toll for a while there, but West Australians really saved us. ""They have been coming and coming and coming, and it's just been tremendous."" If vaccination rates stay below 80 per cent in the Kimberley, Pilbara and Goldfields, proof of vaccination and mask requirements will be made mandatory, and unvaccinated people will be unable to fly to the regions. While Ms Roberts accepted this would have some impact on visitor numbers, she said it was for the best. ""I feel really excited, [but] now that we're going to open, we're going to have to be more diligent and be more mindful of what the news is, what's happening, and protect ourselves,"" she said. ""We need to own that and be responsible, and I'm really excited that we can open our borders to other states and get them coming again."" The reactions from shoppers in Perth's CBD were mostly positive, with many excited to make holiday plans, see family or just get on a plane. ""I have my family back in Malaysia and it's been two years since I last saw them,"" said one young woman. ""It would mean a lot for me to be able to go back and spend quality time with them."" Scientists around the world are racing to understand more about the latest COVID-19 variant, dubbed Omicron. An older shopper said her excitement for seeing overseas family members was tinged with concern about the virus entering WA. ""I would like to see my mum again in Scotland so hopefully she can come over or I can go back... it's been just over two years,"" she said.

377,How life will change when WA reconnects with the world on February 5,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  After two years, Western Australia's hard border is finally coming down. From Saturday, February 5, interstate and overseas visitors will finally be allowed to travel to WA with relative freedom — ending the ""island within an island"" COVID-mitigation approach Mark McGowan has championed since the start of the pandemic. But it will not be back to business as usual, with new rules and restrictions to govern travel to and from the west in the COVID-era. Here is everything you need to know about what restrictions will come into effect in the first week of February. From 12.01am on February 5, Western Australia's borders will officially reopen. Mr McGowan says barring an unforeseen emergency, the February 5 date is locked in and will not change. For the first time since March 2020, international arrivals will be allowed to enter WA without needing to quarantine. No travel exemptions will be required either, with borders officially open at that point. And WA will reopen to domestic travellers as well, albeit with some restrictions in place for trips from both interstate and overseas. The return of quarantine-free travel is a massive milestone, but things are not going back to how they used to be — even for the fully vaccinated. Strict testing requirements will remain in place for anyone travelling to WA. International arrivals who have been fully vaccinated will need proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours prior to their departure. They will then need to be tested again, both within 48 hours of arrival and again on their sixth day in WA. Importantly though, arrivals will not have to quarantine — unless, of course, they test positive to COVID. The requirements are similar for domestic travel, minus the need to test six days after arriving. Medicare covers the full cost of a PCR test if it is required for travel. Interstate travellers to WA and returning residents can access free tests at COVID clinics. Outside of WA, a test can be obtained for free with a referral from a doctor if they bulk bill, or from a COVID testing clinic. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Travellers might end up out of pocket for the cost of a doctor's consultation if they go to a GP who does not offer bulk billing. And there are a couple of exemptions to the other aforementioned rules. People making a brief trip interstate from WA, such as a weekend in Melbourne, will not have to be tested in that state before heading back west. And people visiting WA for fewer than six days will need to have tested negative before travelling, but not on arrival. A G2G pass will still be required, to help authorities track who needs to be tested. All the rules mentioned above are for people who have had both vaccine doses. For the unvaccinated, things will be very different. Domestically, no one who is unvaccinated will be allowed to enter WA, unless they are ineligible for the jab or have a medical exemption. Internationally, the unvaccinated will be allowed in, but there will be strict arrival caps and they will have to quarantine for 14 days at a designated facility. Some restrictions are returning, but Mr McGowan says he has tried to keep those to a minimum. Masks will be required on public transport, in taxis and rideshares, at airports and on flights and for visitors to hospitals or aged or disability care. But masks will not be needed in other settings, like major sporting events or nightclubs. Speaking of that, capacity limits will not change. There can still be a full house at the football and there will be no return of the two or four-square-metre rules at clubs, pubs or restaurants. But the unvaccinated will be barred from going to nightclubs, major stadia, the casino or events with more than 1,000 patrons. If you're in a region that has a double vaccination rate above 80 per cent, such as the Great Southern or South West, there will be no difference to the rules in Perth. But for those in regions with much lower vaccination rates, there will be much more severe rules. In any region which does not get to that 80 per cent benchmark by the reopening date, the unvaccinated will be banned from pubs, bars, cafes, bottle shops, gyms and indoor entertainment venues, while masks will be required at supermarkets. There are several regions of concern, but the most likely to face this predicament is the Pilbara, where the double-dose rate remains below 50 per cent. A total of 12-thousand people would need to be vaccinated between now and February 5 for the Pilbara to avoid those additional restrictions. COVID-19 is coming into WA. After years of trying to keep the virus out, WA is now inviting it in. Even with all the testing requirements, Mr McGowan says it is inevitable that COVID will enter the community. The experience in other states to reopen confirms that, as does the government's modelling, which expects there will be more than 300 infections per day later in 2022. But with a vaccination rate that will be at or near 90 per cent by the time WA reopens, Mr McGowan says the state can now safely reunite with the world without overwhelming its health system.

380,'Tying up resources': Calls to scrap Queensland COVID-19 tests ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  A Mid North Coast MP has called for COVID-19 PCR testing for travel into Queensland to be abolished after waiting times to get a test soared. Coffs Harbour MP Gurmesh Singh says the testing is an unnecessary requirement by the Queensland government. ""There's 'cautious', then there's just adding a burden to people for no reason,"" he said. ""This whole 72-hour-test-before, it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense and it would have been more sensible for Queensland just to allow people to come on up and get a test if they have any symptoms."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Testing clinics across the Mid North Coast have been inundated by cars full of families making their way north on the first day after Queensland's border reopened to New South Wales. Officials at the Coffs Harbour Stadium drive-through clinic warned of wait times of up to three hours, as they worked to administer more than double the amount of tests as this time last week. Among those waiting in line for more than three hours today were Krishna Ellis from Sawtell and her two adult children. They all required testing following the arrival of a family member home from London. ""We saw number plates from Queensland, Victoria, the ACT, and even the Northern Territory. There were entire families in cars full of luggage and 4WDs with boats on the top,"" she said. More than 4,700 tests were conducted across the Mid North Coast local health district last week with 1,571 of those on the Saturday and Sunday before the border reopened — a big jump on the previous weekend's 775 tests. Queensland has kept its borders shut to large chunks of Australia for many months, but that changes today, with the state opening up to travellers from domestic COVID-19 hotspots. Here are the rules around visiting. Bottled water and portable toilets are being provided at some drive-through testing sites across the coast, as summer temperatures hover in the mid-20s. Despite the long lines, Mid North Coast Local Health District says the wait to receive results should not change. ""Advice from our pathology providers is that test results are still taking between 24 and 48 hours,"" it said in a statement. ""We know there are long wait times at the moment, and we understand this can be frustrating for those who are waiting in line, but please remember our team is there to help you."" The surge in testing numbers is due to a requirement by the Queensland government for anyone entering the state from a COVID hotspot to provide evidence of a negative COVID test result taken 72 hours before arrival into Queensland. Queensland considers all of NSW a hotspot. Mr Singh said his call to dump testing does not downplay the seriousness of the pandemic. ""Whilst COVID is very real and very transmissible, unless you have symptoms, unless you've been somewhere or been in contact with someone, it's just tying up tests needlessly,"" he said. Mr Singh said there were other options available to the Queensland government, like using rapid antigen testing. ""Now that we've got such high vaccination rates in NSW, and Queensland's vaccination rate has also improved, I think other options should have been considered.""

381,"In this Moroccan mountain village, winter snow means months of isolation",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  In this Moroccan mountain village, winter snow means months of isolation For the people of the remote Moroccan village of Timahdite, nestled in North Africa's highest mountain range, heavy snowfall brings weeks, or months, of isolation. Nomadic Amazigh tribes living there rely on sheep that graze on the lush forests around the village. Timahdite, east of Casablanca, sits at an altitude of 1,800 metres in the Middle Atlas Mountains. But as winter sets in, they are gradually cut off from the world. The mountains, known for their red-shaded soil, give way to what seems like endless white. The isolation remains until the road leading to the village is reopened by local authorities' tractors. But they are often delayed. After just a week under the season's first snowfall, the pool and foosball tables that youth use to pass the time are fully covered. The sheep are tucked together in a small barn for days. When the snowy weather finally recedes, families try to resume their lives. Children trek along the winding roads to reach the nearest school. While most of the men resume work in nearby towns, women carry the weight of village life. They chop wood from a nearby forest that is used for heating and bake Amazigh bread from flour stored weeks beforehand for winter. In the afternoons, they walk or ride donkeys to nearby lakes or water sources and wash clothes that can finally dry in the sunlight. Sometimes, they carry the shepherd's role too. Heavy rain and snowfall are generally welcomed in Morocco, a coastal country on the edge of the Sahara with few sources of fresh water. Farmers look forward to the rainy season as agriculture depends on storing rainwater in dams, and prices of vegetables and fruit can be affected by levels of rain. But for people like Aqli Fatima, standing in her home as her daughters feed the chickens and clean a rug, winter weather brings hardship. In spite of her family's best efforts to use bricks or nylon bags as protection, water from rain and melted snow leaks into their small living room. ""It's like this every year, there is nothing to do but pray,"" she said. Mohamed Miloud sits in his home as his children are dropped off in a school transport vehicle. A solar panel is perched on top of his brick home as his daughter Ihsan peeks out of the door. ""Maybe things will be better for them,"" he said.

382,'Going to decay': Shops left empty despite growing demand,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Frustration as Queenstown shops stay empty despite rental demand In Queenstown on Tasmania's West Coast, there's growing unease about the number of shops on the main street being snapped up by a single group of developers, and then left vacant. That's despite a housing boom, growing tourism industry and a new TV show being filmed nearby. According to the West Coast Council, ""anecdotally high numbers"" of business owners looking for retail space in the town have been unable to secure it. Rental prices ""far above the market"" have been cited as one factor causing problems, as have negotiated terms that unexpectedly change or disadvantage businesses. Locals tell of asking to rent the shops from John — whose number is advertised in the windows — but being flatly told no, or being asked to pay rental prices they believed were exorbitant and unfeasible for the area. Anthony Brown from Destination West Coast said there is not a lack of demand. ""They're empty because they're charging what I see to be mainland or Hobart prices for a town that isn't at that level,"" he said. ""When you walk down the main street it looks empty. That's really not what we want to portray from a tourism point of view. ""We're trying to grow, and in a growing town and a growing population you need some understanding, but there just doesn't seem to be any."" Shop manager Sophie Suitor speaks to the community's frustration. ""What are they doing with them?"" ""It's just a waste of buildings really, and the longer they're left unoccupied the more they're going to just decay."" The West Coast Council has been trying to work out a solution — a vacancy levy has been suggested, to encourage the landlords to lease the buildings. That might not solve the problem. Rent prices have an impact on a building's valuation, which means a landlord could be better off keeping a building vacant than agreeing to rent it at a lower price, ensuring a better long-term return. Many of the costs of that strategy are tax-deductible. Mayor Shane Pitt has asked the developers to ""come to the table"" to find a solution. ""The rent they're asking for is fairly high, and for a new business opening up it's not easy,"" he said. The Hobart-based company that owns many of the buildings, Delta Pi Pi Pty Ltd, declined an interview. In a statement, the company said it had purchased the properties and was upgrading them following the closure of the local copper mine more than seven years ago. It said they were available for lease at market rates, and it was keen to see them occupied. Mr Brown believes competing interests are at play. ""People who are here are here for a reason, they're part of the town and they immerse themselves in the town,"" he said.

383,COVID 'refugees' prepare for rush on Queensland border as restrictions ease,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Les Mather and his wife Lynne have called a Tweed Heads caravan park home for nine weeks, waiting to cross the border into Queensland. Now, on the eve of the long-awaited border changes, they're counting down the hours until they're allowed to cross. From 1 o'clock tomorrow morning, a relaxation of the state's border rules means those coming from hotspots can enter without having to quarantine if they're fully vaccinated and can show a negative COVID-19 PCR test result no older than 72 hours. Les and Lynne sold their Port Stephens home more than two months ago and have a new house under construction on Bribie Island, but they've been stuck on the NSW side of the border. ""We knew we were going to be here for a little bit of time,"" Mr Mather said. ""We didn't expect to be here as long as we have been."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic But Mr Mather said Monday was the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and he and his wife would waste no time. They plan to be among the first people to enter Queensland. ""I'm anticipating leaving here about 2 or 3 o'clock Monday morning,"" Mr Mather said. They're among dozens of ""border refugees"" who have set up temporary homes at caravan parks in northern NSW in recent months, greeting news that restrictions would ease with a ""sort of euphoria"".,"" Mr Mather said. ""There's probably 20 or 30 couples (at this caravan park alone), some families as well, waiting to get over the border."" The new border declaration pass will only become available at midnight tonight, just an hour before the relaxation of rules. People entering from hotspots must be vaccinated, have a border declaration pass and a recent negative COVID-19 PCR test result. Border zone residents do not need to provide a negative result to cross, but they are concerned about the expected long delays. Coolangatta cafe owner Kylie Bastos welcomes the return of tourists, but says locals are worried about how the easing of restrictions will affect the border community. ""They're all very concerned about how the border reopening will affect their daily lives,"" she said. ""They're going to extreme solutions. ""Some of my customers are parking a car on each side of the border line and walking across, just so they can take their kids to school, or run their businesses. ""I know others are just going to bunker down for a few days and see what happens."" Acting Chief Superintendent Rhys Wildman said the Gold Coast police response to the pandemic had been huge and, while the way they monitor border crossings would change tomorrow, the physical checkpoints would remain for some time. ""We're going to be there until 90 per cent (double vaccination target is reached),"" he said. ""We're just waiting to see the impacts of the omicron."" The hard border has been in place for a total of 436 days over three phases, with 1.4 kilometres of orange barricades forming a barrier through the Coolangatta-Tweed community. Act. Chief Supt Wildman said the strict border operations had allowed time to increase vaccination rates in preparation for living with the virus.

384,SA records seven new COVID-19 cases and high-risk exposure site in North Adelaide,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  South Australia has recorded seven new cases of COVID-19, with a North Adelaide bakery named as a high-risk exposure site. The cases are four men aged between 20 and 40 and three women aged between 20 and 60. One of the cases acquired the infection interstate. Three of the cases acquired their infection locally and are known contacts of previously reported cases, with one contact linked to the Norwood cluster. According to SA Health, the remaining three cases are linked but the local source of infection is yet to be identified. A man in his thirties has been transferred to the Royal Adelaide Hospital and is in a stable condition, bringing the total number of recent COVID-related hospital admissions to three. The 24-hour Bakery on O'Connell in North Adelaide has been listed as a ""high-risk, close contact exposure location"" after a positive case visited there late on Tuesday, between 11.20pm and 12.50am Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Woodville South McDonald's has been listed as a close contact exposure location, on Wednesday between 1.30pm and 2pm, as has the No.9 Karaoke Bar in the city, on last Saturday from 9pm to the early hours of Sunday morning. The Rebel sports store at Gepps Cross, the restaurant Pho Vinh Hoa at Rosewater, and the Golden Grove Central Districts Baseball Club at Surrey Downs have all been listed as casual contact exposure locations. Earlier on Saturday, Premier Steven Marshall defended increasing quarantine requirements for those exposed to the Omicron variant, saying it aims to reduce the risk of a wide-spread outbreak before Christmas. On Friday, it was revealed close contacts of the COVID-19 variant, Omicron — or suspected cases — will be required to quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status, instead of the usual seven days for vaccinated people. Mr Marshall said South Australia was adopting the same quarantine protocols for Omicron as the ACT and Queensland. ""At this point in time, we are being cautious. We don't want a big Omicron outbreak in South Australia just before Christmas,"" he said. However, Mr Marshall said, he was hoping the quarantine requirement could soon be reduced back down to seven days. ""It's a general consensus among most of the states to go to 14 days in the early days of Omicron,"" he said. ""But we think, as we gather more information, we will be in a position to lower that. ""We are also looking at all of the close contacts [who] have been asked to go into 14 days' [quarantine[. We will do more detailed investigation with them and, if we can remove them from the 14-day program, we will."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Casual contacts of Omicron cases are still required to get tested immediately and quarantine until they receive a negative test result and get retested on days six and 13. Mr Marshall responded to concerns that the increased quarantine requirement could result in fewer people using QR codes to check-in at places they visit in the lead up to Christmas. ""While there is a lot of fear out there, the reality is that fear has been whipped up by my political opponents — the reality is QR check-ins are at record levels in South Australia,"" he said. The government has removed the restriction for people coming in from New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT to have to isolate until they receive a negative test result. ""This was really slowing down the number of people [who] were coming in, especially ahead of the Ashes cricket,"" Mr Marshall said. Two of the eight COVID-19 cases recorded in South Australia on Friday are suspected to be the Omicron variant. ""We still suspect that the cases identified yesterday were Omicron, based on where these people were coming into South Australia, but we still need to do that final testing, the genome sequencing. That is happening. We probably won't know for another couple of days,"" Mr Marshall said. One or both of the suspected Omicron cases visited three exposure sites listed on Friday: General manager of The Memorial Hospital in North Adelaide, Janet Jongeneel, issued a memo on Friday, informing staff that a team member had tested positive to COVID-19. The staff member worked in an operating theatre on Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday, they felt unwell, proceeded to get tested and received a positive result Friday mid-morning. ""Staff and VMOs who have, at this stage, been identified as close contacts, have been instructed to have a PCR test and immediately self-quarantine while awaiting further instruction from SA Health,"" Ms Jongeneel said. ""We will await results of COVID-19 testing for these close contacts. At this stage, they are all well and not displaying any symptoms. ""In line with the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers in South Australia, all affected staff members and VMOs are fully vaccinated."" The Memorial Hospital has not been listed as an exposure site on the SA Health website. ""We only provide exposure sites when we haven't been able to contact and put people into quarantine that we need to or if it becomes a transmission site,"" Mr Marshall said. ""We do that because we don't want to create unnecessary fear. ""Often, it is a very small number of people who could have potentially come into contact with a positive case.""

385,"Brazil's health ministry website hacked, vaccination information deleted",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Brazil's health ministry says its website has been hacked, taking down several systems, including one with information about the national immunisation program and another used to issue digital vaccination certificates. The government put off for a week implementing new health requirements for travellers arriving in Brazil due to the attack. ""The health ministry reports that in the early hours of Friday it suffered an incident that temporarily compromised some of its systems … which are currently unavailable,"" it said in a statement on Friday. Police said they were investigating the attack. The alleged hackers, calling themselves Lapsus$ Group posted a message on the website saying that internal data had been copied and deleted. ""Contact us if you want the data back,"" it said, in an apparent ransomware attack. The message, which included email and Telegram contact info, had been removed by Friday afternoon, but the web page was still down. User data in the ConectSUS app that provides Brazilians with vaccination certificates had disappeared. The ministry said it was working to restore its systems. At a news conference on Friday evening, Deputy Health Minister Rodrigo Cruz said access to the vaccination data had not been recovered. Mr Cruz said it was too early to say whether the data had been lost. Under measures decided on Tuesday after President Jair Bolsonaro opposed the use of a vaccine passport, unvaccinated travellers arriving in Brazil will have to quarantine for five days and be tested for COVID-19. The requirement was due to start on Saturday, but the government said that would be postponed for a week as vaccination data was not accessible online following the attack. COVID-19 tracing forms for arriving airline passengers were still available on health regulator Anvisa's website, which was not targeted.

386,'I'm just in shock': Tour operators hit hard as fire rips through WA's premier tourist region,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Boranup Forest tour operators count cost of Margaret River bushfire emergency It is the busiest time of the year for tourism operators in Western Australia's South West, but business has been put on hold for many working in Boranup, where a bushfire has destroyed large swaths of the area's unique forest. However, firefighters have gained the upper hand over the blaze, managing to save Conto's campground, along with other tourism attractions, including Giants and Mammoth caves. On Friday night, fire crews secured the northern end of the fire ground and they spent Saturday tackling it from north to south, with a particular focus on the area around Caves Road. An emergency warning was downgraded to watch and act on Saturday evening due to favourable conditions and the fire being contained. The Department of Fire and Emergency Service's duty Assistant Commissioner, Rick Curtis, said while people should avoid the fire zone, he would encourage holiday-makers to keep their weekend plans in the wider South West region. ""We've got two fires and the conditions are becoming mild and we're getting on top of the fires and we'll manage them,"" he said earlier on Saturday. ""What I don't want is to deter tourism in the broader region. It's really important that we support local business and local economy."" WA Police said they believed the fire was deliberately lit near Mammoth Cave. They appealed for public assistance, including any information of suspicious activity in the Mammoth Cave area on Wednesday, December 8. They have also asked for dash-cam or mobile phone vision of vehicles in the area at that time. Mammoth Cave can be accessed via Caves Road and is near the border of Boranup and Forest Grove suburbs. Police said vision could be uploaded directly to Strike Force Vulcan, while information can be passed on to Crime Stoppers online or by calling 1800 333 000. A watch and act warning remains in place in the Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park and for people bounded by Mammoth Cave Road to the north, Caves Road to the east, Grace Road and Bridle Trail to the south and the coast to the west. At a community meeting on Friday night, locals were told some roadblocks had been shifted, allowing some residents to return home. The full impact on Boranup forest, in the heart of the fire zone, is yet to be revealed. The forest is well known for its towering Karri trees, wildflowers and birdlife, and it's also a popular spot for mountain bikers. Michael Brooks runs bike tours in the forest and said he was really worried about what would be left of the place he called home. ""It doesn't sound good for big pockets of Boranup forest,"" he said. ""I'm a bit shocked, I'm just in shock at the moment."" Mr Brooks has cancelled his tours this weekend, which he said was a further blow to his business that had already been confronted with a lack of interstate and international tourists. ""It's a bit of a tough blow after all the COVID stuff and you get rebuilt and then you've got bushfires to deal with."" Fellow adventure tour operator, Cam O'Beirne, agreed. He cancelled tours for 20 people this weekend and said he was worried about what the future held for businesses like his. ""In terms of running any tours I don't think we will be doing anything in the forest in the near future, even in the medium future, which is really difficult for cash flow."" Dr O'Beirne has called for the state government to step in to help. ""We had bookings forward into march next year … we had a lot of people coming interstate from Brisbane which was fantastic but with what's happened now, with the forest being closed in the short to medium term, I can't see it being viable."" A number of campsites, caves, wineries and accommodation providers have been forced to close because of the fires. Margaret River Busselton Tourism Association's CEO Sharna Kearney said the impact of the fires on visitors was immediate. ""A lot of people who were in campgrounds at the Leeuwin Naturaliste National Park obviously departed at the commencement of the alerts that went out and they returned home,"" she said. ""We know that it will be much quieter in Margaret River this weekend."" She said the impacts would be felt even after the flames were extinguished. ""It is likely to have a long-term impact, we understand that significant parts of the Boranup forest have been damaged by the fires,"" she said. There are also several caves in the area, including the popular Lake and Mammoth caves, which Ms Kearney said could remain closed for some time after the fires. ""Once we get the all-clear to get back in, we will be able to assess what the damage looks like,"" she said. ""At this point, we understand that the buildings have been able to be saved but there may be impacts to other parts of the infrastructure."" Giants and Calgardup caves remain closed, along with the Conto's, Point Road, Boranup and Jarrahdene campgrounds. Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park, Redgate Beach and the Cape to Cape track also remain shut. Caves Road between Redgate and Bushby Road are also off-limits. Authorities said on Saturday night that Bussell Highway was now open. A watch and act warning is in place for people bounded by Forest Grove Road to the north, Bussell Highway to the east, Bushby Road and Hamelin Bay Road West to the south and Caves Road and the park to the west. Western Australia's Emergency Services Minister Reece Whitby said it was unclear how the fires would affect businesses heading into the busy summer season. ""I empathise with any business in terms of short-term issues where they’ve planned to be open and then aren’t able to but I’m not too aware of too many instances of that because of the current situation,"" he said. ""We are on the cusp of the school holiday period, and I think you can already see many tourists in town.

387,Heather Ewart goes off-road and on point with her top 10 road trips,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Back Roads host Heather Ewart continues her top 10 Aussie road trips on the off-beaten tracks of WA From the quaint towns along the Oodnadatta Track to the snowy vistas of Dinner Plain in the Victorian high country, we've already highlighted some must-drive road trips in South Australia and Victoria, but we can't stop there, the famous Nullarbor crossing beckons us. The great dilemma when you've crossed the mighty Nullarbor from South Australia to the west is what direction to take next. Head from Norseman towards the historic mining town of Kalgoorlie or go for the perfect white beaches and stunning turquoise waters around Esperance? It's a tough choice, and ideally, you'd do both. For me, when time was running short, Esperance won the day. I'd always dreamed of visiting Lucky Bay in the Cape Le Grand National Park about 40 minutes' drive from Esperance, but nothing could have prepared me for the sheer, gobsmacking beauty of this place. I wondered why on earth I hadn't come sooner. As we rounded each bend, the views just got better and better. It was a clear sunny October morning when we pulled up to see kangaroos bouncing along an otherwise pretty much deserted beachfront at Lucky Bay. The temperature was about 20 degrees Celsius – not what you might call ideal swimming weather by WA standards. But there was no way I was going to miss diving into those bright, sparkling waters before me, surrounded by rolling heathlands and granite peaks in the distance. What a bracing and memorable swim it was, and well worth the odd shiver at the end. It was hard to drag ourselves away, and I'm sure many a traveller has felt the same way. Western Australia is a state full of surprises and diverse scenery, and there's no quick way to see it all. But from Esperance, it's an easy drive to the southern wheatbelt and the little town of Kulin, famous for its Tin Horse Highway and annual bush races. Make sure you book tickets, though, if timing your visit for this highly entertaining three-day fundraising event because I hear it's become even more popular since being featured on Back Roads back in 2019. The Tin Horse Highway leading to the racetrack is lined with colourful works of art created by local farmers and residents from all sorts of bits and pieces lying about in their yards and workshops. What started out just over 20 years ago as a way to promote the races has become quite a fierce and impressive competition to produce the winning tin horse each year. Both visitors and locals get to enjoy the results all year round. Of course, no journey to the west can ever be complete without travelling far north to take in the Kimberley and the Pilbara. Each region is spectacular in its own way, but I reckon the Kimberley already gets its fair share of publicity so I want to give a shout out this time for the Pilbara, which is about way more than its vast iron ore deposits and towns custom-built for mining workers. From Karratha all the way to Tom Price and beyond, the rich red tones of the earth, the rugged gorges, ancient landscapes and precious Indigenous artworks and heritage are simply unforgettable. I've been fortunate to do a few road trips through the Pilbara – one in a long road train from Karratha to Newman back in 2017 with friendly driver Heather Jones, who'd set up her own trucking company, The Pilbara Heavy Haulage Girls. We called ourselves the two Heathers, and she generously allowed me to have a brief crack at taking the wheel myself. Stream more of Heather's adventures on iview. The standout in the Pilbara for me though would have to be Karijini National Park, about an hour-and-a-half drive from the mining town of Tom Price. It's the state's second-largest national park, full of beautiful gorges, cascading waterfalls and some of the oldest rocks on the planet. There's a wonderful network of walking trails with lookouts and swimming spots with crystal-clear freshwater pools along the way. I managed to make my first trip there early this year, and it will feature in the next series of Back Roads when it returns in January 2022. I find there's a really powerful pull to the Pilbara once you've had even the smallest taste of what it has to offer. There's no question I'll be back for more when the borders open. Heather returns to the screen with a new series of Back Roads starting January 3, 2022 on ABC TV at 7.30pm. Until then, head over to ABC iview to watch the show's previous seven series.

388,"The Vivid festival-style 65,000 LED Christmas light display you can control from your phone ",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The high-tech Christmas light display you control with a QR code and your phone There are Christmas light displays, and then there is Nick Triantafillou's house. The IT technician from Wollongong has custom-built a display in the style of Vivid — Sydney's festival of light — rather than Clark Griswald's garish effort in National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. Featuring about 65,000 LED lights and a soundtrack, Mr Triantafillou's display comes with the added bonus that you can control what you see and hear. ""We have a QR code or NFC sticker on the mailbox, so when you scan the code you're presented with my website and you can pick what song you want to see displayed on the house,"" he said. ""There are currently 25 different songs and I'm always adding to them. ""There is a Michael Jackson medley, a Queen medley, more recent artists like Sia, The Kid Laroi and Justin Beiber, so there's lots to pick from."" People can also select Christmas favourites like Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, Let It Snow, and It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas. Each song is played out of two speakers on his property or on a local FM radio frequency. The songs have a coordinated light display which he has either purchased, sourced, or created himself. ""The night we launched the display traffic came to a standstill,"" he said. ""We had cars in a line waiting to get a look and people who had parked around the corner who had got out to have a closer look. ""It gets pretty busy. We clog up the street."" He said his neighbours are supportive of the display and he has programmed the volume to drop as the night progresses. ""I'm constantly going out and making sure the music isn't too loud because I don't want to bother them, but they've all been really happy with it,"" he said. The IT technician has spent half the year building the display, all the while ordering new parts and building the configuration to suit his house. ""It's just fun and it's the perfect intersection of my love for technology and building stuff,"" he said. ""It started with wanting my mega tree, which is 5,000 pixels, and then seeing what goes along with that. So we added small Christmas trees, snowflakes, and everything else."" The mega tree is four metres high and contains 32 strands of plastic, housing 150 bulbs each. He said it took him about an hour to do each strand, meaning the tree alone took 32 hours to build. ""It was hundreds of man hours throughout the year, but we were in lockdown so I didn't have much else to do,"" he said. He said the effort is worth it to see the joy it brings people of all ages. ""It's awesome and it's great to see the result of what took so long to build,"" he said. ""I remember after I finished building it I just sat across the road for about 15 minutes watching all the music, lights, and sequences myself. ""I was just taking it in because it was a lot of work. But it turned out exactly how I wanted so I'm pretty happy with it."" ABC Illawarra will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

389,'As bad as it gets': Tourism operators blast NT travel rules,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tourism groups and remote residents have expressed their devastation at new elements of the Northern Territory's reopening plan they say will cripple the travel industry and ruin holiday plans. From December 20, arrivals to the Northern Territory — including returning residents — cannot travel outside of Alice Springs, Katherine or Greater Darwin for two weeks, even if they are fully vaccinated. ""We hope we can reduce this down from 14 days early in the new year but that's what we are starting with,"" Chief Minister Michael Gunner said on Thursday. According to the Northern Territory government's border entry information, essential workers including police, teachers and health workers may be exempt, but applications will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Returning residents who are unvaccinated will still be required to pay for 14 days' supervised quarantine, and unvaccinated visitors are not allowed into the NT. Tourism Central Australia chief executive Danial Rochford said the changes left him feeling ""devastated"", ""angry"" and ""heartbroken"" for tourism operators. ""It is as bad as it gets and our industry has been on the rollercoaster from day one,"" Mr Rochford said. ""Essentially tourism here in Central Australia and the Barkly has just been wiped off the map in one fell swoop."" He said extra flights to Uluru that had recently been announced were now in ""enormous jeopardy."" ""The visitation to the rock will essentially dry up under this policy unless there's a sensible middle ground that's formed. Glenn Watt, who owns a fishing safari business in Darwin, said the rules would add to the pain already felt by many tourism operators. ""Virtually no one will be able to come up here and do their run-off fishing trips out from Adelaide River to down Daly or anywhere,"" he said. ""So it's a real worry for us."" Mr Watt said that over the last 12 months, compared to the average of previous years, business was down 64 per cent. ""I don't think we can handle another year of that."" The Country Liberal Party member for the Barkly, Steve Edgington, said his phone had been ""ringing hot"" with calls from business operators, station owners and locals who were concerned about the new travel restriction. ""We're seeing all of the people in the Barkly being punished,"" Mr Edgington said. Thirty-two per cent of eligible residents across the Barkly region are fully vaccinated, according to NT Health statistics, which do not include data from Aboriginal Community Controlled Health organisations. ""There is no actual record of what the vaccination rate is in Tennant Creek,"" Mr Edgington said. ""There's just not enough thought being put into this ... people in the Barkly want to go away over Christmas [but] if they just go over the border to Queensland, they've got to come back and stay in Katherine or Alice Springs for two weeks. ""And not only do they have to stay there, they have to do it at their own cost,"" he said.

390,Australia's best freediver has his eye on the global stage,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Christmas Island freediver David Mulheron is pushing to be the world's deepest person For most kids growing up in Australia, holding your breath and swimming from one side of the backyard pool to the other is a rite of passage. For Australian competitive freediver David Mulheron it is hard to draw a parallel. Picture a 25-metre swimming pool and imagine swimming eight laps of it on a single breath. Mr Mulheron has done it. Most people have taken in a huge gasp of oxygen and tried to outlast a sibling whilst driving through a tunnel. In that respect Mr Mulheron can outperform most, holding his breath for longer than nine minutes. To the average person it sounds unbelievable, superhuman. But these achievements paint a picture of what the 33-year-old Christmas Islander has accomplished in the last decade. Growing up at One Arm Point Aboriginal Community in Western Australia, spearfishing in shark and crocodile-infested waters was not an uncommon way to earn dinner. But at eight years of age a close encounter with an apex predator kept Mr Mulheron out of the water for years. ""I got separated from my dad, he was maybe 50 metres away from me, and as I turned around there was a three-metre tiger shark behind me,"" he said. ""If I'd reached out I would have been able to touch it. But it just kind of slowly cruised past me. ""Enough to scare the life out of me though."" It would take more than 15 years before Mr Mulheron would pick up a speargun again and plunge to the depths of the Indian Ocean. ""I was living in Carnarvon at the time and ended up going out with a few mates,"" Mr Mulheron said. ""I ended up shooting a fish and getting back to the boat and I didn't get attacked by a shark or see one. So after that I was like 'oh, maybe it's not that bad down there'."" Immersing himself in the raw beauty of the deep blue it once again became his life. He was hooked. Today, Mr Mulheron holds three national records out of the eight freediving disciplines and has also placed in the top 10 world rankings. Competitive freediving is a niche sport that has long defied science. It is comprised of different disciplines that reflect the various ways you can hold your breath underwater — whether that be the deepest, furthest, or longest. Pushing the limits too far in most sports and you lose. Push your limits too far in freediving and you die. But for Mr Mulheron the serenity at depth opened another world to him. ""I've never considered myself as someone who pushes the limits. And I wouldn't consider myself to be a super talented athlete,"" Mr Mulheron said. ""Like with most things it's just hard work and hours and hours of training."" The sport has emerged globally with competitions held annually in unique destinations in the Middle East, Europe, and the Caribbean to name a few. However, in June this year, restricted by closed borders, Mr Mulheron had to improvise and took to the local swimming pool. He swam 218 metres without taking a breath, equalling the national record in the dynamic discipline, also breaking the record for dynamic bi-fins. Mr Mulheron said the record-breaking feat came down to a ""good work ethic"". ""It's just about being dedicated wholly and solely to what you're doing and what you want to achieve, and if you do, give it 100 per cent,"" Mr Mulheron said. The current world record for men's dynamic with fins is 300 metres, and the longest static breath hold is 11 minutes, 35 seconds. Reaching the pinnacle of competitive freediving has its financial hurdles with most divers having to pay from already depleted pockets to fund their way around the world. Most of Mr Mulheron's training was holiday-based in the Gili Islands, Indonesia. He said he was forced to return to the red dust of the Pilbara as a fly-in, fly-out electrician whilst keeping his goals in sight. ""Having limited access to the ocean or even a pool I began a daily routine of waking up at 4:00am, performing a yoga and pranayama breathing routine, work for 12 hours, and then I would do dry training which involved walking and static breath-holding sessions,"" Mr Mulheron said. Today he spends nearly every day in the water, but as with every professional athlete it came with sacrifice. He had to quit his full-time job and book a one-way ticket overseas to pursue his dream. ""I look back and still don't know what I was thinking,"" Mr Mulheron said. He spent four months training in Israel and Egypt, learning from the best freediving athletes and instructors in the world. He said it was the best decision he ever made. ""I guess deep down I had a strong belief in myself and just knew that if I did give it 100 per cent I'd get the results, and yeah, that's all paid off and I am where I am now,"" he said. Roughly 1,500 kilometres west of the Australian mainland protrudes the sheer cliffs of Christmas Island that surround Flying Fish Cove — a diver's paradise and Mr Mulheron's home. He operates his own freediving school on the island whilst training in the world-class conditions. ""Christmas Island offers perfect conditions — year-round great water temperature, clear visibility, and protection from swell and currents,"" Mr Mulheron said. ""My training location is an 80-metre swim from the jetty which drops to a depth of 40 metres, further out it is unlimited, dropping to 500 metres only 200 metres from the shore."" Realistically, he said he might have to wait until 2023 before he can compete on the global stage again. ""It's just a bit of a waiting game, but in the meantime the plan is to hopefully have a crack at a couple more national records and push a bit deeper,"" he said.

391,Everything you need to know about the NT's Christmas present: quarantine-free travel,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The Northern Territory's border reopening plans have changed once again. This time, health authorities say they've settled on one clear set of rules for all arrivals in the NT. Some testing plans have been scrapped, others have been strengthened, and most unvaccinated people remain banned from coming to the NT at all. The NT first unveiled its plan to end quarantine in October and fast-tracked those plans in November. Here are the rules that will be in place from December 20. For more than a year, the NT has classified other parts of the country as higher or lower risk based on their confirmed COVID-19 cases. Until December 20, vaccinated travellers from ""green zones"" with minimal COVID-19 risk can enter the NT without any testing or quarantine requirements, while double-dosed arrivals from ""red zones"" must home quarantine for seven days and be tested. But under the new rules, there will be no distinction between different states or territories, with all arrivals required to follow the same testing regime regardless of the COVID situation in the place they've travelled from. Chief Minister Michael Gunner says there will no longer be a distinction because declaring hotspots will become unnecessary, with coronavirus expected to spread throughout Australia as the states eased border restrictions. ""The whole country is now entering a phase of dealing with this pandemic where the virus will gradually become endemic,"" he said. ""We generally declare red zones wherever COVID has spread. ""At some point in the near future that's going to be pretty much everywhere, making the need to declare red zones increasingly pointless."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic No matter where you're coming from, if you're a vaccinated traveller you'll need to get three polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. PCR tests are more reliable than rapid antigen tests. The first will need to be done in the 72 hours before travelling to the Territory, with proof of a negative test result before you arrive at the borders. If you arrive without a negative test result, authorities will book you in for a test and you'll have to isolate until you get a negative result. At the border, you'll also need to show proof of your vaccination status or proof you're ineligible to be vaccinated because of your age or a Commonwealth-recognised medical exemption. Once you're in the Territory, you'll need to be tested again on days three and six. The tests will be free through the government's current coronavirus testing facilities and you won't need to isolate while waiting for results. Health authorities will also be handing out free rapid antigen tests for people to use at home if they develop symptoms at any point, but they've scrapped a previous plan to do a rapid antigen test on all arrivals at the border. All arrivals will be required to download the G2G Now app and stay within ""high-vaccination zones"" for their first 14 days in the Territory. For now, those areas are Greater Darwin, Katherine and Alice Springs. The app will periodically require users to complete a location check-in to ensure new arrivals aren't in areas with lower vaccination rates, such as some remote communities in Central Australia. People will be allowed to travel from one high vaccination zone to another, and authorities are hoping the travel restrictions will ease in the new year as vaccine coverage expands to include kids aged between five and 11. The rules haven't changed for unvaccinated people, with nearly all people who have not received the shots banned from coming to the Territory. The government says unvaccinated people who try to come to the Territory will be turned around and could face a fine of more than $5,000. The exception is for returning NT residents and a limited number of people eligible for exemptions, such as people moving to the NT, some essential workers and some people who will be granted compassionate exemptions. But unvaccinated travellers given approval to come to the NT will still be required to undergo 14 days' supervised quarantine at their own cost. Mr Gunner says the international repatriation program has shown that requiring a negative PCR test before travel is effective at the number of positive cases coming in. ""In New South Wales, their rate was one in 700,"" Mr Gunner said. ""So if you go with the more conservative option, one in 700 people who come to the Northern Territory will test positive for COVID after that negative PCR test on arrival — so you're dealing with a one in 700 risk base."" He says if there is evidence of widespread community transmission in the NT, there may still be lockouts or other health responses. But he has again rejected calls from the Aboriginal health sector to delay the reopening until the vaccination rate in remote areas improves. The government is set on the Territory's reopening and ""learning to live with COVID"", according to the Chief Minister. ""It's taken nearly two years, but we are nearly there, to bring more people to the Territory again, to unite families again, to make the Territory stronger while keeping the Territory safe."" But if there's one thing health authorities have learned over the past two years, it's that you never know what's around the corner.

392,Tiny homes on trailers: short-term accommodation booming on Eyre Peninsula,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  It was the skyrocketing demand for short-term accommodation that first prompted Amanda and Tim Hogg to list their family home on Airbnb and move into a caravan. Now, the boom in regional tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic has helped them take their business even further. ""We have built tiny homes that are on trailers so they are not a permanent fixture in the ground, and they can be moved,"" Amanda Hogg said. ""We can place them on private properties, and take them off if we need to, but we can also have ocean views at a small cost."" The pair has been working with local landholders to secure locations for their off-grid homes. Their first tiny, sustainable house is called Yambara, meaning ""out of sight"" in the local Barngarla language, and overlooks Sleaford Bay and the Port Lincoln National Park. ""There's not a lot in that higher-end accommodation field, and we really wanted to target that market,"" Ms Hogg said. The owner of accommodation booking service Visit Port Lincoln, Di Dennis, believes the high tourist demand will continue. ""I've been doing this for 20 odd years, and I've never had a year like this,"" Ms Dennis said. The pandemic has brought a rise in the number of people listing their properties for short-term rental during busy periods. ""I've had in the last week… five new people that have purchased properties just for the holiday rental,"" Ms Dennis said. The principal of Raine and Horne Real Estate in Port Lincoln, Steve Prout, agreed there had been a big increase in people wanting to take advantage of the booming short-term rental market. ""It's quite a common conversation we're having, particularly in the regional sea-front types of areas,"" Mr Prout said. He said many of his clients had turned their full-time rental properties into overnight accommodation stays. ""We've certainly seen probably around 10 per cent of our rent-roll back into short-term accommodation, whilst this perfect storm is existing anyway.""

394,Lucy and Daniel were planning a Tasmanian holiday — then they tried to hire a car,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  As Tasmania prepares to reopen to the rest of the country next week, interstate travellers who have been locked out for months are planning long-awaited holidays across Bass Strait. Sydney couple Daniel Gocher and Lucy Manne began planning their camping trip as soon as they could. ""We were flying into Launceston and had planned to travel around for a couple of weeks,"" Daniel Gocher said. ""We were heading to the Tarkine and then across to the Bay of Fires, so we were looking to hire a car with a bit of space."" That's when they hit an unexpected hurdle. ""We went on a car hire aggregator site and they were going to charge us somewhere between $2,500 and $3,500 for two weeks, which is certainly beyond what we'd budgeted for."" They aren't alone. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Julie Poumes runs a travel agency in Melbourne's eastern suburbs. She says Tasmania is top of the travel list for many of her clients, but car hire is a sticking point. ""It's disgusting. People who have hired cars before say to me, 'How can we be paying $400 or $500 a day?'"" ""People just go, 'No I'm not paying that', and that's when they look at later dates, or they look at another destination."" So you're a Tasmanian itching to travel this Christmas but what are the rules for each state, and do I need a COVID test to go there and get back in? Expensive car hire in Tasmania isn't new, but the pandemic has made the situation far worse. ""When COVID first hit, a lot of those big national companies got rid of half of their fleet literally to survive and they haven't put them back on in the same numbers,"" Vince Powell from Tassie Car Rentals said. ""In a normal scenario those big companies might've put on 1,000 extra cars over Christmas, but that isn't happening. ""So you've got a lot less cars, a lot more people: supply and demand."" Mr Powell's company offers second-hand rentals which are cheaper than the big brands. But his fleet has been entirely snapped up for the summer. ""We've been booked out for a long time for Christmas, all of January, half of February,"" he said. There is always the option of bringing your own car across from Melbourne on the Spirit of Tasmania ferry but tickets are scarce. Thousands of people made bookings immediately after it was announced that borders would reopen on December 15, so finding a space in December and January won't be easy. It's a message Tasmania's Premier Peter Gutwein has been driving home: COVID will enter Tasmania when borders open next month. So when and where is the state likely to have an outbreak? It's creating a headache for Tasmania's $3 billion tourism industry, which supports around 15 per cent of the state's jobs. Tourism operators are desperate for a post-opening jump in visitation and are worried the high cost of car rentals will see people go elsewhere. ""A lot of us have battled really hard and worked our way through it, but we are at the very edge,"" Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary director Greg Irons said. ""Just prior to COVID we were tracking for around about 115,000 people through the gates. We're now at about 30 per cent of that."" Hiring a car for your holiday? Here's how to avoid hidden fees and overpriced insurance. Bonorong is half an hour's drive north of Hobart and without public transport options, is heavily reliant on self-drive traffic. ""Making it easier for people to visit destinations really should be up there in our very top priorities if we want to keep our businesses,"" Mr Irons said. Tasmania's Tourism Minister Sarah Courtney said the government was keeping an eye on the situation. ""We are monitoring some of those price points, and the government is engaged with some of those businesses to make sure hire cars aren't an impediment to someone wanting to visit our state,"" she said. Hire car companies are still nervous about the possibility of further border closures and aren't rushing to replenish their fleets. ""As Australia reopens, we expect more significant fluctuations in market demand and customer rental patterns and are keeping our fleet at optimum levels to help meet this demand,"" a spokesperson for Budget Rent a Car said. The Department of State Growth has tried to increase supply by offering $1,000 grants to offset the costs of Tasmanians hiring out their personal cars to tourists via car-sharing platforms like Evee and Car Next Door. From April to November, more than 260 applications were approved under the scheme, resulting in 678 newly registered hire and drive vehicles coming online. ""As the supply and availability of vehicles increases it is expected that this will put downward pressure on the cost of hiring a vehicle, as will general market forces,"" a spokesperson for the department said. But with the scheme due to end on Christmas Eve, car hire — and the prospect of a Tasmanian holiday — will remain unaffordable for many interstate tourists.

395,'Never worked so hard to lose so much': Wineries struggle to recover after COVID lockdowns,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," ABC Rural Victorian wineries despair, forced to turn customers away due to staff shortages A chef hand-delivering food to your table or a senior winemaker talking you through a cellar-door tasting might feel special, even intimate. But in one of Australia's most famous wine regions, it betrays a major problem: there are simply not enough staff to do either job. Staff shortages are so pervasive in parts of the Yarra Valley, north-east of Melbourne, that wineries are turning away busloads of eager customers and, in some cases, closing cellar doors altogether. ""Difficult doesn't even sum it up,"" Dylan McMahon, head winemaker and general manager of Seville Estate, said. ""For us trying to reopen the cellar door and restaurant — we're still struggling."" The result is a cellar door closed to walk-ins and a restaurant that has had to cut its sittings by 80 per cent. A bride and groom were able to hold their wedding at the vineyard over the weekend, but they had to supply their own staff. The irony is the 20 or so people who are seated in the winery's dining room over limited sittings are receiving a level of service Dylan McMahon is particularly proud of — he just wishes he could cater for more. ""It is a week-by-week proposition for opening our doors. Even this Friday, we are scrounging around. We've got a full restaurant and we don't have all our staff secured,"" he said. ""The reality is we are not recovering from the last two years. We are just continuing to tread water."" Half an hour north at Sutherland Estate, Cathy Phelan has all her children on deck helping out where they can at her family's picturesque cellar door. It's still not enough. ""I have one booking on Saturday. They're a group of 40 on a bus with a belated birthday [and] they were desperate to come but I just can't,"" Ms Phelan said. ""Even though we have the space, we just don't have the staff to look after them."" Wineries in the region had hoped a summer of restaurant bookings and cellar door tourism would provide a much-needed bounce-back after a financially bruising two years. Instead, they're having to scale down their operations and ambitions. ""We, as a business, are growing and everything is busy, and we are wanting to get a few more staff in to help with that, but we're having trouble finding anyone to step in,"" Ms Phelan said. Sutherland Estate, like other wineries the ABC has spoken to, had to let staff who refused to have a COVID-19 vaccine go. Yet the issues in the region run far deeper. The pandemic has prompted a much-publicised exodus from the hospitality industry, and job ads in the area frequently go unanswered. Burnt-out workers have departed in search of higher-paying careers with better conditions. A recent report from the National Skills Commission found 63 per cent of hospitality businesses experienced greater difficulty recruiting staff this year compared with 2020. Many wineries insist they are willing to pay above award wages, but the viability of a career in hospitality appears increasingly unappealing. With continued constraints on international travel, the gaps have not been filled by short-term visa holders. Dylan McMahon is still looking for about three workers. ""We don't even get applicants anymore,"" he said. ""If we get an applicant, the first thing you think of is, 'Right, you're hired! I haven't even read your CV, but you've applied, that's good enough for me'."" It is an issue the Yarra Valley has grappled with for years. Situated just over an hour from from Melbourne, it is neither classified as regional, nor close or particularly accessible to attract inner-city workers. Small Wineries Association of the Yarra Valley president Daniel Tokar said the issue had been ""brewing for a while"". ""Every time you knock someone back, that's a lost customer — the knock-on effect is they might not come back,"" Mr Tokar said. ""Everyone would love to have the doors swinging open but the reality is they just can't. It is heartbreaking."" Further south in the lush Mornington Peninsula wine region, job ad sites are flush with winery listings. Award-winning winemaker and local industry heavyweight Kathleen Quealy said finding staff was ""costing a lot more and taking a lot longer,"" but the issue was worse for wineries with restaurants. Olivia Barrie from the Mornington Peninsula Vignerons' Association said the area might not have as many staff as it would like, but it should cope with increased demand over summer. ""The cellar doors are at a reasonable level, but people need to be understanding and mindful of venue capacities,"" Ms Barrie said. Instead, it is in non-customer-facing roles where Ms Barrie said the need was most keenly felt. ""In the vineyards and wineries, they are really crying out for more staff — for capable people, vineyard managers, tractor drivers and those who can help with manual labour,"" she said. ""There's a fair bit of pressure in that space."" In the Yarra Valley, Mr McMahon is wary of overburdening the few staff he has been able to retain. ""You don't really want to push anyone too hard,"" he said. ""A lot of people are kind of carrying emotional trauma. ""Even though we're out of lockdown, and people are wanting to go out and eat and have fun, they don't really realise that the people who are working are still getting used to getting back in the workforce. ""Not everyone's 100 per cent. ""It's that thing that lots of people said over COVID: I've never worked so hard to lose so much money.""

396,'We have to filter out the crispy bits': How leftover chip oil will keep EV owners moving across the Nullarbor,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Science Leftover roadhouse deep fryer oil will power the Nullarbor's first EV fast charger at Caiguna Electric vehicle owners will be able to have their hot chips and eat them too, with a remote West Australian roadhouse planning to install fast chargers that run on leftover fryer oil. From January, a crowdfunded 50kW DC charger at Caiguna Roadhouse in the middle of the Nullarbor will plug the 720-kilometre-wide gap between charging networks being built by the WA and SA governments. It will mean that when the respective ""electric highways"" are completed, an EV owner will be able to drive from Sydney to Perth without straying from the network of fast-charging stations, or having to stop for more than 90 minutes to recharge. But what makes the Caiguna charger unique is the generator fuel. Off-grid and unable to afford the up-front cost of solar and batteries, the roadhouse will generate low-emissions electricity through burning something it has been throwing out for years: leftover chip oil. ""We've started collecting the fat from the deep fryers,"" Don Waugh, the roadhouse's owner, said. ""It's a fantastic idea — it's just whether we can get that much oil."" Mr Waugh, who lives in the small wheatbelt town of Dowerin outside of Perth, owns three Nullarbor roadhouses on the Eyre Highway. For months, West Australian EV owners have lobbied Mr Waugh to host chargers at one of his roadhouses. But the fuel merchant took some convincing, said Jon Edwards, a retired engineer who has been leading the push to ""plug the gap"" in the eastern and western charging networks. ""He said we don't have any EVs out here — we make money out of diesel,"" he said. Then, one day in November, 66 EV owners drove out to Dowerin, where they hosted a barbecue, gave free rides to the public, and took the skeptical roadhouse owner for his first ever spin in an EV. ""He scratched his head, went for a drive and looked at the charger, and that's when I said to him, 'How much of this oil have you got?'"" Mr Edwards said. ""He said, '160 to 200 litres. We throw it in the tip.' ""I said, 'You better start saving it up because we can charge cars with that.'"" Mr Waugh's account of the day was slightly different. ""They weren't crackpots, but they were bloody enthusiasts,"" he said of the hoard of EV owners that descended on Dowerin. ""They're so convinced about the future. They can tell you in so many years' time you're going to be driving one of these things."" Electric vehicles are coming, and they don't need liquid fuel. That spells trouble for service stations. But he was swayed by the experience. ""With all the gizmos on them, they absolutely fly,"" he said. ""I know electric cars are coming. I know they'll want to traverse all of Australia. ""Providing we can replace the revenue lost through fuel sales with EV charging or something, then we're still going to be viable."" In early January, Mr Edwards and several volunteers will haul at least one biofuel EV fast charger more than 1,000km from Perth to Caiguna, with the aim of having it functional by January 16. ""I've already sent a 1,000-litre tank for them to load up with cooking oil,"" Mr Edwards said. ""We have to filter out the crispy bits and settle out the rest for two weeks."" For the first few years, at least, there should be more than enough biofuel to power the generator. ""There's about eight to 10 EVs a year going across the Nullarbor, or a bit less than one a month,"" Mr Edwards said. ""We're expecting that to increase once fast charging is out there."" Owners of electric vehicles may soon be able to get paid for simply plugging their car into the wall. But there are a few things to consider first. EV owners crossing the Nullarbor currently use AC chargers running off roadhouse diesel generators. These chargers have a maximum power rating of between 7 and 11kW, depending on the car, and take 6-10 hours to fully charge a vehicle's empty battery. The 50kW DC fast charger will cut the recharge time down to about an hour and a half, depending on the size of the car battery. ""With this charger, you'll be able to grab a burger and a coffee and have a read of a paper, and by that time, you're ready to go,"" Mr Edwards said. Mr Waugh said the fast charger would be initially free to use. ""It's not a revenue-raising thing,"" he said. Fast-charging on the Nullarbor is not a new idea. In 2020, the government asked a team of EV experts at the University of Western Australia to prepare a list of potential fast-charging sites to make up a statewide ""electric highway"". The experts proposed eight 50kW stations along the Nullarbor, including two at Caiguna, for a total cost of about $420,000. ""It was more of a symbolic link that you would be able to drive to South Australia if you wanted to,"" said Thomas Braunl, a professor of engineering at UWA and one of the report's authors. In August 2021, the state government unveiled a $21 million plan to build Australia's longest EV charging network. But the Nullarbor was left off the list. ""The [state] government pretty much adopted what was suggested [in the UWA report], but a few of the routes have been deleted for cost reasons, I assume,"" Professor Braunl said. Governments around the world are offering juicy purchase incentives to speed car ownership to EVs. Here's what they're offering and how it compares with Australia. One of the omitted routes left a 720km-long, Nullarbor-sized stretch between the eastern edge of WA's fast-charging network (at the town of Norseman) and the western edge of South Australia's own ""electric highway"" (with a charging station to be built near the WA border). Both states' new charging networks are scheduled to be fully operational by 2024. Electric cars have proven less popular in WA than elsewhere in Australia, with EVs making up about 0.8 per cent of new car sales, compared to the nationwide average of about 1.6 per cent. The motoring lobby has blamed the lag on WA's vast distances and lack of charging infrastructure. With money now being spent on charging stations, and the price of EVs dropping every year, this is expected to change. Under current policy settings, EVs will make up about 30 per cent of nationwide new car sales by 2030, which means about one in 10 vehicles on the road will need access to public charging infrastructure. This includes when crossing the Nullarbor, Mr Edwards says. ""Heaps of people over east have contacted me about it,"" he said. ""I see it as an interim step now to get things moving. When there's enough traffic to justify solar and battery, the biofuel generators become a backup."" The cost of installing enough solar and batteries to meet the current energy needs of Caiguna has been quoted at about $500,000, Mr Waugh said. ""If it gets to around $250,000 we'll look at going to solar, but how far in the future that’ll be that depends on battery technology."" For the moment, the roadhouse gets its electricity from diesel. According to Mr Edwards, the leftover chip oil ""biofuel"" used in the fast-charging generator is carbon neutral, as it's derived from canola flowers that take CO2 out of the atmosphere. Although some experts have called into question the clean energy claims of biofuels, running a generator on used chip fat pollutes far less than one that burns diesel. ""And the fuel is free,"" Mr Edwards added. ""This is a solution for those roadhouses that are in the 'too-hard basket' with very low volumes of traffic and no business case to support solar and batteries."" Mr Waugh said he could see that his roadhouse business was going to be ""forced to make changes"" with the switch to EVs. ""If the chargers were somewhere down the road, they'd stop at down the road and not at our place,"" he said. ""And surely they'll buy something from us.""

397,Honeymooners among flood of COVID-related cancellations at SA tourism town,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Robe tourism operators are blaming misinformation about the town's COVID-19 exposure sites for a ""heartbreaking"" number of cancellations. Five exposure locations were listed for the small coastal town in south-eastern South Australia last week, including two close contact sites. However, there have not been any COVID cases linked to the exposure sites. Despite the absence of cases, Robe accommodation providers said they had been ""haemorrhaging"" with cancellations in recent days. Secretary of the Robe Tourism Association Lisa Hall, who owns Sea Vu Caravan Park, said the cancellations equated to ""thousands and thousands of dollars"" in losses. She said misinformation was contributing to the heartbreak. ""We had several people call through yesterday that were at the border being told that Robe is a hotspot … and getting turned away,"" she said. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic ""Robe is not a hotspot. We don't know where this information is coming from."" Ms Hall said summer visitors were their ""bread and butter"". ""If we don't get a January and February trade — and December trade — we won't survive for the year,"" she said. ""So we hope that message is not getting relayed to anyone trying to cross the border."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC South East SA's weekly email newsletter. Ms Hall's comments were echoed by Robe B'n'B host Jamie Aitken. He estimated there had been about $100,000-worth of cancellations over the weekend. ""At the weekends at the moment, this town is absolutely humming, but this weekend, it was dead,"" Mr Aitken said. He also blamed misinformation on social media and incorrect statements by authorities for the cancellations. ""A series of remarks that have been made on the media and social media are causing us a great deal of problems,"" he said. ""People were told, 'Don't go the Robe, it's a hotspot'. ""This is shaping up to be a really disastrous problem for us all. ""[It] will continue with further cancellations unless this incorrect information is jumped on as quickly as possible."" Melbourne resident Erica Engeler was planning to visit Robe for her honeymoon, but her family turned around at the border after a nurse at the Mount Gambier testing station told her there was a COVID-19 ""outbreak in Robe"". She said ""it was a bit of a shock"". Ms Engeler said after the conversation with the health staff, she tried to confirm the information online. ""Looking for government websites to verify how many sites were exposure sites, where were they, what was the proximity to where we were staying, and weighing up the risk based on that,"" she said. ""Because we came back with lots of different variations on the story, that was the concern for us. ""Nothing was clear. Some sites said there were two exposure sites, some said six, some said eight."" Ms Engeler said it was ""a really hard decision to make"". ""Lots of things come into it,"" she said. ""For us, for the children. But you also think about the person who you're just about to cancel 10 days of accommodation on. ""It's not a big chain hotel. It's a guy running a house. ""That's his livelihood. That felt awful too."" SA Health declined to comment. Meanwhile, a South Australian Police spokesperson said there was ""no evidence of police officers making comments about avoiding Robe or the area being a 'hot spot'.""

398,Is the holiday over? Airbnb slams 'incredibly damaging' rental policy plans ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Airbnb slams proposed new rules for WA holiday houses as strictest in the nation People who let out holiday homes in Western Australia might have to list their properties on a statewide register, and apply for permission to rent them out for more than 60 nights a year, under a draft government planning policy. Short-stay accommodation booking sites Airbnb and Stayz have criticised the WA government's move to regulate the sector, describing the draft proposals as among the strictest in the nation. They also warn that putting a cap on the number of nights homes can be let for will have flow-on effects for holiday towns that rely on the business tourists bring in. The WA government has stressed the draft rules are just that — and are more lenient than those that already exist in some WA local government areas. The Australian Hotels Association has welcomed the move to crack down on what it said was an often unregulated sector. The draft policy comes more than two years after a parliamentary inquiry into the regulation of providers such as Airbnb and Stayz. The inquiry was prompted in part by the concerns of traditional accommodation businesses, and the frustration of local councils about anti-social behaviour at some holiday homes. Airbnb's head of public policy for Australia and New Zealand, Derek Nolan, said the draft rules were among the most restrictive in Australia. He said the proposed 60-night cap on short-term letting at ""unhosted"" properties would be ""incredibly damaging"". ""Not only to the livelihoods of thousands of everyday Western Australians, but also to the countless businesses and jobs that rely on the guests they bring,"" he said. Stayz Australia's corporate affairs director, Eacham Curry, said he was still looking for more detail in the draft policy. ""There's some good and some bad,"" he said. ""We've advocated for some time right across the nation for things like a register. ""Almost disastrously, they're proposing not more than 60 nights that people can let their property in a year … and that's going to run the risk of shutting down the industry."" Local governments in WA have varying approaches to regulating holiday houses, with registration schemes already existing in some areas, including Busselton and Margaret River. Broome is moving towards a registration scheme. Home owners looking to rent their properties on platforms like Airbnb will be required to apply for council permission under a new plan endorsed by local councillors. Parliamentary Secretary for Planning Jessica Stojkovski said the suggested night limit was more lenient than some existing local rules, but more restrictive in other localities. ""We understand that 60 [nights] is dramatically lower than what's available right now, which is why we're putting it out for people to make the comments about how much they think is an appropriate time,"" she said. ""We don't want to restrict people's opportunity to make income from their own properties, but we also need to be really aware that these properties can impact on the neighbours."" Ms Stojkovski indicated the draft policy did not mean a property could not be rented out for more than 60 nights a year — just that the owners would need planning permission to do so. ""If you have a property that you're just renting out when you're not using it, and it's underneath the designated cap, then you won't require things like a development application from the local council,"" she said. Australian Hotels Association chief executive Bradley Woods said the draft policy was a good first step. ""The traditional provider of a spare room, or a blow-up mattress in the lounge room, will still be able to do that without fear of any regulation,"" he said. ""But those that operate commercial unlicensed accommodation … will have to register."" Robert McDonald, who owns Bushy Lakes Chalets in Margaret River, was part of the push to see Airbnb and similar providers subject to the same rules as traditional guesthouses and chalets. Mr McDonald said he supported a statewide registration scheme. But he said a 60-night cap would effectively make holiday house owners exempt from needing approval unless they went over the cap limit — although they would still need to register. ""I don't know how shires would police that — they're constrained with staffing issues as it is,"" he said.

399,NSW south coast businesses grapple with 'diabolical' staff shortages ahead of predicted bumper summer,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Job vacancies are on the rise across the NSW south coast, prompting many businesses to feel ""bittersweet"" about the busy months ahead. The state's South Coast relies heavily on tourism trade, particularly from Sydneysiders, Canberrans and Victorians during their peak summer holidays. However, executive director of Business NSW Adam Zarth said current staffing shortages were a major concern for businesses ahead of Christmas. ""It's a diabolical problem for business owners down there,"" he said. ""And it's not expected to improve either until backpackers return to our shores and foreign migration can restart again."" Mr Zarth said job vacancies across the South Coast had drastically increased in the past month alone. ""We've seen an increase over the past month of 17.1 per cent in job vacancies,"" he said. ""And over the year we've seen almost a 30 per cent increase in job advertisements across the region. So, this shows just how tight it's getting out there."" For Pambula pub licensee manager Grant Kennedy, the expected surge in tourists alongside a shortage of skilled workers has forced them to change their business model and cancel live music. ""We had to cancel about eight solo artists that we already had booked between now and February and a New Year's Eve band, which I feel very sorry for,"" he said. ""We just can't commit [because] we wouldn't have the staff to be able to service it."" Mr Kennedy said after a challenging two years of border closures and bushfires an influx in visitors was well needed, but the reality of staff shortages was disheartening. ""It's sort of bittersweet,"" he said. ""We're all hearing how busy it's going to be; however, everyone is finding it very difficult to get their staffing levels back up to what they were pre-COVID."" Jade Griffiths owns a cinema in Narooma and has also struggled to attract staff, but said it was the uncertainty around the summer ahead that was most concerning. ""It is hard to plan because the last two years have been quite unstable so it's hard to know what to predict,"" she said. ""Our biggest fear is that something may happen to the borders and travel restrictions."" Ms Griffiths took over the business from her grandparents in 2019 and has endured the bushfires and COVID-19 lockdowns since then. She said the next six months would determine whether they could survive as a small local business. ""I wouldn't say it's quite a make or break yet but it's definitely getting close to that,"" she said. ""If it continues to be quiet in the next six months or so I would start getting quite concerned.""

400,Travelling with unvaccinated children? Here's what you should know,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Radhika has waited nearly two years for Australia's international borders to open so she can visit her family in India. The mother of two from Sydney has finally booked a trip for mid-December with her children aged five and 11 so they can see their extended family. But she conceded she was ""anxious"" about the holiday because her children are not eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine yet. ""It just means we're going to have to be a lot more cautious and careful when we are travelling,"" she said. Although Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has provisionally approved the Pfizer vaccine for children aged between five and 11, rollout is not expected to begin until January 10. ""While I would have liked him to get vaccinated before the travel, it's just a question of that unfortunate timing,"" she said. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Among the many issues Radhika has had to consider for travelling during a pandemic is travel insurance. She is worried her family might not be covered if someone contracts COVID-19 and they have to change their travel plans. So what do you need to consider if you're travelling overseas with unvaccinated kids, now that international borders are open in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT? While children can contract coronavirus, experts say most don't develop a severe form of the disease, even if they're unvaccinated, unlike adults or the elderly. Fellow at the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Melbourne Dr Daryl Cheng said it was up to parents to weigh up the risks and benefits of travelling overseas with unvaccinated children. ""It's very similar in terms of a discussion about kids going back to child care or school, where they may be exposed to their classmates, or they may be exposed to teachers or parents … with potential COVID-19 infection,"" Dr Cheng said. ""If you're travelling to a place where the COVID caseload is low, and there is an important reason for travel … then the risks may be outweighed by the benefits."" Dr Cheng said the best way for parents to prevent their unvaccinated children from contracting COVID-19 while overseas was by practising good hand hygiene, wearing a face mask and avoiding crowded areas. International travel is back on, but it's a lot more complicated than it used to be. Here's what you need to know before your flight. ""It may be prudent for children to travel with vaccinated parents, even though they themselves may be unvaccinated."" Dr Cheng recommended people educate themselves about local health systems before they travel so they know where to go if they need a test or their child does catch coronavirus and needs medical attention. ""If you're travelling to a country where you're not familiar with the testing regime … it may be prudent to bring along available rapid antigen testing that we now have over the counter in Australia,"" he said. ""Those kinds of tools may be actually quite helpful to help parents and families make a decision as to whether or not they may need to bring their child to a healthcare facility for formal testing."" After months being locked down in Sydney and navigating remote learning, Hilary and her seven-year-old daughter have planned an overseas trip to Fiji for July next year. ""I've had like four months of lockdown homeschool, working full-time from home. It was a really stressful time. And I just need something to look forward to and I need a break,"" she said. The seasoned traveller and marketing professional considered flying to the United States, where she is from, to see family and friends, but she was worried about high case numbers there and instead picked Fiji. ""It just seemed too risky to me to be flying internationally to Chicago or anywhere in the US really, because cases are so high, so I sort of looked around at somewhere that was a bit closer to home and that had higher vaccination rates and lower cases."" She also has a daughter who isn't yet eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. It's one of the reasons she is avoiding travelling to the US. Hilary strategically planned her overseas trip for the middle of next year, anticipating her daughter would become eligible for a vaccine before they leave. She's also avoiding staying at an Airbnb to avoid unnecessary contact with others. ""Because of COVID, I am more risk-averse. Like, I wouldn't actually stay in someone's home … now because I don't really know, are they vaccinated?"" she said. Hilary said they would mostly stick to their resort rather than moving around too much. Overseas travel during a pandemic is challenging, so travel experts are urging people to plan carefully, especially if taking unvaccinated children. ""It's never been more complex to travel anywhere in the world, let alone within Australia,"" Australian Federation of Travel Agents (AFTA) chief executive Dean Long told the ABC. ""Travel agents will be able to assist them on the major barriers which they're going to be facing."" Those barriers include possible testing, quarantine and vaccination requirements for entry into a country, including countries you may have to transit through. Australians travelling overseas for the first time since international borders reopened are paying hundreds of dollars for travel insurance — but the fine print reveals some very big COVID-related exclusions. Mr Long said while some travel insurance does cover your medical fees if you catch COVID-19 overseas, many don't necessarily cover the costs of the travel disruptions it may cause. ""That's definitely a blind spot for a lot of travel products at the moment."" He said families should look closely at the terms and conditions of insurance before signing up and pick the best level of cover, rather than the cheapest. ""It will be clearly outlined in the terms and conditions document from the insurance company about what's included and what's not,"" Mr Long said. ""Purchase maybe not the lowest priced one, but the one that actually provides the product and service and coverage that you need to protect your family."" Mr Long also recommended families set aside money in case they have to pay for COVID-19 tests overseas.

402,"Central Australian tourist accommodation, experiences close for summer season",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Several popular Central Australian tourism experiences and accommodation options will be closed for renovations over the summer period leaving tourists wondering what to spend their tourism vouchers on. A fourth round of tourism vouchers is intended to help boost a struggling tourism industry. Both Kings Canyon and Glen Helen resorts were recently purchased by the Discovery Parks and G'Day Group, and CEO Grant Wilckens said both properties were in need of significant upgrades that would see Glen Helen closing mid-January until mid-March. ""We've tried to stay open for as long as we can to make sure we're open for Christmas at least,"" he said. ""But for Kings Canyon, it's actually already happened. We closed Kings Canyon on November 22 and we're not really looking to open up until the beginning of February."" Mr Wilckens said that the closures were essential to get the properties up to standard for the next peak season. ""When we bought them we always knew we had to spend a fair bit of capital to get them up to speed and make sure they were consistent with the customer experience that we were looking for,"" he said. ""We are working through a pretty major refurbishment and development of both Kings Canyon and Glen Helen."" Mr Wilckens said the initial spend would be around $20 million at Kings Canyon and $10 million at Glen Helen resort. ""We will be adding to that, certainly, in terms of future developments over the years,"" he said. ""We certainly need more accommodation at Glen Helen and more fixed accommodation … but they won't be there for next season. But they will be there the following season."" Mr Wilckens said the Northern Territory tourism voucher scheme was not his priority but getting the resorts ready for the next season was. Tourism Central Australia's CEO Danial Rochford said the closures in the region were necessary for the ongoing viability of the tourism industry. ""I guess [this is] unfortunate for us locals,"" he said. ""But from a tourism perspective, now is no better time to do these types of works and to get ready for what will hopefully be a big bumper tourism season in 2022."" Mr Rochford said some accommodation at Yulara, near Uluru, had been closed but a number of hotels were still open. ""With respect to Voyages they've got some of their hotels still closed and hibernating,"" he said. Mr Rochford said the vouchers had been useful for operators who had struggled with cash flow as a result of the withdrawal of domestic visitors due to hotspot declarations and lockdowns. ""We've been calling, for many months now, for some form of targeted assistance and we were hopeful that their governments would answer that call urgently,"" he said. ""Many businesses across the region have had to make some very difficult decisions, just because of the costs of operating their businesses, to either hibernate or shut down or retract services significantly."" Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife announced earlier that Ellery Creek Big Hole, a popular outback waterhole, would also be closed for most of the school holidays as the 2km access road into the region was sealed. Tourism Minister Natasha Fyles has been approached for comment.

404,Unwrapping 2022: How life in Queensland is about to undergo a massive change,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The Premier's gift to Queenslanders this Christmas is opening the state's borders, bringing an influx of people as well as COVID-19. It means 2022 will look very different to the year that was. Prawns and pavlova will bring families together over Christmas lunch as will church services and school holidays with Queensland's border soon to open to travellers from interstate hotspots and overseas. The influx of people expected to arrive in the state over the coming months will include those permanently relocating, Queenslanders who became trapped interstate, people wanting to holiday as well as those who have desperately missed loved ones after months, and even years, of limited contact. Experts anticipate almost 55,000 additional people could decide to call Queensland home — that will have a knock-on effect on the already hot property market, as well as the state's infrastructure, healthcare system and economy. Here's what Christmas and 2022 might look like for Queenslanders. Queensland has been the place to move during the pandemic, pushing up house prices and demand. Australian Bureau of Statistics demographer Andrew Howe said in net terms about 30,000 people moved to the Sunshine State from interstate in the year to March. ""That's the highest inflow of people from other states to Queensland in almost 20 years,"" Mr Howe said. Almost half came from New South Wales and a quarter from Victoria, as lockdown-weary residents re-evaluated their future with new-found flexible work arrangements and healthy equities. Of the 30,000 people who arrived in Queensland, about half moved to Greater Brisbane and the remainder to the rest of the state including the Gold and Sunshine coasts. But the Ipswich suburb of Ripley was the state's fastest growing area. Its population increased by 20 per cent in just one year. While the majority were locals moving into new housing developments, people relocating from interstate accounted for 15 per cent of the overall rise. Pallara and Willawong in Brisbane's south had a population increase of 16 per cent, Pimpama on the northern Gold Coast went up 14 per cent and surf's up for the 2,200 people who moved to the coastal centre of Caloundra West. Overseas migration data also showed 33,000 Queenslanders moved overseas compared to the 17,000 who came back in the past year. ""It's the first time in over a hundred years that more people have left to live overseas than have come,"" he said. Despite this, Queensland's total population still grew significantly more than any other state or territory during the pandemic, increasing by more than 43,000. So what will happen to migration when international borders fully reopen? Mr Howe said if trends went back to pre-COVID times, overseas arrivals would increase from current historic lows to around 80,000 to 100,000 per year. But a booming property market means finding a home for those new arrivals could prove difficult. Experts say one thing that won't change in 2022 is Queensland's skyrocketing property market. Brisbane has now taken the crown off Sydney to be the fastest growing capital city for house prices, according to CoreLogic. In the year to November, Greater Brisbane's prices rose by 25 per cent — that's about six times higher than the year before. Last month, median house prices rose by $18,500 — the highest increase since 2003. CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless said regional Queensland saw a 24 per cent rise in house prices, and coastal areas were cranking as interstate buyers snapped up homes, often sight unseen. House prices on the Sunshine Coast rose by 32 per cent in the 12 months to November, up from 7 per cent the year before. The Gold Coast went up 30 per cent and Wide Bay 24 per cent. Softer conditions could be found in Townsville (7.4 per cent), Cairns (10.8 per cent) and Mackay/Isaac/Whitsundays (10.4 per cent). At the start of the pandemic the property market was predicted to crash, but the exact opposite has occurred. ""Housing values have been rising at the fastest pace annually since 1985,"" Mr Lawless said. ""It's definitely a seller's market. ""Listings are getting snapped up within 25 days and auction clearance rates in Brisbane are at a record high."" When the borders reopen, it will continue to be a seller's market and bad news for home buyers who are less cashed up. The south-east has become ""extremely popular"" with interstate buyers who see the market as affordable. Particularly for those moving from Sydney, where the median house price is nearly double that of Brisbane. Mr Lawless said prices would be pushed even higher, in the short term at least. ""Brisbane is the most popular [place to buy], then bordering coastal areas, then outer fringes, like Ipswich and Toowoomba,"" he said. ""Chances are we are going to see house prices continuing to rise quite swiftly across Queensland into 2022."" Mr Lawless said the lack of affordability for locals would put the brakes on somewhat, with the growth rate expected to slow down later in 2022. ""If it doesn't and household debt is not stabilising then credit conditions would tighten to dampen the market,"" he said. Treasurer Cameron Dick said a lot of young people had entered the market, accounting for a third of all loans in the past year. He said the state was looking at opening up more land supply including in Caboolture West, where there was potential for 30,000 new homes. ""The more homes that we build, the better affordability,"" he said. ""It's going to remain challenging … we've got the benefit of growth, but also the challenge of growth."" COVID could bring the state's health system to its knees. Queensland Health used preliminary modelling by QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute when planning how and when to open the state's borders but it was limited in its scope and there are still a lot of unknowns. The modelling didn't take into account transmission with immunity waning, nor different infection rates in southern states, new variants or complacency with testing and isolation. Epidemiologist Linda Selvey, an associate professor at the University of Queensland and who worked in Queensland Health for 13 years as the director of the communicable disease branch, said it also did not take into account regional areas with lower vaccination coverage. Cherbourg has 40 per cent of residents over the age of 15 vaccinated, Isaac 50 per cent and Charters Towers 62 per cent. ""I think that's potentially a flaw [in the modelling],"" Dr Selvey said. ""This means that it could be possible to have quite large outbreaks in some regional areas. ""There's a risk ... the local hospitals will be unable to cope. ""I don't think we could exclude lockdowns in the future."" The state will change how it manages cases once the virus spreads. The focus will be on testing, contact tracing, isolation of positive cases and quarantine of their contacts, rather than widespread lockdowns. Contact tracing would have a fixed capacity of 100 cases per day, QIMR modelling assumed, focusing on more controlled venues, like households and classrooms. Places like supermarkets, public transport and bars would be harder to keep on top of. Working from home would help prevent the spread, while public health orders could be issued to enforce it, as seen in parts of NSW recently. Booster shots will also become increasingly important. In Australia, they are available for those who are severely immunocompromised and for adults six months after they have had their second dose. But Dr Selvey said immunity had ""quite a significant drop"" around three months after the second dose. ""When we open up I'll certainly be wearing a mask, until I have my booster shot,"" she said. The QIMR modelling predicted about 100 to 200 deaths within the first three months, and that figure did not take into account waning immunity, particularly in the over 65s age group. There could be about 100 new infections each day by January and about 1,000 new daily infections by mid-2022. The over-60s and children are expected to carry most of the infections, but the severe health outcomes would primarily fall on the old. Cases that require hospitalisation may peak at 2,000 in August, including 400 to 600 in intensive care. The modelling did not include scenarios of what impact lockdowns would have on controlling unbridled spread. Hospitals would be pushed to breaking point, the Australian Medical Association Queensland president Chris Perry said. At the Princess Alexandra Hospital, in Brisbane's inner south, 180 of its 500 beds could be taken up with COVID patients by August, Dr Perry said. The hospital has about 34 intensive care beds but up to 94 may be needed during the peak. Dr Perry said if Queensland followed the trend in NSW and Victoria, 98 per cent of people in intensive care would be unvaccinated. ""It is a disease of the unvaccinated,"" he said. ""There will be unvaccinated people dying. ""When people say these things, they're not being alarmist, it's not part of a plot, nobody is trying to pull the wool over people's eyes."" Dr Perry said the strained hospital system would also see elective surgeries put on hold and waiting lists blow out. ""There are people who have car accidents and heart attacks who won't be able to be ventilated,"" he said. To help prevent the inundation, restrictions will continue for unvaccinated people who will not be allowed to enter hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums, festivals or galleries. Mandatory vaccinations are also in place for people working in health care, aged and disability care, police, hospitality, truck drivers, schools, childcare centres, correctional centres, detention facilities and airports. Children have faced a lower risk from COVID, but earlier this year the ""Indooroopilly cluster"" took hold in several of Brisbane's schools. In the latest Sydney outbreaks, the Delta strain was transmitted in schools and early childhood centres at five times the rate seen in 2020, research by the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance found. Extending the vaccine rollout to younger children, aged between 5 and 11, has not yet been approved in Australia, but Dr Selvey said rapid testing could become the new norm. ""The experience in other countries, where they have good vaccination coverage ... it's children in schools and kindergartens that are transmitting the infection to each other and then bringing it home and spreading it wider in the community,"" Dr Selvey said. ""What's been happening in some places, is that when there is an outbreak in a school, the whole class isolates. ""I certainly think that rapid testing will be part of the picture. It doesn't necessary reduce the number of cases, but reduces the number of time that children stay away from school."" There may also be concerns for the unvaccinated when families come together for festive celebrations. Some community groups fear the slow vaccine uptake in their circles could spell disaster if large gatherings become superspreader events. Tevita and Sharon Ta'ai, from Calamvale in Brisbane's south, have 13 children and nine grandchildren, some of whom they have not seen for two years. They can't wait to have the whole family together again for Christmas. As part of the Pacific Island community, the couple said they did not want their Tongan friends and family to lag behind the rest of the state when it came to vaccination rates. In a bid to buck the trend, Mr Ta'ai was the first in his family to be vaccinated. His children who are old enough are vaccinated too. ""The way I raise my family … I'm not looking at others or waiting for promotions. I wanted to be on board straight away,"" Mr Ta'ai said. ""It's your own choice whether you want it or not but please look at others. We don't want to risk other people's lives. We will have a merry Christmas and an enjoyable new year if we do the right thing."" Earlier this year Mr Ta'ai's older brother Feleti, who lives in the United States, was hospitalised with COVID-19 and despite being ""very, very sick"" he was fortunate enough to overcome the virus. ""He was nearly dead. He's still young,"" Mr Ta'ai said. ""He asked us to go and get vaccinated. It's a horrible pandemic … it's really hard to deal with, so that's why me and my wife we are going out and encouraging everyone 'please go and get vaccinated'."" Queensland will open its borders to quarantine-free international travellers when the vaccination rate of those over 16 reaches 90 per cent — a milestone that based on current rates, is projected to happen sometime in early January. A cynic may think airlines will be price gouging to recoup after two woeful years, but Qantas said Queenslanders could expect flights to be similar in price as pre-pandemic costs. ""We expect to see a lot of competition on the international markets that we operate to and we'll always ensure our fares are competitive,"" a Qantas spokesperson said. ""Starting fares are comparable to the year-round fares we offered pre-COVID."" Qantas' Tasman flights are scheduled to take off from January 31, and Los Angeles and Singapore from February 2. Flights to other international destinations from Queensland will resume progressively in the months following, including Brisbane-Noumea restarting on April 2. In the week immediately following the government's announcement to re-open the state borders, Virgin Australia saw Queensland travel bookings increase by 800 per cent compared to the week before. Since then, demand has remained at least 70 per cent higher than pre-COVID times. While Queenslanders are itching to get away, southerners have already booked their tickets into the state. Queensland services account for 80 per cent of Virgin's top bookings during the Christmas holiday period. The most popular routes are Melbourne to Coolangatta, Brisbane to Cairns, Brisbane to Melbourne, and Coolangatta to Sydney. And, Melbourne to Coolangatta and Brisbane to Hobart routes have had higher booking rates than pre-COVID. Families like Jacqui Markun's will cherish the additional flights into the state which will allow her mother Sharon Griffiths to meet her three-month-old twin granddaughters for the very first time. In fact, her flights were booked as soon as the border opening was announced. The last three months have felt like an eternity especially for a hands-on grandmother stuck over the border in NSW. In July, a month before Jacqui's twins Evelyn and Elyse were due, Queensland's border shut and Jacqui had the unnerving task of delivering two babies without her mum nearby. ""I was feeling a lot more anxious this time. I really did want Mum,"" she said. ""Particularly with twins coming, I didn't know how much work it was going to be, with another toddler. It was daunting. ""I never thought COVID was going to affect my life like this."" When the babies were brought home, time was a blur. Jacqui hasn't had more than three hours' sleep in a row in three months. Her husband returned to work after two weeks and the 32-year-old is desperately craving for someone to take her three kids in the morning, so she can have a couple of hours' sleep. ""I have three crying babies all at once and one set of hands,"" she said. ""I've found the use of my feet a lot. ""I have one in the bouncer at my feet when I'm trying to comfort the other one. You cannot actually comfort two babies at once, it's not possible, and then what do you do with the toddler?"" Ms Griffiths, who goes by Shaz to the grandkids, would fly up about once a month before the borders closed, from her home in Redbank, west of Port Macquarie. Now, the family catches up almost every day on FaceTime, but for Ms Griffiths, the distance is hard to overcome. She and Jacqui are resigned to the fact that the girls won't recognise her when they finally reunite, but they are hoping they will be used to her voice from the many videocalls between them. ""It's very unusual, it's like being a bit disconnected,"" Ms Griffiths said. ""You don't have that bond that you have with the other one [Hunter]. So you miss that. ""Normally you'd have a connection, you'd be able to grab hold of them and know what that feels like.""

405,Sunny Tongala making hay while the silo art trail shines,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tongala's hay bale trail in northern Victoria rings in the Christmas festive season Christmas spirit in the tiny northern Victorian township of Tongala is drawing in tourists off the back of eased pandemic restrictions and the success of the Silo Art Trail. Last December, in between pandemic lockdowns, the local dairy farming community created an outdoor, COVID-safe and family friendly display of decorated hay bales that drew visitors from as far away as Sydney. It was a huge hit, bringing a new vibrancy to the town and increased patronage for local businesses. The Tongala Development Group decided they were on a winner and organised other hay bale celebrations throughout the year for Easter, Anzac Day and RUOK Day. Now, the community has launched its second Christmas Hay Bale Trail and hopes social media will continue drawing visitors to the area. The group's spokesperson, Amber Townsend, said shares on social media have played a huge part in the success of the project, and this year the organisers are encouraging people to take selfies. ""Once we were on social media, we had visitors come from far and wide,"" Ms Townsend said. ""Last year, during the first COVID lockdown, a local farmer decided to decorate some hay bales as [popular cartoon characters] Bluey and Bingo, and popped them out the front of her farm, which generated so much interest within our region they got moved into town, next to the post office. ""We're a small dairy farming community off two main highways, so we really want people to be coming through the small towns and seeing what we've got to offer."" Ms Townsend said the community is looking forward to seeing the streets lined with cars, the bakery ""run off its feet"", revenue coming into the town through the local petrol station, supermarket and stores, and grey nomads coming along the silo trail and making a detour through Tongala. Jordan Souter, who donated the hay bales from his local farm supplies business, was initially surprised by the idea. ""The committee are doing a really good job, bringing a lot of people into town on the weekends and even during the week,"" he said. Jackie Humphries, one of this year's hay bale artists, said her three young children loved going around and looking at all the artworks. ""Last year with COVID it was probably a bit tricky to gauge what response we'd get, so it'll be interesting to see who comes out, and hopefully the town and everyone really gets behind it,"" she said Organisers hope that with fewer border restrictions and lockdowns this year the installations will bring visitors in their droves, put a smile on children's faces, spark some spending and imbue everyone with the spirit of community and Christmas. Artist Jimmy D'vate is painting the third silo at nearby Rochester. The artwork will follow the flora and fauna theme of the previous two painted silos and joins the more than 50 silos that have been painted nationwide in the past six years. ABC Central Victoria will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday. Sign up to stay connected.

406,Roads scholar: Heather Ewart shares her top tips for holiday road trips,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Back Roads host Heather Ewart shares her road trip tips ahead of the holiday season I've always loved a good road trip — maybe because that was my parents' idea of a family holiday and old habits die hard. What a way to see this vast country, if you're prepared to cop the occasional flat tyre, lack of mobile phone reception, dust, flies and even snow blizzards. And let's not forget the many wonderful and quirky characters you meet along the way. With summer holidays just around the corner, I'll share with you some of my favourite road trips. This week I'll take you cruising into the South Australian outback, hang out in the Victorian high country, before sharing my tips about crossing the Nullarbor. Take William Creek on the Oodnadatta Track in South Australia. Sure, a tiny town painted completely white may not be everyone's cup of tea, but Trevor Wright actually owns this town, so he can do whatever the hell he wants. He reckons it was like playing monopoly, buying up this place. Population 11 at last count, William Creek has an excellent pub bedecked with business cards from around the world pinned to the walls of the front bar — where a smiling Trevor greets customers. I arrived there on sundown in a bright purple ute owned by stockman Bobby Hunter I'd met at Maree a few hours back down the road. We'd enjoyed the annual Camel Cup together, followed by a colourful reunion of Afghan cameleer descendants and Bobby offered to be my guide as I continued along the track. The natural wonder of Lake Eyre-Kati Thanda National Park was the clear highlight of our journey, as it would be for any traveller. The largest salt lake in Australia really comes to life after desert rains, and if you can manage it, a scenic flight from William Creek puts the sheer size and beauty of this phenomenon into perspective. The endpoint of my trip was the Pink Road House at Oodnadatta, painted bright pink of course (they seem to have a thing about colours out here) where I was just in time for the camp draft and bronco branding contest. Not to mention beers and a laugh or two with competitors and spectators around the fire pits set up at close of day. If possible, it's ideal to time your travels with local events like this — few and far between since COVID, but they'll come back. And aim for a variety of landscapes, and the best seasons. For the record, I've never been a skier, but there's something truly magical about Dinner Plain in the Victorian high country on the Great Alpine Way and waking to freshly fallen snow. This is a unique town worth checking out in winter or summer. Officially opened in 1986 and surrounded by majestic snow gums, the architecture of every building in Dinner Plain is strictly restricted to timber, local stone and corrugated iron, and the result is fabulous. The design is inspired by the pioneering cattlemen's huts, and you can just imagine those days if you take the time to head from Dinner Plain towards the snowfields of Jindabyne in NSW by opting for the less well-worn path of the Barry Way. Stream more of Heather's adventures on iview. Parts of this winding road are unsealed but it is so worth a dirt pothole or two for the breathtaking views across the Snowy River valleys. There are plenty of lookouts, and I recommend the lot. Don't miss Suggan Buggan timber schoolhouse, lovingly maintained by the descendants of those who rode their horses to school here back in the 1870s. As a few of the diehard farmers left around these isolated parts say, driving the Barry Way is like flying with the eagles. They proudly boast it's just as good, if not better than Victoria's way more famous Great Ocean Road. I reckon they just might be right. Speaking of famous roads, crossing the Nullarbor Plain from south to west should be on every curious traveller's bucket list. The key is not to rush the journey to Perth, as I did first time round back in the 1980s. A two-week Back Roads adventure starting near South Australia's Ceduna in 2019 showed me how much I had missed. You've just got to venture off the Eyre Highway a bit. From whale watching at Fowler's Bay and the Great Australian Bight to checking out the ruins of old town buildings at Eucla right on sunset, there are so many glorious surprises. My personal favourite was the Eyre Bird Observatory about half an hour's drive from the Cocklebiddy roadhouse on the WA side, where you can actually step back in time and stay off-grid in this restored telegraph station and birdwatch if so inclined or walk the wild beaches. More delights when you hit the sparkling, pristine coastline near Esperance, but that's a story for another day. Heather returns to the screen with a new series of Back Roads starting January 3, 2022 on ABC TV at 7.30pm, until then, head over to ABC iview to watch the show's previous seven series.

407,Australia receives order to cancel dozens of Myanmar citizens' passports,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Myanmar junta cancels passports of high-profile opponents and shadow government figures, documents show Myanmar's military junta has revoked the passports of dozens of its leading opponents — including senior ministers in the civilian National Unity Government (NUG) and several high-profile pro-democracy activists — in an apparent attempt to stop them travelling and campaigning against the February 1 military coup. The ABC has obtained seven documents sent by Myanmar's embassy to other diplomatic missions in Canberra, as well as to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The documents list the names of almost 70 Myanmar citizens. They include several prominent Myanmar civilian politicians and anti-junta dissidents — including the NUG Foreign Affairs Minister Zin Mar Aung and leading National League for Democracy lawmaker Aung Kyi Nyunt — along with their personal details and passport numbers. The missive says the ""following Ordinary Myanmar Passports have been declared null and void"". ""The embassy, therefore, would like to request to consider the above mentioned passports as cancelled and shall not be recognised if presented."" Human rights lawyer and member of the Special Advisory Council to Myanmar, Chris Sidoti, told the ABC that some of those on the list were currently in Myanmar, while others were overseas. It's not clear if any of the people listed are currently in Australia. Mr Sidoti said the documents provided clear evidence that the military junta was trying to stop its opponents from moving around the world to advocate for democracy or build up diplomatic support for the alternative civilian government. ""I think it's quite clear that this is an attempt to stop people from travelling, from being able to access Western countries and Western media,"" he said. ""Why else would you withdraw passports if the intention were not to prevent people from travelling?"" ""This is quite consistent with all the attempts of the military since the coup to silence any voices of opposition or dissent — or simply those calling for democracy."" The documents have drawn a contemptuous response from the NUG. Its human rights minister Aung Myo Min told the ABC the military had previously used similar tactics to try and convince other countries to hand over political dissidents from Myanmar. ""In 1988 (after a major uprising) they did the same thing. Many of the Myanmar activists were stateless and had a hard time travelling around the world and advocating with the international community,"" he said. He said any governments that had received the diplomatic notes – including the Australian government — should simply ignore them. ""The military is not the government of Myanmar. It's not even the de-facto government. They illegally staged an attempted coup, but we are the legitimate government. This is an illegal act and tactics by the military."" Raising more doubt about whether Sydney economist Sean Turnell will receive a fair trial, Australian embassy officials are being prevented from observing court proceedings. Mr Sidoti also said it was likely that similar or identical documents had been sent out by other Myanmar embassies at the behest of the military junta. He told the ABC the attempt to stop people from travelling was unlikely to be successful, but the episode highlighted why the Australian government should formally recognise the NUG as the rightful government of Myanmar, and expel the diplomats currently in the embassy. ""The fact they are circulating these lists is proof positive that these diplomats represent the military, and the military is not the legal government of Myanmar,"" Mr Sidoti said. ""If this is the way these diplomats are going to conduct themselves they do not deserve to be treated as representatives of Myanmar. ""The National Unity Government has already appointed a representative to Australia. That representative should be considered the representative of the state of Myanmar in this country."" It's not the first time the Myanmar embassy has come under fire for its actions since the coup on February 1. Pro-democracy activists in the Myanmar community of Australia have lashed the diplomats in the embassy for not defecting — unlike some other Myanmar officials at overseas posts — in the wake of the military seizing power. In June Myanmar students groups accused the embassy of intimidation after it sent notes to government scholars in Australia demanding they pledge loyalty to the junta. The federal government has repeatedly pressed Myanmar's military to free political prisoners, cease violence against protesters and restore civilian rule. It's also redirected aid money away from the military, suspended cooperation programs with the Tatmadaw, and thrown is weight behind the efforts of ASEAN — the peak diplomatic body in the region – to resolve the crisis. But it has so far resisted calls from activists to apply fresh sanctions to the leaders of the military coup, frustrating many in the Myanmar diaspora. The ABC repeatedly contacted Myanmar's embassy in Canberra seeking comment, but it has not responded to questions.

408,"Want to travel for the fun of it, but worried about cancelled plans? One country is offering a solution",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Just when it seems safe to finally book that trip, COVID comes along and delivers a fresh blow. When the Omicron variant emerged over the weekend, travel plans were disrupted, changes were quickly made to Australia's border, and anyone who was about to confirm tickets to a faraway place might have had a second thought. For nearly two years, a small island nation and neighbour to Australia has been hanging on these moments. Fiji has pushed to get its vaccination rate to more than 90 per cent and has come up with a model for international travel that requires travellers to stay in the same place for a few days, but also feels nothing like quarantine. A lot was riding on December 1, when the first international flights were due to touch down in Nadi. Then, just a few days beforehand, the Omicron variant appeared. And while individual plans being disrupted is one thing, what they mean collectively to an entire country is something else. The decision was made to proceed. Fiji is selling its model for travel as quarantine-free, and for the most part it is. There are a range of conditions you have to meet to board the plane, including things travellers are getting used to such as pre-flight PCR tests and having an international vaccine certificate. But it's what happens once you arrive that sets Fiji apart. The deal is, international arrivals have to spend their first three nights in accommodation that has been accredited under a program called the Care Fiji Commitment (CFC). At the 48-hour mark, there will be a rapid test, and after returning a negative result, visitors are free to leave the resort area and head further afield. But from the moment visitors land, they are not restricted as they have been in traditional hotel quarantine models. Approved transfer companies can move visitors between the airport and their resorts, then between resorts or to day trips and activities that are also approved by the CFC system. For 48 hours, travellers have to stay within the CFC zone, but that covers countless resorts, restaurants, bars, pools, a long strip of beach and the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean. Inside the resort people are asked to use Fiji's COVID check-in app and wear masks in some areas. Hotels will be able to take care of the rapid tests and some also have onsite PCR labs, which Australian travellers will need to visit in order to board a plane home. Chief executive of Tourism Fiji Brent Hill said the idea was to provide a space where travellers know they will be taken care of. ""We want people to feel really safe and secure, but at the same time we want them to enjoy [themselves], and perhaps get away from all the craziness that's in our world, and just have an enjoyable Fijian holiday,"" he said. News of the Omicron variant was the first test in Fiji's experiment. Fijian Attorney-General and Minister for the Economy Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum told the ABC the government was confident in the moves it had made to increase restrictions for nationals arriving from red-list countries. ""It's still early days, but in the meantime we believe we have enough of a safety net to ensure it doesn't creep into Fiji, or if it does that we will be able to manage it,"" he said. On Thursday, Fiji's Secretary for Health Dr James Fong confirmed there were people already in Fiji's quarantine system who had returned from African nations and tested positive for COVID, but it will be some time before genomic sequencing can confirm if these cases are the Omicron variant. Also on Thursday, planes from Sydney, Melbourne, Los Angeles and San Francisco delivered more tourists to Fiji. The country has a long list of ""travel partner countries"" — nations whose fully vaccinated citizens are invited to holiday in Fiji. The question for travellers is whether the arrangements in Fiji help to reduce the uncertainty that comes with booking travel now. There is no doubt that travel of any kind has been made more difficult by COVID. But with so many Australians spending time locked out of the country, away from friends and family on the other side of international or state borders and lockdowns that come hard and fast, how much desire will there be to risk further complications by travelling for the fun of it? Tourism expert, senior lecturer in development studies at Massey University and Fijian native Dr Apisalome Movono said there was a ""push and pull"" scenario at play. ""The pull factor is that Fiji is open and very few destinations in the Pacific, if any, are open at the moment, so that's a major contributor to people coming. They are able to,"" he said. ""And it's also that push. We've been through 22 months of continuous lockdowns, uncertainties, not being able to travel, unwind, reinvigorate."" Fiji is expecting 75,000 tourists to arrive over the next two months. Dr Movono said the ultimate test would be whether Fiji's tourism industry can achieve ""some form of normalcy"". ""The success of this experiment hinges on Fiji's ability to sustain the smiles, the happiness and the promise of a safe and good holiday,"" he said. ""It will require some tweaking, building resilience into the system for different types of shocks. ""Fiji, we are going all out now to re-open, but there are many what-ifs."" For the people of Fiji, there is an immediate economic need to bring tens of thousands of hospitality and tourism staff back to work. But there have been some concerns raised by the opposition and community groups about the health risks to the population, with much still to be learnt about Omicron. Dr Movono said the situation had ""high stakes"". ""Fiji was quite intent on opening up, tourism is too important for us not to,"" he said. ""Let's see how this experiment pans out.""

410,Everything we know about the Omicron cases in NSW right now,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The Omicron COVID-19 variant has landed in Australia and so far all but one of the cases are confined to NSW. Health authorities are monitoring hundreds of people who arrived in Sydney from southern Africa on three flights over the past week. NSW and Victoria are the only Australian jurisdictions where international travel is permitted without hotel quarantine, however, isolation requirements have been increased due to uncertainty about the new variant. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Health authorities in NSW have also begun reanalysing positive COVID-19 swabs collected over the past two weeks from people who have been in southern Africa, to see if more Omicron infections can be identified. The only other state or territory that has recorded a case of Omicron in a returning traveller is the Northern Territory. Here's what we know about the three flights to Sydney that had confirmed cases onboard. The two most recently identified cases of the new variant were travellers on a Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Sydney last Thursday. A man in his 40s from Sydney's west and a woman in her 30s from the Central Coast were on the flight and have since tested positive to the new strain of COVID-19. Both were fully vaccinated but had been in the community whilst infectious as they flew in before border rules were tightened. NSW Health said the man visited a Chemist Warehouse in Liverpool on Monday. The Central Coast woman visited numerous shops and fast food outlets in Parramatta and Ryde in Sydney as well as Wyong, Wadalba and Toulkey on the Central Coast. Everyone on the Doha flight is considered a close contact and is being contacted by NSW Health. Two more people on the same flight have also tested positive for COVID-19 and genomic testing is underway to determine if they have also been infected by the Omicron variant. The first two Omicron cases to be recorded in NSW arrived in Sydney on Saturday evening on a Qatar Airways flight from Doha. They were tested on arrival and put into isolation and both were asymptomatic and fully vaccinated. About 260 passengers and air crew on this flight are considered close contacts and must isolate for two weeks. Twelve passengers on board were from southern Africa and are therefore undergoing 14 days of hotel quarantine at special health accommodation. Two passengers who arrived in Sydney on Sunday from southern Africa also tested positive to the Omicron variant. Right now, it's most helpful to notice how we are feeling and the urges that are arising, and allow time for more information to become available before taking any action. Both people were fully vaccinated. Neither traveller had been in the community as they landed after the federal government ordered all arrivals from eight southern African countries to enter hotel quarantine for 14 days. The two passengers are now isolating in special health accommodation. On this day the NSW government also introduced a rule which means all all international arrivals, notwithstanding where they have travelled from, must isolate for 72 hours a their residence or accommodation. A third traveller on the same flight also tested positive for COVID-19 but it was ""likely an old infection"", NSW Health said. It's unclear whether that passenger also had the Omicron variant.

411,Popular outback swimming hole shut for summer,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Popular Central Australian outback swimming hole shut for summer Ellery Creek Big Hole, 90 kilometres west of Alice Springs, will be closed for most of the summer months. Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife district manager Phil Cowan said the closure would allow the popular swimming hole's 2 kilometre dirt access road to be sealed ""We've got a exciting project to seal that 2 kilometre of access road in of Namatjira Drive as you drive to the campgrounds' and work is already started. Mr Cowan said the decision to re-seal the road in the hotter months of the year was made as there are fewer visitors to the region. ""[It's] going to be closed until late January. ""But we'll reopen the place for a couple of weeks over Christmas and New Years. ""So people will still be about to get in there and have a swim and enjoy the waterhole for a couple of weeks over the Christmas break. ""But it's all sort of systems go to get that road sealed as of as of now,"" he said. Mr Cowan said that the department is aware of the waterhole's popularity and there was some consideration in making it accessible throughout the road work period. ""The difficulty with the Ellery road is [that] it's quite narrow as it gets closer to the campground infrastructure. ""There's a number of red gums on the eastern side of the road going in there and that they are sacred trees that can't be touched. ""There's just no ability to sort of have one line open while the other is closed because the road isn't actually that wide.

412,"'We couldn't get into Queensland, so we're going to Fiji': Pacific island reopens to travellers",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Fiji's international border opens to tourists today, despite worldwide concerns over the coronavirus Omicron variant. The Pacific island nation has pushed ahead with its plan to reopen one of its biggest industries, with tourism operators and the government insisting the right settings are in place to protect the population and travellers. At Sydney Airport there are plenty of Australians eager to finally have somewhere to holiday. Deb and Ben Tatton were married on Saturday and said being able to honeymoon overseas a few days later made them feel as if things were getting back to normal. ""We only got married on Saturday, so this is our honeymoon — it's perfect timing,"" Ms Tatton said. ""We were originally going to Japan, but we were locked out. Then Tasmania but [we were also] locked out. ""We got the wedding that we wanted … and now we get to go overseas for a honeymoon so it feels like the country is getting back to normal again. ""We tried to travel locally, but the states wouldn't allow that so we'll go international."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Her husband Ben said it was sad the couple could not honeymoon in Australia, but ""at least Fiji is letting us in"". While Fiji prepares to welcome Australian tourists back to its beaches for Christmas, other Pacific countries aren't rushing to follow suit. Morris Delsanto was part of a large group also on the first flight into Nadi this morning. ""We couldn't get into Queensland so we're going to Fiji,"" he said. The plan is to just chill out. ""Relaxation, sit by the pool, have a few drinks, a few island hops maybe, we'll see how we go,"" Mr Delsanto said. ""It's so good without having to worry about where we're going and what conditions [we have to meet]. Fiji just opened their doors. ""We're just excited to get out of here."" Today is considered a major step towards economic recovery for Fiji – a country that relies on tourism for more than $2 billion a year in revenue. There are hopes the country's move to allow quarantine-free travel will help entice tourists back. In a heartfelt message before take-off, the captain of the first Fiji Airways flight from Sydney this morning said today was a ""new beginning"" for Fiji and he thanked passengers. ""Your choice to put us in your travel and holiday arrangements has already made a difference to our people at home,"" he said. ""COVID-19 has affected us all, regardless of whatever nation you are in. We have been severely affected, so much so for our people at home. ""As we take our next step trying to get back to normal, we are so grateful for your choice to be with us this lovely morning. ""On behalf of a very grateful nation, we would like to thank each and every one of you and for those that will be gracing our shores in the coming days, weeks, and months as we recover."" With the emergence of the Omicron variant, Fijians returning from red-listed countries, which include several southern African nations, will face greater restrictions. But under a new plan for tourists, visitors from Australia will not be forced to isolate at all. Tourists from approved countries have to stay three nights in an approved resort and undergo rapid testing, but they are free to move around designated COVID-safe zones, which include bars and restaurants within the hotels, as well as some day trips and activities. Among the passengers departing this morning, there were some concerns about how Omicron might impact their ability to easily return home. ""We're aware of it, we don't feel like there's enough information to stop us going overseas. What will be will be and we'll just deal with isolation or quarantine when we get back,"" Ms Tatton said. Ann Haddara is travelling with her husband Kahtan and daughter Kaylann. ""I was worried [about going] in and out of border closures, but I trust everything will be OK,"" she said. ""The latest information from Fiji is to be patient, everything will be OK. A week is not going to hurt anyone."" To board a plane to Fiji you have to have your paperwork in order. You need to show a negative result on a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before departure, and the certificate has to be from a registered laboratory and include your passport details. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says international travel is on the horizon. But when it will actually become a reality depends on where you live. You also need to have your bookings at a certified COVID-safe hotel and airport transfer company. Travel insurance is again available, and to travel to Fiji you will need to opt in to medical cover in the event you contract COVID while you are there. And, of course, you will also need to download your international vaccination certificate. Allow extra time at check-in because documentation for all passengers has to be checked by airline staff. At check-in this morning, passenger Linda Magee warned: ""It's not like it used to be."" ""It was quite an impulse decision. If I'd known everything that was involved, I may have reconsidered,"" she said. ""I've spent three days doing paperwork to get everything you need to go."" Fellow passenger Cassandra Lack said the key was to be prepared. ""We just made sure we had everything sorted before we got here. I think everyone needs to be more understanding. This is the way of the future now,"" Ms Lack said.

413,'Absolute madness': How Australia's travel ban on African countries over Omicron is impacting families,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  This was the week when Laura was finally going to meet her Australian grandchild. The South African grandmother hadn't seen her daughter in two and a half years and missed the birth of her granddaughter, who is now almost two, due to COVID-19 border closures. But while her flight to Sydney was in mid-air, the Australian government announced a sudden travel ban on nine countries, including South Africa. When she landed for her two-week visit, Laura — who asked to give only her first name — was told she would be placed into hotel quarantine for 14 days. ""I'm 61 and I cried like a baby. I was devastated,"" she said. ""[I had] no idea at all. It was all happening underneath me."" Before take-off, Laura knew very little about the new Omicron variant, which has triggered similar border closures worldwide. Although its emergence has kept her apart from her family and put her in a difficult situation, she was grateful to the scientists and doctors for alerting the world, and to governments for taking it seriously. ""I thought it's just as well they did that, because I would have hated to go to my family and [for] the little one [to get] something because I may have been in contact [with an infected person] on the plane,"" she said. The government has said the border security measures were taken on medical advice and are ""a precaution to protect Australians from the new Omicron variant of concern"". As a travel agent, Laura has spent much of the past two years booking and rebooking flights for clients who are trapped overseas or who need to travel urgently for family emergencies. She's still trying to help clients facing problems with the ban on flights from southern Africa, even as she is stuck in a similar predicament. ""It's special life moments that you miss,"" she said. ""I always thought that the countries were just a flight away, but now I realise the flight doesn't always happen. But I think that's a story all over the world."" The travel ban on southern African countries has also impacted Marian Chikwanha, a nurse in Ballarat. Her whole family lives in Zimbabwe. After working many double shifts to fill the gaps during Victoria's COVID waves, the Australian citizen was planning to fly home to spend some long-awaited quality time with her family in February and March. ""I really wanted to be there for my mum's 70th birthday,"" she said. ""I've been looking forward to de-stress for these two months ... eating my food, listening to my music, speaking my language [in an] area where I call home."" But her travel plans are now up in the air. ""Boom, this one came again,"" she said, referring to the Omicron variant. ""I'm really stressed."" Australia's ban on travel from southern African nations will last for at least 14 days, but Ms Chikwanha and others are concerned it could stretch out longer. Fellow Victorian Vin Masuku's family has also been affected by the travel ban. His niece had booked a ticket to arrive in Australia on December 3 to begin her nursing studies after a two-year delay, but her flight was swiftly cancelled. ""She was ready to come. When she knew people can travel from December 1, she just went straight to the computer to buy a ticket,"" he said. ""Now it's not certain how long it's going to be. So you can just imagine the mental health [impact] that comes with all that uncertainty."" He described his niece as a bright and dedicated person who admired Australia's health system and who wanted to study here to be able to take knowledge back home and improve health care in Zimbabwe. South Africa and the World Health Organization (WHO) slammed western countries for the ""unjustified"" border closures. Zimbabwe shares a border with South Africa and Botswana, but has not yet detected a single case of the Omicron variant. The country has been recording an average of around 78 new COVID-19 cases a day, while neighbouring Mozambique's new daily cases have been in the single figures. Ms Chikwanha said she had mixed emotions about the travel ban on her home country. ""You want to protect the environment that you are in ... I see what is happening in the community, in the emergency departments ... So I understand what they are doing,"" she said. But she said she would like to see other measures put in place to support people to travel. She added she hoped there would be further investigation after 61 passengers tested positive for the variant in the Netherlands, after they should have returned negative COVID tests before leaving South Africa. Africa, as a continent, has a vaccination rate of just over 7 per cent. ""Vaccine inequality should be addressed ... right now we are having boosters yet other countries do not have enough for first jabs,"" Ms Chikwanha said. Kerith Hulme, a South Africa-based travel agent and colleague of Laura's, described the fallout from the travel bans as ""absolute madness"". The United Kingdom was the first to issue a snap ban — she received calls from one couple who had just landed in South Africa for a wedding and needed to return immediately, while another woman rang her in tears. ""She cried so hard she actually couldn't breathe, trying to get her daughter back to her [in the UK],"" Ms Hulme said. She has more than 50 families on her books affected by the worldwide bans, and was trying to prioritise people who were flying to see dying family members. Some were able to get a flight but not a spot in a quarantine hotel on return to the UK, and therefore could not travel, while many airlines had cancelled inbound flights, stranding people outside their home countries. She said the travel ban was seen as ""ridiculous"" by many of the affected countries in the south of Africa, when places including Portugal, Belgium, Hong Kong, Canada, Israel and others were not subjected to bans. ""It's around the world ... and we're the ones who are now just being completely shut out. So I think the overwhelming feeling here is that it's just unjustified. It's not fair,"" she said. ""Namibia is on most of the travel bans — they have less than 20 cases a day and they don't have this new variant. ""They've been put on the ban just because it's Africa. Africa [is seen as] just this one big country that everyone is blaming. It's crazy.""

414,Cars to give way to turtles on one of Australia's most famous beaches ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Driving on Cable Beach in turtle nesting season set to be banned from 2022 Cars are set to be banned from driving on Broome's Cable Beach during peak turtle nesting season from next year after a review found the move could protect 80 per cent of hatchlings from vehicle impacts. The ban is the recommendation of the Yawuru Park Council, which manages conservation issues on Cable Beach and includes Yawuru native title holders, the Broome Shire and Parks and Wildlife. The Yawuru Parks coordinator with Parks and Wildlife, Wil Bennett, said the Broome Shire would make the final decision in coming months. ""The vehicle ramp closures for two months come into place in December 2022, subject to a final decision by the shire, given that it is shire land where the access ramp is,"" he said. The proposal is aimed at providing the greatest benefit for nesting flatback and green sea turtles, while having the minimum impact on the popular tradition of driving cars on Cable Beach. ""To ensure that there's still maintenance of recreational access down to the beach, we looked at targeting the closure for when most of the hatching events are taking place,"" Mr Bennett said. ""Eighty per cent of the hatching events happen in December and January, generally the quietest months of the year which is pretty convenient."" Cable Beach has 25 kilometres of white sand bordered by rolling sand dunes on one side and the Indian Ocean on the other, offering spectacular sunsets that draw visitors from across Australia, and the world when international tourism is possible. So loved is Cable Beach that it regularly features in declarations of Australia's best beaches, and attracts large crowds of tourists, locals, camel rides, cars and nudists. But as the weather heats up ahead of the tropical wet season, female sea turtles start to haul themselves ashore in search of nesting locations and this is where potential problems begin. ""Obviously vehicles pose a direct threat to turtles that are trying to nest on the beach,"" Mr Bennett said. ""They can scare them away through lights and loud noises, and obviously there's the risk of direct impact to a nesting turtle as well which is not what anybody wants."" Of even greater concern is the impact cars can have when the hatchlings emerge seven weeks after the eggs are laid. Deep tyre tracks create significant obstacles for the tiny hatchlings as they try to reach the sea. Mr Bennett said the palm-sized baby turtles hatch with a limited supply of energy that needs to last them for their first three days before they start feeding. ""Navigating tyre ruts is a major problem to that energy,"" he said. ""It leaves them with a lot less energy once they hit the water if they make it, and [then] they're at far greater risk of predation in the water."" Want more local news? Sign up to the weekly ABC Kimberley email newsletter In 2009, the Broome Shire installed a gate on the vehicle access ramp to Cable Beach and started closing the beach to cars overnight during turtle nesting season. Parks and Wildlife staff have spent the past year reviewing the impact cars are having on turtles on Cable Beach and have found the overnight closure is helping the turtles. ""We've gone pretty deep dive into the issue, and what we've determined is that the overnight closures are a great success,"" Mr Bennett said. But volunteers and wildlife managers are regularly finding hatchlings trapped in the tyre tracks of cars and other vehicles. ""Our recommendation was that the best way to [help the hatchlings] is to get the ruts off the beach, get the vehicles off the beach,"" Mr Bennett said. ""One in 1,000 hatchlings make it through to adulthood and come back to the beach they were born on to nest, so you want to give them the absolute best chances of survival."" Under the proposed plan, cars would be banned from driving on most of cable beach during December and January, with the exception of the southern most section near Gantheaume Point. Mr Bennett said this would protect the majority of hatchlings as well as many of the nesting adults. ""Half of all nesting events happen in December and January as well, so a full closure for those two months only, in addition to the continuation of the existing overnight closures, will give really strong protection to those hatchlings,"" he said. The new rules are expected to come into place from December 2022, and in the meantime Mr Bennett said people can help hatchlings by giving them plenty of space to ensure the marine reptiles continue to call Cable Beach home. ""Stay well away from those nests, don't walk over them, and drive below the high tide mark,"" he said. ""Just stay back, leave a clear space between them and the sea, and in 20 or so years they'll be back.""

415,International students and visa holders urged to 'hang in there' for another two weeks as Omicron keeps borders closed,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus International students barred from entering Australia for at least another two weeks are being urged to ""hang in there"" after the federal government postponed its reopening plan in response to the new Omicron strain of COVID-19. Fully vaccinated international students, skilled migrants and humanitarian visa holders were due to restart returning to Australia from Wednesday. The National Security Committee of cabinet last night decided to defer the step until December 15, while health authorities gather and assess the latest information about Omicron with five cases already detected amongst returned travellers in Australia. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Chief executive Vicki Thomson from the Group of Eight, which represents some of the nation's leading universities, said it was an ""unfortunate"" yet understandable decision. ""To our all of our students, the 30,000, that the Group of Eight have got offshore at the moment, hang in there,"" Ms Thomson told the ABC. ""Every decision that's made is in their best interest, so hopefully, you know, it'll be a good outcome before Christmas. ""If this is what we need to do, whilst we're in this very uncertain period, then we understand the government's objectives in that."" She said any further delays to allowing international students into the country, coupled with quarantine requirements, could disrupt the first semester of study. ""The logistics of getting students in for the start of New Year just means that potentially that will be delayed,"" she said. ""Any delay in getting international students back is not just an impact on our universities, but of course, a significant impact on our hospitality, on our retail sector, because we know a lot of our students work in those sectors."" National Cabinet will meet this afternoon to consider its response to the new strain which has been labelled a ""variant of concern"" by the World Health Organization. ""Australians can be assured that we are in a strong position to deal with COVID and its emerging challenges,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement last night. ""We will continue to take sensible and responsive evidence-based action, led by medical experts. This will ensure we can open safely, and stay safely open as we learn to live with the virus."" Scientists are racing to learn more about Omicron, and it is not yet clear if it is more transmissible than Delta, whether it results in more severe disease compared to previous strains, or if it responds to existing vaccines. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic While the government has described the move as a ""temporary pause"", the Refugee Council of Australia said thousands of refugees and humanitarian visa holders who have made travel arrangements to come to Australia would be nervous. ""There are many humanitarian visa holders who will be devastated,"" CEO Paul Power told the ABC. ""Their greatest fear would be that the delay is not going to be just two weeks but could be extended even more."" He said more than 4,000 refugees who had been granted Australian visas prior to border closures in March last year have endured harsh conditions in host countries. ""We've had people have their period of time in quite unsustainable circumstances extended for up to two years already,"" he said. ""It's really been a tough couple of years for people and just to have hope taken away a week after the announcement of the lifting of travel exemptions, even though it might be short-term, is certainly going to be felt very hard by many people.""

417,Border easing delayed as government gathers information about Omicron variant,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus The federal government has deferred Wednesday’s planned easing of border restrictions for international students and other eligible visa holders until December 15. The government says the temporary pause will allow it to gather further information about new Omicron variant of COVID-19 and whether it poses a greater threat than Delta. The National Security Committee of cabinet made the decision following medical advice from the Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly. Australia was due to reopen to international students, skilled migrants as well as humanitarian, working holiday maker and provisional family visa holders from December 1. However, the National Security Committee on Monday evening decided to pause that step. ""The temporary pause will ensure Australia can gather the information we need to better understand the Omicron variant, including the efficacy of the vaccine, the range of illness, including if it may generate more mild symptoms, and the level of transmission,"" a statement said. Australia's international border is closed to travellers except for fully vaccinated Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family, as well as fully vaccinated ""green lane"" travellers from New Zealand and Singapore and limited exemptions. The government has also delayed the reopening of travel with Japan and the Republic of Korea until December 15. ""Australians can be assured that we are in a strong position to deal with COVID and its emerging challenges,"" the statement from the Prime Minister said. ""Australia has a proven record of dealing with COVID, we have one of the lowest fatality rates, highest vaccination rates and strongest economies in the world. ""We will continue to take sensible and responsive evidence based action, led by medical experts. This will ensure we can open safely, and stay safely open as we learn to live with the virus."" National cabinet will meet on Tuesday afternoon to consider its response to the new strain, which has been labelled a ""variant of concern"" by the World Health Organization. Omicron was first reported to the WHO by South Africa earlier this month, and scientists are racing to understand whether the new strain poses a greater threat than Delta. ""Omicron has an unprecedented number of spike mutations, some of which are concerning for their potential impact on the trajectory of the pandemic,"" the WHO said. ""The overall global risk related to the new variant ...is assessed as very high."" To date, no deaths linked to Omicron had been reported, though further research was needed to assess Omicron's potential to escape protection against immunity induced by vaccines and previous infections, it said. Earlier on Monday, Australia's Health Minister Greg Hunt called for calm, insisting Australia was ""well placed"" to deal with a new variant, as Australia's expert immunisation panel, ATAGI confirmed it would be reviewing time frames for COVID-19 booster shots. ""We will, as ever, allow them (ATAGI) to act independently and continue to follow their advice,"" Mr Hunt said. ""But we're prepared with supplies. We are already one of the earliest nations in the world, after Israel, to have a whole-of-nation booster program. ""If they recommend changes, we will follow those changes."" On Saturday the Commonwealth banned non-citizens from nine countries in the southern part of the African continent from entering Australia. Following advice from Professor Kelly, the government has removed Seychelles from the list of countries of concern. Non-citizens travelling from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Malawi and Mozambique are not allowed to enter Australia. New South Wales and Victoria are requiring all Australians returning from overseas to isolate for 72 hours, while other states have mandated 14 days of managed quarantine for international arrivals in response to the new variant.

418,Itching to get back on a plane? Here's where Australia's top 10 travel destinations stand on tourists returning,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Many Australians are champing at the bit to travel overseas again, after nearly two years of closed borders and lockdowns. International borders opened for fully vaccinated Aussies at the beginning of this month, with travel exemptions to leave the country no longer required. The Omicron variant has been declared a COVID-19 ""variant of concern"" by the World Health Organization as cases start appearing in countries well away from southern Africa. Here's everything that happened over the weekend regarding this new variant. But as the arrival of Omicron — a new variant of concern first detected in South Africa over the weekend — shows, we are still far from slipping back into our pre-pandemic travel habits. In response to the World Health Organization declaration, Australia closed its borders to nine southern African countries, forcing arrivals back into 14 days of mandatory quarantine. New South Wales and Victoria have also reinstated 72 hours of mandatory isolation for all other overseas arrivals. On Monday night, the federal government also deferred Wednesday's planned easing of border restrictions for international students and other eligible visa holders until December 15. Even taking Omicron out of the equation, international travel is completely different during the pandemic. With airlines hurrying to restart suspended routes, competing border and quarantine policies and varying risks of COVID-19 around the world, there's more to consider than simply putting your out of office on. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic We've had a look at the requirements for the top 10 travel destinations from Australia in 2019. Information is current for November 29, but double-check before you book. Not right now. While New Zealand was the first international destination open to Australians as part of a trans-Tasman travel bubble earlier this year, the arrangement was suspended when the Delta variant took hold along Australia's east coast. From January 16, fully vaccinated New Zealand residents and other eligible travellers will be able to travel between the countries without quarantining. But foreign travellers will have to wait until at least April 30 to enter the country, as part of a staged reopening. The government has not announced whether these plans will change due to Omicron, which has so far not been detected in the country. Air New Zealand was forced to cancel thousands of trans-Tasman flights this week due to continuing border uncertainty — but, the airline has continued to operate a reduced flight schedule between Sydney and Melbourne for New Zealanders trying to get home. As of last month, Qantas said flights to New Zealand were scheduled to recommence from mid-December, while Virgin Australia plans to resume flights to New Zealand from early 2022. A lot like Australia, a few weeks ago. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced that the three-and-a-half-month lockdown in Auckland would end next month as the country transitions away from its long-held ""COVID zero"" approach. Like Australia, New Zealand employed strict lockdowns, rigorous contract tracing and hard border closures to keep the virus out. As a result, the country of five million has recorded just over 40 deaths from the virus. Fully vaccinated New Zealanders in Australia will be able to travel to New Zealand without two weeks of quarantine from January 16, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says. But the Delta variant has forced the government to change tack. ""The hard truth is that Delta is here and not going away,"" Ms Ardern said last week. At the moment, daily case numbers are hovering around the 200 mark. Yes. The agreement covers hospital care and pharmaceuticals if Australians in New Zealand require urgent medical care that cannot wait until they return home. It doesn't cover GP appointments or other primary care providers. To access treatment under the agreement, you must be able to show your Australian passport and a current Medicare card. Yes, and they don't have to quarantine. From November 1, a one-way travel bubble was re-established for fully vaccinated New Zealand travellers who return a negative COVID-19 test. Not quite. Vaccinated international travellers are required to complete seven days of quarantine in a hotel and undergo COVID-19 testing on arrival in Indonesia. The duration of quarantine for all international arrivals was increased from three days in the wake of the Omicron designation. Travellers from eight African countries have also been banned from entering Indonesia. But a Bintang on the beach might not be far off, with the country's President Joko Widodo eager to get Australians back to Bali. Meeting with Prime Minister Scott Morrison during the G20 Leaders' summit, Widodo reportedly proposed a ""vaccination travel lane"" between the two countries, that would allow fully vaccinated people to travel without quarantine requirements. Indonesia has also suspended visa-free and visa-on-arrival arrangements. In order to enter the country, travellers must now apply for a tourist visa in advance. Indonesia's Garuda Airlines has cancelled most of its Australia routes during the pandemic, maintaining just one weekly flight between Sydney and Jakarta. And there are currently no airlines flying direct to Bali from Australia. Qantas, Jetstar, and Virgin have all said they plan to resume flights to Bali from early next year. Over the past week, Indonesia has recorded daily case numbers in the low-to-mid hundreds. This is down from a peak in July, when more than 50,000 cases were being detected each day in the archipelago nation of more than 273 million. Australians will soon be able to go to places like the UK, which has close to 50,000 cases of COVID-19 a day but travel to Indonesia, which is recording fewer than 1000 cases a day, won't be allowed. The Smart Traveller advice level for Indonesia is currently ""exercise a high degree of caution"", partially due to COVID-19 which remains ""present throughout Indonesia"". There are also limited testing and infection control facilities in the country. ""Critical care for Australians who become seriously ill, including in Bali, is significantly below the standard available in Australia,"" Smart Traveller says. Some COVID-19 restrictions also remain in place and differ according to jurisdiction. These include capacity limits, time limits for eating out, and business curfews. But Tourism Minister Sandiaga Uno has stressed Bali is ready to welcome back tourists. ""We have instituted social restrictions programs that have, thank god, worked very well at bringing down COVID case numbers,"" he said last month. No. Indonesia has also made travel insurance that covers COVID-19 medical expenses up to $US100,000 mandatory for incoming travellers. Only fully vaccinated people with eligible visas will be able to enter Australia from December 15 at this stage. There is so far no travel bubble arrangement for Indonesian tourists. Yes, fully vaccinated travellers are free to enter the United States without quarantining as long as they return a negative COVID-19 test no more than three days before boarding the flight or can prove they have recovered from the virus in the past 90 days. All vaccines currently available in Australia are accepted. Foreign nationals who have recently been in eight southern African countries are banned from entering the country. Good news for people hoping to get over to the US this year, Qantas is already operating direct flights to Los Angeles from Sydney four times a week. United and Delta Airlines have also continued their direct Sydney-Los Angeles services throughout the pandemic. Earlier this month, Air New Zealand brought back its Sydney to Los Angeles route, flying via Auckland, with plans to ramp up the number of services from December 1. Qantas also plans to resume flights between Sydney and Honolulu from December 20, and Sydney and Dallas Fort Worth from February 15 next year. COVID-19 is still running rampant in the US — which has been hit harder by the virus than any other country — with Smart Traveller describing it as a ""serious risk"". Case numbers of almost 100,000 a day are regularly being reported. After being hindered by the pandemic last year, giant balloons have once again loomed over the streets of Manhattan for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. There are also fears the Thanksgiving holiday period will lead to another surge in cases, as people travel around the country to be with their families. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) says community transmission remains high in most states. Across the country, some social distancing rules and restrictions remain in place — varying between states and even cities. Health officials in the US have warned it is inevitable that Omicron would make its way into the country. ""It clearly is giving an indication that it has the capability of transmitting rapidly. That's the thing that's causing us now to be concerned,"" top infectious disease official Anthony Fauci told NBC. There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between the US and Australia, and tourists may be required to pay costs upfront if they can't show proof of insurance. According to Smart Traveller, medical care in the US can be expensive. ""A visit to a doctor for a minor issue can cost hundreds of dollars, not including tests or medication costs,"" the website says. There is no travel bubble for US citizens hoping to come to Australia. Only travellers with an approved visa will be able to enter Australia from December 15. Australians who are fully vaccinated no longer need to show a negative COVID-19 test result before departing for the UK, unless they're travelling from a ""red list"" country. But fully vaccinated travellers from Australia must still: Australians who are not fully vaccinated must comply with additional pre-departure testing requirements and complete 10 days quarantine at home or wherever they're staying on arrival. Travellers arriving from ""red list"" countries — which include southern African countries where Omicron has been detected — are required to undertake quarantine in a managed hotel. Travellers are in luck here: there are more airlines flying to the UK than many other countries. Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Etihad Airways, and Malaysia Airlines all have services from Australia. The Delta variant was detected in the UK earlier than many other countries, triggering a swift rise in COVID cases in May — but it also prompted an acceleration of its vaccination rollout, which was praised as ""world-leading"". But four months since Prime Minister Boris Johnson lifted just about all of England's COVID restrictions, the country is again logging weekly increases in case numbers, with more than 40,000 new cases a day and about a thousand deaths each week. Experts are now worried about hospitals' capacity to cope with a likely spike in cases in coming months, when colder weather is expected to fuel infections and protection from vaccines wanes. In response to the threat of Omicron, Johnson reinstated rules making face masks mandatory in shops and on public transport in England. Three cases of the variant have been detected in the UK. The continent is once again the epicentre of a pandemic, prompting new lockdowns and restrictions. Meanwhile, the death toll from COVID-19 across Europe is likely to hit two million people by March next year, the World Health Organisation said this week, with Regional Director for Europe Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge warning the region is facing a ""challenging winter"". COVID is now the number one cause of death across Europe, the agency said, with almost 4,200 new deaths a day — double the rate at the end of September. Despite calls for the government to reimpose some restrictions, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland remain mostly open. Shops, hotels, restaurants, museums, theme parks, theatres, nightclubs and other venues are able to operate as normal, though some enforce density limits, use of face masks and proof of vaccination status. In London, the hospitality sector is rebounding and it's not unusual to see packed pubs, restaurants and music venues across the city. Large crowds are back at tourist hotspots like Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge and Oxford Street, as the UK's borders are again open to most countries. Many locals are also returning to the office, so expect buses and trains to be quite busy — especially in rush hour. The government recommends face masks be worn in crowded places, including on public transport. Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement with the UK, which may cover some medical costs in the public health system. You'll need to ask for care as an NHS patient and be able to show your passport and Medicare card. But not everything is covered, so check before you go. Currently, only travellers who are exempt or have been granted an individual exemption can come to Australia — so long as they hold a valid visa. Exempt categories include Australian citizens, permanent residents and immediate family members of Australian citizens or permanent residents. From December 15, travel exemptions will no longer be imposed on fully vaccinated eligible visa holders including students, skilled workers, and those on humanitarian, working holiday and family visas, the government announced this week. No. Unlike some other countries in Asia which are cautiously reopening internal borders, China's borders remain tightly controlled under the country's strict ""COVID zero"" policy. China is adhering to its COVID-zero policy and that could leave many Chinese Australians who are eager to go back facing a tough choice. Travellers with valid Chinese residence permits for work, personal matters and reunion may be able to enter China without applying for new visas, but multiple testing requirements are in place and hotel quarantine on arrival is mandatory — and arduous. In some Chinese cities, travellers face a month-long quarantine during which they're tested seven times and only allowed to open their hotel room doors to accept food deliveries. There are currently no plans to tighten border restrictions in response to Omicron. Direct flights between China and Australia are limited, and China has suspended all visas on arrival, including transit visas. Nearly two years after the coronavirus emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, China is enforcing a ""zero COVID"" strategy of widespread lockdowns and testing in a bid to contain outbreaks in more than a dozen provinces. Though many of its neighbours in the Asia-Pacific have abandoned COVID elimination strategies, China's borders have mostly remained shut to stop the virus from being imported with overseas travellers ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February. And if its low COVID death rate — 62 times better than Australia's — is accurate, the policy could be seen as a success. Official figures suggest China may have become a global leader in keeping COVID-19 patients alive. But can the numbers be believed? Until recently, life in China has mostly continued this year ""as normal"" — full restaurants, open shops and theatres, domestic travel — because of the country's efforts to control the spread of the virus. Authorities take swift and drastic action to contain outbreaks when they emerge, sometimes sending hundreds of COVID cases and contacts into quarantine and carrying out mass testing. While many Chinese are supportive of the approach, others — including some in Australia — say they've suffered from not being able to travel freely to visit relatives and friends. And it's unclear how long the COVID-zero policy will be maintained. Though 80 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated, questions have been raised about the efficacy of its locally produced vaccines, which could create problems when the country opens up. ""There is a view that China's COVID-zero policy is likely to continue to the end of the Winter Olympics,"" La Trobe University Professor Chaojie Liu said last month. ""It's difficult for any country or government to really abandon the elimination strategy because people have got used to living in that kind of environment."" Australia does not have a reciprocal healthcare agreement with China, which means that if you need medical assistance, travellers or their insurer must pay the full cost of treatment. Again, flights between China and Australia are currently limited. Only travellers who are exempt or have been granted an individual exemption can come to Australia — so long as they hold a valid visa. Exempt categories include Australian citizens, permanent residents and immediate family members of Australian citizens or permanent residents. At this stage, from December 15, travel exemptions will no longer be imposed on fully vaccinated eligible visa holders. Thailand has approved tourists from 63 countries for quarantine-free travel from November 1 — and Australia is on the list. To be eligible visitors must be double-vaxxed and show two negative COVID-19 tests: one PCR test taken before departure and one rapid-antigen test taken on arrival. Australian passport holders do not need a visa to travel to Thailand but must now apply for a Thailand Pass. Travellers from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe will be banned from December. Qantas Airways and Thai Airways are due to resume flights to Thailand from this month with other airlines, including Jetstar, to begin flights from next year. After an August peak of more than 20,000 cases a day in Thailand, daily infection rates have fallen to just under 6,000 cases per day. But with under 50 per cent of the population vaccinated, the situation remains precarious. As Thailand allows its first visitors in 18 months to skip hotel quarantine, Bangkok-based Australians are looking to take advantage of the relaxing of restrictions and opening of borders to be reunited with loved ones. COVID restrictions are in place in high-risk provinces around the country, including curfews, limits on visitor numbers at some sites and mask mandates. No. Travellers must prove that they have insurance with COVID-19 cover to $50,000. There is no travel bubble with Thailand yet, so Thai nationals have similar conditions to others, with the exemption process removed for Australia visa holders from December 15. If you have been dreaming of a ski trip or a holiday slurping ramen in Tokyo, then you'll have to dream some more. On Monday it was announced Japan would close its borders to all foreign travellers in response to the Omicron variant, with authorities describing the step as an ""emergency precaution"". There is some hope group tourism may return in time for cherry blossom season in March 2022 — Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told The Japan Times that while sightseers are not currently accepted, tourism groups may be able to return once the practicality of monitoring their movements is worked out. Japan's ANA — which kept flying throughout the pandemic – is operating between Australia and Japan and so is Japan Airlines. Qantas is due to begin flights to Japan shortly. Singapore Airlines is also flying from Sydney to Tokyo via Singapore. Flights are limited to 100 passengers and keep in mind that if you are approved for travel, you will not be able to use public transport on arrival and must arrange a private car service to your accommodation. With COVID affecting flight schedules at short notice, it's possible travellers may be faced with cancelled flights and an expiring visa. Extensions must be made in person at an immigration Services Agency. After a huge spike in COVID cases over the Japanese summer – peaking at more than 24,000 cases per day – national infection rates have now fallen to their lowest point since June 2020 with cases jumping around from about 40 to 150 a day over the past week. Japan experiences a sharp decline in coronavirus cases after the Olympic host country suffers its most severe outbreak of the pandemic. In Tokyo figures have dropped to the lowest numbers since May last year. Just over 75 per cent of Japan's population is now vaccinated. No cases of the Omicron variant have been reported. No. Australians in Japan are liable for medical and associated costs and must hold travel or health insurance. Australians who live in Japan for more than three months can register for Japan's national health insurance scheme. Everything was due to change on December 1 with vaccinated tourists and visa holders from Japan and South Korea welcomed back to Australia for quarantine-free travel. But with the emergence of the Omicron variant, the federal government has delayed the easing until December 15. India closed its borders to foreign tourists in March 2020 but has now tentatively reopened, with tourists welcomed back from November 15. New guidelines issued over the weekend require arrivals from at-risk countries to undergo a PCR test on arrival. If the result is negative, travellers will be required to quarantine at home for a week and take a second test on the eighth day. The list of at-risk countries includes parts of Europe, the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel. Other tourists must upload a declaration to the Air Suvidha Portal and show proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. If you are fully vaccinated then there is no requirement to quarantine. If not, self-isolation is required for two weeks. Qantas will resume three flights a week to Delhi via Darwin on December 6 with plans to offer a daily connection from next year. Air India has also resumed flights between Australia and India following a pandemic pause. India is one of the countries worst affected by COVID-19, with more than 34 million infections and more than 500,000 registered deaths. Indian authorities are prepare to celebrate the milestone by holding music events and lighting up national monuments, but only 30 per cent of the country's eligible population is fully vaccinated. But after a peak of more than 400,000 cases a day in May, India is now recording just under 10,000 daily infections. There are signs a new COVID-19 wave may be beginning and travellers are urged to undertake extreme caution. Australia does not have a healthcare agreement with India. Insurance is required for travel here, but tourists should be aware that if another COVID wave takes off the hospital system may be unable to cope with the influx of patients —  whether you hold health insurance or not. At this stage, from December 15 vaccinated Indian visa holders are allowed to travel. Yes, fully vaccinated Australian travellers have been able to enter Singapore without quarantining since November 8 — as long as they return a negative COVID-19 test. Many Australians are rightly looking forward to a carefree summer. However, experts warn Singapore's current COVID-19 surge may be a prime example of how Australia could struggle to remain virus-free for very long. Travellers are required to take a PCR within 48 hours prior to departure, and a second test on arrival at Changi airport. They then must self-isolate until they return a negative result. Like many other countries, Singapore has moved to restrict travel for people who have visited seven African countries in the past 14 days. Qantas is flying direct to Singapore from Melbourne and Sydney, while Jetstar will commence Darwin and Melbourne routes to Singapore from mid-December. Singapore Airlines is also operating daily direct flights from Sydney and Melbourne. Scoot, Singapore Airlines' budget subsidiary, will also run a daily Melbourne-Singapore flight and four weekly Sydney-Singapore routes. After a long period of suppression, COVID-19 cases are on the rise. Last month, case numbers peaked at more than 5,000 a day before dropping down to under 2,000 a day last week. Authorities say they are tracking the Omicron variant very closely and have warned they may be forced to scale back opening up plans. ""We are not sure yet, but we may well be forced to take a few steps back, before we can take more steps forward,"" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong reportedly told Channel News Asia on Sunday. ""But despite all this, I am confident that we will find our way to living with the virus, and safely resume all the things we love to do."" Earlier this month, the country made headlines when they announced unvaccinated COVID-19 patients would have to pay their own medical bills from December 8 amid the growing outbreak. Previously the Ministry of Health said they had covered the COVID-19 health care costs of all Singaporeans, permanent residents, and long-term pass holders. There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between Australia and Singapore. While the standard of health care is on par with Australia, Smart Traveller warns the ""cost of medical services is much higher"" and many providers will want upfront payments or proof of insurance before treatment. Fully vaccinated Singaporeans are free to travel to NSW and Victoria without quarantining, following the federal government's announcement of a travel bubble earlier this month. Travellers will need to return a negative test result within 72 hours of boarding the plane. ""This is another significant milestone in our step by step approach to safely reopening to the world that we outlined in the National Plan,"" Morrison said announcing the arrangement. Yes, from December 1, fully vaccinated Australians can skip quarantine when they arrive in Fiji. You must present evidence of a negative PCR test taken 72 hours before departure and take a rapid antigen test during your first 48 hours in Fiji. You'll also need travel insurance with international coverage for COVID-19. Restrictions for travellers arriving from ""red-list"" countries have been stepped up in response to Omicron, with people arriving from those countries required to quarantine on arrival for 14 days. “We’re monitoring the Omicron variant closely as it has been shown to carry significant mutations that could spell higher rates of transmissibility and virulence,"" Permanent Secretary for Health and Medical Services James Fong said. Domestic quarantine may still be required for travel to some islands in Fiji with low vaccination coverage. The first Fiji Airways commercial flight from Australia to Fiji since March 2020 leaves Sydney on December 1. The airline will have 14 flights a week from Sydney and daily flights from Melbourne and Brisbane. Qantas flights from Sydney are due to restart in December. After hitting a peak of more than 1,000 cases a day during July and August, the COVID situation has stabilised in the country with just a handful of cases most days. Around 700 Fijians have died from the virus. With Fiji welcoming tourists from a select number of countries, including Australia, the US and New Zealand from November 11, Sydney mother Lisa Thwaite wasted no time in booking an international family vacation, instead of risking interstate border closures with a domestic holiday. The vaccination rate has picked up with nearly 70 per cent of the population double dosed. Mask wearing is still mandatory in all indoor public venues, on public transport and in crowded settings like markets and shopping malls. The country has prioritised getting ready for tourists to come back and is one of the first to throw open its borders. ""Fiji is a pioneer of COVID-safe international travel; our entire working population is on track to be fully vaccinated by November,"" Fiji Airways Managing Director and CEO Andre Viljoen said. There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between Australia and Fiji. Smart Traveller says medical care standards in Fiji aren't as high as in Australia, and that in emergencies evacuation to Australia may be required, which can be very expensive. Visits to Australia for tourism aren't allowed yet, but eligible fully vaccinated visa holders may enter from December 15 at this stage.

419,"International students are finally heading home for Christmas, but some worry about Queensland's borders",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  When international students arrived in Australia for the 2020 school year, our borders were closing to the world. International boarding students are flying home for Christmas They haven't seen their families in up to two years Some will remain in Queensland due to concerns about border restrictions While some returned home, many stayed in Queensland boarding schools, remaining there ever since. ""Unfortunately, we did not get to go back to our home for the last two years,"" year 11 student John Chiu said. John is one of three students from Hong Kong who have made a home away from home at the Cathedral School in Townsville. For the past two years, Jason Kong has been fixated on the news cycle, waiting for travel restrictions to ease. ""I was checking the news every day, because my parents want to me to go back to Hong Kong,"" he said. Jason and John won't be flying home for Christmas due to concerns about getting back into Queensland. Cathedral School principal Ian Gamack said many international boarding students were not willing to take the risk this year. ""They're worried if they go home, they won't be able to come back,"" he said. ""While their parents are missing them, they are very happy that they're here in a safe place and they're being looked after by the school."" Most international students have been able to visit the same home stay families in Queensland during term breaks. Returning to the same family during the holidays meant that John Chiu got to see more of Australia than he originally bargained for. ""I'm very lucky that I always go back to the same family, and they treat me as part of their family as well,"" John said. ""It was really nice, and they just taught me how to travel everywhere in Queensland. ""I went up to Cairns and I went to Airlie Beach and lots of places."" With his high school studies behind him, Nigel Wong is booked on a flight back home to Hong Kong. He was able to get a taste of life on the land during his time in Australia. ""I've been very lucky to spend my time out west in Winton, where I've learned the outback kind of lifestyle,"" he said. ""I've been blessed to have the support of a family there and they have been like a second family to me. ""It's been a fun journey."" In Brisbane, Alexis Wong was packed and ready to return to Papua New Guinea as soon as her term had finished. The year 9 student will be reuniting with her family for the first time since the beginning of the year. ""We'll go to the islands, and we'll see dolphins, and they will just follow us around the boats,"" she said. ""And jet skiing — jet skiing is fun."" Meanwhile, her roommate Ollie Chappell says she will keep herself busy baking while she waits to fly home to Singapore next month. Ollie said the school year had been difficult without family support. ""It has been quite hard especially when your schoolwork gets harder and you are having trouble,"" she said. ""You can't get a hug from them."" Somerville House director of boarding Frances Greene said students who weren't Australian citizens were particularly concerned about getting back into the country. She said many were opting to stay in Australia until the situation becomes clearer. ""In some ways that has made things even more difficult for parents who began to feel a glimmer of hope that they would get their daughters home for Christmas,"" she said.

420,Kim Jong Un may have pulled off an astounding COVID-19 feat. But there's a looming threat to his power,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The tension on the Korean peninsula has always been most palpable at the strip of land where these two nations meet: The heavily guarded Demilitarised Zone (DMZ). Before the pandemic, North and South Korean forces would stand face-to-face here, armed adversaries refusing to give an inch. But coronavirus has seen soldiers from one side of the conflict take a few steps back into their territory. ""The [North Korean] soldiers still work there, but they don't come out of their buildings,"" said Vice Admiral Stuart Mayer, an Australian who is second in charge of the United Nation's Command which controls the area. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic ""If they do on the rare occasions that they must, they work in chemical protective suits and they wear gas masks."" The North Korean side of the border is unkempt, as the maintenance crews won't risk coming into close contact with the south. What is really happening beyond the border is always a mystery. ""North Korea constantly surprises. It's called the hermit kingdom for very good reason,"" said Vice Admiral Mayer. But it's clear to everyone that North Korea cannot risk an outbreak of COVID-19. ""North Korea's COVID measures are extremely strict, beyond anything that we experience in democracies,"" he said. While the North has claimed to be COVID-free for the duration of the pandemic, the past 18 months has taught us that this virus will always find a way. And recent events south of the border could have major implications for North Korea and its enigmatic ruler. South Korea has recently started easing its restrictions, pivoting to a new policy of learning to live with the virus. But since then, the situation has rapidly deteriorated. The latest surge in South Korean cases has once again been triggered by a controversial sect. This time, a cluster of infections spread from a little-known religious settlement led by a pastor who pokes his followers in the eyes to heal them. South Korea is now averaging about 4,000 cases a day. More worrying is the acute spike in serious cases. Despite nearly 80 per cent of South Koreans being fully vaccinated, almost two-thirds of ICU beds across the nation are full. If the virus creeps over the border into North Korea, the country is unlikely to cope. With a decrepit medical system, it slammed its borders shut to the world in early 2020. While experts are sceptical of the regime's claim that they have since been virus-free, Rachel Minyoung Lee from the Stimson Centre said there are clues the situation is under control — for now. ""They continue to have large-scale gatherings, which tells me that the regime feels comfortable and confident about managing the situation,"" the North Korea watcher said. But by keeping out the virus, they have also kept out vital supplies of fuel, which is necessary for food production. ""Definitely, the food situation is difficult. Kim Jong Un mentioned that directly,"" she said. A reported exodus of the remaining foreign diplomats still in North Korea suggests the nation is continuing with its elimination strategy. Ms Lee said that suggests the ""COVID lockdown will be in place for a while longer"". ""That's why they're leaving. They don't know when the situation is going to end,"" she said. North Korea has so far knocked back potential shipments of vaccine from the UN-backed COVAX facility and there are no signs it has struck a deal with its two most important partners, China and Russia. ""They maybe have trust issues with the Chinese vaccine and perhaps even the Russia vaccine,"" Ms Lee said. ""I think the other issue too, is whether it can get enough doses for the entire population."" While no-one knows for sure, intelligence suggests even Kim Jong Un himself may still be unvaccinated. Coronavirus has presented opportunities and potential threats to Kim Jong Un's power. Experts say the North Korean ruler has long believed his country is too reliant on its neighbour China. With their shared border closed, he has been able to push a campaign of self-reliance. ""He's a smart man and he realises that it's not a sustainable model to be overly reliant on one country,"" Ms Lee said. His recent dramatic weight loss led some analysts to wonder if he was in ill health. But Ms Less suspects he is trying to consolidate his power and stave off concerns about his longevity. ""I think that was due to some strict diet regimen,"" said Ms Lee. “He's now on the same footing as [his grandfather] Kim Il Sung and [father] Kim Jong Il."" But other analysts aren't so certain Kim Jong Un is doing enough to maintain his grip on power. ""There have been rumours Kim Jong Un's leadership could be re-evaluated in the next two years,"" said national security analyst Yun Ji-won from Sangmyung University. She said there are even whispers of a potential coup by his little sister, Kim Yo Jong. ""It's far-fetched,"" Ms Yun said. ""But the fact the rumours even exist might indicate he could potentially face a problem.""

421,Western Australia tightens border with South Australia after new COVID cases,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Western Australia will force all arrivals from South Australia to isolate for 14 days under tightened border rules. The new rules will classify South Australia as a ""low-risk"" jurisdiction. People will still be able to travel to WA from South Australia without an exemption, but will have to self-isolate for 14 days. The tightened rules come after South Australia opened its borders to other states, with several confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in the community since then. WA Premier Mark McGowan said the decision was linked to concerns about the new Omicron variant, the spread of which has sparked alarm across the globe. The new variant has been officially deemed a variant of concern by the World Health Organization, prompting Australia to close the border to nine African countries. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic ""There is a great deal of uncertainty about the recently emerged Omicron variant so it is important Western Australia has strong protections in place for states which have relaxed their international borders,"" Mr McGowan said. ""The new variant emerged in southern Africa and is now understood to have been detected in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. ""With little known about the variant, it is important we act with an abundance of caution in dealing with potential spread into WA from overseas travellers arriving in other states."" The emergence of a new COVID-19 variant has scientists, health officials and the public concerned, and the World Health Organization monitoring the situation closely. No cases of the new variant have been detected in Australia. The new rules mean travel from South Australia into WA is set to be heavily restricted over the festive period. People who were due to travel from South Australia to WA in the coming days have been told their existing approval to enter the state has been cancelled. After enjoying months without a single case of local transmission, SA opened up to COVID-19 on Tuesday and the cases have started popping up. ""As of 1:15pm Saturday 27 November 2021, SA will be classified as a low-risk jurisdiction,"" a text message to those people from WA Police stated. ""If you entered Western Australia after 1:15pm on Saturday 27/11/21 and have been in SA since 12:01am Tuesday 23/11/21 you will be required to self-quarantine at a suitable premises for 14 days after you were last in the SA. ""You will also be required to present for COVID-19 testing within 48 hours of your arrival and on Day 12 after you were last in SA. ""Your existing G2G Pass will be rejected. You will be required to submit a new G2G Pass application."" The changes mean WA is only allowing quarantine-free travel from Tasmania and Queensland, with restrictions in place for arrivals from New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and now South Australia. But Mr McGowan did not hesitate to highlight how quickly those arrangements could change. ""South Australia and shortly Queensland and Tasmania are going to open their borders,"" he said. ""We've put in place measures with South Australia, if we have to with Queensland and Tasmania, we'll do the same."" The Northern Territory has also recently reintroduced testing requirements for those entering from South Australia.

422,Unaccompanied visits to Cape York's tip could end after repeated vandalism of the significant site,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Visitors disrespecting Pajinka with vandalism, defecation, nudity leaves traditional owners of the Tip hurting Visitors to the northernmost point of the Australian mainland may soon need to be accompanied by a ranger to the site after increasing graffiti and vandalism attacks has caused upset among some of the Tip's traditional owners. Pajinka, the tip of Cape York, is an iconic location and a bucket-list destination for many but the effect of growing visitor numbers, vandalism, and reports of human defecation and nudity at the site has left a group of traditional owners close to closing it to tourism. Gudang Yadhaykenu Aboriginal Corporation chair Michael Solomon said the actions of a few is ""disrespecting the traditional owners, even our ancestors. It makes us very upset. It hurts us, makes us sad. ""I mentioned to close the Tip to tourism because of graffiti and toilet mess in the scrub, but mainly the memorial plaque."" Corporation director Nicholas Thompson Wymarra said there was evidence visitors had destroyed rock formations, an act he believed amounted to ""sabotage"". ""When we walk on our country, we know where all plants and trees, rocks and stones are,"" Mr Wymarra said. ""For me to go up to the tip, to Pajinka, and to see the actual rock slates missing and the big rock slates that have been knocked off or kicked off, it's not on. ""That's taking a part of our cultural heritage away from us."" Piles of loose or dislodged rocks have been built, while trees have been etched with deep carvings of visitors' names and initials. For Mr Thompson-Wymarra's son, Jarrah, nudity is another growing problem. ""My younger sister seeing two naked people in a pond … yeah it's a bit disheartening,"" Jarrah Thompson-Wymarra said. ""They were shocked … they did not expect that because Pajinka isn't the place where you can come and do that."" Tourist Shayden Sievers made the trip to Pajinka earlier this year and was surprised by how popular the route had become. ""Pretty well most of the signs from Lakefield up, there's graffiti, there's stickers, there's even signs run over and shot at,"" Mr Sievers said. ""On the beach next to the tip itself, there's people that have done doughnuts and burnouts and all the rest."" The road to Pajinka is four-wheel-drive-access only, prone to corrugation and flooding at certain times of the year. The medical director of primary health care at Bamaga Hospital, Dr Inika Weaver, said this year there were more presentations from car accidents at the Tip. ""Here on the tip of Cape York, we're limited in what resources we have in our hospital. We have a limited number of X-rays that we can do here,"" Dr Weaver said. Reaching the tip itself has its own hazards. It requires walking across sand flats and, if the trip is not timed well, the incoming tide could leave visitors stranded. The area's resident crocodiles and snakes also provided an added danger. ""For them to do one wrong thing or take the wrong track or wear the wrong footwear, they could very badly hurt themselves,"" Mr Wymarra said. Gudang Yadhaykenu rangers and a security company have been tasked with protecting the site. ""We wanna fix that up so their children follow their footprints up to the tip,"" Mr Solomon said. ""Make everything balance across for our generation and their generation, for future tourists."" From next year, the corporation — which took over management in 2019 — intend to charge a fee for visitors, who must walk to the tip with a ranger. While Pajinka comes under the jurisdiction of the Torres Shire Council, Mayor Vonda Malone says the 13 councils in the Northern Peninsula area will work together to protect the site. ""It's been highlighted over the years most definitely,"" Mr Malone said. ""This is a very complex area where it verges on a number of parties to look at how we can best provide resources to manage the area better because it is of importance for the whole nation, not just within our area of Torres Shire and Northern Peninsula area."" Cameron Costello, the deputy chair of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council and Quandamooka Traditional Owner, said tourists generally accept fees when provided with quality eco-cultural tourism and educational experiences in return. ""There are people who will always think that they shouldn't have to pay,"" Mr Costello said. He points to Uluru and his own Quandamooka Country [covering Moreton and Stradbroke Islands] as exemplary models. ""What this does is actually empower First Nations people to tell their stories and talk about country and explain the connectedness and it helps to educate people,"" Mr Costello said. ""It's actually providing a really richer, in-depth layer to our tourism in Queensland which is being embraced by the industry."" Mr Costello said the 2032 Olympics provided an opportunity for Indigenous tourism. ""As the year of Indigenous tourism comes to a close, we should start embarking on the 10 years of investment in Indigenous tourism, so that when the eyes of the world are upon us in 2032, we are the premier state in Australia and a global hotspot for culturally appropriate tourism,"" he said. Travellers such as Katie Brown from the Gold Coast, who has been home-schooling her three sons on the road said she was willing to pay for a special experience. ""Places that show you or can teach you or educate you about the area, a lot of the things that you wouldn't know,"" Ms Brown said. ""They are fantastic and so good for education for the children as well, to learn to respect and understand the culture behind the place.""

423,SA opened its borders to COVID-19 this week. Here's what we've learned,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  South Australia this week went where no other state — possibly no other jurisdiction — has gone before. After enjoying months without a single case of local transmission, the state opened last Tuesday and allowed the virus into the community, with its vaccination rate sitting just shy of 80 per cent. By comparison, Sydney celebrated its ""Freedom Day"" when 73 per cent of its population over 16 had received two jabs, while England opened in July with its double-dose vaccination rate at 68 per cent. South Australian authorities are hoping they will be able to minimise the health impact from borders re-opening, but also want to teach the state how to live with COVID-19. Almost a week into that plan, here is what we have learned so far. There were jubilant scenes at Adelaide Airport on Tuesday, as families and friends separated by border closures reunited. Road travellers – either fully vaccinated, or with an exemption in hand — spilled into SA at midnight, desperate to spend time with loved ones. Then, as if on cue, South Australia recorded its first new case 24 hours later. A girl from Victoria, who was too young to be vaccinated, had travelled into the state to visit relatives. She received a positive result after undergoing testing at Tailem Bend and returned to Victoria to isolate – leaving her grandparents in quarantine here for seven days, too. Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier immediately declared the case a ""wake-up call"". Several more cases from interstate travellers have since been recorded – 10 in total as of this afternoon. That is still a significant number for a state that is used to zero. Though fully vaccinated travellers from across the country are now free to enter South Australia, this week has shown us that mandatory quarantine remains a necessary, albeit inconvenient, measure for now. According to current directions, fully vaccinated close contacts of positive cases in SA need to quarantine for seven days, while unvaccinated close contacts must quarantine for 14 days. The direction captured all passengers aboard a Qantas flight deemed close contacts, and several rows of passengers who had travelled on two other flights. Presumably, some of those travellers had been looking forward to reunions of their own. Anyone who bought a donut at the airport Wednesday mid-morning was also told to immediately get tested and isolate until they received a negative test result. It seems a trip into South Australia could still cost a traveller at least seven days in quarantine, while picking up a sweet snack could land you in isolation for at least a day or two. It is a stark reminder to those looking to come into South Australia in the lead up to Christmas, that ""open borders"" won't necessarily mean worry-free travel. SA Health is still listing exposure sites according to risk. But this time around, businesses impacted by positive cases won't have to close for deep cleaning, unless otherwise advised by SA Health. That does not mean business owners and their staff will not have a lot to work through now that borders are open. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Business owners are grappling with how to manage potential exposure to the virus, and planning for the event that multiple staff may need to quarantine for up to 14 days if they are not vaccinated. The state government has mandated vaccines for some industries, including health services, police, education, and taxi and rideshare services. But Premier Steven Marshall has ruled out introducing a blanket approach – meaning it will be up to individual businesses as to whether they impose vaccine mandates for staff and customers. While those in New South Wales, the ACT and Victoria are well accustomed to daily case numbers in the hundreds or thousands, Western Australia is holding off throwing its borders open until it hits its 90 per cent double-dose rate. South Australia has acted as a buffer for WA throughout the pandemic, sometimes shielding the state from truck drivers and other travellers carrying the virus. But WA Premier Mark McGowan has warned his state will reintroduce border restrictions with South Australia, should WA health authorities recommend it. On Friday, Mr McGowan said while South Australia chose to open its border before reaching an 80 per cent double vaccination rate, WA would remain ""far more careful"" and ""cautious"". At the same time, the Northern Territory reintroduced testing requirements for those entering from South Australia. South Australia's reopening has been joyous news for many, but some governments remain wary. Modelling released in early November presented several scenarios. The ""best case"" scenario suggests there's a 27 per cent chance of an outbreak within 300 days of borders opening. That scenario estimates several thousand cases and 13 deaths. So will the modelling, and cases of community transmission, spur on more South Australians to get vaccinated, setting the state up for its long-term recovery? Exactly a week before the border was due to open, 13,935 jabs were administered, compared with 15,612 on Tuesday – a difference of 1,677. The Premier and Chief Public Health Officer have both predicted more people in the vaccine-hesitant camp will get their jabs once cases pop up in the community. With Christmas and the ""Mad March"" festival season fast approaching – along with a federal and state election — any outbreak will have wide implications for the South Australian public and its leaders. No one can predict exactly how it will all play out. The strongest advice remains to simply to get vaccinated, and fast.

425,'An incredibly valuable market': But are tourism operators missing disability dollars?,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Could tourism operators be more profitable by better serving the disability sector? People with disability make up a good proportion of the national tourism spend, but just how well are we serving this sector of the market? There is a sizeable, growing, and diverse range of travellers with disability, and their needs are not that unusual. Think: getting on and off a tour bus, finding a toilet to fit a mobility aid through the door, and seeing the sights alongside your friends and family. Unfortunately, this was not always possible and was a growing sense of frustration to the estimated 20 per cent of Australian adults that have a disability. Data from Tourism Research Australia showed about three-quarters of people with a disability travel, with more people stating they would like to do so if the products or technologies existed to support their travel. Melissa James is the CEO and Founder of Inclusive Tourism, and a qualified access consultant, specialising in the accessible tourism space. ""It's an incredibly valuable market, it makes up about 11 per cent of domestic tourism spent. So that's huge, up around $8 billion a year is what this market is worth,"" she said. Ms James said the tourism sector is missing out by not catering to a diverse range of travellers. ""Most people don't travel alone, they travel with a group, so you have a multiplying factor that goes on there,"" she said. ""If we think about something as simple as you've got a cafe and a group of people want to come in into your cafe and have a coffee. Now, if one of those people uses a wheelchair, or a walking frame or a walking stick, and they have to go up steps to get into your cafe, they're not going to go there. ""So, you're not just losing that one person, you're losing the entire group."" Elyce Tunbridge started her tour business in regional WA just as COVID hit. She said she quickly learned how minor adaptations opened a whole new market with about 10 per cent of those who have used her service requiring additional supports. ""I just saw this huge gap in the market and am looking to increase accessibility for people to get to these places,"" Ms Tunbridge said. She has been exploring ways to improve her ability to cater to more tourists. ""I've tried to be as accommodating as I can with what I've got, and already, I've had people who have come on my tours who are legally blind, who use frames, people with walking sticks, all sorts of different disabilities, but we've accommodated them as best we can."" Ms Tunbridge said the experience had made her look at things differently. ""By looking through the lens of these people who do have different needs, it's highlighted some areas where I can grow my business and have room to improve,"" she said. ""It's also highlighted the flexibility, the way that we can all accommodate people with different needs and give them an equal experience. ""I'm just excited to share more of it with more people.""

426,Coastal town welcomes return of cruise ships amid bumper regional tourism year,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tumby Bay welcomes return of cruise ships amid bumper regional tourism year The first cruise ship of the 2021/22 South Australian cruise season has been welcomed by businesses at Tumby Bay, on Eyre Peninsula. The Coral Expeditions 'Coral Adventurer', with 72 passengers onboard, arrived this morning and is the first cruise ship to visit the region since February this year. The South Australian Tourism Commission says the ship is one of three expedition vessels to visit the state this summer. It estimates cruises will bring a $5 million boost to the state's economy. The cruise companies have SA Health-approved SailSafe Plans. They operate with a capacity limit of 99 passengers per voyage, drawn from the domestic market, and all passengers and crew have to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. SATC chief executive Rodney Harrex said the cruises brought benefits to regional communities. He said the companies were boosting regional economies and rebuilding confidence in the cruise industry. Coral Expeditions commercial director Jeff Gillies said the COVID pandemic had provided Australians with an opportunity to explore the nation's coastal wilderness and support local businesses. ""We use around 50 local suppliers across South Australia,"" he said. Nicole Challinger from Tumby Bay Bakery said the arrival of the cruise ship had been great for the town, with tourists pre-ordering coffees, cakes and take-away food. ""They all checked in and were social distancing and the boat does regular COVID checks — before they got on, and every three days onboard,"" Ms Challinger said. ""Some of them said they'll be back with their caravans after having a half-day look around, so it was great promotion."" Tumby Bay Hotel's Bradley Harkness said the cruise ship was the talk of the front bar with people happy it was bringing visitors to town. Mayor Sam Telfer said the majority of people were satisfied with the health measures and the ongoing benefits for Tumby Bay of hosting tourists from the cruise ships. ""Many of them expressed intentions of coming back,"" Mr Telfer said. Mr Harrex said the regions has benefited from tourism over the past year. ""What we've been seeing in the last month in terms of South Australia, we're seeing record levels of regional hotel accommodation,"" he said. ""We've had seven consecutive months of the highest level of regional occupancy on record.""

427,Recent rains bring dormant outback waterfalls to life ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Watarrka/Kings Canyon National Park, 300 kilometres south-west of Alice Springs, has been transformed into a watery wonderland thanks to a very wet start to November. The Bureau of Meteorology has recorded 218.2 millimetres in Alice Springs, making November one of the wettest on record. Reg Ramsden has been a tour operator in the region for 30 years and said the region has had sporadic rain over the past three weeks. ""It's been amazing. It's like a big cleansing. Everything is starting to green up,"" he said. ""It's been a while since we've seen a major flow like that and you have to be lucky to see it — you've got to be in the right spot at the right time."" Mr Ramsden said thanks to COVID-19 there were very few tourists to witness the waterfalls. ""It's unique to see it as it doesn't happen all the time,"" he said. ""People should get out here. People from Alice Springs should get out to the Western Macdonnell [Ranges] and check out those waterholes as they've all flowed majorly."" Mr Ramsden specialised in school group tours and his business has been badly affected by the global pandemic and subsequent border closures. ""It is sad that we haven't got the tourism out here. We are coming into a traditionally quiet period,"" he said. Mr Ramsden said the Northern Territory government attempt to support the industry in the form of tourism vouchers for residents was not fair. ""It's useless to my business,"" he said.

428,Phil witnessed Australia's Chinese tourism boom. But now that's over and many like him have moved on,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Perth tour guide Phil Dong was still showing his Chinese guests the beauty of the city on March 19 last year. What came next caught him off guard. The day after, Australia shut its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents in response to the worsening COVID-19 situation. ""I never thought that was the last time I saw tourists from China,"" the 39-year-old Chinese migrant, who emigrated to Australia two decades ago, told the ABC. ""I was aware of what was going on in the east coast but didn't expect COVID could get worse so quickly."" Mr Dong, who joined the tourism industry in 2017, said big-spending Chinese tourists were driving Australia's tourism boom for years. ""There was a 30 per cent increase in our business every year,"" he said, adding that he used to host more than 50 week-long tour groups from China each year. ""In those years, I was working almost every day, non-stop … if there wasn't a pandemic, 2020 would only get better."" Tourism was Australia's fifth most valuable export pre-pandemic, according to a latest report from the Australian Trade and Investment Commission. And China was Australia's largest inbound tourist market for both arrivals and spending. There were more than 1.4 million visitors from China pre-pandemic, contributing a combined total of $12 billion to the Australian economy. But the steady flow of Chinese tourists was quickly turned off due to border closures. While Australian borders remain shut to China, lengthy quarantine rules for returning travellers in China and visa restrictions have put off many holiday-makers. The Chinese government is keeping the international aviation capacity at just 2 per cent of pre-pandemic levels and is advising its citizens not to travel overseas, as it sticks to zero tolerance for COVID-19. A tourism expert warns Chinese travellers are unlikely to return to Australia in the same numbers as before the pandemic unless diplomatic relations between the two countries improve. This week, a new report on China's outbound tourism by China Tourism Academy, part of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, shows a majority of Chinese citizens (83 per cent) would only travel to countries with zero new COVID cases and 82 per cent of them said they choose to travel domestically rather than overseas in the near future. In the survey, 72 per cent of the Chinese people said they were unwilling to catch a flight due to safety concerns. The report also says there is ""great uncertainty"" for 2022 and outbound tourism is largely hinged on the containment of the pandemic, despite a 25 per cent jump in Chinese outbound tourism numbers this year. Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan currently account for over 80 per cent of the total outbound numbers while Oceania had the biggest decrease in 2021. That leaves a dire prospect for the Australian economy and businesses relying on Chinese visitors, including those in the Yarra Valley, Melbourne's north-east. ""We look after tourists from all over the world, and most of them are from China,"" Della Zhang, China market manager from Rochford Wines, told the ABC. ""They used to occupy our two 300-seat restaurants almost every day. ""After COVID, because borders were closed, our international visitation went down to zero."" She said although the return of Chinese international students from next month would bring some relief to the business, she wants to see the Australian borders reopen to China completely. ""Chinese tourists are quite important to our business,"" she said. ""The feedback so far was [China's tourism operators] can't wait for our borders to open, so they can start promoting to their customers. ""For someone who's never visited Australia, they would have a little bit of safety concern. If we can keep the communication open, keep promoting Australia as a safe and enjoyable destination, that will help a lot."" The Australian government have recently relaxed tight travel restrictions, by allowing fully vaccinated tourists from Singapore, Japan and South Korea to enter Australia quarantine free. But still, there isn't a timeline when tourists from China can return. Tourism Minister Dan Tehan said the reopening of the borders to vaccinated travellers would adhere to the National Plan to safely reopen to the world. ""We look forward to welcoming back tourists from across the world, when the medical advice says it is safe to do so, including from China,"" he told the ABC. ""Australia is one of the safest destinations in the world with an abundance of unrivalled natural attractions and the highest quality food and wine, so we will continue to be a destination of choice."" Mr Tehan said Australia has been maintaining its market presence in China by engaging with Chinese consumers through traditional marketing channels as well as on social media. ""Tourism Australia's trade marketing efforts includes hosting this year's Australian Tourism Exchange with a live event held in Suzhou, China, where more than 200 travel buyers in the market met online with Australian tourism product suppliers,"" he said. ""Meanwhile the Aussie Specialist Program is continuing to train frontline travel sellers across China so they can expand their knowledge of Australian products, destinations and people."" There are concerns that even when international travellers return at a large scale, the industry may not be ready for them immediately as prolonged border closures have forced specialist tourism operators like Mr Dong to quit the industry and to look for jobs elsewhere. He said it's a common trend for many Chinese-speaking operators in the sector and many of his fellow tour guides have moved on. Now Mr Dong works in construction and said although he has fond memories of touring Chinese visitors, he's not planning to go back to his old job in the foreseeable future. ""I'm happy with my current job, it's better pay and I don't have to work on the weekend anymore,"" he said. ""I can spend more time with my family now."" The ABC has spoken to several veteran Chinese Australian tour guides, bus drivers and travel agents across the states, some of them have become Uber drivers or real estate agents, others have retired. ""We're not really well equipped to cater for the return of the tourists at the moment,"" said Simon Chan, the president of the Haymarket Chamber of Commerce, which represents traders in Sydney's Chinatown. ""We do need to support the businesses and encourage them to commit themselves and get back to the business to provide the infrastructure to cater for the tourists."" Research from Tourism and Transport Forum Australia (TTF) shows that at least 610,000 jobs have been lost since the pandemic struck. It says that compared to other sectors, more tourism businesses have had to let staff go than other businesses, and staff shortages are expected to continue well beyond current operating restrictions. Margy Osmond, the chief executive officer of TTF told the ABC that it isn't unique to the China market. ""There are a whole lot of specialised markets where language is a critical issue as is an advanced cultural understanding,"" she said. ""And in the absence of any international travellers over the last couple of years, that has been a major problem and obviously those people who've had to seek work elsewhere because there's been no activity in that space."" Despite some progress being made at home with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) recognising two Chinese-manufactured vaccines for travel to Australia, the frosty bilateral relations between the two countries saw the difficulty for top leaders to have high-level dialogues about trade and tourism. The relationship between Australia and China deteriorating sharply in the past few years, with Beijing targeting multiple Australian goods with trade sanctions and even issuing travel warnings for its citizens to not visit Australia. That cuts deep for Justin Steele, who runs a small business, Local Sauce Tours, in Sydney. The Queenslander grew up studying Chinese language and culture and was once awarded a scholarship to China to improve the cultural exchange among young Australians. He started out his business with bilingual tours focusing on Australian culture in 2018, attracting many young Chinese millennial tourists. ""They wanted to do something that their parents' generation wouldn't do,"" the 32-year-old told the ABC. ""In my experience, all the Chinese guests that I've had in the past, they don't talk about politics, they don't have any interest in that. ""I was really excited for 2020 and those first few months of the year were looking really good and then everything just ground to a halt."" He said he hopes that a travel bubble can be open soon given high vaccination rates in both countries. ""Despite all the politics and stuff, Australians still have this reputation as being very friendly, welcoming people. ""I think Chinese tourists will come back, whether it's in the same amount numbers as pre-pandemic, I'm not sure, let's hope. ""But it might take a few years before those numbers to really start climbing back to what they were.""

429,When will international travel in Queensland return to normal?,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Queenslanders cannot expect international flights to ramp up until future COVID-19 restrictions are made clearer and there is a firm deadline for quarantine-free travel, industry leaders say. The Australian Federation of Travel Agents, the Board of Airline Representatives of Australia, and Brisbane Airport Corporation say airlines cannot commit to reinstating or establishing international flights in or out of Brisbane due to ongoing uncertainty about border closures, quarantine and COVID-19 testing requirements. A spokesperson for Tourism Minister Stirling Hinchliffe said Queensland's Vaccine Plan to Unite Families ""clearly states"" that once 90 per cent of Queenslanders 16 and older are fully vaccinated there will be no border restrictions or quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated arrivals. On Thursday, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the government was still ""looking at"" hitting the 90 per cent vaccination rate ""around early January"" but that would depend on how quickly the 80 per cent double-dose target was reached. But infectious disease expert Paul Griffin said it was still not clear when or if Queensland would hit 90 per cent due to ongoing vaccine hesitancy, despite it being a realistic target. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Board of Airline Representatives of Australia executive director Barry Abrams said airlines did not have clear guidance about the arrangements for testing and quarantine, nor did they have a firm reopening date. International travel is back on, but it's a lot more complicated than it used to be. Here's what you need to know before your flight. ""As we've been asking every jurisdiction, we want clarity as to the arrangements, we need as much consistency, we effectively don't want to operate to five different countries when coming to Australia,"" he said. ""Ultimately we're after a firm date [for quarantine-free travel], and then we also need to know the detail of how the arrangements will work in practice."" Mr Abrams said the industry needed clarity around the requirements, including around COVID-19 testing on arrival, restrictions on passengers entering certain places such as aged care, what self-isolation measures would be for 13 to 17-year-olds, and international aircrew. ""So those guidelines and the level of clarity that airlines need is at a much more granular level than what is on a one-page PDF road map,"" he said. ""If the industry is saying they need greater clarity, they're saying it because it's an important thing, rather than telling industry there is that clarity. The other option is saying we can meet with industry and understand what is needed and how to address it."" Australian Federation of Travel Agents chief executive Dean Long said it was very difficult for carriers to operate out of Brisbane due to the border stance. He said anyone travelling out of Queensland would have to travel through New South Wales and Victoria to access international flights primarily because of reduced demand overall. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Mr Long said the peak body recently surveyed more than 600 people and found the two main barriers to travel were people's concern they would not be able to get home and the lack of information provided by governments around the world. In a statement, Brisbane Airport said without certainty about the border reopening date, airlines could not ""afford to commit to services into Brisbane Airport"" and that companies were choosing to take aircraft to markets where they knew they could sell tickets. ""With Sydney and Melbourne now open to quarantine-free travel they are clearly the priority,"" the statement said. ""We are also competing with every other airport and travel market in the world and many of them are open now, so airlines are putting their planes where they can make money."" Recently, Emirates vice-president for Australasia Barry Brown estimated flights into Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney would not return to 2019 levels until at least 2023. The spokesperson for Mr Hinchliffe said New South Wales and Victoria had already reached their 90 per cent full vaccination targets, while Queensland's average was about 75 per cent. ""The sooner 90 per cent of all Queenslanders are fully vaccinated, the sooner the state can welcome back fully vaccinated international visitors and supercharge the recovery of Queensland's tourism industry,"" the spokesperson said.

430,"COVID-19 PCR test confusion about 'singling out Queensland' ahead of looming federal election, Palaszczuk says",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says she was unaware until yesterday that people coming to Queensland would not have to pay for a COVID-19 test to enter the state, despite the cost being covered by an inter-governmental deal since the pandemic began. There had been confusion over who would pay for the test requirement for entry into Queensland, at a cost of up to $150 per person, when the state opens its borders to interstate COVID hotspots next month. States such as South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia require negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 tests 72 hours before entry under their re-opening border rules. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the test would continue to be free at state-run clinics as it falls under a public health order, which are jointly funded by state, territories and the Commonwealth. The deal was agreed upon over a year ago. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic ""We haven't changed anything,"" Mr Hunt said. Asked when she first became aware that Queenslanders could get free COVID tests interstate, Ms Palaszczuk this afternoon said: ""I think it was yesterday when the statement was issued from the federal government."" The Premier said she was ""delighted it's sorted out"". ""In terms of the federal government, we need to continue to [work] cooperatively, I don't think this has helped anyone,"" she said. In latest reporting period: Queensland's vaccine rollout: Latest case information from Queensland Health. ""I acknowledge the costs were high for families, but in Queensland if you were going to other states the test was free. ""It's great the Commonwealth has recognised it's free for people coming into Queensland."" Ms Palaszczuk said Queensland was ""singled out"" ahead of the federal election, despite other states also requiring the tests. ""I'm sick of this. I'm sick of Queensland being singled out when the PCR tests are required across the country,"" she said. ""This is a backflip by the federal government. This is about singling Queensland out. This is about the federal election. ""Federal election means Queensland gets singled out, Western Australia gets singled out and Victoria gets singled out and I'm sick of it."" Ms Palaszczuk said ""the politics has to stop"" and called for more ""national consistency when it comes to these issues"". She denied the state government took too long to clarify the situation. ""I don't pick up the phone to the federal Health Minister, I'm happy to pick up the phone to Scott Morrison. And Scott Morrison's got my number as well,"" Ms Palaszczuk said. Earlier today, Deputy Premier Steven Miles accused the federal government of running a ""clearly orchestrated campaign to confuse people"". He said it was the media reporting that tests would cost travellers and the state government had been responding to questions on that basis. ""We never floated that, there was never an announcement from the state government that it would cost people,"" he said. ""We were asked whether people would need the test and we were presented with the argument that in some cases that would cost people money, and we said they would still require that test."" Confirmation that visitors would not have to pay for COVID tests to enter the state came as a welcome relief to the state's struggling tourism industry. For stranded Victorian couple Debbie and Erich Turner, news they wouldn't need to pay for tests to relocate to Queensland was cautiously welcomed. After quitting their jobs, the prospect of paying about $150 each for a COVID test was yet another blow. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. ""That's when we threw our hands in the air and said that's it, we can't afford it,"" she said. She said the confusion over testing costs was just the latest of several ""changing goalposts"" and constant uncertainty surrounding the state's border requirements. ""You get a bit numb to all the changes that happen,"" Ms Turner said.

431,'It's put Albany on the map for diving': HMAS Perth II marks 20 years since scuttling off southern WA coast,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Renowned dive site HMAS Perth II marks 20 years since scuttling off southern WA coast One of Australia's most renowned wreck diving sites celebrates its 20th birthday today. HMAS Perth II was scuttled in King George Sound off Western Australia's southern coast on November 24, 2001. The scuttling was the subject of intense competition from several regions across the state hoping to cash in on the tourism dollars that would flow from visiting divers. ABC Journalist Mark Bennett was there and recalls it being a spectacular sight. ""There was this simultaneous run of explosions right the way along the ship,"" he said. ""Flames and smoke rushed out of all the portholes and made these enormous holes in the keel."" HMAS Perth II was a 4,850 tonne, 133-metre long Charles F. Adams (Modified Perth) class guided missile destroyer built in Michigan, in the United States. It was the Royal Australian Navy's only vessel to have been hit by enemy fire in the past 50 years, which happened while assigned to the US Seventh Fleet in Vietnam between 1967 and 1969. After a distinguished 34-year career HMAS Perth II was decommissioned in 1999, and two years later was scuttled at a depth of 36 metres off Seal Island, 8 kilometres south-east of Albany. While no doubt a dramatic scene, the scuttling was a controlled operation designed to keep the ship intact for use as a recreational dive site. ""What wasn't very controlled was the controversy in the lead up to the Perth II being brought down …among tourism operators there was huge competition to get a warship scuttled,"" Mr Bennett said. In the end, the two-year-long efforts of Albany's business community and the City of Albany paid off. HMAS Perth II wreck has since become one of Australia's most renowned wreck dive sites. Today the wreck has extensive coral and sponge growth and is home to many fish species, including yellow tails, carpet sharks and kingfish. Albany dive shop owner Gary Wellstead said about 80 per cent of divers from outside the region came to dive the HMAS Perth II wreck. ""It's got a special attraction for a lot of people, Navy people especially who've served on the Perth,"" he said. ""It's certainly helped put Albany on the map for diving."" Dives on the HMAS Perth II wreck typically last for 45 minutes and take in highlights such as the gun deck, the bow and the skipper's chair on the bridge. Mr Wellstead estimated he had dived the HMAS Perth II wreck between 600 and 700 times over the past 20 years, most recently a fortnight ago. ""It's in good nick,"" he said. ""There's always something different on the wreck. There's a couple of resident wobbegongs (carpet shark) there that move around and they tend to scare the bejeebies out of people when they realise what they're swimming over. ""But it's all good; we train them well."" ABC Great Southern will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

432,'We haven't changed anything': War of words follows COVID test clarity,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus The Queensland and federal governments are blaming each other for delays in clarifying the funding arrangement for COVID-19 tests required by anyone travelling in and out of the state from next month. A negative PCR result will be required within a 72-hour period before travelling to Queensland, but after days of argument between state and federal authorities it was clarified that the $150 price tag will not be the responsibility of holiday-makers. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Tuesday afternoon the 50-50 arrangement had been in place for some time. ""Testing has been proceeding without incident for the last 18 months,"" he said. ""This includes testing required to support entry into another state or territory."" Queensland's Deputy Premier Steven Miles this morning welcomed Mr Hunt's clarification, saying ""we just wish it had a bit sooner"". ""There was clearly an orchestrated campaign to confuse people,"" Mr Miles said. ""Just yesterday, Greg Hunt was saying we should drop the requirement for a PCR test, I had to comment on that yesterday morning, and by yesterday afternoon, he was clarifying that PCR test would be free for people travelling to Queensland and we welcome that confirmation."" Queensland has recorded no new cases of COVID-19 in the community and it has been 14 days since the last case in a recent Gold Coast cluster, which Deputy Chief Health Officer Lynne McKinlay said brought that outbreak to a close. In latest reporting period: Queensland's vaccine rollout: Latest case information from Queensland Health. One case was detected in hotel quarantine in a traveller from PNG and the state now has three active cases — the lowest number of any time this year. Speaking on Channel Nine this morning, Mr Hunt said he was pleased Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk was ""back in the tent"" on joint funding of PCR tests. ""We haven't changed anything,"" he said. Mr Hunt said the Queensland government ""wavered"" on the funding agreement over the past 24 to 48 hours. ""For some reason — whether it was inadvertent or otherwise — they suggested they might be changing that. In the end, they’ve agreed to continue to do exactly what has been occurring over the last 18 months. ""They’re back in the tent and I'm pleased about that, because the only people who would have lost are families and those that wanted to visit friends and sick relatives."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Mr Miles was asked why the state government had not offered clarity on who was paying for the tests earlier. He said it was the media reporting that tests would cost travellers and the state government had been responding to questions on that basis. ""We never floated that, there was never an announcement from the state government that it would cost people,"" he said. ""We were asked whether people would need the test and we were presented with the argument that in some cases that would cost people money, and we said they would still require that test."" Tourism operators have expressed their joy and relief at the clarification. Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind said it was a massive relief for the sector. ""I think catastrophe has been averted here. We're relieved, and we appreciate the efforts of both state and federal governments,"" Mr Gschwind said. ""I think families will be a lot happier to spend the same amount on a tourism experience and bring themselves a bit of joy, and the industry, instead of spending it on a PCR test,"" he said. Tourism operators reported a spike in bookings when Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced Queensland's roadmap. The wave of enthusiasm was overshadowed by a realisation a family of four would need to pay $600 on COVID-19 tests just to enter the state. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Mr Gschwind said the cost of testing would've been another blow to an already struggling industry. ""The state government and the private sector spent millions of dollars trying to attract people now that the borders are open again through marketing, and this would've been a shot in the foot for sure,"" he said. He said it was a relief to operators who had been fielding calls from concerned travellers. ""We're enormously relieved that these bookings will hopefully hold, and people will arrive in a good mood without having their wallets raided before they get here."" While it was a long road to get to this point, Mr Gschwind said, ""it's a very joyful moment and a Christmas gift for consumers.""

434,Another Christmas in Siberia for stranded Aussies with unapproved vaccines,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  New South Wales resident James Cater is preparing for another white Christmas in Siberia because the brand of COVID-19 vaccine he has received is not recognised in Australia. The international model from Shoalhaven Heads, on the state's southern coast, was travelling with his partner, Anna Merkureva, in her home country of Russia when the pandemic struck. He has been stranded there since July 2020. Mr Cater said he had hoped the federal government's move to lift the COVID-19 international border ban, and its changes to quarantine restrictions, would allow the couple to return for Christmas. But it now appears those hopes have been dashed, as the Sputnik vaccine the couple received in Russia is not recognised by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and, according to Mr Cater,  no airline is prepared to fly them home. ""Since the November re-opening, I have been looking forward to getting home, but the logistics of trying to find a way home have been incredibly stressful,"" he said. Mr Cater said he and Ms Merkureva were both fully vaccinated. ""Me and Anna have the only vaccines available in Russia due to an embargo on all other imports of vaccines,"" he said. ""But the TGA does not recognise the Sputnik vaccine as a valid vaccine for travel. ""So, the path home is unclear because I am viewed as unvaccinated."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Mr Cater said the couple considered travelling to another country in Europe to access the Pfizer vaccine, but the process was too daunting. ""[With] visa restrictions and the necessary 21-day gap between doses, followed by an Australian requirement for a seven-day gap after the second dose — the complications boggle the mind,"" he said. In July 2021 the couple received the news that Ms Merkureva's partner visa had been approved, and since then they have tried to access multiple repatriation flights to Australia. ""But we've had no luck as most of these flights sell out within seconds of their announcement,"" he said. “Things have gotten kind of more complicated because I am viewed as unvaccinated, and a lot of the carriers simply will not take me. ""So far everyone I have talked to will not let me fly back."" The young couple used up their savings during their enforced stay, but support from a go-fund-me page has helped them raise money for the journey home. Want more local news? Sign up to the ABC Illawarra weekly email newsletter The Department of Health said there was insufficient data and information available to adequately demonstrate the protection offered by the Sputnik vaccine. It said in a statement: As such, the TGA has not recognised the Sputnik vaccine at this stage. The TGA continues to actively engage with international regulatory counterparts and Ministries of Health, including the Russian Ministry of Health to gain access to data where it exists. A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) spokesperson said in a statement that the government was attempting to provide support. DFAT's focus is on assisting those most in need to return, including those who are unvaccinated or who have not had access to a TGA-approved or recognised vaccine, as well as those in locations where there are limited commercial flight options. The Government will continue to support these Australians by arranging government-facilitated commercial flights from a range of locations and helping vulnerable Australians to access scheduled commercial flights under flight caps. Mr Cater's local federal member for Gilmore, Fiona Phillips, said the situation was dire. ""We thought James would be able to come home last Christmas and further restrictions have prevented his return,"" she said. ""The issue is they have not been able to access an approved vaccine."" Ms Phillips said the government should consider an emergency measure exemption. ""I have written on behalf of a number of constituents in a similar situation and the government is not prepared to make any exemptions for people that have not been able to access the Australian-approved TGA vaccines,"" she said. ""They promised stranded Australians could be home last Christmas, and here we are coming up to another Christmas where stranded Australians have been left languishing."" Mr Cater said the couple did not believe they would be able to return to Australia until early 2022. ""So we are chilling out here. It was down to minus 20 overnight, so pretty frosty,"" he said.

436,Tourists may have to pay to visit Cape York's tip,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Visitors to tip of Cape York could be charged in Pajinka traditional owners' plan The ""trip to the tip"" is the ultimate pilgrimage for conquistador four-wheel drivers, and its popularity has grown with the closure of international borders. The Northern Peninsula Area (NPA) is Queensland's northernmost mainland council area and has about 3,000 residents, made up of the five communities of Bamaga, Injinoo, Seisia, Umagico, and New Mapoon. Since about April the NPA estimates 80,000 visitors passed through, putting exceptional pressure on its resources. Earlier this year, reports surfaced that some traditional owners of Pajinka — the tip of Cape York — wanted to close the site to the public, but that did not eventuate. Some businesses say the threat of closure drove a tourist season that was busier than usual, but now community leaders are looking ahead to how the region can be better equipped to benefit from the annual influx of four-wheel-drivers. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Cape York was physically barricaded from the rest of Queensland under federal biosecurity legislation, to protect its vulnerable communities. Coupled with interstate travel restrictions, 2020 was a disappointing year for tourism businesses in the region, but ABC reported earlier this year some were anticipating 2021 would be the busiest tourist season in a decade. Bewan Idai managed the service station in Bamaga and said there was a rush of visitors at the start of the season. ""There was one period there, I think it was  right when the tourist season kicked off, because it was such a mad rush to get up to the tip everyone was, 'Oh, we're not sure if it's going to close or not'; everyone was rushing through. ""Our diesel sales have ... pretty much doubled in some stages there .. because of the diesel vehicles coming through,"" Mr Idai said. He said it was not quite his busiest tourist season ever, but it was up there. ""It was enough to kind of keep my staff busy; [enough to] keep them running off their feet at some points. ""We ran close to running out of diesel at one point, actually, we did run out of unleaded — it was extremely busy,"" Mr Idai said. Robert Poi Poi is the chairman of Bamaga Enterprises, which manages a range of businesses, including the town's resort. ""There's a big difference, compared to previous [seasons] … we've made, like, 50 per cent more than previous years. ""We definitely had plenty of tourists this year,"" Mr Poi Poi said. The NPA is a unique area, made up of five distinct communities over about 1,000 square kilometres. When ABC visited the region in November, residents were subject to level 6 water restrictions. But in August, at the height of tourist season, the town's water supply broke down with a major water leak, and essential services like the local school, were closed. Mayor Patricia Yusia said the community's water infrastructure was old and could not cope with the pressure added by the thousands of tourists that passed through. She said it needed to be upgraded and if increasing numbers of people were interested in visiting, then ""we need to have a bit more more investment into NPA"". Mayor Yusia said at times, the town tripled in size with tourists. ""You can hardly drive, there's so many people, so many cars … there's just cars everywhere."" ""We've only got couple of supermarkets, and they get inundated; there's hardly anything on the shelves for the locals when the tourists stay here,"" Ms Yusia said. ""We've been just overwhelmed by the tourists; we weren't really prepared for it."" With the supermarket, service station and campgrounds operated by private entities, council's only income from drive tourists is the Jardine Ferry. She said tourists were welcome to the region, and acknowledged the benefits of the industry to the local economy, but noted the community needs help to manage the influx of people during the tourist season. ""We need more influx of dollars coming into NPA communities, to try and look at how we can address those issues,"" Ms Yusia said. Traditional owners of Pajinka are planning to charge visitors on arrival to the area. The site was handed back to traditional owners in 2019, which gives them rights to manage the area. Earlier this year there were widespread reports that the Gudang Yadhaykenu Aboriginal Corporation (GYAC) would close Pajinka to the public, to protect the area from further damage, but it did not happen. But moving forward, corporation chair Michael Solomon said the corporation would be setting up an entry station to collect fees from tourists. He said a fee would encourage more tourists to be more respectful and would give the owners the funds to create a better experience for tourists. Mr Solomon described disrespectful behaviour shown by tourists as ""very, very hurtful"". GYAC is yet to decide on how much tourists would pay, or develop the infrastructure needed for a toll booth at the entry to Pajinka, but those in charge said earning income off the site would provide long-term benefits. ""If we would have the money, we could have solved a lot of problems with that place, lot of issues and all this stuff,"" Mr Solomon said. ""If you calculate all the dollars that went past, it could be there up and running; our generation could be walking by now. ""I want to make things happen for my, you know, future grandchildren, children and their children on this thing, you know, rest of the clan groups.""

437,SA's border is open. Here's who can come in and what rules are in place,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  At the stroke of midnight, South Australia's border opened and, by yesterday afternoon, more than 29,000 applications to enter the state had been submitted. Of those, more than 15,000 applications were from people assessed as coming from ""low-risk"" and ""very low-risk"" local government areas (LGAs) across Australia. If you want to enter South Australia, you will need to use the new EntryCheck SA website to find out the restrictions that apply to you and to complete an application. To do so, the website will ask you to create a mySA GOV account, which will require you to provide personal information, including your date of birth, address and Medicare card details. You will also need to upload evidence of your COVID-19 vaccination and provide the details of where you have spent most of your time while outside of the state. It will also ask for proof that you and your dependents have been fully vaccinated, with children under 12 years of age to be treated as if they were vaccinated. This proof can come through a certificate that can be connected from the Express Plus Medicare or federal myGov apps. You may also need an international vaccine certificate if you have been overseas. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic You can find out the level of risk for interstate LGAs on the SA Health website. The risk level is assessed using the vaccination rates in each area and if they currently have community transmission. According to SA Health, the information will be updated weekly, ""based on Australian Government vaccination data, and additional public health information, taking into account variations in data"". You can complete the application up to 14 days ahead of your planned travel to South Australia. SA Health recommends you have it completed at least 72 hours before you plan to arrive in the state. Unvaccinated people wanting to travel to South Australia can still apply using the EntryCheck SA website. The SA Health website states: ""Unvaccinated people planning to travel to South Australia must apply for an exemption to travel. Applications for an exemption from entry conditions are an extension of EntryCheck SA and can be made at the end of that application."" The EntryCheck SA website has had multiple outages since it was launched on Friday evening. Yesterday, South Australia's Premier Steven Marshall apologised for the site being out of action for nearly an hour. ""Apologies for that portal being down today but it is up and running now,"" Mr Marshall said. ""The development of software like this would usually be a six- or a 12-month arrangement, especially one that was going to be under such a heavy use."" Late yesterday, a state government spokesperson said there had been a lot of traffic to the website. ""Since launching, the platform has seen significant demand, and has been scaled-up to meet [that demand],"" the spokesperson said. ""Support teams are constantly monitoring the platform to ensure returning South Australians and travellers coming to our state are able to process their application smoothly.""

439,Access to this vital piece of sporting equipment is changing lives,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Sport The Sports Bra Project: gifting a simple piece of sporting equipment that's changing lives When it comes to getting a sports bra, most women would pop to the shops and buy what they need. But what if you didn't have the time, money or freedom to do that, and it created a barrier to playing the game you love? It's a reality here in Australia, and many countries abroad. And for New Yorker Sarah Dwyer-Shick, it was one basic need that wasn't being addressed, that she knew she could do something about. In 2018, she created the Sports Bra Project. It's now a non-profit that distributes sports bras to women and girls who don't have access to them, removing that barrier to participation. The project has given out about 7,000 brand new sports bras to women and girls in 30 different countries. ""It's something that my mum can relate to because she never had a sports bra,"" Dwyer-Shick said. ""Every 12-year-old girl who gets her first sports bra, can relate to it. ""Geography, sport, level of play doesn't matter. It's universal."" Australia hasn't been included so far, but that's soon to change with a collaboration in 2022. One of the organisations working with the Sports Bra Project is Women Sport Australia, which says it's proud to be involved. ""A sports bra is such an important element to ensuring female athletes feel comfortable when engaging in sport and recreation,"" said Gen Simmons, President of Women Sport Australia. ""We look forward to seeing bras donated to Australian communities who need them."" Dwyer-Shick grew up playing a lot of sport, but soccer was her main game. She played in college, coached intercollegiate soccer for 15 years and remains involved in youth sports. The idea for the Sports Bra Project came to her before travelling with a non-profit organisation through Namibia. They'd already sent over a shipping container of items like soccer balls, boots and schoolbooks. ""And I thought, 'you know what, I'm just going to bring sports bras, 30 or 40 of them, let's see what happens,'"" Dwyer-Shick said. ""We were working with a wonderful woman with the Namibian Football Association and we're in the capital city of Windhoek. ""She's got some programs that are really far flung in some rural areas. I figured she would take them to those programs."" But instead, she asked if she could give them to her national team players. ""And I think I just went 'what'? I was like 'yes! Please do that!'."" On a different trip, this time to Brazil, Dwyer-Shick noted the sporadic appearances of women and girls in a soccer program she was running. She discovered some couldn't arrange transport or needed to mind siblings. ""Some of what the girls and the women said really hit home,"" she said. ""What they dealt with culturally, but also that manufactured goods [like sports bras] in Brazil are expensive. ""I thought 'OK, you're dealing with so much, can we address this little piece of it?' And that was kind of the beginning."" After those experiences, Dwyer-Shick was on a mission. She spoke to friends and other female coaches, who lamented the lack of women in leadership roles, and how women's issues were overlooked. ""Why don't we have feminine products in medical kits? Why are we ordering white shorts? Why are there no sports bras?"" she said. So those women decided to informally help each other out. ""If someone was travelling, we would do a drive. If I were travelling, they would do a drive. And then it took off,"" she said. ""I think we underestimated how it would resonate across sports, ages and levels of play."" Dwyer-Shick says finally having a sports bra can be life changing for some people. ""There's a group we gave to recently in Seattle, Washington, and they came back to the women who distributed the bras and said 'oh my gosh I just used the bra, we went out walking, we went out hiking, even if it was raining, we still went out'. ""Yes, the elite athletes and the national teams are important, but I think that core women just having access to being active – for us that's the big one."" The bras now largely come from groups and individuals who do sports bra drives. It adds another layer to the project by helping young women take on leadership roles without much pressure. ""For a young athlete or a young assistant coach to take on that leadership in a project, they're able to take ownership of it and the worst that happens if it fails is that they don't get bras,"" Dwyer-Shick said. For example, a young group of high school students in Minnesota has just collected 100 sports bras. ""Adults supervised, watched them struggle and watched them do it, but it was a safe environment,"" she said. ""It was a win on all fronts. They were taking on leadership, they are connecting with their community and helping someone else, by giving a sports bra."" When a person donates a bra, they also get the chance to write a personal message of support to the recipient. Some of them say things like 'you rock', 'I believe in you' and 'you have the right to play'. ""It's not just a company giving it to them, it's that personal tie,"" Dwyer-Shick said. Dwyer-Shick also wants these drives to normalise the conversation around bras and their role as a basic piece of sporting equipment. ""So the young girls who might not be comfortable talking about it, once they're on a sports bra drive it's now suddenly not a strange thing when they hit puberty,"" she said. ""Now it's just like … it's a bra, it's not a big deal, it's just like a jersey or shorts."" And what about when they're received? ""Some groups are ecstatic,"" Dwyer-Shick said. ""Then there's other stories where the girls were kind of a little uncomfortable, they weren't sure, they didn't look excited. ""But then when the organisers walked by later they overheard the girls talking amongst themselves, they were like 'oh my god', they were super excited."" The Sports Bra Project has grown over the years thanks to the effort of international networks committed to supporting female athletes. But COVID-19 has had a big impact on the project, because of its reliance on people to carry the bras while travelling. ""It pretty much stopped it for a while,"" Dwyer-Shick said. ""And when in-person events stopped, a lot of the drives stopped too."" However, the travel hiatus gave Dwyer-Shick time to forge connections and lay the groundwork to help communities here in Australia. ""It facilitated some in-person events that now have to go digital at an international level, which really created some fascinating networks.""

440,Getting ready to travel overseas? Know this: It's complicated,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Most Australians have spent the past two years unable to travel overseas, forgoing holidays, family events, and overseas work opportunities. Now that borders are starting to reopen, more than half a million international trips have been booked from Australia and demand is only expected to grow as more states open up to the world. But many travellers are about to discover boarding a flight for a foreign destination is not what it used to be. Gone are the days of checking you had passport, ticket and wallet. Flying overseas is now much more complicated: There are more forms to fill in, apps to install, certificates to carry, and checks to clear. And it all takes far longer to work through at the airport, so Qantas has started recommending passengers arrive at the airport at least four hours before they fly. Here's what's changed. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic You're already vaccinated? Great, but this is international travel 2.0 — the version with unexpected twists. You might already have the COVID-19 vaccination digital certificate, but the federal government has also introduced the International Vaccination Certificate. You could be asked to show this to airline staff, local authorities at your destination, or Australian immigration officials. To get yours, go into the Medicare app, or log on to the Medicare section of my.gov.au, find your vaccine history and request an international certificate. You'll need to have your passport number and expiry date handy. The international version can be saved as a PDF and printed out. Carrying a hard copy is advisable because you never know when you'll run out of battery power, or lose coverage. Of course not. Getting a PCR test for international travel is slightly more complicated than the regular one we all know and love. So best not leave it too late. It will cost you $150 and you'll need your passport details and a bit more time to fill out the required forms. Not all testing sites can give you the kind of test you need to board an international flight. Check that your chosen testing station can. Australia does not require a negative COVID-19 test before you depart, but the country you're going to might, so check that well in advance: Your airline may not allow you to travel if you don't meet the requirements set out by that country. This is where all the extra little bits and pieces can make things really fun. It may have been a global pandemic, but there is currently no global agreement on what's needed for international travel. Every country is making up their own rules. One destination might need you to download a health app, the next to complete a health declaration, another to do both. Some countries use online systems, others require printed forms the ground staff pull out of a folder. Plus, things are changing fast, so it's possible one country's rules changed last Thursday. For many travellers, the requirements will be unexpected and take extra time. Let's assume it normally takes five minutes to check in. When you arrive there are three counters open and 12 groups ahead of you in the queue, so you'd expect to wait 20 minutes. But if each group takes an extra 10 minutes, and someone argues with ground staff about what's required, you're going to wait more than an hour to check in. And you'll be crossing your fingers the person in front of you doesn't present a vaccine certificate in a language staff don't recognise. No, but don't be surprised if you discover before you go through security or customs there's another surprise form to complete on the fly. Remember to carry a pen. A mask. Most airlines require you to wear a mask for the entire journey, so make sure it's comfortable. Some might prefer one type of mask over another. If they want you to wear a surgical masks and not cloth, they will likely provide those. Consider taking some snacks and a water bottle. Some domestic airlines have suspended refreshment services, so you can't be sure you'll get that cuppa you're hanging out for on the local leg. Of course. None of this is easy. Australia requires all inbound travellers to complete a travel declaration at least 72 hours before departure. You can fill this out online, or download the Australian Travel Declaration app. Paper forms are also available, but again this will slow you down. Yes, you'll also need another poke-up-the-nose no more than 72 hours before getting your flight home. If you're getting a connecting flight back into Australia, consider whether your test is within 72 hours of boarding that leg. Again, we're not talking about the regular yes/no test – this needs to be associated with your passport details and be internationally recognised. Finding someone in an Australian city to do this test might be easy, but do you know where to have it done in London? Johannesburg? Kathmandu? Consider finding out well in advance who provides these, where they are located, what they require and how much it costs. As with all of this – expect it to be more hassle than you imagined.

441,Prime tourist town pushes ahead with plan to regulate short-term rentals,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Broome pushes forward with plan to regulate Airbnb and other short-term rental properties Home owners in one of Western Australia's prime tourist destinations wanting to rent their properties to travellers will soon have to apply for permission from their local council. The Shire of Broome has formalised its stance on short-term rentals, which have boomed in popularity through platforms like Airbnb and Stayz. The shire will soon require home owners to apply for their property to be listed as a holiday house if it is in a suburban area and the owner is not residing there. The draft policy also states that before the two-year licence for a property is granted, there would be a 21-day public comment period. It is expected that rates charges would also change for the property. Councillors unanimously backed the policy at their meeting on Thursday, with the proposal now subject to a 90-day public comment period. ""It'll be a case-by-case basis to approve these holiday homes, because at the moment there's no formal land use for that,"" Shire President Harold Tracey said. ""We need to bring it back to a level playing field."" Neighbours have complained of some un-hosted holiday homes turning into ""party houses"" and of parking logjams on suburban streets. ""That's another issue we have at the Shire, is complaints from neighbours about noise,"" Mr Tracey said. Michael Leake, a resort manager and member of the Broome Tourism Leadership Group, has long lobbied for governance of holiday rentals. ""There's too many stories of people in Broome surrounded by two or three Airbnb houses and they've got no control of it,"" Mr Leake said. He recalled an older couple who had retired to Broome telling him they were surrounded by short-term holiday lets. ""[They said], 'We didn't come here to be surrounded by empty houses or party houses, we wanted a community, a residential neighbourhood'."" Mr Leake gave cautious support for the shire's draft policy but said it did not go far enough. ""There's well over 100 properties that are totally non-compliant. There's no structure in place for when things go wrong,"" he said. The proposed policy calls for a manager to be contactable between 9am and 5pm and live within a 15-minute drive. ""That's very, very poor. We have to have a caretaker on site and have a contact number 24 hours a day,"" Mr Leake said. Want more local news? Sign up to the weekly ABC Kimberley email newsletter There are an estimated 20,000 short-term holiday rentals in Western Australia. The unregulated holiday home market has long had criticism from hoteliers and bed-and-breakfast operators who have a range of fees and regulations attached to their businesses. It sparked a WA government inquiry in 2019 called Levelling the Playing Field: Managing the Impact of the Rapid Increase of Short-Term Rentals in Western Australia. Its recommendations have not been implemented. Holiday rental properties in NSW will be de-listed from booking websites including Airbnb and Stayz if providers fail to register with the Department of Planning. The Broome Shire's submission noted the only penalty available under the Planning Act was a $500 fine which ""was unlikely to be a sufficient deterrent"". Typically homes in Broome's peak season can rent for several hundred dollars a night, and Mr Leake says it has exacerbated the town's rental shortage. ""Four workers, who couldn't get any other accommodation, were getting charged $27,000 for three weeks,"" he said. ""That's just price gouging. It has a massive impact on the reputation of Broome."" The proposed policy will be submitted to the State Planning Commission once the public comment period is complete.

442,Major Queensland hotels lock out the unvaxxed ahead of December deadline,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus Unvaccinated Queenslanders could find themselves locked out of holiday destinations this summer, with some major hotels saying they will refuse bookings rather than navigate the state’s impending COVID-19 restrictions. From December 17, when the state is due to reach its 80 per cent vaccination target, Queensland will open its border to interstate travellers — but only if they are fully vaccinated. The new rules will usher in a suite of restrictions for Queenslanders who are yet to be vaccinated, barring them from cafes, restaurants, bars, pubs, and tourism experiences. Under the rules, those people will still be able to access hotels for accommodation but will be banned from specific parts of the venue that might offer food or drinks. But the prospect of staff having to police the behaviour of unvaccinated guests is worrying operators. The Kingfisher Bay and Eurong Bay resorts on K'gari (Fraser Island) have confirmed they will not accept bookings from unvaccinated guests. David Hay from Kingfisher Bay Resort said he did not agree that tourism operators should be the ones to enforce government guidelines and said it was a ""pragmatic"" decision. ""It's unreasonable to expect our staff to police those things — it's not their job,"" he said. ""Everyone's there to take care of everyone's health, and it's our duty of care to our staff and our patrons that [led to] this decision. ""If we're clear about what we require and how those rules apply to our business, we think it's in everyone's interest."" Steve Knight from Fraser Island Retreat may also lock out unvaccinated customers from his general store despite groceries being classified as an ""essential service"", because the store has a bar and bistro attached. Under government rules, the unvaccinated would simply have to stay away from certain areas, but in this hotel, the reception desk also acts as a cafe. ""It's the same counter where you order coffees and sandwiches,"" Mr Knight said. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Even if he found some way to allow unvaccinated guests to stay, the retreat does not offer room service, and there is no other food available in the area. Mr Knight said guests were now being told that the law required the retreat to only allow fully vaccinated people on to the premises, but he was hoping for government intervention. ""If we can get an exemption that would be the ideal outcome,"" he said. Earlier this year Paradise Resort, on the Gold Coast, made it mandatory for staff to be double jabbed. Manager David Brooks has made it clear that when the state's borders open the resort will require guests to be fully vaccinated as well. ""We have a very clear mandate and I guess a duty of care to the majority of our guests, which are families with children between zero and 14 years old,"" he said. ""We believe they're the most important and the protection and safety for their stay is of paramount importance."" Mr Brooks said his 25-year-old daughter was ""bedridden for three months"" after contracting COVID early last year. ""It can take anybody, of any creed or any walk of life,"" he said. Those who stay at the resort have access to all its facilities, including the water park, the ice-skating rink, climbing walls and restaurants. Mr Brooks said allowing some but not others entry to the attractions would be ""impossible to work with"". ""Having guests not vaccinated walking around the property using all the facilities puts the majority at risk, along with our staff who have already reached the 99 per cent vaccination rate,"" he said. ""Overall it's taking what has been mandated anyway by the government and leading the way."" The Queensland Hotels Association (QHA) posted a statement to members on its website on Thursday to thank members for their patience as it works to clarify the rules with the government. It said it still did not know what ""reasonable steps"" hotels were expected to take against unvaccinated customers, or whether they could order takeaway food and coffee. ""The QHA is aware that there are still many areas requiring clarification,"" it wrote. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Sunshine Coast's weekly email newsletter Those considering hitting the sand or the bush for a camping trip to avoid vaccination rules will also need to read the fine print. Stays at Moreton Bay and on North Stradbroke Island will be off limits after the Quandamooka Yoolooburrabee Aboriginal Corporation announced those wishing to stay with Minjerribah or Mulgumpin Camping would have to provide a vaccine certificate seven days in advance. It said the wellbeing of its Aboriginal community members, particularly vulnerable elders, prompted the decision. State-run campgrounds do not require vaccinations to visit, although the Department of Environment said it was still working with Queensland Health in relation to the rules. Car-carrying ferries to Fraser Island will accept unvaccinated travellers, but they must book ahead, prepay, and stay in their cars during the trip.

443,'This is our last chance': Alarm about future of iconic fish species,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," ABC Rural Fishing changes needed with low stocks of dhufish, pink snapper report finds The latest review of fish stocks off the WA coast between Kalbarri and Augusta has found fishery management changes and catch reductions are needed to protect popular fish such as pink snapper and dhufish. It's the third major stock assessment conducted in the fishery since 2010, following a raft of cuts to fishing limits that were implemented to rebuild scalefish numbers. Conducted by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) scientists, the latest West Coast Demersal Scalefish stock assessment found the prized tablefish species were not recovering fast enough to safeguard their sustainability. DPIRD principal fisheries management officer Clinton Syers said the fishery was halfway through a 20-year recovery plan but was not recovering fast enough. ""Pink snapper and dhufish are used to indicate the health of the entire scalefish resource, which is comprised of more than 100 species of fish,"" he said. ""Pink snapper and dhufish can live up to 40 years, and our latest stock assessment shows a continued lack of older fish in the population required for the resource to recover. ""The stock assessment makes it clear that changes to management arrangements are required to get the recovery of demersal scalefish to sustainable levels back on track."" CEO of the WA Fishing Industry Council Darryl Hockey said urgent action was needed. He called for management changes to result in a reduction of the recreational sector's catch. ""We can't afford to take no action, this is our last chance,"" he said. ""If we do take some action, we've got a chance of recovering these species. ""Please don't underestimate that this is a very serious, significant situation at the moment."" Mr Hockey said the commercial industry had remained below catch limits set in 2010, and increased pressure on the fishery was coming from an increase in the recreational catch. ""This isn't about attributing blame on recreational fishers, we know overwhelmingly recreational fishers are very responsible,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, in the recreational sector, the catch has drifted up over time. ""So, clearly, the onus comes back onto that sector under the agreement they signed up to in the [2010] harvest strategy to make sure that they are taking the measures to stay within it."" Currently, recreational fishers can catch one dhufish and two demersal fish in total. RecFishWest, the body representing WA's recreational fishing sector, believes any review should result in shared catch reduction if required. CEO Andrew Rowland said the situation had not reached a dire point yet, but sustainability must be a key priority for all stakeholders moving forward. ""Although the alarm bells aren't ringing right now, the importance of this suite of species and anything to indicate that the recovery isn't happening at the speed or rate that was anticipated is cause for concern,"" Dr Rowland said. He said the recreational fishing sector was worth around $2.4 billion to the state's economy and that fish stocks were a publicly owned resource. ""It's really important that it's managed to return the highest and best use to the WA public that own it,"" he said. ""We don't want to see any further restrictions imposed on the recreational sector if that can be avoided. ""But at the end of the day, we're not going to put the sustainability of the stock at risk to be able to do that.""

However, when they visited the Rupanyup silos, Mr Baloglow tripped down an embankment, splitting open his foot. They went to get help at Rupanyup ambulance station, where he was attended to by paramedic and ambulance community officer Nina Denham and her paramedic colleague, Brian.

""We could just see a trail of blood all the way up the ambulance driveway, so we quickly whipped the ambulance out of the station and got him in there and got him patched up."" They decided to take Mr Baloglow to Warracknabeal for stitches and on the way found out they had been planning to visit the Sheep Hills silo next. ""I said to Brian, 'How about we just do a little detour?' because it's only a kilometre or something from the main road so it's not much of a detour at all,"" Ms Denham said. The ambulance team wheeled Mr Baloglow out on a bed so that he could get a proper view, and offered to take photos of the couple, spending about five minutes at the site, before continuing to Warracknabeal where they ensured he was being seen to properly. Mr Baloglow had to have seven stitches in his foot, and said he was extremely grateful for the help the paramedics gave him. ""Luckily I haven't had to deal with too many paramedics before but the instances that I have had to deal with them it's been amazing and Brian and Nina really went the extra distance,"" he said.

447,"Eighty-four years after the Hindenburg blew up, hydrogen air travel is back. Would you hop on board?",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Hydrogen planes may offer a possible solution to 'flight shame'. But can they safely provide greener air travel? As the world looks for new ways to combat climate change, hydrogen has emerged as a potential saviour for polluting industries like aviation. It's the most common element in the world, and packs more energy than conventional aviation jet fuel without the side effect of producing massive emissions of carbon dioxide. But hydrogen and air travel have a complicated history. More than 80 years ago the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship burst into flames when attempting to moor at Lakehurst in New Jersey. The extent to which the buoyant hydrogen gas can be blamed for the disaster has been the subject of much debate. But the image of the airship crashing to the ground is something the aviation industry is hoping to leave behind as it re-embraces hydrogen. One company is confident it can make it work, and is hoping to take paying passengers on a hydrogen-powered flight within just a few years. From its base at Kemble in England's scenic Cotswolds, ZeroAvia is developing an aircraft that could make the world's first commercial hydrogen-electric flight in 2024, between London and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The benefit of using hydrogen fuel cells, ZeroAvia argues, is that the only waste product is clean water. ""It's essentially a zero-emission process,"" says Sergey Kiselev, who heads ZeroAvia's Europe division. ""The only by-product is water vapour."" The concept has won financial backing from the UK government and from IAG, the parent company of British Airways. While hydrogen played at least a partial role in the Hindenburg crash, the team at ZeroAvia says modern storage systems make it a reliable fuel. ""Certainly hydrogen is safe,"" says John Kells, the company's head of technical operations. ""Today there are electric vehicles with hydrogen fuel cell systems and it's not more dangerous than kerosene [which fuels modern-day jets]."" Hydrogen is much lighter than air, so will quickly dissipate when released, unlike regular fuel, ZeroAvia says. But developing the plane hasn't been easy. In September 2020, the team from ZeroAvia reached a major milestone after performing a take-off, circuits and landing in a six-seater Piper Malibu powered by hydrogen fuel cells. The plane carried out dozens of successful test flights. Then in April this year, it crashed. The plane made a forced landing in a field near Cranfield airport, in Bedfordshire. While trying to come to a stop on the uneven surface, one of its wings was torn off. Nobody was hurt. ""I think when you test novel technology, things like that happen,"" Mr Kiselev tells the ABC. He says while the incident is still being investigated, the hydrogen itself was not the cause. ""We've gone through quite a bit of learning … to avoid that and make sure that doesn't happen again."" Stephen Lawes, who was on the plane when it crashed, is still convinced hydrogen is the future. ""The technology we've got today works,"" he says. ""You don't have to wait until 2030, 2040, 2050. You can do it now, basically."" Just outside ZeroAvia's hangar at the airport in the Cotswolds are dozens of fossil-fuel-guzzling passenger jets. They were sent there for temporary storage during the COVID-19 pandemic. But the long-term future of some of these jets is in doubt, amid a push for greener flying. As travel restrictions ease, passengers are keen to return to the skies. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is forecasting 3.4 billion passengers next year, up from 2.3 billion in 2021. At the same time, there is growing community awareness about air travel's contribution to climate change. It currently accounts for about 2.5 per cent of global emissions, but some forecasts predict that figure could reach about 25 per cent by 2050. A McKinsey survey of 5,300 passengers found that more than 50 per cent were ""really worried"" about global warming. Forty per cent of those aged between 18 and 24 said they planned to reduce their air travel as a result. ""We've got the social support,"" Mr Lawes says. ""There's this big wave coming, supporting change."" Instead of building a new plane from scratch, ZeroAvia is installing hydrogen gas tanks inside a 19-seat Dornier 228 regional airliner. The company is hoping airlines will be more likely to adopt the technology if they can add it to their existing planes. The hydrogen fuel cells will power electric motors, which will rotate the propellers. ""It sounds easy, but it isn't,"" Mr Lawes cautions. ZeroAvia make their own fuel on-site, passing an electrical current through water to split it into oxygen and hydrogen. ""The beauty of hydrogen electrolysis is it needs only two inputs. One is water, the second is electricity,"" Mr Kiselev says. However, for the process to be truly carbon zero, the electricity needs to come from renewable sources. Mr Kiselev says so-called green hydrogen presents big opportunities for countries like Australia. ""Especially in Australia with all the solar resources, there can be quite a bit of renewable power … generated very close to airports,"" he says. Green hydrogen currently accounts for just 1 per cent of global supply. But it's not the only pathway to a greener future for aviation. For small planes, electric propulsion is already shaping up as a viable alternative. But while batteries are becoming increasingly efficient, they still don't pack the punch required for longer trips. One of the world's biggest aircraft manufacturers, Airbus, is also putting its faith in hydrogen. But instead of using the gas to supply a fuel cell, it plans to burn hydrogen in its liquid form. It's working on three concept designs for a 'ZEROe' aircraft, which it's hoping to have in service by 2035. One of them looks unlike any passenger aircraft currently in the sky, requiring a radical new design if it's to store enough hydrogen to fly long-haul. Aviation is growing at immense speed, but its expansion comes at the expense of the environment. So what if flight routes were changed to minimise this? Jo Dardenne, the aviation manager at the European sustainability group Transport and Environment, says the world can't wait until 2035 to drastically cut long-haul airline emissions. ""You don't need a new airframe like a hydrogen plane, you can just use today's technology,"" she says. Ms Dardenne says sustainable aviation fuel (SAFs) like e-kerosene, also known as electrofuel or synthetic kerosene, provide the best short-term solution. That's because it can be blended with conventional jet fuel (kerosene) and used in today's aircraft. ""That's the beauty of electrofuel. It can be treated as normal kerosene."" The fuel is made by combining green hydrogen with CO2 captured from the atmosphere, at high temperature. This produces a crude oil which is later refined. When it's burned, e-kerosene emits the same amount of carbon as was previously removed from the atmosphere during its production, making it carbon neutral. There are nearly 800 carbon offset projects across Australia. But do they really stack up? In January, Dutch airline KLM flew the first regular passenger journey using sustainably-produced synthetic kerosene. However, the 500 litres produced by oil giant Shell represented just 5 per cent of the total fuel needed for the flight from Amsterdam to Madrid. Sustainable synthetic kerosene isn't being produced on a large scale. In October, a new plant opened in Germany, promising to produce just over 300 gallons a day. That would only fill about 5 per cent of a single Boeing 737-800's fuel tanks. Jo Dardenne says that until production is drastically ramped up, electrofuels will struggle to compete with cheaper jet fuel. ""That's why we need governments to invest in them… and make sure they force airlines to shift towards those kinds of fuels."" Yet while all these technologies promise to reduce the airline industry's carbon emissions, one major problem remains. If you look up at the sky, sometimes you can spot white condensation trails behind a plane when it passes overhead. These are called contrails, and according to scientists, they can have a significant impact on the environment. ""The consensus is… contrails have an effect that is similar in magnitude, if not larger, than the total effect from CO2 emissions,"" says Dr Marc Stettler, a senior lecturer in transport and the environment at Imperial College London. A plane's hot exhaust produces water vapour which clings to soot particles emitted from the engines. In the cold sky, these particles freeze, creating clouds of ice crystals. While the clouds can sometimes reflect the sun's radiation and cool the planet, Dr Stettler says the overall effect is to trap heat that would otherwise be lost into space. However, there is a potential solution. By predicting the atmospheric conditions that are most likely to produce the longest-lasting contrails, airlines and traffic controllers can stop planes flying through them. After studying Japanese airspace, researchers at Imperial College, led by Dr Stettler, concluded that by altering the altitude of less than 2 per cent of total flights, you could reduce contrail-related climate change by 59 per cent. ""This isn't something that we need to do for every single flight"" he tells the ABC. ""[But] I do think we need to be creative about how we reduce the climate impact of aviation."" E-kerosene promises to reduce the impact of contrails by burning more cleanly than regular jet fuel. Alternative jet fuels that create less soot could reduce the global warming effect of contrails, according to new research. Hydrogen combustion engines like those planned by Airbus will be even cleaner, but may still emit particles that cause contrails to form, Dr Stettler says. And hydrogen fuel cell aircraft, like Zero Avia's, will theoretically produce only water vapour. But Dr Stettler says it's still unclear how quickly those contrails will disappear. ""In terms of hydrogen [planes], the jury's out in terms of their effect on contrails."" He says while technology catches up, passengers may have to think carefully about the impact their flights are having on the environment, and potentially pay more for their pollution. But he hopes the ""privilege"" of flight can still be experienced by more than just the most fortunate in society. ""We are a global community and I think we are better for it. ""We really don't want to be building walls.""

449,Mt Wellington cable car project drops restaurant in hope to win approval,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Mt Wellington cable car project scales down proposal in hope to get green light The proponent of a cable car project on Hobart's kunanyi/Mount Wellington says it has made a ""regrettable"" move to scale back its plan in an attempt to see the project win approval. The Mount Wellington Cableway Company appealed against the Hobart City Council's refusal of their proposal to the Resource Management and Planning Appeal Tribunal. The Hobart City Council rejected the project in July, after an independent planner's report found it would diminish the tourism, recreational, cultural and landscape values of the mountain. There were 21 grounds for refusal, with a further nine later added to the appeal. The company has now submitted a revised proposal, which chairman Chris Oldfield said would reduce the size of the pinnacle centre by about 40 per cent. ""We're proposing now that we won't have a fine dining restaurant, we'll remove that. We'll still have a cafe,"" he said. ""We'll also reduce the operating hours basically to daylight hours, except we won't start the cableway until after 9am on school days."" The number of people who can travel in the cabins has been reduced from 80 to 40. ""It's regrettable, but we've listened to what the community's had to say, we've listened to the council,"" Mr Oldfield said. Mr Oldfield said the route over the Organ Pipes was the best choice from both an environmental and scenic point of view. Residents Opposed to the Cable Car has slammed the revised proposal as ""development by stealth"", with the new plans not required to be advertised for public comment. ""This proponent appears willing to do and say anything to get a foot in the door and a lease for public land on the summit of kunanyi,"" spokesman Vica Bayley said. ""No-one should have any confidence that the abandoned restaurant won't be reinstated in a future development application, to be considered once the special values of kunanyi have been compromised by the construction of the cable car, cafe, bar and function centre."" Asked whether the company would consider making subsequent changes, Mr Oldfield said: ""While I remain chair of the cableway we won't be coming back with any second proposals to make the scheme larger, I can give that personal guarantee."" Mr Bayley disputed the company's claims that it had listened to feedback. ""While this revised application seeks to overcome some of the now-30 grounds of refusal, it does nothing to address others,"" he said. ""These changes do nothing to avoid the bulldozing of swift parrot and masked owl nesting trees, the traffic on residential streets, noise, sewage and odour. ""Bus-sized carriages are still proposed to cut across the Organ Pipes every 15 minutes. ""There is still a 35-metre-tall tower atop the mountain and it's impossible to see how abandoning a significant commercial element of the development will turn around the already discredited claims of economic benefit."" The amendments will now be considered by the parties to the appeal in an attempt to reach a mediated outcome.

451,Silo art trail gets a boost with work beginning on Rochester's third silo — not easy for an artist afraid of heights,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Silo art trail receives boost with work beginning on Rochester's third silo Artist Jimmy Dvate is set to start painting the third of Rochester's silos as part of efforts to continue the famous silo art trail in regional Victoria. The silo will complement the two existing murals he has done at the Northern Highway site and the residents of Rochester are hoping the new art will draw more people to stop and spend money in the town. But painting such a huge canvas is not as easy as it looks. Dvate said as long as 90 per cent of the image fits within the face of the silo, the curvature of the structure would not appear distorted. ""I am actually [scared of heights]. Not too bad, but I'm not a massive fan of it so I have a few tricks to play with myself to kind of overcome it,"" he said. ""I go as high as I possibly can to start with and then drop down a little bit and that tricks my brain into thinking I'm lower than I am. ""Once I get into the zone and painting, it's just the first few days that are wobbly."" Today will involve putting the metal primer on the silo as an undercoat for the artwork. The work is part of a range of artwork and attractions in the town including the Rochester Sports Museum founded by late sporting identity John Forbes and the mural dedicated to former Victorian police homicide detective Ron Iddles. The Rochester Riverside Holiday Park has been redeveloped along with a new all-abilities fishing and kayak launch platform on the Campaspe River. The Rochester silo project committee's Kate Taylor said the mural would remain a mystery until people figured it out and work was expected to be completed by December. ""We're very excited. There's a little bit of secrecy around what it might be,"" Ms Taylor said. ""People are starting to guess. It's obviously some kind of local fauna. ""We're hoping someone will guess before they actually start."" The other two silos depict a squirrel glider and an azure kingfisher. Ms Taylor said there was a significant boost for local businesses when the first two were painted. ""There's definitely been a boost for local businesses especially when it was painted back in 2018, the local business saw such a growth in business and traffic going through,"" she said. ""Lots of people from out of town, we called it 'not local money', so it was great."" A Griffith University study released in August this year suggested silo art would not revive the economies of small towns on its own. The survey of 1,100 businesses, residents and visitors found only 47 per cent of businesses noticed a collective economic impact for their entire town after a painted silo opened. In the past six years, almost 50 silos have been painted nationwide. ABC Central Victoria will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday. Sign up to stay connected.

454,"When COVID and burnout led Fred back home, he found unexpected happiness",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus As COVID-19 descended on the Australia east coast nearly two years ago, Fred Porter found himself in the midst of a personal crisis. He'd worked himself to the point of burnout. On Queensland's Gold Coast, lockdowns threatened to separate him from his family in Western Australia, and the fast-paced city life he'd once yearned for had lost its lustre. Little did he know, this low point, combined with new communications technology, led Mr Porter home to a remote West Australian farm, where he has found himself happier than ever in a place he was once desperate to escape from. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic As a kid growing up on a remote farming property some 600 kilometres north of Perth, Mr Porter often found himself dreaming of far-flung places. ""I remember growing up here and just thinking it was really the end of the Earth,"" he said. ""I'd look over the horizon and I'd always want to know what was beyond the horizon."" Many assumed he'd take on the family farm, but with no pressure from his mum and dad to do so, Mr Porter was quick to dismiss such ideas. ""I remember my grandmother asking me as the only boy in the family when I would be taking over the farm and I looked at her straight in the eyes at a very young age and I said to her, 'Oh no, I won't be taking over this farm,'"" Mr Porter said. ""'I'm going to be living in my own apartment with my own air conditioner' because having an air conditioner when it's 40 degrees out here was pretty much the most luxurious thing I could think of."" Fast-forward through the decades and Mr Porter was enjoying the life he'd once dreamed of as a boy on the family farm. Life was a whirlwind of nightclubs, parties, travel and building a career in marketing and entertainment. He worked and travelled with the likes of the Wiggles, and Yo Gabba Gabba, and counts DJ Lance Rock as a friend. He'd launched his own marketing business, met the man who'd become his life partner, and eventually achieved his childhood dream: buying an apartment on the Gold Coast complete with its own air conditioner. Technology meant he could work from wherever he wished. He spent one summer in Mexico and dreamed of working from hotel pools around the globe. ""I went to Cancun and did my work poolside while there was some foam party coming out of a hotel that was shaped like a pyramid,"" he laughed. ""I did think I was going to be working out of a five-star hotel in a New York loft remotely, because I could do that too."" But Mr Porter's fast-paced life pushed him to the point of burnout. Then came COVID. Desperate for a break, and yearning for the comfort of family, Mr Porter and his partner Vince Pruiti-Ciarello packed up and headed back to the Porter family farm to recoup. Improved telecommunications technology meant Mr Porter could continue to run his business remotely. And, much to their surprise, the duo found the isolation, the quiet and the rigours of farm work strangely satisfying. While continuing to work in entertainment, marketing and promotions from home, Mr Porter lent a hand with the harvest, got swept up in his dad's nature conservation efforts and started to imagine a life that combined the best of city work with the joys of being with his parents in their older age, and enjoying the tranquillity of country living. ""It's a really exciting time to work remotely and to live regionally. All of those things I needed to be in the city for just don't apply anymore — I can actually get my work done anywhere. ""And [I've realised] I have this deep connection to this land as well. ""I really feel right now that I've come home and that this is the right place to be.""

455,"'It's amazing the prices people are paying': Holiday home rental listed for $22,000 a week",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Holiday home rent on NSW South Coast skyrockets more than 30 per cent The price of taking a holiday on the New South Wales South Coast has skyrocketed, with a week’s accommodation costing up to $22,000. McGrath Real Estate manager Kelly Robertson said the increase was due to a post-lockdown rush of Sydney travellers wanting to escape combined with the popular peak season. She said all 70 of the properties she managed were fully booked over the Christmas-New Year period, and prices had risen by up to 30 per cent from last year as a result of the demand. ""We are moving over to a new booking system and the prices are not set tariffs, the system fluctuates,"" Ms Robertson said. ""We enter a minimum amount and it sets the price for us depending on the season and demand. ""It is amazing the prices people are paying."" Ms Robertson said a number of premium properties in the Mollymook area were listed for more than $10,000 per week for a family home. Further north in Kiama Downs, some rentals were going for even more — a property overlooking Jones Beach was listed for more than $22,000. But the price of most holiday homes being rented privately had not increased so drastically, according to South Coast Escapes owner Catherine Shields. ""It would only be a handful of agencies using the dynamic pricing software,"" Ms Shields said. ""The vast majority of people are renting houses out through Airbnb or Stayz and might have put them up 10 per cent, but not very much."" Ms Shields said her business had been busy with Sydney travellers in particular. She said it was a welcome influx after the COVID lockdown. ""Because a lot of people who own holiday houses have not got an ABN, they have not been able to claim any compensation for the losses on their rentals over the last couple of years,"" she said. ""A lot of people have done it really tough. ""It is great to see the demand up now, but as soon as people can travel overseas it will drop off."" She also recommended booking directly with the home owner rather than through corporate websites for a better deal.

456,Perth Airport 'missed the mark' in move to recognise traditional owners on boarding gates,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Perth Airport 'missed the mark' in move to recognise traditional owners on boarding gates Perth Airport has become the first major airport in Australia to recognise traditional owners on its domestic boarding gates. The airport said it consulted local communities and councils to determine language group labels for 57 destinations across Australia. Perth Airport's chief commercial officer Kate Holsgrove described it as a small but meaningful step in its path towards reconciliation. ""Acknowledging the traditional custodians on the boarding gates helps us recognise and respect the rich Aboriginal culture and history across Australia,"" she said. ""It allows us to pay our own respects as well as help start a conversation and educate our travelling public, our airport community and ourselves around that rich culture."" Ms Holsgrove said it had been a lengthy process to select the traditional custodians to recognise on the boarding gates. ""What we've done is looked at a number of factors, so we've looked at the AIATSIS (the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies) map, for instance, which shows those traditional custodian groups,"" Ms Holsgrove said. ""We've consulted Native Title claims, we've looked at local government sites, engaged with local shires and councils to best identify the traditional custodians for each of the almost 60 ports that we fly to across Australia."" But some Indigenous leaders have raised concerns the labels for their countries are not accurate. Jennell Reynolds from the Esperance Tjaltjraak Native Title Aboriginal Corporation said the name selected for Esperance — Ngadju Country — is not correct. ""I'm not quite sure how they came about having … the name, Ngadju, when it's clearly on Wudjari country,"" she said. ""Obviously the genuine meaningful comment they made about acknowledging First Nations people when they didn't even have the courtesy to come and talk to traditional owner groups was disappointing. ""They've sort of missed the mark in relation to what they're trying to achieve."" Ms Holsgrove said Perth Airport was keen to work with traditional owners and communities, and would change the names based on their feedback. ""We've made a conscious decision to be bold and to take steps immediately to recognise the traditional owner groups in each of the ports we serve,"" she said. ""We very much welcome the discussion and want to make sure we get this right and learn and grow along the way, as well as educate the passengers that we serve.""

459,Merimbula Tourism wants to celebrate return of visitors with a bang,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Merimbula Tourism is fundraising the costs needed to organise the town's New Year's Eve fireworks displays. The Bega Valley Shire Council, which has previously funded the event, told the ABC in October that it could not afford to this year due to ""budgetary pressures"". But Merimbula Tourism board member Lynn McColl said the group was trying to raise $20,000 to run it instead. ""It was pretty disappointing that it couldn't go ahead,"" Ms McColl said. ""It would be lovely now that the borders are open to be able to celebrate having our visitors back again."" Merimbula, along with other NSW Far South Coast towns like Eden and Tathra, traditionally host a large number of Victorian tourists over the Christmas and New Year period, as well as visitors from Sydney and Canberra. The peak summer tourism season across the region has been challenged over the past couple of years since the 2019-2020 bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. But there's optimism about the summer ahead after regional travel resumed in NSW earlier this month, and Ms McColl hoped the fireworks could encapsulate that. ""It's traditional I guess … it's a bit of a drawcard,"" she said. ""It's a celebration of getting some sort of normality back into our lives and putting the last couple of years behind us."" Merimbula Tourism has so far gathered about half the costs in order to run the event, but needed to get the remaining money within the next three weeks in order to organise equipment like fencing, security and fireworks in time. In a statement issued to the ABC in October, the Bega Valley Shire Council acknowledged the impact its decision not to fund the event would have on the community. ""Due to a number of budgetary pressures, including the ongoing effect of compounding and unprecedented natural disasters, funding for the community events grants program was reduced in the 2021-22 financial year,"" the BVSC's Director of Community Environment and Planning Alice Howe said. ""This funding source has supported New Year’s Eve events in the past. ""We know this is disappointing for the community, however we have had to make a number of tough decisions to reduce our expenditure to ensure council remains financially sustainable into the future."" The fireworks were traditionally held at Merimbula's Ford Oval, close to Main Beach and Mitchies Jetty, but could be viewed at a number of vantage points across town, like Spencer Park and Bar Beach. Owner of Merimbula Aquarium and Wharf Restaurant Anthony Daly said the fireworks were a crucial part of the town's entertainment during New Year's Eve. ""People have already been asking me what entertainment have we got in Merimbula … and it's either to go into a club or a restaurant … but there's limited spaces with that,"" he said. ""We need something for the families … we need something to celebrate that this year is over with.""

460,'People in this region are survivors and they'll have a crack': Regional tourism gets $100 million boost,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Major projects to boost tourism in regional areas will now be eligible for up to $10 million each in state funding. Minister for Tourism, Sport and Major Events Martin Pakula was in the King Valley to launch the Victorian government's $100 million Regional Tourism Investment Fund, which aims to support new tourism attractions and experiences. Speaking at Dal Zotto winery, Mr Pakula invited shovel-ready projects to apply for between $150,000 and $10 million per project. ""We're calling on the private sector, local government, local tourism boards, all of those who can bring forward great projects that will catalyse tourism investment in this region,"" he said. The state government is particularly looking for projects that focus on First Nations, epicurean, nature-based, and arts and culture tourism — four areas that were identified in the Visitor Economy Recovery and Reform Plan as Victoria's areas of ""natural advantage"". Expressions of interest are open now until January, and successful projects are expected to be announced by May 2022. Those projects should be ready to begin within nine months of funding being allocated. Mr Pakula said this was about long-term investment in regional Victorian tourism. ""This is a small mainland state, but it is huge in terms of the tourism offering in every corner of the state,"" he said. ""We're looking for projects that fit the same bill — inspirational thinking that will translate into more visitors and jobs."" It is hoped the money will bring a much-needed boost to the region, which has suffered greatly from the COVID-19 pandemic coming in on the heels of the Black Summer bushfires. Amber Gardner from Tourism North East said the industry employed more than 30 per cent of locals. ""Tourism forms the absolute economic backbone of our region, so it's crucial to our vibrancy and success. But over the past two years the industry has been absolutely decimated,"" Ms Gardner said, adding that the region had lost 4.6 million tourists worth $2.2 billion in visitor spending. ""[This funding] will be crucial in developing the tourism experiences that will accelerate our economic recovery and drive a new phase of growth for the region."" Mr Pakula acknowledged the region was facing many other issues, including critical worker and housing shortages. He hoped that some of the labour pressures would soon be relieved by the arrival of international students, as well as young Melburnians keen to get out of the city. ""It's a great opportunity for young people to learn a skill, to live in a magnificent part of our state and to earn good money, and I think that's something that's incumbent on industry and government collectively to promote,"" he said. Michael Dal Zotto, CEO of the winery, thinks the north east would rise to the challenge and take advantage of what was on offer. ""You'll be surprised by how many things come from the King Valley region — ideas, plans and exciting opportunities that will be put forward,"" he said. ""People in this region, they're survivors and they'll have a crack.""

461,Producers rejoice as Tasmania's Launceston named world foodie city by UNESCO,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  UNESCO names Tasmania's Launceston a City of Gastronomy Tasmania's main northern city Launceston is already known for its heritage buildings — but food culture is its latest claim to fame. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has named Launceston as a City of Gastronomy under its Creative Cities Network. It means the region of northern Tasmania — which is home to hundreds of agricultural producers, dozens of vineyards and has a rich history of flour mills — has been recognised globally as one the world's best food destinations. Kim Seagram, who co-founded two Launceston restaurants as well as the Harvest Market, and is the chair of Fermentation Tasmania, said the honour was great endorsement for the city. ""It allows everybody to stand up a little bit taller and be a little bit prouder about what we do down here and it will allow people to really take notice,"" she said. ""We're now going to stand out as one of the great food regions of the world."" Gastronomy is the relationship between food and culture — or as many Launcestonians like to say, it is the relationship between food and people. Cities need to submit a bid to UNESCO to be bestowed with a creative city title. The Creative Cities Network was established in 2004, and aims to promote cooperation between endorsed cities and encourage sustainable development. Cities can be recognised under seven creative categories: craft and folk arts, design, movie, gastronomy, literature, digital arts and music. Thirty-six cities globally have been bestowed with the City of Gastronomy honour. Bendigo was named in 2019, the only other Australian city to have been recognised in past years. To be approved as a City of Gastronomy, cities need to meet a number of UNESCO criteria, including: Launceston food entrepreneurs decided three years ago to vie for the title and formed a steering committee, made up of 24 passionate industry producers and experts, to make a formal submission to UNESCO. Businessman Andrew Pitt, who is on the Launceston Gastronomy board, said the city decided to make the submission because of its growing food culture. ""For cities our size, there's really only one or two things usually that you can go for, and you really need to lean into what your regional strengths are — for us it was obviously food,"" Mr Pitt said. ""What's happened over the last 15 years is that our history of food culture had starting emerging through new products and new ways of thinking about food."" Well, no. But the city does have a paddock-to-plate culture. Mr Pitt said the honour was about embracing the whole of Launceston's ""food system"" and ""supply chain"" — from the paddock to the manufacturing process to retail sales. ""It's all about making this city and this region world famous for what we do here in sustainable food systems and gastronomy,"" Mr Pitt said. ""The big aspect of it is looking to collaborate with other cities around the world who are also thinking in creative and collaborative ways to solve these problems, such as food insecurity or poor access to food, low nutrition, and also environmental sustainability issues."" Launceston is also home to northern Tasmania biggest food and wine festival Festivale which prior to the COVID-19 pandemic attracted up to 30,000 people each year. Every Saturday, the city also hosts a traditional farmers market called Harvest. Plans are also underway for an Indigenous food garden to be developed in the city at the University of Tasmania's new Inveresk site. Ms Seagram said as well as being about branding and attracting more foodies to the city, the recognition would allow producers and growers to tap into new global markets. ""We'll now have a network across 36 different cities of gastronomy across the world to be able to trade, solve problems and collaborate with,"" she said. Lauren Byrne and Michael Layfield grow vegetables on their farm 30 kilometres outside of Launceston. Most weekends they sell their produce at the Launceston Harvest Market. Ms Byrne said she was not surprised Launceston had been bestowed with the City of Gastronomy title. ""My husband and I originally moved up to the north of the state because the climate really appealed to us as growers,"" Ms Byrne said. ""We're very lucky here in the north of Tassie that we have a climate that can produce a varied diet of different products. ""We have the really cold winters, which produce the most beautiful, sweet brassicas like cabbage, broccoli and kale. ""Then we have really lovely, usually consistently warm summers, where you can produce things like melon."" Ms Byrne hoped the title would draw more people to the idea that ""food connects us all"". ""Food is something we all have in common, and we're so fortunate in Tassie to have such fantastic produce and producers who are really passionate about everything from the seed all the way onto the plate.""

463,Operators hope for tourism bonanza when SA borders reopen,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Limestone Coast tourist operators rollout the welcome mat ahead of SA border opening Limestone Coast tourism operators are gearing up for an influx of tourists when the South Australian border opens on November 23. Despite some concerns COVID-19 will creep into the state, businesses operating near the South Australian-Victorian border say they are looking forward to a tourism boom. Linda Hay, who operates tourism attraction Echo Farm at Mount Gambier, said she was hoping tourists from Victoria would flow across the state partition when borders opened. ""We're hoping to get visitors from Victoria. Around 50 per cent of our market is Victorian, and we've really missed them,"" Ms Hay said. ""We are looking forward to an influx of tourists. ""I'm sure the people that have been locked down in New South Wales and Victoria in particular, are really looking forward to getting out and travelling."" But she said some people were too scared to book in advance. ""So the last eight months, we've hardly had any forward bookings,"" she said. Blue Lake Holiday Park Julie Cowley manager said she was looking forward to the number of caravanners increasing once borders opened. ""The only thing we've really noticed is the caravanners are not there,"" Ms Cowley said. ""The grey nomads who usually hit the road and travel throughout the year, that's what we're missing at the moment more than anything."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC South East SA's weekly email newsletter. She said the Mount Gambier tourist park had remained busy during the border closures in large part to South Australian travellers. ""We had a huge influx last year because of South Australians being allowed to travel,"" Ms Cowley said. ""Generally, the Christmas school holidays are busy. So, we're hoping that's going to be the same this year."" Robe District Council tourism and events manager Molly Murdock said the popular seaside tourist town was expecting a rush of visitors when borders opened. ""Accommodation providers have already seen an influx of booking enquiries coming through, particularly from Victorians,"" Ms Murdock said. She said the support of South Australians travelling within the state had helped keep Robe tourism operators in business. ""In Robe, we have seen a great number of South Australians visiting Robe for the first time ever,"" Ms Murdock said. ""We anticipate that they will become frequent Robe visitors which is great for our town. ""Our Spendmapp by Geographia data shows us that in 2020/21 we saw an increase of approximately $24 million spent in Robe compared to the previous financial year. ""Visitor spending actually increased by approximately 62 per cent in 2020/21 compared to 2019/20, so overall as a whole, Robe benefited economically,"" she said.

465,Qantas A380 soars back to Sydney after gathering dust for more than 500 days,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  After more than 500 days gathering dust in storage first in Los Angeles and then in Dresden in Germany,  a Qantas A380 superjumbo has roared back across Australian skies for the first time since 2020. The Hudson Fysh was one of thousands of planes that were grounded at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as borders around the world slammed shut and the bulk of international travel ground to a halt. Billions of dollars of mothballed aircraft were parked in hot, dry regions around the world, including Australia's Alice Springs. But after Australia lifted its international travel ban last week, the renewed demand for flights has seen Qantas bring the A380 out of storage earlier than planned. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said high vaccination rates had been invaluable to getting the A380 back in the skies. ""Literally six months ago we didn't think they'd be back until the earliest at the end of 2023, that's how much things have moved in Australia, how much the vaccine roll-out has actually helped,"" he said. He said there had been a huge surge in both domestic and international bookings. ""When the borders reopened on November 1, we had to add 20 flights to London there was so much demand. ""In the last two weeks we've had 500,000 domestic bookings compared to 20,000 in a two week period in August, that's a 25-fold increase ,"" he said. While it seems Australians are keen to take to the skies once again, not all countries will welcome them with quarantine-free travel. The Department of Foreign Affairs said the growing list of options for fully vaccinated travellers included the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Italy, Greece, Germany and South Africa. Thailand and Singapore have also both reopened their borders, while those looking for a tropical escape relatively close to home can go to Fiji from December 1 — although travellers will have to self-isolate for two days on arrival.

466,Tour operator forced to scale back business to Uluru,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  An outback tourism operator in Alice Springs will temporarily discontinue its tours to Uluru due to a lack of visitors and worker unrest over vaccination. Emu Run tour owner Patrick Bedford said the Northern Territory government's vaccination mandate and the reopening of New South Wales' borders had played a key role in his decision to scale back the business. ""We had a couple of staff leaving in one week and it basically decimated my business. ""We used to operate with about 30-plus staff with casuals and full-timers, pre COVID. [Then] we were down to around 14 to 15."" Mr Bedford said they are now down to core staff of eight. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic ""To be honest [we can] just do the local touring around Alice Springs which will be the West MacDonnell Ranges ... the Alice Springs Desert Park and some airport shuttles. ""That's kind of all we're left with because we haven't got the capacity to do tours to Uluru."" Mr Bedford complained ""there's nobody coming to Central Australia."" ""For example, into Uluru there's only flights to Brisbane. So that means down there it's not very busy because  New South Wales and Victoria can't fly in there either. ""There's just a whole issue across the whole region; where we normally have internationals, we don't have a domestic market to fill that void in this coming month,"" he said. Mr Bedford said two of his staff were unwilling to be vaccinated. ""Funnily enough, we signed [one worker's] apprenticeship on the Wednesday and the [vaccination mandate] announcement was the next day. ""And she's like, 'Well, I'm not getting vaxxed,'"" he said. Mr Bedford said he had heard that other operators were also losing staff. ""I know some other operators that even the reservation staff — they didn't want to be getting vaccinated,"" he said. Mr Bedford said that the current situation was affecting his mental health. ""In the last couple of weeks, it really has taken its toll on me to be honest, ""This is the third time I've had to wind back my business ... mentally it's been quite challenging."" Tourism Central Australia chief executive Danial Rochford said that many businesses would lose employees as a result of the mandatory vaccination requirements. ""We're going to have a huge problem here in Central Australia. We're talking to our members constantly about this issue. ""We need 1,000 new employees from today,"" he said. Mr Rochford said that despite the region heading into the low season, the effects of staff shortages were enormous. ""This becomes a real problem, in fact a tsunami, when we start to see demand pick up earlier in 2022, which we expect ... once we see relaxation of borders,"" he said.

467,"How to fly long haul, stay safe from COVID and actually be comfortable",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  International borders are open, but with travel comes a 'personal responsibility' to prevent the spread of COVID-19 A clear bag full of mini toiletries, a 14-hour flight and a new stamp in the passport — it might all seem like a distant memory. If you're preparing for your first long-haul flight since the pandemic began, this will be the first time you'll have to navigate the terminal and the plane while also having to protect yourself from COVID-19. And as Australian states open their borders and we dare to make Christmas plans, it's wise to think about how to keep safe while travelling domestically too. Preparing for flights is no longer as simple as weighing your luggage and setting an early alarm, but experts have offered us advice on how to travel comfortably and arrive safe. One of the new non-negotiable items on your new pre-travel to do list is downloading your international vaccine certificate. You'll also need to be aware of and meet the entry requirements for your destination, and any stopover locations. If that involves a negative PCR test, you'll need to think about the specific requirements of that. It could mean making a booking at a private laboratory test for within three days of your flight. There is going to be a whole lot more paperwork and preparation to do before you fly, so leave yourself time to get it done. Overseas holidays are making a comeback. But they’re going to require a lot more planning, including contingencies in case you get sick while you're away. Once you've got that sorted, experts recommend thinking about how to best protect yourself in transit. In Australia, you must wear masks inside airports and onboard departing flights and you will only be flying with people who are vaccinated or have exemptions. But these circumstances may change as you move across the world. Jennifer Sisson, chief medical officer of Travel Doctor-TVMC and dean of the faculty of travel medicine at the Australasian College of Tropical Medicine, said travellers had a ""personal responsibility"" to do as much as possible to prevent the spread of COVID-19. ""Australians will be mixing with people from everywhere, from countries with different risks of COVID,"" she said. ""We have to remember a lot of the world is not vaccinated yet and that's going to continue to be a risk to us."" That means a return to some of the most simple, but effective infection control practices — hand washing, using hand sanitiser, wearing a well-fitting mask and social distancing as much as possible. Dr Sisson recommends packing a hygiene kit in your carry-on luggage. ""That includes masks — disposable masks — hand sanitiser, disinfectant wipes, so they've got all of those things available to use,"" she said. ""In general masks are thought to be good for four to five hours, so generally after sitting with a mask on for that period of time we would say it's a good idea to change it, so people do need to take a reasonable supply of masks with them and they all need to be disposed of properly as well."" In airports across the world and as you board flights, you may find masks and other hygiene items are made available to you, so take the opportunity to stock up. It's also a good idea to travel with plastic snap-lock bags. If you're unable to dispose of used masks promptly, keep them stored securely until you can. Over the past 18 months, airlines have been open about their cleaning protocols. Qantas says its planes are cleaned with a disinfectant, ""with a focus on the high contact areas of seats, seatbelts, overhead lockers, air vents and toilets"". While you're getting settled, Dr Sisson suggested giving your seat a once over with a disinfectant wipe. ""When you first get to your seat, wipe down all the areas you're likely to be touching regularly."" You'll also have to manage your expectations about just how much you can move around inside the cabin during the flight. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says passengers need to ""avoid unnecessary movement"" and ""congregating when waiting to use the toilet"". ""Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, especially after contact with commonly touched surfaces,"" the association said. The IATA also warned food and beverage services might be simplified to decrease crew movement and interaction with passengers. A 14-hour flight is one situation where you may have long wished to be socially distanced. ""While the bookings on planes are relatively light, they will continue to spread people as much as possible in terms of seating,"" Dr Sisson said. ""And at the airport, prior to leaving, avoid getting into big crowds as much as possible."" The departure halls of an airport might provide enough space to social distance, but eventually there is a high chance you will end up in the very small space that is an economy seat with a stranger just a few centimetres away. World-leading expert on air quality and its health implications Lidia Morowska said the close proximity on planes was the biggest risk factor. ""The difference is the space — the volume — is much smaller and normally the ventilation is much better in terms of air exchange per hour. It's very fast ventilation, so from that point of view, it is better than in many environments on the ground,"" she said. ""However, the issue is proximity to people. ""On the ground, we are saying we should be separated by 1.5 metres, this is of course impossible on the plane where we are basically sitting and touching another passenger. ""So before the ventilation takes effect and removes the virus potentially emitted by someone, there is enough possibility the passenger sitting next to that person will inhale it and this is happening over hours and hours of a long-haul flight, so the risk increases, there is no doubt about this."" Dr Morowska said it was important to remember the increased transmission risk of the Delta variant. ""From an infection point of view, Delta means there is significantly more virus emitted. So, that means there is a higher risk because a shorter exposure time is enough to be infected,"" she said. You know you'll have to wear a mask on the flight, and change it periodically, but the fit of the mask is also very important. ""If you want to protect yourself, you need to ensure that there's a good fit,"" Dr Morowska said. ""You can have a very good mask in terms of efficiency where the virus doesn't go through the mask, but if the mask is not fitted properly, if it's loose on the face, then … [the virus] is going around the mask to the face and it's not doing anything,"" she said. On a long flight, you have to eat food and drink water. Dr Morowska said the best strategy was to wear a well-fitting mask for as long as you could, and accept the small risk that comes with taking it off to quickly eat and drink. You made it overseas, the holiday was amazing and now you turn towards the long journey home. Getting back into Australia will require a negative PCR test result within 72 hours of your departure, so make time to get that done and be careful in the days before it. ""We know the Delta virus has an incubation period of about four to five days, so it's a lot shorter than it used to be,"" Dr Sisson said. ""You don't want to be getting exposed in the days before you're going to be getting your PCR test to return home, so that's really important."" Australia may be starting to reopen its borders, but after months of yearning to come home, I find myself nervous about the prospect of returning. And you may have thought about packing a few rapid antigen tests. Those tests could help give you peace of mind, but ultimately if you have symptoms, you should get a PCR test and that's also the standard of test you'll need to re-enter Australia. ""The result of a rapid antigen test is not always reliable, but I think with time it's going to be fairly normal for people to be travelling with these and using them"" Dr Sisson said. ""I think if people do use them and they get a positive result, they can't assume it is a true positive. ""Generally we would always recommend they get it confirmed by having a PCR test."" We know activities such as singing and talking to someone in close proximity increase the risk of transmission. You may not have needed another reason to avoid eye contact with the person next to you, politely don headphones and evade a long-haul conversation, but for the record, Dr Morowska says avoiding ""situations where you are talking to someone directly for a long period of time"" will help keep you safe. She also suggested keeping an eye on your hydration level and sinus health to stay comfortable while flying. ""If your respiratory tract is dry then you are at a much higher risk of contracting anything, so keeping that saline solution [handy] and hydrating, is a very important measure,"" she said. ""It's important in any situation, but particularly on the plane, where usually the humidity is lower than other environments, so the potential for dehydration is higher."" COVID-19 has brought new risks that could impact you when you travel abroad — here's what you need to know about how travel insurance has changed since the start of the pandemic. Travel during the pandemic really involves a constant assessment of your risk and taking steps to reduce it. Dr Sisson reminds us that ""vaccination doesn't work the same in everyone"" and urges each individual to think about a scenario where they contract COVID overseas, how severe the disease could be and what they would do to look after themselves. ""There are people who are at much higher risk than others,"" she said. ""So it's really important for anyone who has any concerns to make sure that they see their GP or go to a travel clinic to have an assessment if they have any health issues that they worry about in terms of their risk of COVID."" Travel insurance does not cover Australians in places where the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has recommended we ""do not travel"". DFAT's global ""do not travel"" advisory has now been lifted and insurance is once again available for travel to some parts of the world. And COVID cover is now possible, so you can start to address the risk of high medical and cancellation costs should you contract the disease. ""You can get COVID cover and it ends up costing about 10 per cent extra,"" Dr Sisson said. ""There will be circumstances where travel insurance is not available. For example, they're not covering COVID on multi-night cruises."" Dr Morowska said once we start travelling, ""we will immerse ourselves in environments where there are infections"" and in places where there are minimal precautions taken, such as the United Kingdom. ""All the [infection control] measures will reduce the risk, but they will not bring it completely to zero,"" she said.

468,'Very concerning': Tourism operators open up on shut-out fears ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tourism operators are fearful northern Western Australia could be locked out of the state's ""road map out of COVID"" because of the region's low vaccination rate. Premier Mark McGowan outlined a conservative reopening for the state which would hinge on 90 per cent of the state's population aged above 12 years old being fully vaccinated by early 2022. But he indicated parts of regional WA that had lower vaccination rates could be subject to further internal travel restrictions. While restrictions are only expected to apply to unvaccinated travellers, tourism operators already impacted by WA's ongoing border closures fear any further disruption. Natasha Maher, chief executive of tourism marketing board Australia's North West, said the possibility of further lockouts was ""very concerning"". ""I just don't want to see that happen. ""Closing down the Pilbara or Kimberley would be absolutely detrimental to many businesses, in particular the tourism industry."" Vaccination rates in WA's north have been amongst the lowest in the nation, particularly in some Indigenous communities. Broome camel tour operator John Geappen said he understood the concern about the low vaccination rates and how the virus could affect vulnerable populations. But he is hopeful there will be an increase in vaccinations before the peak tourism season begins. ""I'll have to play it by ear. By March I hope things will be where they needed to be and we won't be affected adversely,"" Mr Geappean said. Colin Woodman, chief executive of Ardyaloon Community, said his tiny community, north of Broome on the Dampier Peninsula, currently has a 55 per cent  of its residents fully vaccinated rate, while 80 per cent have received a single dose. ""Just get vaccinated and it solves all the problems."" Wyndham East Kimberley Shire president David Menzel said it would be a huge blow for tourism and agriculture — sectors already plagued by worker shortages — if the region was to be cut off. ""I'm really concerned about our next tourist season which will be our third one in a row that could be significantly impacted,"" he said. Mr Menzel had hoped the Premier would set firm opening dates at his announcement. ""We need a clear date to open up. It would provide significant motivation to our community on whether they want to be vaccinated before that date or not,"" Mr Menzel said. ""There's some mixed messages that you've got to get vaccinated on one hand, but we'll keep you locked down and there will be no COVID in your community on the other hand."" ""I'm confident we'll get the towns up to a decent vaccination rate. My gut feeling is getting that last ten per cent is maybe impossible.""

469,Step back in time when the 'romantically adventurous' ventured underground,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Ngilgi Cave's rich history includes fossils, Dreamtime and the 'romantically adventurous' Since 1900, Ngilgi Cave has been the unlikely honeymoon destination, the site of a world record feminist cave sit, and the home of an infamously narrow tunnel. But the human history of Ngilgi began with the Wardandi people, whose Dreamtime story of the spirit Ngilgi gives the wondrous underground network its name. Ngilgi Cave site manager Tod Kearns says the Wardandi people have known about and used the cave for more than 60,000 years. It wasn't until the 1890s that Europeans first learnt of the cave. In the early 1900s entrepreneur Edward Dawson managed to convince waves of adventurous young honeymooners from Perth to explore the underground attraction. Mr Kearns said the trip would have been a huge adventure for the travellers who visited the site in groups of 40 or 50. ""It was a couple of days journey on a steam train down to Busselton, and then a horse and cart from Busselton down to the cave."" They then slept in swags at the cave's entrance, before braving an eight-hour trek through the underground with no boardwalks, lighting or infrastructure. ""Because they were mostly on their honeymoon, they would dress up in their finest attire for the journey,"" Mr Kearns said. ""Ladies were dressed in corsets, hoop dresses and petticoats. Men in a three-piece suit with a top hat, with only candles to light their way."" He said the ""romantically adventurous"" would sometimes break away from the main group to a dark corner of the cave for their ""romantic endeavours"". ""That [spot] became coined 'Cupid's Corner'."" Ngilgi enjoyed steady popularity with tourists until the 1920s before a visitor infamously became stuck in one of the cave's key passageways. ""He was an accountant named Heinrich Harney, a very large man. ""The story goes that it took about eight hours to get Heinrich out."" Mr Kearns said they removed most of Harney's clothes and slathered him in cooking oil in a desperate attempt to free him. ""All the while, he's wedged in this hole there were two families with young children trapped in the main chamber because Heinrich was blocking the exit."" Harney was eventually freed but the incident made quite a splash in the press. ""Once they'd done that ... people were a little more reluctant to come to the cave."" The passage became known as ""Harney's Pinch"". About 40 years later the publican of nearby Caves House Hotel paid a Kalgoorlie miner to pack explosive gelignite into the walls of Harney's Pinch to create a more accommodating passage for visitors. In 1963, Ngilgi was in the media spotlight again when local beautician Dorothy Williams embarked on a world record 90-day cave sit. ""She did it because there was a local man named Wyndham Rendell that came down just before her and set the world record at 87 days in the cave without leaving,"" Mr Kearns said. Williams did not just want to one-up Rendell, she was out to make a statement. ""She wanted to prove that women could do anything that men could do.""

470,'Just another nail in the coffin': Tourism misses out after Alice Springs Masters Games postponed again,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The Alice Springs Masters Games has been postponed until 2023 due to the global coronavirus pandemic, the NT government has confirmed. The biennial event was also cancelled in 2020 due to the pandemic. Northern Territory Minister for Major Events Natasha Fyles said a range of uncertainties connected to the pandemic lead to the decision. ""There's nothing normal about what's happening right now,"" Ms Fyles said. ""I know people want us to return to the previous normal, but we're going to be on track for a new normal. ""Part of that is how we live with COVID going forward."" Ms Fyles said the decision to cancel the event was made in the past few weeks. ""We needed to start to sign off on milestones and get into contracts. ""We just weren't able to do that with any certainty because of the global pandemic."" Ms Fyles said a multi-sport event like the Masters Games would be more susceptible to COVID outbreaks. ""If we suddenly had five of the touch football teams or people not being able to come it would really interrupt that program,"" she said. The last Masters Games were held in 2018. Tourism Central Australia chief executive Danial Rochford said the loss of the games would cost the region between $7 and $10 million. ""Our industry is on its knees and we're facing down our darkest hours,"" he said. ""This decision on top of other decisions and other issues that our industry faces is just another nail in the coffin."" Mr Rochford said events like the games were crucial to the regional economy. ""We need more events. ""We need our Northern Territory government to stand up for Central Australia to mount the argument that we need more than just three major events,"" he said. Alice Springs Baseball president Lachlan Modrzynski says he is ""gutted"" by the decision to postpone the Masters Games for another 12 months. He said that normally six or seven teams came for the Alice Springs Masters Games. ""I would imagine the majority of folks will be disappointed. I even think a bit confused."" Mr Modrzynski said many people had been working hard behind the scenes across the country to build enthusiasm for the Alice Springs Masters Games in 2022. He hopes that enthusiasm can be sustained for another year. ""I think it's going to be hard to convince people to travel here to 2023, I really do. ""We've all done the right thing for so long, and yet we're still getting punished,"" he said.

471,Tourists chasing Outback Opal Hunters' experience boost tiny town's prospects,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Outback Opal Hunters TV show inspires tourists to begin fossicking in Opalton The red, rugged country of the remote Queensland outback is a far cry from the white powdery slopes of the French Alps, but there's nowhere else that Chamonix chairlift builder Remi Demazure would rather be. Mr Demazure and his partner Malicia Sliwimski had been travelling the world before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, and the pair managed to get into Australia to complete their pilgrimage to an unlikely location — Opalton. ""Since we were children, we grew up with these TV shows, Opal Hunters and Gold Hunters, and it's always been a dream to see the outback life, and we had this opportunity, so we thought why not."" Opalton, almost 1500 kilometres from Brisbane, has featured on the television show Outback Opal Hunters since 2018, and local miners attribute the rush of tourists to the remote location to the success of the internationally popular program. It's late in the tourist season, and most of the big crowds have retreated to cooler climates, but the camping grounds atop one of Queensland's largest opal fields are still alive with domestic and international travellers. It's a joyous sight for Queensland Boulder Opal Association (QBOA) secretary Alison Summerville, who says Opalton's tourism has relied on word of mouth for the past 40 years. ""I think the Outback Opal Hunters are far, far ahead of COVID,"" Mrs Summerville said. ""We've actually been restricted, because we used to get all the southern people come up from Victoria because it's warm, so we're expecting a bumper year next year and possibly even the year after when all these people go, 'thank God we can get up here and enjoy the warmth again'. ""To see it today, it brings me a lot of joy to hear all these young people chatting and talking, and how passionate they are about something that we're passionate about. ""We've been doing this for 30, 40 years and it's just fantastic."" Pickaxes have been downed, and mining machinery left dormant for a series of working bees over the past month to improve facilities to cater for the growing tourism demand. But it's just outside the Opalton Bush Park where the future of the region is being designed. QBOA president James Evert says the time is now to capitalise on the tourism boom and immortalise the stories of the past. ""What we're seeing is a generational change,"" Mr Evert said. ""We've got to capture this modern history from the 60s, 70s onwards, when a lot's happened here so the timing is right to grab it while the memories are still here."" The Opalton Exhibition and Visitors Centre is still in the design phase but will be unlike anything the mining outpost has ever seen. It's hoped the centre will provide the foundation of a bustling tourist industry. ""As a local coming from the Winton district, it's so great,"" he said. ""It's going to be a major attraction for all the tourists that come into the area, and the operators in the surrounding area to come here to Opalton confident there'll be people here to greet them."" Opal miner Col Duff has called Opalton home on and off since 1991, and is currently fixing up his campsite in preparation for retirement. Mr Duff has been watching the region he loves slowly develop over the past 30 years, but few can say they've contributed more to the spike in Opalton's global reputation than him. His opal fever and larrikin persona caught the eye of the producers of Outback Opal Hunters, resulting in his mining operation in Opalton debuting on the first season of the show, and securing the remote outback town's presence for the following six seasons. ""This has been the best opportunity to promote the outback, Winton Shire, Opalton, and the Bush Park for the past couple of years,"" he said. ""We've had heaps of people coming through, and that means it grows, we get more water tanks, more dongas, more shower and toilet blocks. ""This is a little community way out in the middle of nowhere, so to get people to come and visit is great, it gives miners a chance to sell stones, a bit of socialisation, and people get to enjoy the outback as it really is."" But is the dedicated opal hunter worried about all the extra fossickers and miners digging into his profits? ""We've probably only dug about 5 per cent of the known opal reserve here in Opalton, so we're not going to run out of ground to chase opals in,"" he said. ""This'll last 1,000 years.""

472,No cap on Tweed holiday letting despite housing crisis ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tweed Mayor predicts 'open slather' after council rejects holiday letting cap The Tweed Mayor says it is now open slather for short-term holiday letting in her shire as new regulations covering the sector come into effect elsewhere this week. The new state laws mean every home in regional New South Wales, outside Sydney, can be holiday let all year round unless council applies for a cap. A limit of 180 days of holiday letting per year is now in place in Ballina and parts of the lower Clarence, while Byron is still seeking a stricter 90-day cap. But Mayor Chris Cherry said her fellow Tweed shire councillors voted against a cap. She said the new state rules would override existing council planning restrictions which had set out where holiday letting was allowed. ""They didn't allow it [holiday letting] in low-density residential, the zoning which is on most of our towns and villages outside the main thoroughfares,"" Cr Cherry said. ""So it's a lot of area that was going to be impacted. ""We've basically now got open slather."" Cr Cherry said caps on holiday letting were designed to make more long-term rentals available in a region that is in the grip of a housing crisis. She said with no cap and more areas of the Tweed now eligible for short-term letting, a free reign for property owners could have the opposite effect. ""It is a massive issue for us here in terms of not having any available rentals for our key workers,"" Cr Cherry said. ""If we start to see a lot of tenants being told to vacate because the owners want to use them for short-term holiday let, then obviously I will try again."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC North Coast's weekly email newsletter. Tweed councillor James Owen said the cost of enforcing a cap was not something the council could afford. ""If it's only 180 days a year we need to have staff that are out there checking and they're already very busy doing other things,"" Cr Owen said. ""I think compliance is the main thing, but equally we can't control the market. ""If people want to put their houses out there for short-term letting then so be it. ""I don't think [a cap] is the answer to more affordable housing in the Tweed."" In the adjoining Byron Shire, the council is seeking permission from the NSW Government to cap short-term holiday lets to 90 days per year. Deputy Mayor Sarah Ndiaye said the aim of the strategy was to ""make it as unattractive as possible"" for investors looking to cash in on the holiday letting market. ""If there are some pressures on short-term holiday rentals I can live with that,"" she said. ""Because I think the devastation that's come from having over half our available rental stock available year round is just too big a price to pay. ""I just think it's great to have a cross section of our community that can still live here and make up the wonderful community that we know and love.""

473,Landlocked jetty keeps fishers high and dry,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," ABC Rural Port Gregory lobster fishers call for help with landlocked jetty Like a viewing platform in the middle of a beach — that's how lobster fisherman Greg Horsman describes the wooden fishing jetty at his hometown of Port Gregory. Built in 1980, the jetty on the West Australian mid-north coast provided lobster fishers, yachts and tourists with a safe place to secure their boats, but a build up of sand over the years has rendered it inaccessible to watercraft. The eight or so lobster boats based out of Port Gregory, north of Geraldton, are now forced to moor offshore and ferry their catch and bait to and from shore via dinghies. Fishers like Mr Horsman and Colin Suckling have been in a 10-year battle to get the state government to help move the sand. ""It adds a lot of double or triple handling of product, a lot more physically lifting for the crew and ourselves,"" Mr Suckling said. ""As one would say in colloquial terms, we're back in the Dark Ages in the cave."" It is a labour-intensive, expensive and sometimes dangerous exercise. Lobsters can lose quality when exposed to the elements; Mr Suckling estimated between 1 and 3 per cent of his catch was downgraded due to damage when transporting full pots from his fishing boat to shore. ""When you start losing $10 or $15 or $20 a kilo of your product, that's when it really hurts,"" he said. Mr Horsman said he wanted to see the sand around the jetty removed. ""I realise it possibly will fill in again, but at least if we dig it out — that's possibly the cheapest way to do it — we'll know what sort of a timeframe we're looking at for maintenance."" The jetty is not far from the world-famous Port Gregory pink lake. The fishermen said the region was missing out on further tourism opportunities of visitors being able to fish off the jetty or buy lobsters off the back of boats. ""We really need the Minister for Transport to come out and say, 'Right, we need this to get done',"" Mr Suckling said. The government funds regular maintenance dredging at Kalbarri, north of Port Gregory. Last month, Nationals MP Shane Love presented a grievance in parliament to the Minister for Ports and Transport, Rita Saffioti, calling for the jetty to be fixed. The Minister committed to visiting the area and seeing the jetty, but did not commit funding to fix it. In a written statement, Ms Saffioti said ongoing studies showed the sediment build up was not stopping. ""Given the uncertainty around future sediment build-up and variable local weather patterns, the Department of Transport will continue to monitor coastal processes in the area to determine whether long-term interventions become viable,"" she said.

474,'Do tourism differently': Sustainability expert says it's time to rethink how we travel,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  As international borders reopen, some say tourism should be more sustainable post-COVID With domestic and international borders gradually reopening, many tourism operators will be hoping for a swift return to pre-pandemic business conditions. But Emma Whittlesea, senior research fellow at the Griffith University Institute for Tourism, says there is a better option than simply getting back to normal. ""There's a great opportunity to do tourism differently,"" Dr Whittlesea tells ABC RN's Sunday Extra. She says the break in business-as-usual provides a chance ""to rethink how tourism can benefit community and environment and culture as well as the economy"". Pre-pandemic, concerns about the impact of mass tourism on local environments saw some destinations closed entirely. Thailand's Maya Bay, for example, featured in the Leonardo DiCaprio film The Beach, was closed to tourism in 2018 because of the damage to its ecosystem caused by thousands of people visiting each day. Sunday Extra presents a lively mix of national and international affairs, analysis and investigation. Meanwhile, residents of popular destinations such as Venice and Barcelona protested at the detrimental effect tourism was having on their lives. Dr Whittlesea says the pandemic has seen life in many of these places return a more ""normal"" state, with communities no longer being inundated by travellers. ""There's an opportunity to address those sustainability challenges, whether it be around waste, or emissions or impacts on communities that are negatively impacted by numbers of tourists,"" she says. She believes tourism can be harnessed as a force for positive change, one that helps ensure communities are ""viable and resilient into the future"". ""It's about a shift from growth, and profit at all costs, to a more regenerative way of thinking."" But, she says, government support will be needed for there to be anything more than gradual change. One place where many people are looking forward to a return of tourism is Fiji, which will welcome back international tourist flights from December 1. Tourism Fiji CEO Brent Hill says, so far, bookings from that date have exceeded their most optimistic expectations. ""There definitely is that pent up demand to come and travel to Fiji,"" he says. For many, the reopening can't come soon enough. Tourism makes up around 40 per cent of Fiji's GDP. Prior to the pandemic, Mr Hill says, about 150,000 people were directly employed by the country's tourism industry. Post-pandemic, he says, that number was more like 20–30,000. ""Unfortunately … we don't have the sort of level of government support that Australia does,"" he says. ""A lot of people just had to go back to their villages and try and work things out from there."" But sustainability is a pressing concern for the island nation. Fiji's attorney-general Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum has described climate change as an ""existential threat"", with 70 per cent of the country's population living within 5 kilometres of the shoreline. Mr Hill says many of Fiji's resorts are working to reduce their carbon footprint, with some going entirely off-grid. ""Tourists are increasingly asking more questions of operators and wanting to find out, you know, what their credentials are in that space,"" he says. Mr Hill says tourists don't only want to know that they're not contributing to the problem — they want to feel like they're a part of the solution. ""One of the things I think is fantastic with tourism is that you can absolutely involve tourists in that sustainability push,"" he says. He says the local tourism sector is undertaking programs in coral farming and marine life conservation. ""People coming to Fiji can participate in those kinds of activities and just help leave it a better place for generations to come, which I think is a really critical thing."" Dr Whittlesea says there are many other examples of tourism operators doing ""exceptional things"". ""[There's] a lot of great work happening, for example, in protected ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef where they're engaging tourists in looking after those systems and also raising awareness at the same time,"" she says. ""A lot of industry in those locations are becoming a lot more aware and making efforts to get eco-accreditation and to try and bring down their [carbon] footprint."" Prior to the pandemic, commercial aviation was generating 918 million metric tons of CO2 per year — more than 2 per cent of global CO2 emissions. Passenger transport made up 85 per cent of that total. ""Transport is by far the biggest component of the emissions footprint for tourism,"" says Dr Whittlesea. But, she says, the industry is working to change that, with airlines and airports making ""ambitious"" attempts to reduce emissions. Airline passengers made 5.7 million tonnes of waste last year, and there's no solution in sight. These include researching sustainable aviation fuels, as well as developing electric- and hydrogen-electric-powered aircraft. ""These are some of the really big things that could make really big changes to the emissions footprint,"" Dr Whittlesea says. However, she says, these programs are mostly industry-led. ""Without increasing regulatory and government support to help them transition, it's going to be a slow move."" Dr Whittlesea says there is already plenty of information on how to do tourism sustainably and many good examples of sustainable tourism. She says it's time to ""rethink how tourism can benefit community, environment and culture as well as the economy"". ""I think there's a really big opportunity for the sector and the industry to really embrace some of the other emerging challenges and existing challenges that we have — such as climate — and actually start to embed those in plans and policies and really maximize the benefits of tourism,"" she says. Dr Whittlesea says tourism has a ""strong potential to be a vehicle for change"". She says the pandemic is not only an opportunity to transform tourism, but also a chance to ""think about how we can really utilise tourism as a vehicle to make changes in lots of other parts of our society"". But at the moment, while she is hopeful for such a transformation, she's not seeing much evidence of it. ""At the moment, the focus seems to be just getting back on track,"" she says. ""It would be good to see us getting back on track differently — and better."" Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.

476,"Kimberley's Kooljaman campground officially closes, but hope is on the horizon ",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Kooljaman campground in WA's Kimberley officially closes, but hope is on the horizon An iconic Kimberley campsite overlooking pristine beaches and pindan red cliffs has officially closed to visitors, but there is hope it will not be shut forever. The shock closure of Kooljaman at Cape Levique was announced last month amid a tourism boom in Western Australia. Campground operators cited deteriorating infrastructure that they could not afford to replace or redevelop. It closed on Sunday after more than 30 years open to the public. The site is run by the Djarindjin and One Arm Point communities who lease the land from the Kooljaman Land Aboriginal Corporation (KLAC). KLAC chairwoman Rosanna Angus is a Bardi Jawi woman with family connections to Kooljaman and, like many in her family, once sat on the Kooljaman board. She said her family had high hopes to grow Kooljaman as a tourism destination. ""My Uncle Vincent Angus was one of the first tour operators that did the mud-crabbing tours at Kooljaman. He was known as 'mudcrab dundee,' she said. One of her proudest moments was watching Kooljaman inducted into the Tourism Council's Hall of Fame. ""Tourism was thriving,"" she said. ""It was busy, we had planes coming in, we had the bus coming in, I was doing dinners at night. It was just a busy place."" Ms Angus said a lack of communication between the landholders and lessees contributed to the closure of the site. However, she said she was now in talks with community leaders about how to carry out work on the site and reopen Kooljaman. ""There is hope for Kooljaman,"" she said. ""It's something that we've always known that it's going to resurrect again, but it's how fast or how slow it's going to happen."" ""We want to see Kooljaman thriving again."" Ms Angus called for urgent support from the government. ""Going forward if renovations and new developments need to happen it needs a whole injection of funding to support the next stages of Kooljaman,"" she said. The Kimberley Development Commission has undertaken a review into business operations at Kooljaman which is currently being considered by the state government. Djarindjin chairman Brian Lee runs tours on the Dampier Peninsular and is also optimistic Kooljaman will reopen. However, he said that was not likely to happen until 2023 after much needed work was carried out. ""I can't see it opening up for next year. There are things that need to be done before we get to that stage,"" he said. ""We have three … asbestos buildings that are from the 30s and the 40s, and we're reluctant to put people anywhere near there now."" Mr Lee ran his final tour to Kooljaman on the weekend and said things will look different for local tourism operators next year. ""I hope that I can provide a service next year [but] it won't be the same as it was in previous years,"" he said. ""I have to find ways of providing that same type of service.""

477,Bundaberg veterans concerned about $19m redevelopment of Anzac Park,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Bundaberg veterans concerned about $19m redevelopment of Anzac Park to activate CBD A children's aquatic park and an outdoor amphitheatre will be a part of the $19 million dollar redevelopment of Anzac Park in Bundaberg, but a group of veterans fears the attractions will overshadow the memories of those lost. The veterans want Council's plans for Anzac park reconsidered. Bundaberg's Max Francis is fourth-generation military who joined the navy when he was 16 and served Australia for more than 20 years with multiple deployments to the Middle East. ""Many families in Australia, from father to son it's passed down that they are builders or butchers. Our family were predominately military,"" Mr Francis said. ""There's a part of me that feels like my dad and my grandad are looking over my shoulder saying, 'You've got to stop this'."" Mr Francis said he could not see the history of Anzac reflected in the redeveloped park. ""I'm not against development, development in this town means jobs."" ""But the purpose of the park now seems to be to attract more people to the central business district in Bundaberg. ""There was no real detail or no importance placed on creating a memorial and you lose the nostalgia that is Anzac Park."" Mr Francis said he was not the only digger upset by the proposed plans. ""There's like an undercurrent that is flowing through the veteran community at the moment,"" he said. ""The veterans are realising there has been a change of plans, and there is concern."" A previous upgrade plan for Anzac Park was released from Bundaberg Regional Council in 2010, which Mr Francis said was a more honourable tribute to local veterans. But after a decade and no further progress, the new plan was unveiled to the veteran community at the beginning of last year. This prompted the Bundaberg RSL, the Royal Australian Air Force Association, and Bundaberg District Women Veterans Group to make a submission to council expressing their dissatisfaction with the redevelopment. The groups have said they will meet with council this month to discuss their concerns. The Bundaberg Regional Council said it had previously consulted with the RSL in 2018 before releasing the new redevelopment plans. ""The proposed upgrade does not seek to alter this intent but to protect and enhance the Anzac legacy while ensuring this riverside precinct is utilised to its full potential by the community year-round,"" a council spokesperson wrote in a statement. The Council has listed a wet and dry play space, a cultural hub overlooking the river, outdoor event space and stage, and improved access to the riverside walkway as the new development features. ""When complete, this area will continue to be known as Anzac Park and will incorporate many elements which will facilitate future commemorations in addition to activating the CBD,"" it said. ""Now that Federal Government funding has been secured, Council is looking forward to sharing more detailed designs of the memorial and community functions of this space in the near future."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Wide Bay's weekly email newsletter. In October the federal government secured $5 million dollars in funding for the redevelopment. Federal Member for Hinkler Keith Pitt said ""the riverside redevelopment tied in with plans to de-main Bundaberg's Quay Street."" Mr Francis said he was concerned the funding meant it was too late for the redevelopment to be stopped. ""There's a feeling that this project has gained a momentum, and if we don't speak now we may lose our chance to incorporate memorial aspects to the gardens and the park here.""

479,Tourism industry welcomes news of Gina Rinehart's move to develop Great Keppel Island,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tourism industry welcomes news of Gina Rinehart's move to develop Great Keppel Island Tourism bodies in central Queensland have welcomed news that Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart has entered into an agreement to potentially redevelop the resort on Great Keppel Island. The once iconic resort off the central coast of Queensland closed down in 2008 and has since had several false starts from companies trying to bring it back to life. In a statement released at the weekend, Ms Rinehart's company Hancock Prospecting said plans had begun to acquire the development project from its current lease holder, Sydney-based developer Tower Holdings. ""We hope to be able to make it better than it has ever been, with a world-class, year-round beach club, sandy bars, shopping, and more experiences circling around a marina modelled after successful marinas like Puerto Banus,"" the statement read. ""We envision a year-round swimmable beach club and an underwater bar being able to bring the benefits of overseas tourism to Australia."" The deal is still in its very early stages and subject to local and state government approvals. Ross O'Reilly, the Great Keppel Island Progress Association president, said it was good news, though finer details of the proposal were yet to be known. ""I think there's been that many starts, and nothing has happened, that everybody is kind of sitting back saying 'we'll believe it when we see it',"" Mr O'Reilly said. ""[But] if we were hoping for the best prospect in the country, I think we've found that in Gina. ""It is a very big project and getting the finance in this day and age to complete the project is huge, and that won't be a problem for her."" The region's peak tourism and development body Capricorn Enterprise echoed those sentiments. Chief executive Mary Carroll said after months of speculation it was wonderful to hear the news confirmed. Ms Carroll said while the deal was in an early conditional contract process stage she had ""absolutely no doubt"" that Hancock Prospecting could ""deliver a truly world class tourism development"". State member for Keppel, Brittany Lauga, agreed the investment seemed like it had the greatest chance of eventuating compared to previous attempts over the past decade. ""I really want to see whoever does it make sure they protect the environment, that they use local contractors, that they use local workers, and that they don't lock local people out of the island,"" Ms Lauga said. She reiterated that state government would look at the project management experience and the financial capability of any applicant who wanted to have the lease transferred to them. ""They have to [demonstrate] what they're going to do with the island, what their plans are, and their ability to deliver that,"" Ms Lauga said. Ms Lauga said she was aware that Ms Rinehart had visited the island but had not met with her and was concerned about potential environmental impacts to the island. ""[But] I'm also very confident in the state, federal, and local government approval processes"" Ms Lauga said. ""As long as they stick with the approvals they minimise that environmental impact, and as long as our region gets a fair share out of it … but also that Hancock works with the local Woppaburra people and the island operators as well, then I think we're in with a good shot."" The Department of Resources said it had not yet received an application to transfer the lease. In comes after the Minister for Resources rejected developer Altum Property Group's attempt to acquire the lease in June. Tower Holdings declined to comment until a later date when the deal is confirmed. Woppaburra elder Bob Muir said it was a shock to hear of the proposal through the media. ""When it hits the media first, before they talk to the Woppaburra people, it really does cause division,"" he said.

480,ACT records five new cases of COVID-19 and two more deaths,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The ACT has recorded five new cases of COVID-19 and two more deaths, as travel restrictions ease and more students return to school. ACT Health said two people with COVID-19 died yesterday — a man in his 60s and a woman in her 70s — both of whom had been receiving intensive care before their deaths. Ten Canberrans have now died with COVID-19 during the current outbreak of the Delta variant. There are currently eight people in hospital with the virus — three of those in the intensive care unit, requiring ventilation. More than 92 per cent of Canberrans aged 12 and older are now fully vaccinated. Today, interstate travel reopened for all of New South Wales and Victoria, meaning Canberrans can now travel to all areas of NSW, including Sydney, without having to quarantine. Canberrans can also travel to Victoria with a permit — without the need to quarantine if they are fully vaccinated. Travel to the capital from areas not identified as ""high risk"" is also now open — with exemption documentation automated for fully vaccinated travellers. Unvaccinated people will only be permitted to enter the ACT for essential reasons. The resumption of interstate travel also brought the reopening of Canberra Airport for daily flights. The airport had been closed on Tuesdays and Saturdays since August 21. ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the resumption of daily flights were ""an important next step forward"" for Canberra's tourism industry and the aviation sector. He said hundreds of jobs associated with those industries would now return. ""We look forward to this next period with a little bit more certainty than we've had really at any time in the last 18 months,"" Mr Barr said. International travel has also resumed with some countries, and Mr Barr said he hoped to learn of more agreements with additional countries at the next meeting of National Cabinet. ""We hope with this matter on the agenda for Friday's National Cabinet meeting and some further dates from the Commonwealth that will open up more international travel, all of which is great for a family reunion, for Australians returning home,"" he said. ""But importantly, and hopefully not too far in the future, for the return of skilled migration, international students and tourists."" Mr Barr said with the return of interstate travel, people would have to take responsibility for ensuring they were permitted to visit the ACT, with vaccination a requirement. He said authorities would not be closely policing travellers but would be using a system based on trust. ""So I think you need to think about this now as very much in the hands of individual responsibility from this point on — so random spot-checking, no more borders,"" he said. ""It's a very different arrangement now."" From today, teachers and early educators who work with young children will be expected to have received at least their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. They will need to be fully vaccinated by November 29 in order to continue working, or will need to be re-deployed. ACT Education Minister Yvette Berry said 97 per cent of the territory's school staff had now met the mandatory first-dose requirement. ""[I] can just assure people we've got those high vaccination rates and if staff haven't been able to demonstrate to the directorate that they are compliant with that health order then they won't be able to work at the school,"" Ms Berry said. Fully vaccinated Canberrans are also now able to book in to receive a booster vaccine dose, provided it has been more than six months since their second. Bookings for a Pfizer booster shot at ACT government facilities can be made, as well as through participating general practitioners or pharmacies. But pharmacists are warning that some chemists may be forced to opt-out of the booster program due to limited resources and what they called ""inadequate"" pay. Pharmacy Guild of Australia ACT branch president Simon Blacker said pharmacies were only paid about 60 per cent of what GPs were receiving for administering vaccines. ""There are a number of pharmacies in the territory who have been frustrated and want to get on with helping with the Pfizer booster rollout, but also would like [federal Health Minister] Greg Hunt to address the disparity in what we're being paid,"" Mr Blacker said.

481,NSW records lowest number of COVID cases since July as booster shots offered to residents,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Vaccination hubs and pharmacies are now offering booster COVID-19 shots for NSW residents after the state recorded 135 new cases and four deaths. The number of local COVID-19 cases recorded in the 24 hours to 8pm yesterday was the lowest daily number since July 22. NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said the booster program would prioritise high-risk workers across the state. ""We'll move the focus the need is required,"" he said. ""I think that will be less relevant for location and more relevant for those higher risk areas that should take priority when rolling out the program."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic More than 93 per cent of the adult population of the state have now had one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 87.7 per cent are fully vaccinated. Health Minister Brad Hazzard said NSW could be ""one of the highest vaccinated jurisdictions in the world"". ""The people of NSW can be proud of our vaccination rate, and there's no reason we can't reach 95 per cent double-dose vaccination to help ensure we get on top of this pandemic,"" Mr Hazzard said. Hotel quarantine and caps on arrivals have been lifted for returning Australians. In the 12-15 year old age group, 79.3 per cent have had their first dose, and 61.8 per cent are fully vaccinated. Mr Perrottet did not rule out changing the date for unvaccinated people to be allowed the same freedoms, currently scheduled for December 1. ""We're looking at it ... we're always reexamining the roadmap,"" he said. Regional areas have ramped up their double vaccination rates as Greater Sydney travellers are welcomed back from Monday. More than 82 per cent of eligible adults in regional NSW have now had both COVID-19 vaccinations. Murray River area has surpassed 95 per cent full vaccination, Orange, in the state's Central West, Hay, Eurobodalla and Gilgandra have all passed 90 per cent. More than half of the reported cases were found in regional areas, as the Hunter New England health district adds another 30 cases to its growing cluster. Four people died from COVID-19 in the reporting period, including a man in his 70s from Albury who was fully vaccinated but had underlying health issues. Two people in their 70s who died in Sydney were not vaccinated. The death toll in the state since the outbreak began in June now stands at 518. Over 62,000 people were tested for COVID-19 in the latest reporting period and 349 are being treated in hospital, while 33 people are on ventilators. Intensive care admissions have dropped to their lowest rate since August 17 with 77 people currently in ICUs.

483,Tearful reunions return at Sydney Airport as travel restrictions eased,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Tearful reunions have returned at Sydney Airport for the first time in 20 months with landing Australians able to hug relieved family and friends waiting to greet them. From this morning, hotel quarantine and the cap on arrivals have been scrapped for fully vaccinated travellers. Fourteen international flights are expected to land in Sydney today. One of the first passengers to land was desperate to see his sick mother. ""I am really scared and emotional because I really want to see my mum because the doctors say she hasn't got long,"" he told reporters. He now faces another challenge to get approval to travel to Western Australia where his mother lives. ""I am going to do whatever I can to see her,"" he said. Nick Skarajew, who was on board a Qantas flight from Los Angeles, said he was relieved to be among the first passengers exempt from hotel quarantine. He spent the past month in the United States but felt for those who had spent much longer trying to get home. ""It's amazing hearing some of the stories about displaced families, about relationships and also a lot of sad people that feel quite helpless with you know parents and immediate family members passing away and not being able to do much,"" he said. Passengers are required to take a COVID-19 test before boarding and again upon landing. Priority has been given to Australian citizens and permanent residents and their immediate families. The borders are not yet open to overseas tourists and international students. ""Today Sydney has reopened Australia to the world,"" NSW Jobs, Investment and Tourism Minister Stuart Ayres said. ""It is so great to be here in the arrivals hall seeing the smiles on people's faces, the heartfelt, warm embraces of family members reuniting for the first time in many months."" One returning Australian told the ABC he was ""over the moon"" after flying in from the United Arab Emirates after 20 months away from home. ""This is a big deal. We've been locked out and finally have this chance to come and it's just amazing,"" he said. Sydney man David Frisken was at the airport with two dozen red roses to meet his fiancee off a flight from South Korea. The pair hadn't seen each other for almost two years. ""Every day's been a struggle,"" he said. ""I understand why but it's so horrible how many people have to go through this. The amount of relationships that have been destroyed."" Passenger Carly Boyd was emotional after arriving from New York. ""There's a lot of people on that plane who have loved ones about to die or have had people die this week so for them to be able to get off the plane and go to see them straight away is pretty amazing,"" she said. Overseas holidays are making a comeback. But they’re going to require a lot more planning, including contingencies in case you get sick while you're away. NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said November could not start in a more positive way with families and friends reuniting after so long apart. ""Today is a day many people have been waiting for and our high vaccination rates have allowed us to reopen in a safe and considered way,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""Families and friends across NSW can now get together as well look forward to welcoming back home Australians who have been overseas trying to get home."" Sydney Airport CEO Geoff Culbert welcomed the easing of restrictions. ""Today some of the magic returned to our arrival halls. Grandparents meeting grandkids for the first time, families reuniting, all of the scenes that have been absent for far too long,"" he said. He said the aviation sector still had a long way to go in its recovery. ""Allowing fully vaccinated Australians to travel without quarantine will provide a template for bringing back students, business travellers and tourists from all over the world.""

485,COVID nightmare almost over as regional travel resumes in NSW,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Caravans are packed, dining are tables set and family reunions are just hours away as regional travel in New South Wales resumes. Sydneysiders have been banned from travelling to regional parts of the state since June, when Greater Sydney went into lockdown. Regional travel was pushed back several weeks due to low vaccination rates in many rural areas, but the majority of local government areas now have 80 per cent double dose rates. Western NSW endured the most serious outbreak of any regional area, recording over 1,600 cases. Now, the famous Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo is ready to welcome back tourists. ""It's my expectation that the people of Sydney, as they did last year, are going to absolutely love a regional getaway to celebrate the fact that these lockdowns are finishing,” said zoo director Steve Hinks. Six-month old Liam Chazan will meet his aunt and cousins for the first time this week when they travel to Tamworth to see him and his parents. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Liam's mother, Deirdre Burke, said it had been difficult not to have the in-person support of her sister during her son's early months. ""[It's been] a bit heartbreaking, because you want to share those beautiful moments with them,"" she said. ""When you enter the world of motherhood and parenthood, it's certainly not something you should be by yourself in."" Lana Wills runs a day cruise business at Eden, on the Far South Coast of NSW, where the southern whale migration is almost over. She says she expects a flurry of visitors from Sydney in the last fortnight of the whale season, which she hopes will cushion what has been a 50 per cent reduction in foot traffic during the lockdown. ""That will help to just keep things ticking along, ready until we can get around to whale watching again next year,"" Ms Wills said. But it is not just Greater Sydney residents that have more freedoms to travel as of today, with the Far South Coast set to welcome Victorians back — without the need to quarantine. Merimbula Lake Apartments owner Kim Dorling said there was excitement but also caution amongst holidaymakers. ""It's a bit 50-50 — half of them are very excited to come and nothing's going to stop them from coming here,"" she said. ""Others are very nervous about whether there should be a lockdown … there’s still a lot of anxiety."" In the state's north, the general manager of Elements of Byron said the resort was fully booked until early next year but finding staff had been challenging due to vaccination requirements and workforce challenges. ""We think what's happened – aside from the holiday visas not travelling into the destination or into the country – is that a lot of people have left the industry because it's gone up and down,"" Michael Skinner said. Flights from Sydney to Ballina Byron Gateway Airport will more than double from today, despite the region having some of the lowest vaccination rates in the state. Six of the state's seven local government areas yet to reach 70 per cent double dose vaccination are on the North Coast. Byron Mayor Michael Lyon said that was largely due to supply issues, but was confident the two-week grace period had given the region enough time to reopen safely. ""Businesses are really struggling without the tourism economy, so that balance has to be struck somewhere,"" he said. ""We've seen some pretty good increases in our double-dose rate over the two weeks. ""I'm comfortable enough with the opening up on Monday and I'm confident that we can deal with the impact."" Forster, on the Mid North Coast, is a popular beach holiday destination for Sydneysiders and café manager Darren Cornell says he is looking forward to welcoming them back after ""on-again off-again"" trade. ""Trade would just start to build up and all of a sudden, it's gone — you're in lockdown again,"" he said. In the Central West, Mudgee Regional Tourism chairperson Jes Chrek said the region was excited to be welcoming tourists back, particularly since being crowned Australia's top tourism town. ""The wineries and the restaurants and cafes, they've got bookings coming out their ears starting on Monday,"" she said.

486,Odds are you haven't been to country races like this before,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Country races with a difference beat the Melbourne Cup any day They call it ""the Melbourne Cup"" of international yabby racing at Windorah in outback Queensland. And who am I to disagree, since this is the only one I've ever experienced. I am, however, reasonably skilled in the art of yabbying, having spent countless hours with nets on the dusty banks of farm dams over the years, and it would never have occurred to me in a pink fit to attempt to race the little crustaceans. So I take my hat off to the organisers of this rather bizarre annual event that takes place early September in front of the Windorah pub, on the road to Birdsville. I think I can safely say these are the only international yabby races in Australia, or anywhere in the world, with an official race caller and bets that can be laid in advance. Just to set the scene for you, excited locals and tourists cheer the yabbies on to victory in a chalk-drawn arena in the middle of the road near the front of the pub. The yabbies all have names of course, just like any Melbourne Cup field. This race meeting was the brainchild of a handful of residents, including the publican, over a few beers (well, possibly several) 20 or so years ago. They were eager to give travellers a reason to stop at their tiny town en route to the more famous Birdsville horse races and raise some money for Windorah and the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Well, they've certainly achieved that. The yabby races are now considered a must for those driving the western Queensland outback circuit, and personally, I wouldn't have missed the event for quids when I visited back in 2018. I even helped to catch a few of the competitors at a nearby watering hole on race eve, although I consistently failed to back a winner the next day. I did have more luck though on a visit to Derby in the Kimberley when I was invited to an impromptu crab race in front of the Norval Gallery in the heart of town. Stream more of Heather's adventures on iview. This didn't seem to surprise anyone. Apparently, it's by no means a rare occurrence around Derby. I'd been out crabbing that afternoon with a local builder who'd decided to share our spoils with a gathering of friends. First, there had to be a race before we dined on them. Fair enough. Every attendee had his or her name painted on a hand-picked crab, and mine easily crawled to victory. Sadly, Heather would later end up in the delicious hot pot in the gallery kitchen. At Dinner Plain in Victoria High Country, dog sleds in the snow are the races of choice once a year, in the heart of winter. The enthusiasm and barking noise levels of these big fluffy huskies and similar breeds are quite something to behold. Earmuffs are worth considering along with the rest of your ski attire if you choose to attend. Be warned competition is just as fierce amongst the owners of the canine contestants, who travel from far and wide to take part in the stampede to the finish line. The same pretty much applies at Marree at the start of the Oodnadatta track in outback South Australia for the Camel Cup, held every July. They're a bit more of a relaxed mob out here, but spectators travel huge distances to join in the fun and the camel owners are in it to win. After all, this was home to the pioneering Afghan cameleers, so they know their stuff. Cameleer descendants time their family reunions for Cup weekend, adding to the colourful carnival atmosphere. The racetrack of any description has always been a great leveller in Australian society, a place where all types come together. It can be both a distraction for locals in tough times like drought, and a drawcard for visitors in search of new experiences. You don't have to wait for the Melbourne Cup season to be in on the action. Try going further afield and the odds are you'll be giving a big boost to our regional communities. You'll be welcomed with open arms and have a lot of fun. To catch up on more of Heather's adventures on Back Roads, head to ABC iview.

487,live: NSW Now: Hundreds of returning Australians touch down in Sydney as international travel resumes,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Here's what you need to know this morning. Fully vaccinated Australians can travel overseas from today without an exemption and those in other countries can finally return home. The lifting of the health orders after more than 20 months of closed borders due to COVID-19 also means the scrapping of quarantine rules. In its place, those flying in or out of Australia will now be required to show proof of their vaccination status and undertake pre-flight COVID testing. To qualify as fully vaccinated, according to the Federal Department of Health, people must have had two doses of a COVID-19 jab approved or recognised by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Currently this includes: AstraZeneca Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca Covishield, Pfizer/Biontech Comirnaty, Moderna Spikevax, Sinovac Coronavac and Janssen-Cilag COVID vaccine. The new rules also apply to international students and tourists. Fourteen international flights are expected to arrive at Sydney airport today. Former premier Gladys Berejiklian is back in the witness box at the Independent Commission Against Corruption's (ICAC) inquiry today. It will be Ms Berejiklian's second day on the stand after a grilling on Friday where she was played a series of tapped phone calls between herself and former secret boyfriend, disgraced MP Daryl Maguire. The phone intercepts, text messages and emails revealed that she gave multi-million dollar funding assurances to Mr Maguire for his Wagga Wagga electorate. In one call, she boasted about securing him $170 million dollars for hospitals in five minutes. Ms Berejiklian denied any wrongdoing, maintaining her relationship with Mr Maguire wasn't serious enough to disclose and that she had not given him special treatment. The inquiry is examining if she breached public trust or turned a blind eye to corrupt conduct during her secret relationship with Mr Maguire, which began in 2015. It is also considering if she breached the ministerial code of conduct by failing to report the relationship. From today, booster COVID-19 shots are available from state-run clinics for eligible people. Pfizer is the only vaccine on offer but NSW Health said it could be used regardless of what jab people had received as their first or second dose. They also said the third dose was important for strengthening protection against the COVID-19 virus, including the Delta variant. At this stage, only those aged 18 and over qualify and they must have had their second dose at least six months ago. The mass vaccination hubs at Sydney Olympic Park and Macquarie Fields in south-west Sydney are among the participating clinics. GPs and pharmacies can also administer booster doses to eligible people. Yesterday, 87.7 per cent of over 16s were fully vaccinated in NSW, and 93.5 per cent had received at least one dose. Vaccinated Sydneysiders are now able to travel anywhere in New South Wales. Today's reopening was delayed twice due to regional vaccination rates lagging behind Sydney. NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said vaccination rates have improved in the past fortnight. ""But even in some of those areas in regional NSW where there are lower rates, they are still substantially higher than other places in the country so we are very confident,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""I know it was an unpopular decision to delay regional travel by two weeks but it was the right decision, it's all about providing confidence."" Local Government NSW remains concerned over patchy vaccination rates in some regional areas. In the state's central west in Orange, more than 91 per cent of people over 16 are fully vaccinated. However, in the state's north in Byron Shire, only 63 per cent are double dosed. Investigations are continuing into a fatal boat accident off the NSW South Coast that left a 37-year-old man dead and three in a critical condition. Seven men were rescued from a boat that had overturned off Waniora Point in Bulli after emergency services were called about 10:20am yesterday. Some of the men swam to safety but others were caught underneath the boat and were left unconscious. They were retrieved by surf lifesavers who performed CPR but one man was unable to be revived. A surfer who had paddled out to the boat to help received chemical burns to his face. NSW Police said the skipper of the boat was being interviewed as part of the investigation carried out by specialist officers from Marine Area Command. Two men remain in a critical condition in Sydney and Wollongong hospitals, and one has improved to a stable condition but remains in the intensive care unit.

488,"International borders are reopening with quarantine-free travel, but not everyone is happy",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus It's been almost two years since Giovanni van Empel saw his children. In February last year, he left Yogyakarta in Indonesia to pursue his doctoral degree at Melbourne's Monash University. He was granted a Postgraduate Research Sector visa and planned to use the first six months to settle in before his family would join him. ""I have a wife and two kids, but they couldn't come because the borders were shut,"" he said. ""Last time I saw my daughter, she was only six months old, just learning to sit, but now she can run."" Mr van Empel chose to stay in Melbourne because there was no guarantee that if he returned to Indonesia his scholarship would continue. ""There is a financial implication for my scholarship because the scholarship is within a government plan, so it's not straightforward for us to apply for study leave."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic He said his children have been badly affected by the 20 months apart. Every time he rings home his seven-year-old son Kahlil repeats the same questions. ""He's always asking, 'When are you coming home? When are you coming home?' ""Also his performance at school has been affected. [His grades] are dropping."" Mr van Empel said he was also suffering being away from his two children and wife. ""I wouldn't say it's been easy for me, it's been weird in a sense that I haven't been around my family for this long period and I have missed them so much,"" he said. He said it was the simple things with his children he was missing the most. ""Reading them stories before bedtime, playing with them, just growing up together, but it's been a long time now."" Like many visa holders, Mr van Empel had high hopes when the Australian government announced it would reopen international borders in states that had 80 per cent of the eligible population fully vaccinated. From today, the borders will open to fully vaccinated international arrivals in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT, and there won't be a requirement to quarantine. However, the changes only apply to Australian citizens, permanent residents and their families, meaning temporary residents and visa holders remain in limbo. International travel taking off from next month — here are your questions answered. ""I believe we [visa holders] should be treated the same as permanent residents, there are no reasons why we have to be treated differently because we are in the same situation,"" Mr van Empel said. ""The funny thing is that we also contribute to the 80 per cent vaccination rate, we've been doing things right, but the question is why can't we also travel abroad [and return to Australia] or have our family join us?"" Mr van Empel is not alone. At least 1.6 million temporary residents hold various visas in Australia, according to the Department of Home Affairs. It's not the first time temporary residents or visa holders have been left out of key national policies. In 2020, researchers from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and the Migrant Worker Justice Initiative published a report titled, As if we weren't humans: The abandonment of temporary migrants in Australia during COVID-19. In a survey of 6,105 non-permanent residents, most said they had experienced various difficulties, such as having no place to live or working in exploitative and dangerous environments because they were not part of the Australian government's financial aid package. The package initially only included citizens and permanent residents. Dr Laurie Berg from UTS said the exclusion of visa holders from November's reopening plan reaffirmed the Australian government's attitude. ""The government seems to be treating temporary visa holders yet again as a source of income but otherwise indispensable and not key members of the community,"" she said. Some temporary visa holders are unable to get Medicare. They can still get the vaccine, but getting a record of their vaccination status is proving difficult. Greens leader Adam Bandt said the reopening roadmap involved ""double standards"", especially given many visa holders had legitimate reason to travel overseas. ""The government seems to have no problem letting billionaires, like Andrew Forrest, come and go as they please, but when people want to go overseas for a funeral or perhaps to see their parents or their loved ones for the last time, the government is letting them down and not letting them do it."" Mr Bandt said many visa holders were in a difficult position because ""if they leave Australia the door gets shut behind them"". ""We're not calling for special treatment. The government should just give people who are stuck here away from their loved ones the same rights that they give to Australian citizens. ""Let people go if there's a legitimate reason, and then let people return,"" Mr Bandt told ABC. Just like Mr van Empel, Jennifer Clayburn, a US citizen, is a temporary resident who holds a Temporary Skill Shortage visa. Her family moved to Melbourne in January last year for her husband’s work, which supplies products and services to critical infrastructure and construction sectors. She said she was holding out hope over the national plan. ""I think that it's vague around the definition of residents and where we get to be involved in that national plan,"" Ms Clayburn said. ""We have been doing it tough, alongside all Australians. We too want to be around the table at Christmas with our family, but we do not want to be summarily locked out of Australia upon return."" Last week's announcement that Australia's travel ban will be lifted in November had many separated families rejoicing. But for temporary residents, the ordeal is far from over. Ms Clayburn said she had created a parliamentary petition to give all visa holders a voice. ""By including all residents — both temporary and permanents — and all citizens upfront in the border reopening, I think the even higher demand for outbound travel will drive more flight availability for inbound flights — a win for everyone affected by the travel ban,"" she said. Ms Clayburn's petition has been signed by more than 2,000 people since it was approved last week, while a similar petition on change.org has amassed almost 30,000 signatures. Dr Berg said the Australian government ""must recognise the existence of temporary visa holders as an important part of the Australian community, and needs to pay attention to what they think"". She said she hoped the absence of temporary residents in the reopening policy was an oversight and would ""be rectified, like when the government rectified its financial support policy for temporary residents last year,"" she said. The Department of Home Affairs did not provide specific comment on whether temporary residents would be included in the reopening plan any time soon. ""We need to make sure in the first instance that our priority is and remains looking after Australians,"" Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews told the ABC. ""We will then work with other cohorts. That includes our economic cohorts, so our skilled workers, being able to come into the country; then it will be international students; then we will be looking at travellers from overseas — so our tourists — being able to come back in.""

489,"American pick-up trucks are an increasingly common sight on our roads, but why are they so popular?",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  American pick-up trucks are an increasingly common sight on our roads, but why are they so popular? Australia's COVID caravanning boom is driving demand for big American pick-up trucks capable of towing heavy caravans, but industry experts warn drivers should do thorough research before buying. For Australians taking a lap of the continent during the pandemic, American trucks like RAM, Chevrolet and Ford F-150s are spacious, comfortable and some can tow up to 4.5 tonnes — if you can afford the price. Queenslander Simon Maloney — a lifelong Toyota man — is 36,000 kilometres into a tour of Australia. He has no regrets about buying a RAM 1500 last year for a lap of the country during COVID. Speaking to ABC Radio Brisbane from Carnarvon in Western Australia, Mr Maloney said he did months of research before spending his money on a RAM. ""It's done all the Victoria High Country; it's been up through Tasmania,"" Mr Maloney said. ""We did 10,000km in Tasmania — it's not that big. We drove around it, over it, through it, everywhere. ""It's been up the Oodnadatta track, out through Kings Canyon, it's been all through the Territory. I can't fault this car."" Straight off the manufacturing floor, an American pick-up truck can cost more than $100,000 before any modifications, and prices have only gone up as supply runs short. A new Toyota HiLux might cost upward of $65,000, while a new LandCruiser can cost anywhere from $80,000 up to nearly $200,000 depending on the model. Second-hand utes and four-wheel drives are also in high demand as people look for cars already modified for travelling. Many in the four-wheel-drive industry are capitalising on the boom even as supply delays mean customers are waiting months for new trucks to arrive from overseas. One of the first companies to export American pick-ups to Australia, Moreton Bay's Maracoonda Automotive specialises in converting those trucks to right-hand drive. Director Ann Anderson said, since the pandemic began, more young families seeking a vehicle capable of towing a heavy caravan were calling up. But demand is so high, Maracoonda is now telling new customers to expect a 12-month wait — and when the vehicle arrives, the conversion process can take 380 hours of specialist work. One of the biggest issues, Ms Anderson said, was a lack of understanding of the complexities of safe and legal towing loads. Term Meaning Tare weight The weight of an empty vehicle Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM) The maximum a vehicle can weigh — including tare weight, any accessories such as snorkel and bull bar, and the payload Gross Combination Mass (GCM) The maximum weight for the vehicle and trailer combined Payload The maximum load the vehicle can carry, including passengers and luggage Most of the American trucks are rated to tow anywhere from 2.5 tonnes to 4.5 tonnes, but Ms Anderson said inexperienced drivers could find themselves in trouble if they did not properly calculate the weight of a kitted-out caravan, gear, and passengers. ""When they're looking at towing something, there's another weight that's called the GCM and that's gross combination mass,"" she said. ""So that's the weight of the truck, and the payload with all those goodies, and the trailer. ""And that weight is what people really need to make sure that they're well covered, to be within that legal environment."" Drivers could find themselves accidentally voiding their insurance, exceeding their general driver's licence weight restrictions, or in further legal strife if they do not accurately calculate their towing weight. In Cairns, ute tray manufacturing company Norweld is flat out. Business development manager Mark Law said in the first two weeks of October, he had 22 inquiries for American truck trays. Mr Law said the entire four-wheel-driving industry had exploded during the pandemic. To meet demand, Norweld has expanded interstate, put on more staff, and now exports trays and canopies back to the USA. ""I think the American trucks will continue to grow, just because of the offering they have across the differing vehicles,"" Mr Law said. ""Across the Rams, the [GMC Denali], the Silverado, the Ford F trucks, they're all very capable and comfortable vehicles and they all offer different strengths. ""Australians are looking for a little bit more variety and luxury in their utes now."" In Brisbane, auto electrician Quentin Gill spotted a gap in the market. Taking a risk, Mr Gill decided to specialise in custom modifications for American trucks, buying his own RAM as a family car and to showcase his business. ""There's a huge market for what I'm doing in LandCruisers, but every Tom, Dick and Harry is doing it,"" Mr Gill said. ""I thought I could see an opening as the [American trucks] were looking more and more popular. The outlook on that has exploded, so I'm happy with my decision."" But the sheer size of the American truck has its downsides. An American pick-up such as a RAM 1500 might be 2.4 metres wide, 5.8 metres long, and 1.9 metres high. In contrast, a typical HiLux might be just 1.8 metres wide, 5.3 metres long, and 1.8 metres high. Monash University accident research expert Stuart Newstead said while the pick-up looked like a ute, they were closer in weight and size to a truck. ""These vehicles are incredibly long,"" he said. ""Some are knocking on 6 metres long, which won't even fit in a car park, and they're well over 2 metres wide."" Dr Newstead said pick-up trucks were classified as commercial vehicles and, as such, were subject to different safety rules. One problem, he said, was that there was no single port of call for advice and information on calculating the total weight of a heavy truck and caravan correctly. ""It's an area where people really need to do quite a lot of research to make sure that the combination … they want to put on the road is actually within the limits they're designed to operate in,"" Dr Newstead said.

490,'Best feeling in the world': Australians returning home after being locked out for 20 months,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Sydney Airport will once again be the scene of heart-warming reunions and joyous departures, as New South Wales and Victoria fling open their international borders. It's been more than 20 months since Australia slammed its doors closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic — banning most citizens from leaving the country and imposing incoming passenger caps and costly hotel quarantine on those wanting to return. But from tomorrow Australians will once again be allowed to take overseas holidays and quarantine requirements will be scrapped for fully vaccinated Australians flying into Sydney or Melbourne. As soon as Melanie Orvis heard the rules had changed, she booked a flight home from London – a city she's been trying to come home from for months. ""A couple of weeks ago when NSW changed their rules, my dad called me and I booked my flight instantly,"" Ms Orvis said. ""I'm originally from Melbourne, but even just getting to Sydney felt like a win."" With her working visa due to expire the 28-year-old has been trying to get on the federal government run repatriation flights since June, but they instantly sold out. ""To be essentially locked out of my home and country has felt a lot like rejection and betrayal,"" she said. Stranded on a tiny Caribbean island, the Harewood family can't get home. ""The first page of our passports states we should not ever have an issue in returning home no matter what and this was not the case."" But she said she would not fully relax until she was back on Australian soil. ""There is a part of me that is expecting something to change and to be left heartbroken again,"" she said. ""To be reunited will feel so surreal, but it will be the best feeling in the world. ""I just cannot wait to give my family the biggest hug, meet family members that were born in the pandemic for the first time and see my friends."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Losalini Kelei, 51, will be able to return to Fiji for her father's 80th birthday with her 19-year-old daughter, but she's so anxious about COVID-19 upending her plans, she hasn't bought a return ticket. A small part of the south Sydney woman is worried they'll be stuck over there after they fly over in January. ""I'm trying to have common sense and I've been thinking should I take my work laptop just in case,"" Ms Kelei, said. She has felt disconnected from her home for the past 20 months. Fiji is the one place in the world where she doesn't keep track of time. ""It's a catch up with family and relaxing, but one of the things I've value about going back is that I don't have to wear my watch,"" she said. ""I don't have to worry about what time it is and I don't feel guilty about it."" Alexandra Koster has never met her almost two-year-old nephew Patrick, who was born in Seattle just two months before Australia closed its borders. His Australian parents Elisabeth and Laughlan Davies could no longer bring him home for a visit to meet family as planned, so his Australian relatives had to get to know him via video calls. But as soon as the travel ban was lifted the toddler's Aunty Ally booked a flight to Seattle and she'll soon be jetting off to spend about five weeks with him. ""I just realised that you don't have that long to get to see him and to build that kind of bond when he's still small,"" Ms Koster said. ""I'll be taking care of him while Elisabeth is working, I'm just excited to take him to playgrounds and coffee shops and all that every day stuff."" Ms Koster said the highlight of the trip would be when Patrick's Australian grandmother joined them in December. ""The plan is that we are all going to Disneyland for Pat's birthday,"" she said. She described the feeling of being able to travel again as surreal. ""It doesn't fully feel real that I'm going over there, I'm still anticipating that something will happen like flights will get cancelled,"" she said. Ms Koster is fully vaccinated but said she was also worried about the possibility of contracting COVID in the United States. ""Just how would that affect things, what if I couldn't' get my flight home and had to isolate over there, stuff like that,"" she said. A certain uneasiness about the changing rules and regulations is a common thread for travellers that spoke to the ABC. Overseas holidays are making a comeback. But they’re going to require a lot more planning, including contingencies in case you get sick while you're away. Retiree Ray McDonald and his British wife Val divide their time between Melbourne and the United Kingdom. They returned to the UK at the start of the pandemic, but will fly back to Melbourne this week to see Mr McDonald's elderly mother and his grandchildren in the lead up to Christmas. ""While quarantine was in place I would have only returned to Australia in the case of a family emergency,"" Mr McDonald said. Once the rules changed, Mr McDonald immediately booked flights to return to Melbourne this week to see family in the lead up to Christmas. But he's been trying, without success, to find out how Victoria will facilitate and monitor its requirement for all travellers to have a COVID test within 24 hours of arrival in Victoria. ""In my opinion, it seems the various federal and state governments have made the announcement without having a communications plan in place for travellers seeking updated information about what is required of them, "" he said. ""I am taking a leap of faith and hoping by the time I travel on November 4 it will be sorted.""

491,Sobering news as COVID brings popular Santa Claus charity pub crawl to a halt,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus Sobering news as COVID restrictions halt Wollongong's Santa Claus Pub Crawl for Charity Wollongong's renowned Santa Claus Pub Crawl for Charity will not go ahead next month with the organiser declaring the event untenable under COVID restrictions. The charity pub crawl raises more than $130,000 a year for the Salvation Army, Disability Trust and the Disabled Services Association. Neil Webster has run the crawl, which attracts about 11,000 people, for 28 years and said that even with restrictions easing on December 1, venues would only be allowed one person per two square metres. ""That halves the venues' capacities, which means we're dropping to 5,500 people and as a charity event, that's a big loss of potential fundraising,"" he said. Restrictions also meant the December event would cost twice as much to put on. ""We would've had to increase some of our COVID compliance so, for example, we usually run 11 buses during the event, so we'd have to double that amount and pay for twice as many buses,"" Mr Webster said. ""Then we'd need to have COVID marshals in place, so our costs were doubling but our income was halving and when you're organising a charity event, that's hard to live with."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic He said the event would return in 2022 when venues were more likely to be able to operate at full capacity. As Australia recovered from the worst of the coronavirus outbreak last year, Neil Webster decided to host a scaled-back version of the Santa Claus Pub Crawl for Charity. Venues operated at reduced capacity, and he encouraged revellers to host their own parties at home. He also hosted a live stream event at the North Wollongong Hotel, but said the response was ""poor"". ""We're an event based on interaction and socialising and doing it online doesn't have the same effect,"" he said. ""It's about visiting pubs and bars, seeing friends and making new friends. ""It was a lot of hard work coordinating an online event with technical issues, scriptwriting and a plan — I became a presenter for a five-and-a-half hour online show and it's not my day job."" Mr Webster established the Santa Claus Pub Crawl for Charity as a way to spread positive Christmas cheer after he was assaulted on Christmas eve in 1997 as he left a venue in Sydney. Since its inception, it has grown to become one of the biggest events on the Illawarra social calendar, attracting visitors from around the state. Want more local news? Sign up to the ABC Illawarra weekly email newsletter Mr Webster said, as well as last year's restrictions, the event had gone ahead through other challenges, including ""a belter"" of a rain storm, and he was disappointed to call it off this year.

492,How a water-ski show became a theme park that's 'part of our fabric',travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Gold Coast theme park Sea World celebrates 50 years, 10,000 animal rescues and 50 million visitors One of the Gold Coast's best-known theme parks celebrates a major milestone today. Sea World is turning 50. With more than 50 million visitors, 30,000 employees and 10,000 animal rescues since it opened its doors in 1971, Sea World has cemented its place in local history. Originating as a water-ski show in the late 50s, the park has undergone major changes in both name and location. It wasn't until the 1970s that Sea World ventured into marine life and rebranded as a theme park showcasing dolphin shows, rollercoasters and ""aqua ballet"". Destination Gold Coast CEO Patricia O'Callaghan says the park has been a fundamental part of the Gold Coast since its inception. ""We are so proud of what they have contributed to our economy,"" Ms O'Callaghan said. ""They are a part of our social fabric and we are so proud to celebrate this with them, especially after surviving what has been a horrific 18 months."" Major Events Gold Coast CEO Jan McCormick says the success of Sea World should inspire other local tourist attractions to aim high. ""I think from a business perspective it really has demonstrated to the city that we can go big, we can go bold,"" Ms McCormick said. ""We can make it happen and all it requires is a lot of hard work and absolute commitment to what you're delivering."" What started as a weekend job for Mitchell Leroy has become a career spanning almost four decades. Now the curator of mammals and birds, Mr Leroy says the park has always felt like a family. ""Even to this day, I still walk through and say hi to as many people, in whatever department, as possible,"" he said. Mr Leroy plans to celebrate the milestone at Sea World, reflecting on the people and animals he has worked with. ""To think about some of the wonderful, wonderful animals that I have spent my whole life,"" he said. ""I've spent more time with these animals than I have with my 30-year-old daughter."" More than 10,000 rescues of marine life have been performed by Sea World's team, including the rescue of humpback whales from shark nets and turtles and dolphins from drumlines. A major section of the government's shark control equipment has been cut away from the young whale, but Sea World and Fisheries couldn't free the animal completely. Minister for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries Mark Furner congratulated Sea World rescue and his own Marine Animal Rescue Team (MART). ""Sea World does an excellent job, not only conservation but allowing the opportunities for people to interact with marine life,"" he said. ""I want to commend them for that ongoing work in that [rescue] space … it's a shining light to what we see around the state."" Sea World has conducted two rescues of humpback whales entangled in the government's own shark-control equipment on the Gold Coast this season. In August, the Sea World Rescue Team, along with MART, embarked on a daring two-day-long rescue mission to release a whale from a shark net. The park hasn't been without controversy. There have been protests in recent years, with activists calling for an end to animals kept in captivity. Mr Leroy says Sea World is an accredited zoo, and undergoes regular checks from the Zoo and Aquarium Association. ""They are looking at if the animal has good nutrition, good environment, good health,"" he said. ""We even engage an external contractor that operates her own animal welfare business and she will come down and assess our dolphin collection every year to ensure that we are meeting those targets.""

493,"I was recently made redundant, but my strongest feeling was relief. This is why",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  When my manager recently let me know my position was being made redundant under a sweeping new organisational restructure I felt a mix of emotions — gratitude for the time I'd worked there, sadness for the work colleagues I would miss, a tinge of insecurity about what my future would hold. But the strongest feeling I had was relief. I'd started this job on a four-month contract that had been extended for 14 months and, after enduring almost two years of rolling lockdowns in Melbourne, I could feel the risk of burnout seeping in. It wasn't that I didn't love my job — I absolutely did and respect the organisation I worked for. But I had started to reconsider my priorities post-COVID and realised I was looking for a less office-bound but more fulfilling life. And I'm not the only one. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic In what has been dubbed the ""Great Resignation"", workers all over the world are increasingly retreating from pre-COVID work patterns. Many are unwilling to go back to the 9-to-5 office grind after having had a taste of working from home, or simply revolting against the idea that our lives should be defined by never-ending treadmills of career aspirations. For Dr Zali Yager, who moved from Melbourne to regional New South Wales with her family after two years of uncertainty and disruption due to COVID, working remotely in a beachside town has helped her reassess her life priorities. She is set to resign from her secure university position. ""When we first moved, I thought I would be looking for another university position up here. I now feel much less need for a 'title', and would rather be pursuing impact and making research matter in the real world rather than just writing scientific papers that are only read by other researchers,"" she says. Dr Yager, an expert in body image and psychological wellbeing in school, community and online environments, says she initially made the move because she was feeling under-appreciated and burnt out in her university job. The slower pace of life in a regional area has removed the pressures around work status and career climbing and allowed her to regain a sense of control over her own life beyond workplace demands. ""I think this is something that we need to be talking about — but it's hard to find people to talk about it with,"" she says. ""You can't talk to your work colleagues about it because they are still wrapped up in that world. But for me, it has been a slow shedding of those old assumptions about how we should work and live."" The phenomenon of the Great Resignation has been well documented. According to Microsoft research, more than 40 per cent of workers globally are considering giving their jobs the sack this year. In the US alone, 4.3 million people quit their jobs in August, according to the latest US Bureau of Labor report. In Australia, the trend seems to have been delayed because of our ongoing and extended lockdowns. But data from the people management platform Employment Hero suggests 48 per cent of Australian workers are planning on looking for a new job in the next 12 months. And there are now plenty of jobs out there. A major trial in Iceland suggested cutting the standard five-day week to four days for the same pay needn't cost employers a cent (or, to be accurate, a krona). It almost seems too good to be true. Unfortunately, it was. In April last year — as COVID lockdowns took hold and businesses shut down operations — an estimated 780,000 Australians lost their jobs, with around 90 per cent of those lost in the first week of April 2020. Now, 18 months later, as the country opens up again, businesses ranging from hospitality to high-end corporates are struggling to fill those same roles, with many workers thumbing their noses at job offers and instead opting to pursue new work-life balance aspirations. New data from global research firm Gartner, released exclusively to the ABC, shows company boards and senior management now consider the challenge of retaining the workforce to be among their top strategic priorities for 2021 — an increase of 81 per cent from the previous year. The research indicates that Australian employers face a rocky road ahead, with companies needing to ""sell career development"" to attract workers. And while companies have high expectations of growing digital capacity, it remains to be seen how that growth will be achieved with an exhausted workforce that's ready to quit. ""Global pandemics often prompt long-lasting social change,"" says Aaron McKewen, a behavioural scientist at Gartner. ""The black plague arguably ended 300 years of feudalism in Europe and paved the way for modern democracy, largely due to a severe shortage of workers. We're seeing something similar unfold with COVID."" After decades of globalisation, stagnant wages, automation and off-shoring, McKewen says, ""we're experiencing a severe global labour shortage that has tipped the balance of power towards workers"". ""At the same time, as peoples' worlds became smaller during lockdowns and they faced a very real existential health threat, millions of employees deeply reflected on what was important to them and the role of work in their lives."" Meanwhile, a growing number of Australian workers, buoyed by COVID lockdowns, have already gotten ahead of the curve. Tara Harrison says that during the first lockdowns of the pandemic, the travel industry shrank rapidly, and her hours working for Intrepid Travel were reduced to about one day per week. The pandemic has triggered a seismic shift in the workforce as many reconsider their ambitions. ""I was so frustrated with the lack of control over my circumstance and I had time to reflect,"" she says. ""I think it's important to check in with your career every year and ask if it's still serving you, if you're still learning and growing. If you're not, it's time to look at other opportunities."" For Harrison, the COVID opportunity was clear: ""I felt stagnant. Had the pandemic not happened, I may have never had the space and time to build my business or redesign my life."" Harrison says she started writing a book about travel and launched her own company called Aweventurer, which specialises in lifestyle travel such as yoga retreats and snorkeling with seals in Byron Bay. Her first round of domestic trips sold out. The shift Harrison describes broadly fits a trend first identified by Financial Times columnist Nilanjana Roy as Time Millionaires: People who are no longer measuring their worth in terms of career advancement or financial wealth, but according to how much time they're able to wrest back from employment to spend on personal fulfillment. It was challenging to reach Harrison for this article because she is in the midst of a yoga teacher training course — another feather to her bow of changes in her new look working life. ""Next year we are launching international trips and I plan to be overseas all year, traveling and working remotely,"" she says. ""I'll be doing a month working from Italy — I dreamt of that throughout the lockdown. I want my work to fit my lifestyle, and I want freedom and to feel creatively fulfilled. I would never think of returning to an office or someone else's business now that I know how unlimited your growth and potential can be with your own business. It's deeply rewarding."" Like with any global change event, these shifts in how we live and work are bound to produce winners and losers, for both employers and workers. In researching this piece, I have become acutely aware of the privilege involved in being able to swing between jobs, choose time and lifestyle over money, and emerge from COVID lockdowns in Melbourne, perhaps the world's most locked-down city, feeling more financially secure and in control than ever. This raises the uncomfortable question: Are these new trends only applicable to a privileged minority of wealthy, often dependent-free, professional elite? Aaron McEwen isn't convinced. ""I don't think it's a phenomenon reserved only for the privileged few,"" he says. ""Certainly, some people will find it easier to quit their jobs than others. And for some, it simply won't be a luxury they can afford."" But, he adds, ""I think we've probably all thought about quitting our job. I've spoken to so many people and heard so many horror stories of abuse, bullying, harassment, humiliation, health scares. In this sense, it shouldn't be seen as a privilege to question your work. In cases where a business has created a toxic environment, then it is the business and its leaders who need to change their behaviour."" Instead of feeling guilty, McEwen says, workers across the board are rightly demanding more from their employers. ""Frankly, corporate leaders will need to 'check their privilege' and adjust to the new balance of power,"" he says. ""The pandemic has rewritten the psychological contract or employment deal that was forged during the eras of neoliberalism and austerity. Today's workers want to be seen as people — complex, messy, colourful, diverse, flawed, fabulous humans. That means that they need to rethink how work is done in the post-COVID world and rethink how they attract, retain and manage their people."" Tara Harrison agrees COVID lockdowns have triggered a ""reset"" for people across the board. Perhaps during this past 18 months we have all had more time to reflect and realise what aspects of our lives served and nourished us, and many are now choosing to pursue those over things which depleted and diminished us. ""Whether we were drained by commutes, or stressed in the office, or denying our passions for a steady paycheck, this has enabled a redesign of our lifestyle to find more fulfilling work, hobbies and relationships,"" Harrison says. ""It is confronting for some to now return to a work-life that perhaps felt [like it was] on autopilot. There's a window of bravery before a transition is accepted as the norm and we are witnessing that window right now.""

494,Regions brace for COVID spike as Melburnians escape for long weekend,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," Coronavirus As regional Victoria prepares to embrace a flood of Melbourne visitors over the long weekend, there have been mixed reactions from non-metro residents fearing a potential spike in COVID-19 cases. Victoria's health authorities have warned regional residents to prepare for an increase in COVID-positive visitors. Rural Doctors Association of Victoria president Rob Phair said rural health services were already under strain and ""if you put the burden of COVID on top of that, we're really stretched"". ""People are already exhausted,"" he said. Dr Phair said smaller towns with big tourist numbers would have to transport COVID patients to larger regional centres. The good news is that first-dose vaccination rates are above 90 per cent in country areas. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Ballarat Health Services is ""as prepared as it can be"" for an influx of COVID-19 patients as the state reopens and case numbers rise in the regions, according to executive director of acute operations Ben Kelly. The hospital has a new pop-up marquee to treat more COVID patients and has teamed with nearby private hospital St John of God to redirect non-COVID patients. Mr Kelly said his main concern about the likely rise in COVID patients was the pressure his staff would be put under. ""My primary concerns is about the welfare of our staff and how we support them, and the greatest way to support them is for our community to continue to follow the [COVID] rules,"" he said. Barwon Health, which covers holiday hotspots around Geelong,  Bellarine and Surf Coast, said in a statement that it too was bracing for an increase in demand for its services over summer. ""We are confident that we have appropriate plans in place to manage any increased workload from COVID or summer tourists, including additional bed capacity, staffing redeployments when necessary, and new clinics if required,"" the statement said. The Beechworth Lake Sambell Caravan Park has booked out all of its cabins and powered sites for the next two weekends. And while a boom in business is welcome, owner Susan Humphris is feeling some angst about the influx of Melbourne tourists. ""We're a bit on edge because we feel like it's not a matter of if we're going to get a case, but when we're going to get a case,"" she said. ""But we've got a business to run and wages to pay, so we don't have the luxury of shutting the doors and saying we don't want to do it."" Ms Humphris said she was particularly concerned that visitors to the park were not required by law to be fully vaccinated. ""We've got people that are ringing us asking if our staff are vaxxed, and I'm saying, 'Yes, but you do realise that accommodation is not mandated so you could be camping next to an un-vaxxed family',"" she said. ""It's a very inconsistent set of rules, but what can we do?"" In Port Fairy, in the state's south-west, Bec Holt's mobile phone has been ringing ""off the hook"" since the eased restrictions were announced on Sunday. Ms Holt, who manages a caravan park in Port Fairy, said the return of Melburnians to the regions had been a long-time coming. ""We're really excited about Melbourne being able to come down to our pretty little town,"" she said. However, Ms Holt feels some apprehension. ""From a personal perspective, I guess I'm a little bit nervous,"" she said. ""If COVID does come to Port Fairy, or if we do have a case in our caravan park, are we going to be forced to lock down for 14 days and send all of our visitors home? How are we going to manage that? ""Of course, we're really happy from a business perspective to have everybody coming down and wanting to stay with us. But it's that uncertainty of what comes with that."" Bendigo-based Foodshare, which supports the Loddon Mallee region which covers around a quarter of Victoria, is bracing for an increase in demand. Which was concerning, as the service was already almost at capacity, Bridget Bentley said. ""We're already seeing numbers rise — more people are needing food relief because they're having to isolate,"" she said. ""It's difficult to know what's going to happen but we're looking to other regional cities where numbers have gone up, and they're already having to give out a lot more food hampers. ""We're doing our best to plan. Depending on where numbers go, we might need more volunteers. It's very touch and go.""

495,These grey nomad influencers are more at home on social media than in the village,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  The grey nomad influencers more at home on social media than in the village Tiktok, Instagram and loyal online fans — they're no longer things reserved for suntanned 20-somethings in bikinis. An elderly couple from News South Wales who document their travels around regional Australia have amassed thousands of followers cumulatively on their social media accounts. They said they were been inspired by other elderly influencers like 93-year-old performance artist Baddie Winkle, who boasts millions of Instagram and more than 170,000 Twitter followers. Merril DeFiddes and her 70-year-old husband John Gourley recently visited Karijini, Kalbarri, Leonora, and Kalgoorlie and were on their way to Esperance. ""The history of these towns regional Australia is incredible,"" Ms DeFiddes said. While COVID-19-locked borders posed a challenge to the couple's appetite for travel, it inspired them to pivot and explore Australia. ""We used to do a bit of travel overseas but Australia's going to be it from here on in,"" Ms DeFiddes said. She wants their social media presence to promote tourism in regional Australia. “Hopefully other people can see how fascinating this kind of journey is and spend their money in Australia,"" she said. The 67-year-old retiree said their most active fans were people from their retirement village. ""We live in an over-55 village and so a lot of our friends there are connected online,"" she said. ""They'll comment and say 'I remember we were over there at that time' or 'I didn't realise the wildflowers were so beautiful."" Originally the couple were going to focus on writing a travel blog but it was too time consuming compared to the short captions and pictures required on social media. ""We were too busy sightseeing, so I basically just do Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, "" she said. Helen Avaient, 59, earns a full time wage documenting her travels around Australia on her blog Mature Solo Traveller and social media pages. ""I have thousands of people reading each article,"" she said. Ms Avaient said some are surprised with some of her mediums of choice. ""People look at you and go 'You're over 40, what are you doing on Tiktok?'"" the travel writer said. Helen Avaient's 60-plus audience has requested more video content. ""I think people want to watch rather than read so I do a couple of YouTube videos too,"" she said. But the reality of life on the road at a mature age is not all smiles. Ms Avaient rolled her car and caravan on her way to Kalbarri in WA. This year while exploring Tasmania, she was rushed to emergency surgery after telling her doctor, during a regular procedure, of symptoms she was experiencing. ""I asked if I could fly back to WA and have the surgery and they said 'no, because you'll be dead in three weeks. You'll die on the plane',"" she said. The doctors found a tumour in her colon. While Ms Avaient felt vulnerable being sick away from home, she said her social media community had been essential to recovery. ""It's bloody hard trying to recover from an illness when you're travelling,"" she said. During Helen Avaient's hospital stays she reached out to a Facebook group for single female travellers. ""I posted on the group 'could anyone bring me a t-shirt and a hairbrush?',"" she said. Ms Avaient was amazed at the response she received. ""So many people helped, all over Australia. People offered for me to stay at their houses until I got back on my feet,"" she said. ""It's such an amazing story of total strangers helping you."" Ms Avaient still needs more surgery and is hoping to get an exemption to get back into her home of WA. In the meantime, she will continue to remind Tasmanian locals about interesting things to do around their state. ""A lot of people become complacent about their own area, but when someone else highlights somewhere new for them to go they go 'oh that's amazing!"" Ms Avaient said.

496,"Stuck in idyllic Caribbean, the Harewood family faces a nightmare",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  A quick trip to Barbados to visit a sick relative before COVID-19 reshaped the world has turned into a nightmare for one far north Queensland family who remain stuck on the idyllic Caribbean island. Ian Harewood and his wife Junily, a proud Kalkadoon and Olkola woman, decided to take their 5-year-old daughter to visit Ian's mother in Barbados in March 2020 after receiving news that she was unwell. Not long after the Cairns-based family arrived, the global pandemic was declared and the world began to shut down. ""Flights were cancelled, and we lost our return flight, which was supposed to be in April,"" Mr Harewood said. Junily's travel sickness on the flight to Barbados soon turned out to be good news for the family but an added complication for their plans to return home. ""We didn't know, but she was pregnant,"" he said. They were able to buy tickets on a second flight to Australia, but it was also cancelled leaving them with no option but to stay to see out the pregnancy. Now, they are among the 46,800 Australians registered for assistance to return home. Barbados is a tiny island country in the Caribbean, and while the Harewoods described it as a beautiful place to be, the high cost of living has sucked their savings dry and was now impacting their health. Junily's pregnancy incurred exorbitant costs as she was not a citizen, and the family had to raise funds to pay the bills. It was a traumatic time for the young mother who had her baby alone, because Ian was not allowed to be in the room due to COVID regulations and her family was out of reach in Australia. ""I had to go to hospital twice because I had pre-eclampsia, so that's why our hospital bill was quite high,"" she said. ""I'm still struggling health wise from that as well [but] I haven't had the major follow ups, which I'd like to have ongoing, because of the expenses."" Not being a citizen meant Junily has not been unable to get work in the country and she has relied on online work through her art therapy business. Ian is a citizen and has been able to obtain some work but it has been scarce and unemployment is high in the country. The Harewoods have a rental property in Cairns, which their family has been helping to pay for, but the bills are stacking up. ""It just becomes one challenge after another,"" Junily said. With no direct flights from Barbados to Australia, the family must rely on connecting flights through other countries to try to get home. ""The only two airlines that are flying now out of Barbados is British airways and Virgin Atlantic,"" Junily said. ""When we last checked the prices are through the roof. You're looking at over $20,000 for our family of four."" Qantas's recent announcement to open flights to the UK ahead of schedule could mean more flights available from the UK, if they could get there. The Harewoods' son is now 14 months old and they need to find the money for his Australian citizenship. They also have to pay for costly COVID tests before they can fly to the UK and hope to avoid quarantines or sudden lockdowns at each stop. Once they arrive in Australia, they may still face border restrictions and quarantine if Queensland maintains the current regulations. Aside from letters of support for citizenship for their son, the Harewoods said all the Australian Consulate has been able to do for them was keep them abreast of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade flights. They have also reached out to local governments, which had either not responded or said it was out of their authority. Feeling deflated by the process, the Harewoods were now hoping for community support to help them get home. Federal Member for Leichhardt Warren Entsch said that caps on returning flights and state border closures were inhibitive. ""Recently, New South Wales announced that they are going to open up their state to visitors coming from overseas that are double vaccinated and that have had a test before they leave,"" Mr Entsch said. ""The federal government has said that the priority has to be for returning Australians.""

497,'All you can eat for $12.95': Why this school became a restaurant during COVID,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  A Far North Queensland business that was facing closure due to COVID, has found unique ways to keep the gates open. Sun Pacific College (SPC) at Kewarra Beach near Cairns, used to teach and accommodate English language students from around the world. After the 2020 border closures, management went looking for various ways to keep the doors open and staff employed. SPC principal, Braden Smith said that pre-covid the college had between 400–600 students studying at the campus. ""We are now down to about six international students who are still studying with us,"" he said. ""Because the cafeteria was already serving meals to the students, we decided to open up the kitchen Monday to Friday to the general public. It's 'all you can eat' from $12.99."" Mr Smith said it had been a slow start, but numbers have started to increase. ""Our first night we had one person, but last week we had more than 130 people. ""We aren't doing this as a profit-making exercise, rather it's a way of keeping the staff on and paying the wages. ""The great thing is the amount of community support we have been getting, people know that we have been struggling and now they are excited at what we have done."" The SPC is not a school with just classrooms, they also have on-site accommodation, a pool, and tennis and basketball courts. While the accommodation is dormitory style with four beds a room, it has seen the SPC pivot into short-term accommodation during the current accommodation crisis in Queensland. ""At the moment we have over 200 beds free, and we wanted to see if we could address the rental crisis, so we have opened up our rooms for bridging accommodation for the general public,"" he said. ""It's been a great success. We have had families move to Cairns and they have had problems with their settlement or finding a rental. ""Recently we have a family of four from Melbourne stay with us for four weeks while they waited for their house to be ready. ""We have also had people stay with us, while they were waiting for the borders to reopen so they could get home. The school also has another reason to celebrate with the pregnancy of their school mascot, Jill the goat. ""We are hoping for a few kids to join us in the next couple of weeks,"" Mr Smith said. ""We are not sure what we are going to do with the kids, but we have no ambition of getting into goat farming."" While SPC has pivoted towards providing catering and accommodation for locals, the recent news that international travel could soon be on the cards is welcome. ""We have had [student] bookings since March of last year. Their bags are packed and they are ready to come when the time is right,"" he said. ""We have also been getting a lot of bookings from South America. ""We are really hoping that Queensland will open its borders. The sooner they open the sooner we can get back to normal.""

498,Warning to hikers heading up one of WA's most popular peaks,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Bluff Knoll hikers warned to be prepared as number of rescues rises A spike in rescues at one of Western Australia's most popular tourist hikes has prompted a warning from emergency services. Rescue crews have rescued five people from Bluff Knoll, the highest peak in southern WA, so far this year — the most in recent memory. The three-kilometre summit trail offers stunning 360-degree views from the 1,090m peak in the Stirling Range National Park, about 90km north of Albany on the state's south coast. It attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year. A woman with a leg injury was carried by stretcher off the mountain last month. Gnowangerup SES responds to emergency calls on the mountain, with the group's volunteers often trekking up the peak to assist people following falls or medical episodes. A rescue helicopter has been used this year to airlift injured hikers from the summit, but its use is limited due to the peak's ever-changing weather conditions. The Department of Biodiversity, Attractions and Conservation recorded a spike of more than 150 per cent in visitors to national park earlier this year. SES coordinator Les Nayda said the increase in visitors seemed to have sparked a rise in rescues. ""A number of injured hikers have been airlifted or carried in stretchers off the peak,"" he said. ""When you get an increase in visitor numbers, the risk for someone getting injured increases."" Mr Nayda said hikers should be well prepared for the climb despite its relatively low grading. ""People need to be prepared for what they are going to do, they need to understand their own capability, whether they're physically able to do the climb. ""Conditions change rapidly — it can be sunshine at the car park but up the top totally different. ""Carry enough water and snacks for the task they are doing."" SES personnel have had to stay overnight while assisting people. ""We've been preparing for an increase in numbers in the Bluff Knoll area for some time,"" Mr Nayda said.

499,'Aviation is going to be on fire': Grounded airlines are now preparing for a pilot shortage ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Izzy Lamb's dreams could take off as global pilot shortage begins In her 20 years in the industry, global aviation coach Kirsty Ann Ferguson has seen four economic downturns. ""We've come out bigger and brighter [every time],"" Ms Ferguson says. She expects the same again. And the signs look promising, with some international routes resuming ahead of schedule from November 1 and Qantas announcing staff will return to work by Christmas. Ms Ferguson says the demand for jobs may be tight initially. According to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots about 300 expat pilots have returned to Australia during the pandemic. Meanwhile, airlines like Qantas and Virgin plan to return the pilots they stood down. ""Then, after that, they'll be looking at new jobs that will be created for the increasing routes and increasing destinations,"" Ms Ferguson says. ""In the very short term, we're not going to have a shortage but push out a little bit further and we definitely are, and we need to plan for that now."" In a boost for the industry new carriers like Bonza, a budget airline forecast to start flying in early 2022, are expected. As the global coronavirus pandemic took hold and planes were sent into storage, Chris Dennis penned a letter to serve as a time capsule for the next crew. ""I don't know any airline HR capacity that can handle the onslaught of applications they're going to get as soon as they open a job,"" Ms Ferguson says. Eventually, Australia will face a major pilot shortage — like much of the rest of the world. In its latest outlook report, Boeing forecast 600,000 more pilots would be needed by 2040. ""The general consensus is that that shortage is very, very real … we don't have enough pilots coming through,"" Ms Ferguson says. ""If we don't have [pilots] coming into training, if we don't have cadetships, then we're going to be in dire straits. ""We need to get in earlier, we need to get in at high school so they're taking the right subjects."" It's good news for aspiring commercial pilot Izzy Lamb. The 17-year-old from South Australia's Limestone Coast has spent this year analysing the industry's career prospects for her year 12 research project. Fortunately, a lot has changed since she interviewed her four pilots earlier in the year. ""I asked when they thought the industry would come back. Most of them thought two to three years,"" she says. Izzy's been flying since she was 14 after her aunt saw the local aero club was offering a free introductory flight. How did it feel to fly a plane? ""[It's] much different to if I was just driving around the paddock … It was so surreal. I could not believe I was actually flying a plane,"" Izzy says. ""As soon as I was back down on the ground I told Mum and Dad, 'I've got to keep doing this'."" Three years later she's got 45 hours of flying under her belt and a Passenger Carrying Endorsement under her Recreational Pilot's Certificate. ""Mum's a little bit scared but Dad, he was eager to go so I took him up,"" Izzy says. ""I'm hoping to get Mum up soon. She's a little bit nervous but she'll be fine. I tell her that, I'm like 'Mum, you'll be fine'."" She's also got her brother, sister and four teachers at school lined up for joy rides. ""As long as I check it off with [my instructor] Tony and the plane's ready to go I can go take it for a fly,"" Izzy says. Most of her flying is done over the summer, when there's less school, less sport, and less driving her younger brother to footy training. She's been paying for her lessons with shifts at Bunnings. Prior to that, she was working as kitchenhand. ""I was probably the first person [in year 8] to get a job."" Izzy says her plan is to go charter flying for a few years after school for ""however long it takes [to build up my resume] and then go for a big airline somewhere"". ""And then retire as a Royal Flying Doctor [Service pilot] because you need plenty of hours for a Royal Flying Doctor."" Ms Ferguson thinks Izzy's plan is a good one, especially given the initial bank up in general aviation. ""We've got to wait for [our experienced pilots] to move back into the airlines before general aviation jobs open to entry level candidates,"" Ms Ferguson says. To do that, they'll need to ""get current again"" with updated training and testing. Ms Ferguson believes training availability will be really stretched. Pilots need to have done a certain number of takeoffs and landings in the last 90 days to be considered current. ""We're going to have to spend time and energy and money getting those pilots back up to currency,"" Ms Ferguson says. In her work consulting pilots with Pinstripe Solutions, Ms Ferguson says 70 per cent of pilots have had to find work elsewhere during the travel halt. ""And some of those are not going to return,"" she says. Other skilled pilots have been poached by airlines in the United States. She's been approached by 140 pilots considering the move alone. As international borders slowly reopen, Australians are being urged to use a travel agent to rebook their cancelled holidays to ensure they don't lose out. ""We want to keep hold of them if we can but we also want them to continue their career, rather than being in stall mode for another 12 months. ""[The US] is 100 per cent committed to the fact that they're going to have a shortage. ""They're like a microcosm of what we're going to see when we start to reopen."" The future looks bright for Izzy Lamb. Although she's not too worried. ""I've got age behind me, I've got my whole life ahead,"" Izzy says. Ms Ferguson is also optimistic. ""Late 2022 into 2023 is going to be awesome ... I think aviation is going to be on fire,"" Ms Ferguson says.
