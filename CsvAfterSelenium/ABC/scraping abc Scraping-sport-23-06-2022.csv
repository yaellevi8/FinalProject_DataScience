0,"Melbourne vs Brisbane was supposed to be a battle of contenders, but only one team looked like premiership material",sport," Sport Melbourne reaffirm their status as premiership favourites with 64-point belting of Brisbane Melbourne have rediscovered their mojo in a 64-point hammering of Brisbane that has re-established the reigning premiers as this year's AFL flag favourites. The Demons triumphed 16.21 (117) to 7.11 (53) at the MCG on Thursday night, snapping a three-game losing streak and displacing the Lions at the top of the ladder in the process. Steven May had mixed results on return from his club-imposed suspension when he blunted Brisbane spearhead Joe Daniher but made a few costly errors, especially with ball in hand. Just about everything else went the Demons' way as they laid the victory platform with a destructive six-goals-to-one second term, having trailed at quarter-time for just the second time this season. Melbourne won contested possession in a landslide (170-133) — a repeat of last year's qualifying final dominance over the Lions — and got on top of their opponents at stoppages (35-21). Clayton Oliver (35 disposals, 12 clearances), Christian Petracca (31, eight) and Jack Viney (34, eight) gave the Demons control in the midfield, where young ruckman Luke Jackson stepped up in place of injured skipper Max Gawn. James Harmes put the clamps on Lachie Neale, restricting the Brisbane ball-magnet to eight disposals during the middle two quarters, and Jake Lever starred in defence with 15 intercepts. Bayley Fritsch kicked three goals and four Demons — Toby Bedford, James Jordon, Kysaiah Pickett and Harmes — booted two each. The Lions had no clear individual winners in their heaviest loss of the season after three previous defeats by a combined 29 points. Hugh McCluggage, Daniel Rich, Harris Andrews and ruckman Oscar McInerney fought against the tide, while Mitch Robinson and Eric Hipwood finished with two goals each. Andrews (shoulder) and Rich (shin) required treatment on injuries but played out the match, while Jarryd Lyons (ribs) was eventually substituted out after being crunched in a second-quarter marking contest with Fritsch. The result extended the Lions' barren run at the MCG, where they last won in 2014 and have now lost 10 consecutive matches. May was back for his first appearance since round 11, when he suffered concussion, and looked shaky early but worked his way into the game. He put teammate Angus Brayshaw under pressure with a handpass that led to Brisbane's first goal and gave up another when he infringed on Daniher in a marking contest. It was the only major Daniher (1.3) kicked from his nine disposals. May's turnover by foot in the second term led to a Robinson goal, which ended a run of five straight for Melbourne. It was only a slight blip for the home side, who were firmly in control by half-time.

1,Team USA coach dives to save swimmer who passed out at world championships,sport,"  Photographer captures dramatic underwater rescue of unconscious swimmer Anita Alvarez An underwater photographer has captured the dramatic rescue of Team USA swimmer Anita Alvarez, who fainted during her routine. Alvarez, 25, was performing in the artistic swimming solo free final at the 2022 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Budapest. At the end of her swim on Wednesday (local time) she became unconscious and sank to the bottom of the pool. Head coach Andrea Fuentes dived in, fully clothed, to rescue Alvarez. ""It was a good scare,"" Fuentes told Spanish sports newspaper Macra. ""I had to dive because the lifeguards didn't do it. I was scared because I could see she wasn't breathing."" The underwater rescue was captured by AFP photographer Oli Scarff. Fuentes brought Alvarez to the surface, where another swimmer helped her take Alvarez to the edge of the pool. Alvarez was lifted out of the water and onto a stretcher to receive medical attention. In a statement, Fuentes said Alvarez had a medical emergency but was OK. ""The doctors checked all vitals and everything is normal: heart rate, oxygen, sugar levels, blood pressure, etc … all is okay,"" Fuentes said. ""We sometimes forget that this happens in other high-endurance sports. ""We all have seen images where some athletes don't make it to the finish line and others help them to get there. ""Our sport is no different than others, just in a pool, we push through limits and sometimes we find them. ""Anita feels good now and the doctors also say she is okay. Tomorrow she will rest all day and will decide with the doctor if she can swim free team finals or not. Thank you for all of your well wishes for Anita."" This is not the first time Alvarez has had a medical emergency in the pool. She briefly lost consciousness at the end of a routine during an Olympic qualification event in Barcelona in June 2021. It was Fuentes again who dived in to rescue her. Alvarez came seventh on Wednesday with a score of 87.6333. The women's solo free was won by Japan's Yukiko Inui, who scored 95.3667.

2,Best of five on the line when New South Wales meet Queensland in the women's State of Origin,sport," Sport History is on the line when New South Wales meet Queensland in the women's State of Origin clash In the final year of one-off women's Origin matches, and at two wins each for New South Wales and Queensland after four meetings, there's even more on the line than usual when the rivals meet in Canberra on Friday night. With the series expanding to two matches next year, a new era will begin for women's rugby league – but before that, old scores must be settled. Both sides have two wins each since 2018, and each win has come on home soil, so on the frozen tundra of Canberra Stadium, the closest thing to neutral ground in rugby league, they will fight for the right to say they're the best of this era. The game is a decider of sorts, five years in the making. For their part, the Blues are also hell-bent on snapping their two-game losing streak. ""It annoys me (when I think about it). I hate losing, so it hasn't been great. But we played in Queensland the last two years, I'm happy this is a bit closer to home soil,"" said New South Wales prop Millie Boyle. ""Everyone gets hungrier through each year you don't have that success. We know what it's like to win, but now we know what it's like to lose as well."" The Blues enter the match as favourites, due in part to the presence of Boyle and fellow NRLW Dally M winner Emma Tonegato at fullback. While Queensland boast quality in the backline, especially with custodian Tamika Upton and dangerous five-eighth Tarry Aiken, the arctic Canberra conditions should play into the Blues' power and yardage game with Boyle, Tonegato and star prop Simaima Taufa leading the charge. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter In such conditions, the kicking game will be crucial – the Maroons will once again look to Ali Brigginshaw, as fine a playmaker as the women's game has ever seen, to lead the charge while New South Wales will trust debutant halfback Rachael Pearson to run the show. Pearson, who enjoyed a brilliant debut NRLW season with the Dragons, has the biggest boot in the game and the Hay local will be looking to showcase it early and often at Canberra Stadium. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. She'll need to overcome any debutant jitters, but after appearing in St George Illawarra's run to the NRLW grand final Pearson believes she has the big game experience to get the job done. ""It was an emotional moment, when I found out I was debuting. I was excited and proud, getting the call from Kylie and hearing her say 'I want you to be my New South Wales halfback', what else can you say but 'I'd love to',"" Pearson said. ""Coming off the back of that NRLW season, it's been hectic and crazy but in a good way. I thought I was a good chance off the season I had, but getting the call was still so exciting. ""Just coming into the sheds and seeing 'Pearson' on the back of the jersey, I had tears in my eyes. It probably won't hit me all the way until I run out in Canberra. ""Sowie (Dragons coach Jamie Soward) said to me he can't wait for the switch to flick in my mind when I realise I'm the player who's supposed to be here. But I'm not a boastful person, I just want to take this opportunity and run with it.""

3,analysis: The science of silliness: How psychology won the Socceroos a World Cup spot,sport,"  How Socceroos goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne used psychology to secure Australia's spot at the 2022 World Cup In last week's 2022 World Cup qualifying play-off between the Socceroos and Peru, there were two different games being played. The first began at the opening whistle and lasted for 119 minutes: a tense, physical battle between two uncertain sides that ultimately ended 0-0. The second game started a minute later. Because that's when Australia's head coach Graham Arnold made an unexpected (and risky) substitution, bringing off veteran goalkeeper and captain Mat Ryan for 33-year-old Andrew Redmayne. The initial reaction from Socceroos fans was one of disbelief. Ryan, who plays for Real Sociedad in Spain's La Liga, was a veteran of two World Cups and one of the team's most consistent and dependable players throughout Australia's 1,008-day-long qualifying campaign. Redmayne, on the other hand, had just two appearances for Australia to his name, and was even struggling to maintain his starting spot with Sydney FC in Australia's A-League Men. But Australian fans weren't the only ones who were baffled by the switch. Peru's players were, too. And that, according to Socceroos goalkeeper coach John Crawley — one of the only people 'in' on the plan — was the entire point. ""We always knew we had Redmayne up our sleeve,"" Crawley told the ABC. ""We planned for that. We did a couple of sessions throughout the window where we did some specific stuff on penalties. But we didn't need to tell anyone [in the team] as long as we knew the plan ourselves. ""I think you just have to do something different to disrupt the penalty-taker's routine. ""They'd played against Maty [Ryan] for the whole game and knew what he was about, so when they saw Redmayne coming on, they maybe thought, 'who's this guy?' ""Even just that bit of doubt can make a difference."" Redmayne's substitution was just the start of the psychological game that began to unfold after the final whistle of extra-time blew. As the nerve-biting penalty shoot-out got underway, there were other, subtler strategies the bearded shot-stopper performed to give his team the edge. The first was handing the ball to each of his team-mates; a tactic that was popularised by England at the 2018 World Cup and carried on by a number of goalkeepers at club level, including Liverpool's Alisson. According to Geir Jordet, a professor of sports psychology at the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences who wrote a tweet thread breaking down Redmayne's tactics, these gestures were important in fortifying the psychology of Australia's penalty-takers. However, it was what Redmayne did after each hand-off that was most interesting. ""In a penalty shoot-out, you want to make events as predictable and safe as possible for your team-mates,"" Jordet said. ""The way Redmayne helped his team-mates was spot-on: first, by handing them the ball between every shot, giving them a familiar way to start their pre-shot routine [and] a friendly word of support or encouragement. That beats getting the ball from the opponent or having to go get it yourself. ""But what I have not seen before is what he did after handing off the ball. ""He looks up at the opponent goalkeeper and saw that he was maybe trying to get into the penalty-taker's head, so [Redmayne] basically takes on the role as a bodyguard, where he lets [Gallese] know to back down and step away. He puts himself in the middle between the penalty-taker and the goalkeeper like a barrier. ""I've not seen this in a penalty shoot-out before, so this was maybe the biggest innovation for me: how he took that role of a bodyguard. That's quite unique."" Another piece of psychological warfare was barely captured on camera, but arguably had one of the biggest impacts. After Redmayne noticed one of Gallese's water-bottles had notes on Australia's penalty-takers wrapped around it — containing details on who they were and which way they would likely shoot — the Socceroos keeper picked it up and threw the bottle over the advertising boards. For Jorbet, this act didn't just deny Gallese crucial information; it also acted as an intimidation tactic, a violation of the Peruvian's property and his space. ""It's disruptive on a few levels,"" he said. ""Of course, it takes away information that he probably relied on. We don't know the extent to which he had memorised these things anyway, but it was on the bottle for a reason. ""But then there's the added aspect of it being a very hostile act. It's intimidating. It's not friendly in any way; it's leaving the goalkeeper feeling very unprotected, very attacked in this very indirect kind of way [with] someone stealing your stuff. ""You can imagine coming home and someone has been in your place and stolen things. People who've been robbed talk about how it's not just that they lost a computer or whatever, but that some stranger was in my home. So to instil that in this situation is quite extraordinary. Socceroos substitute goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne danced his way into national folklore this morning – and the internet went a wild emotional rollercoaster ride with him. ""This may be stepping over the line and taking it too far, though. I wouldn't be comfortable telling my team that [stealing] is something you should do. But if a player decides to do it on their own, that's a different thing. ""And there's the other intimidation tactic where [Redmayne] was invited to hand the ball over to one of the opponents, and then just let it go and kicked it away. It's a clear demonstration of gamesmanship: 'I don't respect you.' It's a clear, explicit mind-game."" Crawley admitted that he had prepared a similar water-bottle with notes on Peru's penalty-takers, but that Redmayne was confident enough that he wouldn't need them. ""We discussed it together probably two weeks out from the Peru game,"" Crawley said. ""And I said, 'mate, in the event that we lose our bottle — it gets thrown into the crowd or something — we've still got our signals. ""And, as it turned out, when I gave Andrew the bottle right before [the shoot-out], he said, 'mate, don't worry about the bottle. We've done the signals before with success. You hold the bottle.' ""So he's gone in there without the bottle and we just did our signals. But I actually didn't realise he took advantage of Gallese's notes being there and that he's then thrown his bottle [away]. ""But again, it's whatever it takes. We certainly had a Plan A and a Plan B, but I think Redders may have taken that to another level. And thank goodness he did."" And then, of course, there's the iconic ""Wiggles"" dance. While it looked silly and unorthodox, Jordet said there was a clear rationale behind Redmayne's flailing limbs and jittery style. ""A lot of goalkeepers do things on the line to try and distract; to try to disturb,"" he said. ""What Redmayne did was follow that principle that it needs to be unpredictable, it needs to be a little erratic, it needs to have some variation. ""Because if all you do on the line is go from left to right, from right to left, it doesn't have any impact; it's very easy for the taker to block out. So it needs to be different. ""I've watched thousands of penalty shoot-out shots over the years, and this definitely ranks in the top five with respect to unpredictability in his behaviour, which I love. ""It takes me back to football history: Liverpool in the Champions League with Dudek back in 2005 and Grobbelaar in 1984 and '85. This one fits nicely with them because it's so weird, it's so strange. And what could be more impactful than that?"" However, while it may have worked for Redmayne this time, such unusual goalkeeping tactics are still so rare in professional football that there is only a small amount of evidence to suggest it's more effective at stopping penalties than any other method. The key, Jorbet says, is the overall distraction — the psychology of the moment. ""There is research on when the goalkeepers are trying to do something to distract the shooter — no matter what it is — and that history directly reduces the chance of the shooter scoring by about 10 per cent. ""Research that I've done also looked at whether goalkeepers were able to take so much time that the penalty taker had to stand there and wait. I looked at every single penalty shot in the World Cup, the European Championships, and the Champions League and the difference there, with the shooter having to wait [for the goalkeeper] versus the shooter not waiting, was more than 20 per cent. ""So there are different ways a goalkeeper can be disruptive and there is some research to suggest it works. ""But it's always difficult to go from documenting what has happened to predicting what will happen. The point is that these are not absolute discoveries; these are trends based on history that might indicate something about probabilities going forward."" For Crawley, who Redmayne credits as introducing the idea to him when they worked together at Sydney FC, the same principle of unpredictability — as well as bravery to do something different — is what made the difference against Peru. ""Whether it's a Wiggles dance, or you turn your back on the player, or you say something to them, or you move to one side of the goal; whatever it takes, you're disrupting that routine,"" Crawley said. ""If you're a player and you're stepping up to practice a penalty, you put the ball down, you walk back, you turn around, you will always see a goalkeeper in the middle of the goal. That's routine for hundreds and hundreds of practice takes. ""So what would happen if you saw a dancing Wiggle there? Automatically, you start to win the psychological game. Andrew understands this and he's willing to make a fool of himself to get that edge. From A-League journeymen to first-generation migrants to young players moving abroad, the Socceroos' ""Aussie DNA"" is more than just mongrel and mateship. ""It's all about disrupting the routine. I don't think Redders really has a great save ratio with penalties, but we all know what he can do and what he can bring. It comes down to that intangible thing in the moment."" And that intangible thing, for Jordet, is why goalkeeping is the most 'human' position in football: so much of a goalkeeper's job happens off the ball and away from cameras. Their power lies largely within the invisible, but very real, dynamics they create between themselves and others on the field. ""This is such a personal type of strategy,"" he said. ""It's something where you have to use yourself more than other parts of the game where you can just do your job. ""There's something very human about this that transcends the game itself, in a way. You have to be able to put yourself out there in a moment like this, do something that others might not. ""These are the intangible human parts of football that are so fascinating. It's something that's very hard to measure; it's something that's hard to quantify. And that's exactly what is so wonderful about it.""

4,"analysis: How going without a ruck is helping Port move the ball, and why it might impact the rest of the league",sport," Sport Inside the game: How Port Adelaide's could change the game with their no-ruck approach Heading into Round 12 Port Adelaide was at a crossroads. A top four fancy at the start of the year, and minor premiers just two years ago, the Power were stuck in the lower ranges of the ladder and struggled to both effectively win the ball, and move it when they had it in hand. They had also been caught out by Essendon in the wet the week before. Before the team selections were made, coach Ken Hinkley hinted to the media that they would play smaller rather than taller, with a wry grin on his face. By that stage, Hinkley had decided to go into the game without a true ruck. Instead, forwards Jeremy Finlayson, Charlie Dixon and midfielder Sam Powell-Pepper shouldered the load against Richmond. While they lost the game, they did win the clearance battle in the middle. Port's ruckless experiment is far from the first foray into this space. Sydney legend Adam Goodes won a Brownlow Medal in the ruck, but in practice operated more like a supersized midfielder, beating lumbering bigs on the ground. At 191cm he tended to lose the hitout battle, but outworked his direct opponent around the ground. But using an undersized second ruck option is different to being completely undersized. So how can teams get away without picking a true ruck? Going small when others go tall isn't unique to footy. In fact, the world just got a reminder of the most prominent current version when the Golden State Warriors took their fourth NBA title in eight years, thanks in part to their ""death lineup"". The death lineup features the 6'6"" defensive maestro Draymond Green at centre, running his far taller opponents off the floor while protecting the paint. In the AFL the theory is similar. Going small gives you a speed advantage, at the expense of potency in the air. It's what Hinkley hinted at when he suggested playing without a ruck against Richmond. ""We're really pleased with the end result. To be fair, we ended up winning clearances so it's a pretty good performance by our midfield group collectively to be able to,"" Hinkley told reporters after the game. ""Because we got beat in hitouts — which we knew that was going to be on the cards with us. So we managed that really well I thought."" Port managed just 18 hitouts to 41 from the Toby Nankervis led Richmond across the game. Crucially, Port was able to win the clearance battle, reading the hitouts more effectively than their counterparts. Port's makeshift rucks fought hard to limit where Richmond could effectively direct hitouts. Port's rucks used their body positioning to effectively deny easy access to the ball. Around the ground, Port looked more attacking than they had in weeks, speeding the game up. While they narrowly lost, they looked re-energised. Last week against Sydney, Port shifted up a step further. After an injury to first game ruck Brynn Teakle early in the game, the Power were forced to go ruckless again. The move helped take the game away from the Swans. The ability for the Power rucks to contest and compete around the ground frustrated Sydney ruck Peter Ladhams, with the Swans' big lashing out during the game. The extra mobility of the Power presented open taller targets around the ground, critical against a Swans side that can be left exposed on the counter attacks. Despite giving up raw height to Sydney, they gained in being able to use what height they had. For most of the year, Port has been the worst team in the league in terms of centre clearance scoring differential. However, when they went ruckless the Power were able to largely nullify their opponents from the middle, and broke even in the contests. Hinkley's decision to shift to a ruckless strategy wasn't without precedent. In 2018, an early injury crisis at the club left it without any fit and mature rucks. That spell of ruckless play saw them win three of five games, likely helping Port's ability to adapt and Hinkley's willingness to experiment. The Power aren't the only side who have had to resort to going ruck free this year, and aren't the only side to succeed while doing so. When both Rowan Marshall and Jack Hayes were injured late in the game against GWS on the big stage of Friday night footy in Canberra, the Saints' narrow 15 point lead looked vulnerable against the two headed ruck hydra of Matt Flynn and Braydon Pruess. For a side looking to prove itself worthy of the top four, holding the ground in the middle would be key to winning the game. In the last quarter the Giants were able to win 31 of 32 hitouts largely through Pruess. Normally, this would indicate that GWS would be able to dominate first possession, and the rest of the contest. Instead, St Kilda won first disposal 17 times of those 32, effectively limiting their biggest advantage. ""It's interesting around the ball sometimes. Sometimes when you actually lose the hitouts by that much you're not worrying about your bloke,"" St Kilda coach Brett Ratten told the ABC after the game. ""You're not watching what your bloke's doing. You're just watching the opposition. So we have then three onballers and other players around who are just scanning him and what he does so they're not getting caught up in this 'we win one, they win one'. So it's all the focus on just watching their ruckman."" With Pruess playing just his third game at the Giants, that important ruck-midfield combination was absent when it was needed most. Late in the game Pruess and Flynn were relying on taps to the feet of the contest or big punches forward, often with little variation. Some clubs utilise calls to specific players in stoppages, others to zones. Whatever method GWS used on that Friday night, St Kilda decoded it easily. The Saints set up well on the defensive side of the stoppage, limiting the damage that the Giants could do even if they got a touch on the ball first. The mobile St Kilda bigs were also able to outwork the taller Pruess around the ground, and at the foot of the contest. Ratten commended Josh Battle and his ability to outwork the Giants' bigs at ground level after the game. Despite losing the battle in the air, Battle won the war on the ground — and more importantly the Saints won the game. Generally speaking, winning the hitouts does not particularly suggest winning the match. Since the introduction of ruck nominations in 2017, winning a lot of hitouts has often been as useful as winning very few of them. Teams have become better at knowing how to compete despite losing the aerial battle. Winning clearances, however, has a more considerable impact. The first touch in the ruck is far less useful than the first real use of the ball, which often dictates the pace and direction of play. It may be widely understood that raw hitouts don't represent the midfield battle, but even an edge in hitouts to advantage in a match has only a loose relationship with clearance effectiveness. Winning hitouts and clearances don't always go hand in hand, but a good ruck and midfield group have some small edge in turning the former into the latter. Some sides base significant parts of their game around winning the contest. Last year the Suns were without captain Jarrod Witts for most of the season, robbing the team of a big part of their identity. While the Suns had some strong weeks, they largely struggled without their talisman. Melbourne, absent Max Gawn in the coming weeks, faces a similar challenge. Going ruckless seems to work best in a few situations. It seems to work well as a surprise tactic, especially in wetter conditions. This surprise factor can also help a makeshift ruck after an in-game injury. Ruckless sides seem to have a real mobility advantage against slower primary rucks, and where they have ample other tall targets around the ground. The best tap rucks present the biggest challenge to the strategy, as do the most mobile traditional rucks. If Port continues to experiment in the ruck, and keeps rising up the ladder, a new approach to rucking in the AFL could be on the horizon.

5,'Infuriated' former world champion joins swimmers speaking out against trans ban,sport," Sport Former world champion swimmer Danni Miatke warns FINA ban on transgender athletes will impact a 'marginalised' community for decades Former world champion swimmer Danni Miatke says she is ""infuriated"" by FINA's controversial ruling that effectively bans transwomen from elite competition. Miatke, who won gold in the 50m butterfly at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, said she rejected the idea that banning transwomen from participation was about prioritising ""fairness"" over ""inclusion"". ""This isn't about fairness, because fairness is inclusivity,"" she told ABC Sport. ""We're talking about not just Australia's, but the world's most marginalised people. We should be doing everything we can to uplift and support them."" Miatke, who identifies as a member of the LGBTQI+ community, said she was also disappointed that Dolphins captain Cate Campbell had spoken publicly in support of the ban. ""I understand the difficult position that Cate is in, as a media personality, and as someone who was asked to give evidence to FINA,"" she said. ""But sportspeople are pillars of Australian communities in terms of setting the moral standard of what we will accept. ""This is not about the athletes competing now, this is about an entire community and generation of people who are going to feel the negative impact of this decision and these comments, for decades."" Miatke, who now works as a pharmacist in a Melbourne-based hospital, added that it was only with the hindsight of retirement that she had come to understand the critical role sport plays in shaping social norms. ""I'll be really honest, I didn't have this perspective when I was an athlete,"" the 34-year-old said. ""They teach you to be really selfish, because how else can you justify spending 60 hours in a pool a week? ""But I think if you're going to comment [on an issue like this], you need to educate yourself about the impact of those decisions beyond you as an individual."" Miatke added that she was sick of gender equality being used as an excuse to exclude trans and gender diverse people from sport. ""You can't say you're a feminist if you're transphobic, that's nonsense,"" said Miatke. ""Feminism stands for equality for everybody, not just cisgender women. In talking about transwomen, we are talking about women."" Miatke is not the only former swimmer to have spoken out against the ban in recent days, with Maddie Groves responding angrily to Cate Campbell's claim that her stance on the FINA decision came from a place of ""acceptance"" for gender diverse people. Groves made headlines last year when she withdrew from Olympic trials, citing a culture of misogyny within Australian swimming. She has since also spoken to the ABC about allegedly being sexually abused by someone who works in the sport. On Tuesday, she was joined by former Canadian Olympic swimmer Nikki Dryden, now a human rights lawyer, who told Radio National's Patricia Karvelas that she believed the ban was unconstitutional. ""There's no way this [ban] could stand up internationally under human rights rules,"" Dryden told Karvelas. ""If Lia Thomas [transwoman and NCAA swimmer] is listening, call me. I'd love to take this to court, all the way up to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)."" Dryden added that it was problematic that FINA was yet to reveal who made up the ""taskforce"" behind the bombshell decision. ""We haven't got to see any of the names from this supposed taskforce, either the scientists or the human rights consultants,"" Dryden said. ""The reference to 'science' is really flawed, because when you read [the policy] they keep comparing men to women... but we're not talking about men vs women, we're talking about trans or intersex women and [cis] women."" Dryden went on to claim that those who voted on the policy had less than 15 minutes to read and make a final decision on it. ""FINA did this 40-minute presentation and they had all these people speak, including Cate Campbell; they didn't even have the policy in front of them during that presentation,"" she said.

6,'Queensland's Everest' to feature country racing's richest prize,sport,"  Toowoomba Turf Club lands King of the Mountain horse race Toowoomba is set to ring in the New Year with the richest provincial horse race in Queensland's history. Toowoomba horse trainer Maddy Sears said The King of the Mountain slot race, which will have a $750,000 prize pool, was a great initiative by the Toowoomba Turf Club. ""It really highlights the region and will showcase how good our horses really are,"" Sears said. The sprint race will be run under lights at Clifford Park on December 31, with entries restricted to Queensland-bred and trained horses. Sears, who operates a family business with her father Tony, said they were already eyeing off a spot in the lucrative race. ""It would be a fantastic opportunity to have a horse in the race,"" she said. ""Obviously, to win the first one would be an honour… no one can take that title away from you."" The King of the Mountain concept is based on the hugely successful Everest and Kosciuszko slot races in New South Wales. The Toowoomba Turf Club spearheaded a campaign to add another big race event to the regional Queensland calendar and formed a committee of select business, event and racing experts. Committee chair Paul Reedy said it took the basic principles of the NSW races but added a maroon feel. ""We sort of pinched a little bit of both, but we've put some twists on it to make it just Queensland,"" he said. He said it was open to Queensland Thoroughbred Incentive Scheme horses and Queensland-based trainers to encourage a magnificent provincial race where the city met the bush. ""We're trying to make sure we enhance this race and make sure it's good for all participants,"" Mr Reedy said. Mr Reedy said there were 12 slots to fill. ""You don't have to be a Queenslander to own a slot, just the horse you picked to race in your slot has to be sourced and trained here,"" he said. ""People will buy a slot for $40,000 which gives us $480,000 … and Queensland Thoroughbred Incentive Scheme are putting the other remaining $270,000 needed to bring it up to $750,000."" Other big race meets outside Brisbane, like the Gold Coast's Magic Millions and the Ipswich Cup, are part of the metropolitan race draw. Racing Queensland chief executive Brendan Parnell said the race would further incentivise the local breeding industry, including the highly vaunted Queensland Thoroughbred Incentive Scheme, which provided more than $12 million in prize money each year. Mr Parnell said Racing Queensland couldn't say no when the Toowoomba Turf Club presented its idea. ""It was an innovative submission brought forward by the club and the breeders and we thought, 'well, let's back that' because this is the heartland of breeding and it's a concept that supports the breeding industry,"" he said. ""When clubs come forward with innovative concepts, we're really excited to support them."" Mr Parnell said the slot race would boost an already booming summer carnival. ""The big Magic Millions race day is only two weeks later, so the winner of the King of the Mountain could be vying for a million-dollar race two weeks later,"" he said. Expressions of interest for slots are expected to open in the coming weeks. ABC Southern Qld will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Wednesday.

7,Scott Morrison resigns as Perth Wildcats coach as turmoil engulfs NBL's most successful club,sport," Sport Perth Wildcats coach Scott Morrison resigns after one season in NBL as upheaval hits club Perth Wildcats coach Scott Morrison has resigned as the turmoil engulfing the NBL's most successful club continues. Morrison has quit due to ""family reasons"" which the Wildcats said would require him to return to North America. The Canadian exits the club after just one season in charge, during which Perth missed the NBL playoffs for the first time in 35 years. Morrison's departure comes just days after the club sacked long-time chief executive Troy Georgiu under what new owner Sports Entertainment Network called a desire for ""further integrating and aligning the organisation"" within the business. It means the Wildcats will have had three coaches in the space of just 12 months, with Morrison's tenure preceded by the departure of Trevor Gleeson to pursue a career in the NBA. Perth has won five of the last nine NBL championships and a record 10 titles overall, with the most recent coming in the 2020 season. Morrison said while it was a difficult decision, when forced to choose between his professional life and what was best for his wife and children, there was only one option. ""Our children's best chance to thrive is closer to family in a more familiar environment,"" he said. ""It is with great emotion that I make this announcement, but in the end, I feel that I'm doing what is most important in the big picture, which is making a decision that will best help our young children in the short and the long run. ""At the end of the day the choice came down to a potential risk of regret in terms of a parent, and a potential risk in my career, which is what we're choosing."" He admitted it was sad to leave off the back of a disappointing season, which saw the club's historic playoff run come to an end. ""The only frustrating thing was when people would say that I didn't really want to be there because that was the furthest thing from the truth, I think it's the exact opposite. ""I feel bad that I didn't deliver I guess what our goals were when I was hired, for the team, and if there's a regret. It's just that I can't go back and try to meet those goals."" Prior to Morrison's departure, the club had strongly endorsed him to continue in the role, even after missing the playoffs. The Wildcats said they were disappointed to lose Morrison but understood that ""family comes first"". ""The club will now undertake an extensive search process to appoint a new head coach,"" the Wildcats said in a statement. As the Wildcats prepare to begin the search for both a new coach and CEO, and also deal with the recent departures of a number of other staff, they've been forced to reject suggestions they're a club in crisis. ""No not at all, we've got a really exciting future,"" said Craig Hutchison, the chief executive of Sports Entertainment Network, which owns the Wildcats. ""These series of events are not in sequence, they're just timed as they've happened, Scott's situation is peculiar to this time, and we absolutely feel bullish about the team that we can and will build. ""We'd ask everyone to judge us on our performance this summer on the floor and not necessarily what happens between now and then.""

8,"analysis: Why it's time for Samoa, rugby league's sleeping giant, to awaken from its slumber",sport," Sport As Samoa looks to begin again, it's time for rugby league's sleeping giant to awaken The return of international rugby league after almost three years lost to COVID-19 has given everybody a fresh start, and nobody needs one more than the proud men from Samoa. On a weekend where their Pacific rivals Tonga will take on New Zealand in Auckland in what is a true clash of two Test footy titans, Samoa will once again be trying to start something up when they face the Cook Islands on Saturday in Campbelltown. There is a path where Samoa end up joining Tonga alongside Australia, New Zealand and England as one of the sport's top level sides – but for it to happen, rugby league's sleeping giant will need to awaken. And with Samoa playing host nation England in the World Cup opener at season's end, there is no better time than right now for the tide to turn. ""You just have to see what the Tongans have done for their team to see what footy means in the Pacific. We want to do the jersey proud, Samoa is a proud nation and we want to play well for them,"" said halfback Anthony Milford. ""It's a special week. I'm always honoured to put the jersey on and I'm always grateful for the opportunity given to me by (coach) Matty Parish and the coaching staff. I can't wait to represent my people and my family."" Tonga is blessed with an extraordinary crop of talent, headed by Jason Taumalolo. But how does international rugby league's newest powerhouse turn that into a sustainable future? The pandemic years have not been easy for Samoan rugby league, and nor were the seasons that came beforehand. As Tonga shot ahead in the pecking order, the Samoans stagnated. They've won just one of their last nine matches, the last time they troubled one of the big three was back in the 2014 Four Nations, and their last showing was a disaster, a 44-18 belting at the hands of Fiji in November 2019. Over the past few years there's also been bitter backroom infighting with long-time coach Parish coming under fire from players past and present. But Parish, who has coached the side since 2013, survived and has been blessed with a strong crop of up-and-coming talent, even though Samoa is yet to enjoy a Jason Taumalolo-style wave of defections. For Milford, Samoa's longest-serving player after he debuted as an 18-year old nine years ago, this is the biggest change he's seen during his time with the island nation. ""When I first came through I was the youngest, now I'm the last one left from that 2013 World Cup,"" said Milford. ""There's good times ahead, a lot of youth who are putting guys on their toes. It's a luxury, to have that competition and Matty can pick so many top players. ""It makes our nation stronger and harder to play against."" A host of debutants, led by a Penrith contingent of Charlie Staines, Taylan May, Izack Tago and Spencer Leniu, as well as Manly backrower Josh Schuster, can bring about a new dawn for Samoa, who are heavily favoured to dispatch the Cook Islands in quick time. A thumping, feel-good win could be just what the side needs for a reboot, which could make the call of home and history, of family and heritage almost impossible to ignore for some of the game's biggest names. Because it will be away from Campbelltown, across the desert in Perth and over the sea in Auckland, where the best Samoan players in the world will be plying their trade this weekend. Brian To'o, Jarome Luai, Tino Fa'asuamaleaui, Josh Papalii and Junior Paulo, who have all worn Samoan blue before, will play Origin on Sunday night. So will Stephen Crichton and Payne Haas, who are eligible, as is rising star Joseph Suaalii who forms part of the extended New South Wales squad. In Auckland, Samoan graduates Isaiah Papali'i, Ronaldo Mulitalo and Moses Leota will wear the black and white of New Zealand, and so will man mountain Nelson Asofa-Solomona, another player of Samoan descent. It's asking a lot, for them to give up Origin jerseys and Kangaroo and Kiwis spots - landing all of them for the World Cup is unrealistic in the extreme, and Milford says that's not what Samoa are expecting. They'll back their people no matter what they choose. ""It can be hard, but a lot of those boys have been in camp before and know what it's like. I know they enjoyed being here,"" Milford said. ""It's up to them, whatever they choose, we'll support them, If they pick Australia, good on them, if they pick Samoa we'll always have a place for them."" But just imagine, for a moment, what it could be like if Samoa just landed a couple of them. They just need a few, because once they get one then more will follow. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Imagine if Suaalii, who is living up to his reputation as the game's best young player, plays for the land of his fathers, or if Luai and To'o join their Penrith brothers and ramp the Panthers vibe up another notch, or if Haas and Paulo trade one blue jersey for another and give Samoa a pack that can match anybody in the world. It's a lot to give up, and Samoa can be competitive regardless of landing those players or not. But they can aim higher than just competitive. There can be greatness in this team and in this jersey. There is a future where everybody comes home and Samoa like their chances against anybody, any time, anywhere. They just need something they can come back to. Something that Tonga has found but Samoa is still looking for. It won't happen overnight, but it can happen – and if it does, it can start against the Cook Islands on Saturday.

9,"Mollie O'Callaghan wins another relay medal, set for more at world swim titles",sport," Sport Australia's Mollie O'Callaghan could end world swimming titles with up to six medals after latest silver in 4x200m freestyle relay Mollie O'Callaghan has raced to her third medal of the world championships in Budapest by spearheading the Australia 4x200m freestyle relay quartet to silver. Australians in finals on day five Yet, though she couldn't bring home the main prize on the anchor leg in Wednesday's final, the 18-year-old star also demonstrated earlier with an amazing swim in the 100m freestyle that a second gold could soon be on its way. Thursday also offers the scent of another gold with Zac Stubblety-Cook ready to dominate the 200m breaststroke final to complete an Olympics/world championship double. Their efforts helped bring a smile back to the Dolphins after Shayna Jack had earlier been forced to quit the championships after slipping and breaking her hand in a warm-up area. For the 23-year-old, the abrupt end to her first global competition after completing a two-year doping ban left her ""broken-hearted"". Jack posted an Instagram message from hospital, speaking of her ""shock and disbelief"", confirming scans showed she had a spiral break in her fourth metacarpal. ""This was caused by a freak accident during my 100 freestyle warm up involving another swimmer,"" Jack said. ""To ensure the fastest possible recovery for my hand, I will be returning home to AUS for surgery. ""Post surgery the plan is to return to my teammates in Charters, in preparation for the Commonwealth Games."" Later, Queenslander O'Callaghan took the limelight as she attempted to top off the efforts of Madi Wilson, Leah Neale and Kiah Melverton on the previous three legs of the 4x200 by overhauling American anchor-leg swimmer Bella Sims. But having competed a breathtaking semi-final of the 100m only an hour and a half earlier, O'Callaghan — the individual 200m silver medallist — couldn't get near the flying Sims. After fine work from Claire Weinstein, Leah Smith and the great Katie Ledecky, who produced a decisive third leg, Sims brought the US home in a championship record 7 minutes 41.45 seconds, well clear of Australia (7:43.86). O'Callaghan, though, had earlier produced an astonishing performance in her individual semi, clocking the fastest-ever second half to a women's race, amazingly shooting from last to first place over a landmark final length timed at 26.43sec. Australian gold medallist Shayna Jack is forced to the pull out of the rest of the world championships after breaking her hand during a warm-up. That was just one-hundredth of a second slower than her first half of the race and her 52.85sec saw her qualify fastest for Thursday's final, ahead of Sweden's eight-time world champion Sarah Sjostrom, who won the other race. Having also won gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay, O'Callaghan could potentially end up with six medals as she also has chances in the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay and women's 4x100m medley relay. Stubblety-Cook looks to be untouchable in his Tokyo-winning event, after after setting a time of 2:06.72 in his 200m breaststroke semi which was over two seconds faster than his nearest challenger. His own world record of 2:05.95, set at the national championships in Adelaide last month, could well be in danger as he looked to have more in reserve. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. The Dolphins have now picked up eight medals in total — two golds, five silvers and one bronze — after five days of competition to put them fourth on the table behind the USA (11 golds), Italy (four golds) and China (three golds). Teenager Elizabeth Dekkers made a breakthrough in the 200m butterfly, finishing fifth in the final in 2:07.01 behind the remarkable young Canadian champion, Summer MacIntosh, who clocked a world junior record 2:05.20. The 15-year-old MacIntosh then clocked another world junior mark in the 4x200m freestyle final with her opening leg of 1:54.79, which helped propel Canada to the silver. Kaylee McKeown had to settle for sixth in a blanket finish to the 50m backstroke — not her strongest discipline — but her 27.47sec clocking was, agonisingly, just 0.07 outside the medals as 0.08sec separated second to sixth places. Canadian Kylie Masse won in 27.31. AAP We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

10,Kyrgios plays it safe for Wimbledon but smashes ATP over off-court coaching,sport," Sport Nick Kyrgios withdraws from Mallorca event due to abdominal pain ahead of Wimbledon, opposes ATP trial of off-court coaching Nick Kyrgios has taken a ""no-risk"" approach towards his Wimbledon fitness, but the same cannot be said of his blast at the men's tour over off-court coaching trials. The in-form Australian has taken the cautious route to Wimbledon, deciding to pull out of his last-16 tie against Roberto Bautista Agut at the Mallorca Championship on Wednesday, local time, after suffering abdominal pain. Kyrgios — who has been a big hit with the local fans on the Spanish island — says he was sorry to have to disappoint them by withdrawing because of a painful abdomen muscle problem that he'd suffered during Tuesday's win over Laslo Djere. Taking doctor's advice, he played it safe, saying he wanted to take ""no risks"" with his best shot at Wimbledon in recent years just around the corner. However. the enigmatic Australian was not playing safe with his views about the ATP's plans to trial off-court coaching, saying he believes the unique nature of the sport was being removed by the experiment. The ATP will trial the system in the second half of the season, with players allowed to receive instructions during qualifying and main draw matches in tournaments, including the US Open and the ATP Finals. Patrick Mouratoglou — who helped guide Serena Williams to glory — congratulated the ATP for ""legalising a practice that has been going on at almost every match for decades"" but Kyrgios was adamant in his opposition. ""Completely disagree. Loses one of the only unique traits that no other sport had,"" Kyrgios responded on Twitter. ""The player had to figure out things on his own. That was the beauty of it. What happens if a high-profile player versus a low-ranked player who doesn't have or (cannot) afford a coach?"" Mouratoglou was involved in the most high-profile piece of off-court coaching at the 2018 US Open final when Williams was given a warning for his gesturing. The new trial is due to begin on July 11, the day after the end of Wimbledon, where Kyrgios has good reason to believe he could have his best run yet after reaching two grass-court semi-finals in the space of two weeks in Stuttgart and Halle. ""I'm really sorry I'm going to have to withdraw from tonight's match here in Mallorca. I have been playing a lot of great matches lately and, unfortunately, I woke up with a pain in my abs,"" Kyrgios said in a statement released by the organisers on Wednesday, local time. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""I went to see the tournament doctor right away and he advised that I don't play tonight. I really value the Mallorca Championships but I will follow his advice as I don't want to risk Wimbledon next week. ""I was really looking forward to tonight's match as I've been loving my time here. Mallorca is such a beautiful island with really nice people."" Javier Cerrato, the tournament doctor, reported: ""Nick Kyrgios suffers pain in the rectus abdominis, on the left side, due to the accumulation of matches in recent weeks and the effort of yesterday's first-round match. ""This will not allow him to return to the court tonight."" Organisers must have been left disappointed that his exit also prevented the prospect of a blockbuster quarter-final for the Australian against world number one Daniil Medvedev, who earned his place in the last eight on Wednesday, with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Aslan Karatsev.

11,analysis: The NRLW is expanding at breakneck speed. Will women's rugby league be ready for the future?,sport," Sport The NRLW is set to radically expand in the next 12 months. But is women's rugby league ready for such rapid growth? The world of women's rugby league is changing faster and faster all the time. That's the thing about progress – it's a path that leads down a hill, so the further things go, the faster they get there. And women's rugby league is hurtling down the hill. Friday night will be the last time the State of Origin series is contested in a single match before it expands to two next year. After three new clubs joined the NRLW for 2022's first season the league, flush with success, fast-tracked expansion from two new teams for 2023 to four new sides, meaning the competition will have more than doubled in size in less than three years. Growing Origin is a no-brainer, but flooding the NRLW with new clubs is a more complex discussion, with some of the game's biggest names split on whether the league is ready for ten teams. ""It's nearly doubled with what we've got at the moment and we're already struggling to fill up those last few spots on the teams as is,"" Newcastle and New South Wales prop Millie Boyle said. ""I know the game is growing, I'm not sure if it's growing at the pace where they can put in those new teams."" Boyle, a member of the Rugby League Players Association women's advisory group, also takes issue with what she believes to be a lack of consultation from the NRL on the viability of such radical expansion. ""We're on there, but they're going to make their own decisions. I guess they'll say we're whinging whatever happens – 'they say we're not big enough, they say there's not enough teams, they say there's too many',"" Boyle said. ""We'll never be able to make everyone happy. They make the rules and you can't grow unless you grow. I thought it would be two teams, but it's not up to me. ""Four teams will be a big jump, I guess with the new marquee spots and the new CBA we'll spread girls out again and get them to new areas all over the country, especially down in Canberra and up in North Queensland."" When Sam Bremner announced she would take time away from rugby league to start a family, people treated it like a retirement. Now she's making her return to State of Origin after a four-year absence. The NRLW took four years to expand following it's launch in 2018, a slow-burn approach which ensured there was always enough elite-level talent to fill out the existing teams. It meant that when the league finally pulled the trigger on growing the game, they were able to spread out enough star players to ensure the new teams were competitive. Things didn't work out perfectly – Newcastle were winless in their first campaign – but every other team won at least two games and for the most part, matches were closely fought and competitive. Providing new avenues and pathways and growing the sport is important, but so is producing a high-quality product on the field. If the quality of play rises, as it did this year, it means better ratings, stronger crowds and increased interest from fans both old and new. It's easier to sell, which means more people will buy it. If there is more teams than there is talent there's a danger of scores blowing out and the competition losing it's lustre as the snake starts to eat it's tail. Given Canberra, Cronulla, North Queensland and Wests Tigers must all find enough players to fill out a competitive roster and given there was a winless side in a six-team league it's a fair question to ask if that will be possible. What will help matters is that each of the four clubs has a strong grassroots program – Cronulla and the Tigers have fielded teams in the NSW Women's Premiership since 2019, the Raiders have a Tarsha Gale Cup (Under 18s) side and the North Queensland Gold Stars, who will presumably provide many of the Cowboys players, won the Queensland Women's Premiership grand final earlier this month. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter And, as Blues veteran Sam Bremner points out, if there are more spots available it creates more opportunities for players to fill those spots, which should help grow participation. Bremner, who has played at the top level of women's rugby league since 2012 and has witnessed the game's transformation over the past decade first-hand, knows the old ""you can't be what you can't see"" adage still rings true. ""It is a really big jump, but the best thing that ever happened to women's rugby league was that we exposed it,"" Bremner said. ""I remember going to a school after we won the World Cup and they asked the kids 'hands up if you've ever heard of the Jillaroos' and one boy stood up and said 'yeah, I know them, they play hockey'. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""From then, we started exposing women's rugby league and all these girls started playing and I think having more opportunities are going to make girls think it's possible for them, and then the depth continues to grow. ""It is a really big leap, but I have faith we can fill those spots. It's an exciting time for women's rugby league. ""Girls can see us on TV and we say it all the time but it's true, you can't be what you can't see."" Regardless of how this new round of expansion goes, it's unlikely the NRLW will be slowing down. The NRL already wants to expand again - South Sydney want in for the 2024 season and Penrith are keen to field a team as soon as possible. Unless the four new sides are an unmitigated disaster, the game will keep flying down the hill until it either levels out or topples over. The careful, slow approach is over. Sometimes, if you wait until you're ready you never get ready at all, and the NRL has decided the future is coming and it's coming fast.

12,analysis: AFL Round-Up: Top-eight chaos as season sits perfectly poised for the run home,sport," Sport AFL Round-Up: Top-eight chaos as 2022 season sits perfectly poised for the run home It was a week of upsets and top-eight movement, setting the table for the home stretch of an enthralling season. Welcome to the Round-Up, where we digest the week that was. Of all of the three bye weeks, this one felt the most bye week-ish. The big dogs at the top of the ladder had a week off, so attentions were turned a little lower down. Luckily the goings on down there — and by that we mean from about fourth to 12th — is pretty compelling. In fact we've got one of the craziest finals races in recent memory brewing here. The big movers this week were Richmond, whose win over Carlton both went some way to re-establishing the old order and brought the Tigers back into flag consideration. Such is the evenness of this season across the board, Richmond's experience on the biggest stage and in the biggest games will become an asset. The same could be said for Geelong, who have once again quietly been sucked in by the gravitational pull of the top four. We've said all year there is likely to be one vacant spot in the top four and any number of teams capable of taking it. Right now, the smart money would be on one of Geelong or Richmond making it their own by the end of the season. Perhaps that is overreacting to one round, but it's hard to get too hyped about Sydney or St Kilda after their massively disappointing showings this weekend. Both were smacked by teams well below them on the ladder, mustering little fight and showing little resolve once their attacking instincts were headed off. The Swans in particular have been wildly unpredictable this year, their best just about untouchable and their worst barely worth registering. Collingwood, Gold Coast and the Western Bulldogs are lurking just outside that top eight now. Sporadic brilliance might not be enough to cut it in the race for the eight this year. We normally try not to get too ahead of ourselves in the Round-Up, but it's hard not to look at next week and not get excited. It's as if these three bye weeks were all just to set us up for round 15, when the 2022 season moves into its glorious home stretch with everything still up for grabs. Check out these fixtures: It's probably good that Richmond publicly told Shai Bolton off for his showboating, but internally I hope they were far less critical. He is a special player whose flair and showmanship should be protected at all costs. West Coast produced their best performance of the year this week, and Geelong one of their more timid. In a weird win-win, the Eagles would have been happy with their intent and performance and the Cats simply happy to get out of there with the points. We put a line through Port Adelaide last week here. Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. As long as there is a mathematical chance, any team with those key-position weapons can't be completely discounted. It was hard to know where to look during the Giants' and Bulldogs' 80s throwback game, but it was very easy to know where not to look. Cody Weightman's elbow. Returning to play after that might go some way to killing off some of the chatter around the young gun and ""the way he goes about it"". Good for Essendon. It would have been pretty easy to shut up shop in the third quarter after St Kilda basically erased the deficit in about five minutes, but to find the willingness to go again shows there is still something about this team. The Dons can really underline the point with a win over West Coast next week. Wil Powell's injury was the sort of one that can rattle teammates so thoroughly they struggle to see out the game. The Suns couldn't afford that and did well to finish the job. But holy cannoli, poor Wil Powell. Here we take stock of who is leading the race for the season's individual awards. A slow week in the Rising Star race with many of the frontrunners sitting out, but Nic Martin gave a timely reminder of his credentials. We've still got Nick Daicos in front for now, but it's going to be genuinely exciting to see which of the chief contenders — Daicos, Martin, Jai Newcombe and Sam De Koning — run away with this thing. Sam Draper can take home mark of the week honours with this solid entry. Not nearly enough to trouble Cam Zuurhar's lead though. Slim pickings on the goal front his week too, so we'll chuck it to Jack Billings for this one from the same game. Ed Langdon's grip on the GOTY title remains.

13,"analysis: After Peru, it's back to the drawing board for Socceroos boss Graham Arnold",sport,"  After the Socceroos' gruelling World Cup qualification, it's back to the drawing board for head coach Graham Arnold Just for a moment, Graham Arnold can take a breather. There is relief all around now that the Socceroos have qualified for the FIFA World Cup. He held his head in his hands during the penalty shootout against Peru; unable to bring himself to watch, he relied instead on the reaction of the players and staff around him to know whether Australia was going through or whether his job finished there and then, on the sidelines of Khalifa International Stadium. But if you thought the road to qualification was dramatic, that's not the half of it. Off the pitch, Arnold has had to be many things, from psychologist to politician, navigating COVID-19 challenges, player crises, and more, with the tenacity of a world-class boxer mixed with the strategic mindset of a chess grand master. Now, 1,008 gruelling days after this qualification period began, he has a brief moment to sit and reflect on the journey so far. What comes to mind, at first, is something Justin Langer once said. ""I read this great article Justin Langer wrote when he was Australian cricket coach, talking about how lonely coaching the national team is, and it resonated very much with me,"" Arnold told The Ticket. The Socceroos coach is quick to point out he has ""great staff"" around him which, ""especially during COVID, was very special"". But despite their unflinching support, not a single one of them can know the extent of the constant stomach churn and inner debate a head coach must wrestle with incessantly. Building a team culture that unites a group of journeymen in order to achieve something greater than their individual talents is a 24/seven mission. All the while, the loneliness of a head coach knows the media will be quick to doubt you, seizing on any perceived weakness. Their words impact those closest to you like poisonous darts finding their target, sometimes sowing the seeds of discontent in the minds of some of those watching on from head office. A head coach accepts the position with the sword of Damocles hovering overhead. ""That's something that's never bothered me because you can only focus on what we can do, and I'm just here to help the players,"" he said. ""Coaching has changed so much over time… the generation of people and the players. ""Just being there to support the players, more than being a 'dictating' coach, which I probably was when I was younger. ""Now it's more about the players taking ownership, and caring for the players, and making sure that they're mentally right and you're showing that type of support. ""These boys, they've been through a lot over the last year and a half with COVID, not being able to get back to Australia. ""Some of these boys had long COVID and missed a couple of camps, and then we lost players due to COVID. I missed two camps with COVID as well, and so it's been tough. But when you stick at it [and] really make those sacrifices, then everything is possible and achievable."" While COVID has been the great disruptor to many people's lives over the past two years, one gets the sense it has become a blanket of sorts, masking many other personal crises that players have gone through and which Arnold has had to deal with. What the world sees when the team plays a game is like the serving of a meal: those who consume it are oblivious to what happened during its lengthy preparation. ""What you get on the field is what you actually do off the field,"" Arnold said. ""If, off the field, you build a great culture, a family culture where people care for each other, and people are prepared to work for each other, and people are loyal to each other, then you get the result on the field. ""At the end of the day, the game is only 90 minutes, but if the players don't go out on the pitch and be prepared to give everything they've got for each other, then you're never going to be successful. ""One of the most important things in coaching is making sure you get that right."" Arnold's journey to this year's World Cup has been 40 years or more in the making. As a kid, he played rugby league at school and soccer on weekends. He was coached throughout his junior years by his dad in an era when well-being meant nothing and toughening up was all that mattered. For more than a decade, Arnold was a Socceroos striker in a national team that came agonisingly close to breaking the team's decades-long World Cup drought, but it wasn't to be. Destiny sometimes arrives through a different door than the one we walk through. ""It has been a long journey,"" Arnold said. ""But I just have the passion for Australian football. I just want to help kids and help the players fulfil their dreams, because I feel very blessed and privileged that I've had the life that I've had in Australian football. If everyone could have a life like I've had, I'd be very happy."" So, what's it going to take for the Socceroos to win a World Cup? ""I don't think I'll be alive when that happens, but the game in Australia — the growth in the game — means the Socceroos are only as strong as the development system. ""People talk about the golden generation and all those players, and they're all in the Premier League and all that… and that's all around the development system. ""We have to get the game right at junior level because there's so many different things that are happening that shouldn't be happening for the kids."" Expense being one of them. The cost of tapping into development football has shut out large sections of the Australian community. With many families priced out of junior football, one club in Perth has waived fees and signalled a new direction for grassroots sport, writes Samantha Lewis. ""One hundred per cent. Most people that are successful in life are the ones that have been brought up the hard way, and they can't afford to play the game."" Does that description fit with Arnold's own childhood experiences? ""Yes,"" he says. ""I lived in my grandmother's garage for 24 years. That's where I grew up. ""My mum and dad had no money. My dad was a cab driver. My mum died when I was 18 or 19. ""I learned the hard way. And living in the garage was probably not the greatest upbringing, but I had a fantastic family around me… my brother was a fantastic support for me over all these years. ""When you get bought up the hard way, that's when you appreciate things more in life."" The greatest players of all time have emerged from the struggles Arnold describes: Those who develop their skills in bare feet or on dirt roads are those who know they must fight to survive. Nothing is handed to them. It is no surprise they also have a love affair with the game: they play with a different kind of passion. There are plenty of Australians who love the international game but are priced out of the pathway system that leads to the national team. Arnold can't fix that. Football Australia can. The Moriarty Football Foundation is one that is knocking on the door with a huge, mostly untapped cohort of young First Nations players that are talented but raw; hungry for the same opportunities others are handed. Arnold's mission now is to work on a few more surprise moves, like this week's goalkeeper substitution, replacing Socceroos captain Mat Ryan with Andrew Redmayne, leaving Peruvian penalty takers perplexed. That psychological ploy was likely the difference in getting Australia to the World Cup while Peru has to wait four more years. ""I need a break for a bit,"" Arnold says. ""I've been away for seven weeks already now and managing fifty-odd people every day, it gets quite fatiguing. ""But the most important thing is they are happy and the staff and the players have an integrated mindset. ""I will have a break and the boys all go back to their clubs and today there's a clean sheet of paper again. Those boys, the ones who qualified us, it's not automatic that those 23 are selected (for the World Cup). ""They've got to go back to their clubs and work hard and perform well because to play for your nation we need the elite. ""I'll be watching them… sitting back and enjoying watching them play."" Arnold is reminded there are only 23 Wednesdays until Australia plays France in its opening match in Qatar. ""Is that right? I haven't even thought about it,"" he laughs. The time for reflection is over. It's back to the drawing board for Graham Arnold, only the third Australian in history charged with guiding the Socceroos through a World Cup campaign.

14,analysis: How Tonga can turn their golden generation into a glorious future,sport," Sport Can Tonga turn their golden generation into a new era of stars? A Tongan team sheet is eagerly awaited these days, but the most important names in Dean Young's squad for next Saturday's clash with New Zealand might have escaped your notice. It wasn't Daniel Tupou and Kotoni Staggs, because in the ""Origin vs Test"" discourse there's almost always only going to be one winner: interstate football surpassed the international game as the pinnacle of the sport some time ago. Tonga will almost definitely get them for the World Cup, but not when there's a blue jersey to be worn in Perth. It wasn't Moeaki Fotuaika or Joe Ofahengaue either, although they were important as well. The two props missed out on selection in the top 17 due to the quality of forwards available, a fair wrap given the two were playing for the Maroons this time last year and a mark of the increasing talent pool the Tongans have at their disposal. For the first time since he made his historic defection, it's not even Jason Taumalolo. The Cowboys lock changed international rugby league forever when he switched from New Zealand to Tonga in 2017, turning the Pacific Island nation into a powerhouse who have since beaten New Zealand, Great Britain and Australia. The pandemic warped everyone's perceptions of time and cost rugby league its best chance of capitalising on Tonga's rise – that 2017 World Cup and Tonga's run to the semifinals and the vision of Mt Smart Stadium turning into a singing sea of red flags for the semifinal against England, one of the greatest Test matches ever played, doesn't feel like it was five years ago. But it was, and the passage of time is why the most important Tongan players in Young's squad are potential debutants Talatau Amone, Tolotau Koula and Will Penisini. All three of them seem like stars of the future, but they are still at the beginning of their rugby league careers – Koula and Penisni are just 19, while Amone is the elder statesman of the group at 20. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. That means they were in their mid-teens when they saw Taumalolo pick up the red jersey over the black and white, when they saw Siosuia Taukeiaho, Manu Ma'u, Andrew Fifita and David Fusitu'a follow Taumalolo's lead, when they witnessed Tonga's brutalising win over New Zealand in Waikato and their gallant defeat to England in that semifinal. Their formative rugby league memories aren't just packed with NRL moments and Origin series, but also of Tongan triumphs. Players like Amone and Koula and Penisini are the final by-product of Taumalolo's decision all those years ago, the ripple effect we could not perceive back then but surely knew must have been coming. They are the first of the new generation, the sons of a tomorrow that was promised five years ago and has finally arrived. Taumalolo was always going to play well for Tonga — when he made his switch, he was arguably the best player in the world and certainly the best forward. Fifita had come off a brilliant Origin series for the Blues and was selected in the Kangaroos squad before coming home. Ma'u was one of the best backrowers in the league and Taukeiaho one of the best props. Fusitu'a was a year off becoming the NRL's top try scorer. It was as close to a golden generation of talent as Tonga were likely ever to get, but golden generations don't always keep glittering once everyone grows up and gets old and moves on. Coming across a boon of talented players who are all the same age is a blessing, but to make the most of that blessing it has to be converted into something more sustainable. That's easier said than done, and there's no exact formula for it, but Tonga has the chance to do it. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter Taumalolo and Tuakeiaho are the only members of that original five who have been named in Tonga's top 17 for next weekend. Fifita is in the extended squad but seems to have moved into the same elder statesman role he plays for the Sharks. Ma'u and Fusitu'a are in Super League and should make the World Cup squad, although competition will be fierce. The Tongan side finally has a past that was put up in lights and can be easily and fondly remembered, and the benefit of that comes in the future, in players like Amone, Koula and Penisini, and other potential debutants like Haumole Olakau'atu and Keaon Koloamatangi, who weren't there as players when the revolution began but were there as Tongans. The red jersey always meant a lot, back to the days Tonga played their first matches in the 1980s. It meant history and family and connecting to one's culture and giving back to the community that meant so much. But now, there are also past glories to celebrate and those glories inspire the next generation of players to emulate their heroes and create a legacy of their own. The record books might say Queensland's incredible Origin dynasty is over, but in new coach Billy Slater, the eight-year winning streak is still alive. And they can talk about those games from 2017 and beyond the same way Queenslanders talk about 1995 and the eight in a row, the same way New South Wales fans talk about 2014 and Bryan Fletcher's hand grenade, and the same way, in generations past when a Test jersey was the pinnacle of the sport, Australian fans would remember the Rorke's Drift Test and the Swinton Massacre and the Invincibles and the Unbeatables and all the other great Kangaroo sides. The past can be more than history and memory if it's used as the fuel that fires the present into the future. That's how a golden generation becomes more than just a good tournament or two or a handy win here and there. That's why Amone and Koula and Penisini, and other young players like 19-year-old halfback Isaiaya Katoa, are so important. Their Tongan careers are beginning in a brand-new world, a world where Tonga can stand up to anybody and bow to nobody, a world where Tonga isn't a stepping stone to something greater – they're just something great.

17,"Meet the Adelaide Armpits, the 'ratbag lesbian feminists' who were pioneers of Australian sport",sport,"  'A bunch of ratbag, lesbian feminists': The coming-out story of the Adelaide Armpits, Australia's first LGBTQIA+ football club Truffy Maginnis was sitting at a bus stop in Fremantle in 1981 when her life changed forever. Born and raised in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles, Maginnis always suspected the world had something different in store for her. She'd felt that way ever since she was young, particularly after falling madly in love with Chrissy, a girl who was twice her age. However — surrounded by a strict, devout Catholic family, at a time when religion was tangled up in the decades-long conflict sweeping across the country — Maginnis knew she had to keep that part of herself hidden. In 1978, when she was old enough to support herself, she relocated to London, lured by the city's cosmopolitanism, its feminist activism and its blossoming LGBTQIA+ community. She started going to bars and clubs, community halls and social gatherings, trying to meet women who were just like her. As soon as she opened her mouth, though, her tumbling, curling accent would give away where she was from and many women would hesitate to engage or avoid her entirely. But there was one group who didn't care: a brassy band of loud Australians she met out in town one rollicking night. They immediately took Maginnis under their wing, inviting her to visit them back home in Western Australia. That's how she ended up sitting at a Fremantle bus stop on a warm morning in 1981. Because that's when a car pulled up right in front of her, and Pat — a well-known lesbian from Perth — rolled down the window. ""You waiting for a bus?"" Pat asked, leaning casually over the frame of the door. ""Yes,"" Maginnis replied. Pat looked up and down the road: ""They don't come 'round here,"" she said. She glanced back at the pale Irishwoman sitting quietly on the metal seat. ""Where do you want to go? We'll give you a lift."" After Maginnis shuffled into the car, Pat asked: ""Are you here for the women's festival?"" ""No, but I've seen the posters."" ""Well, we'll take you there."" It was the chance encounter that set her life on a totally different course. ""Suddenly, being Irish was a boon,"" Maginnis, now in her mid-60s, told ABC. ""Being Irish in Australia, everybody loved me. ""And because Pat brought me in — and she was an important person in the lesbian community in Perth — I was 'in' from then. I just soared. ""It was the most glorious experience because I'd never felt like I fit in anywhere before. ""It was extraordinary, that sliding-doors moment. If I hadn't been at that bus stop, I wouldn't have met these women, and we wouldn't have started the Armpits."" Alongside other women, football was the other love of Maginnis' young life. Growing up, girls couldn't play organised football in Northern Ireland. Instead, they were ushered into hockey and camogie (an all-women version of hurling), which were deemed more suitable sports for ""ladies"". Maginnis never gave up, though. She played football on her own in local parks or with her brothers and all the village lads on weekends. She'd stay outside until the sky grew dark and slept with the scuffed ball in her arms at night. It wasn't until she left Perth for Adelaide in her mid-20s and a friend, Anne Francis, asked if she wanted to start a team, that Maginnis realised women could actually play football in organised competitions. ""We met at the Exeter pub,"" Maginnis recalled. ""When we got there, Anne had already gone to the association and got all the paperwork. For me, it was so exciting. I already knew some of the women there, but others were unknown to me. ""In those days, Anne would have identified as a 'lesbian feminist', and so wanted to play sport in a way that wasn't about having to be the best or having to win, but to be able to be safe as a lesbian playing in a sports team."" And so, the Adelaide Armpits — Australia's first LGBTQIA+ football club — was born. ""If you rocked up, you got a game,"" Maginnis said of the early years. ""You didn't have to be a good player. There was only me and one other woman who'd ever played football before, Roxy. So that's how it started. ""1982 was our first season, and we thought we'd just play for a couple of years and have a laugh and that'll be the end. But the Armpits actually went for over 30 years in South Australian competitions. ""And the women who came to play … some were sporty like me. Others weren't, but they just wanted to have a safe space. So there was a real consciousness that we were representing something that was not seen around the place."" The Armpits developed a reputation almost immediately. Their uniform was a mish-mash of shirts that they dyed themselves in various shades of purple. Their team name was an allusion to the radical, separatist second-wave feminist movement flourishing across Australia in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They didn't care about winning games and would applaud opposition teams for scoring against them. There were no coaches, no captains and no hierarchies. They were, as Maginnis described, ""a bunch of ratbag lesbian feminists"". While they began as an all-lesbian team, they eventually welcomed any woman who wanted to join — some of whom had been struggling in secret with their own sexuality but had no space to be themselves. ""I certainly had conversations with women after they'd been in the team for a while who said, 'You know, I just felt like I'd come home when I came into the Armpits',"" Maginnis said. ""And that's very moving. It softens your heart. The team became a place where women could feel like they were at home. Where they went back to maybe wasn't like that, but when they came to play with us on a Sunday or came to training, it felt like a home for them. A family for them. And we were. ""That was the hope. When we met that day at the pub, that's what we talked about. We wanted this to be a place that women who identified as lesbians, or who didn't mind being assumed to be lesbians, could come and play. ""You don't have to be good to play sport. You just have to find somewhere where you'll be welcomed and can belong. ""From the beginning, it was an expression of lesbian culture in a different sort of way. It wasn't about playing pool at the pub or going to bars — those safe social spaces for lesbians at the time. ""This was something else. People were intrigued by us."" One of the women who eventually joined the Armpits was Jill Latimer, who represented the Matildas in the late 1980s. Latimer played for the Adelaide University team alongside former national team vice-captain Moya Dodd, and like everybody else in South Australian football, knew who the Armpits were from the start. Maginnis recalls a young, shy Latimer coming along to watch them play in the early days, hiding behind some nearby trees so she wouldn't be seen. ""She knew her sexuality, but it wasn't possible for her to be out,"" Maginnis said. ""She'd come and watch us and think, 'Maybe this is possible for me.' ""Over the years, we heard that. The Armpits seemed to represent something to other same-sex-attracted women about what was possible when it was safe for them."" ""That was definitely true,"" Latimer told ABC. ""I was out to my family at that stage, but nobody else. Only a few people that I knew and trusted who were the same. ""In those days, the Armpits did get a lot of abuse on the sidelines — and we did as well. People [were] saying, 'Girls shouldn't be playing soccer' and getting laughed at because they were lesbians. ""So, I think I was a bit afraid of that at first, as I was discovering more about my sexuality at that time. ""But I always wanted to play in their team. I was getting a bit burnt out where I was, so that was one of the reasons, plus knowing the women personally. ""And I did bring other players with me from Dynamo Uni over to the Armpits as well. I admired Truffy and what she was doing and really believed in it. ""I never looked back once I became a member of the Armpits. I felt like I was home. I felt brave, as well, that I was also making a stand. I could be my authentic self there. ""That's what was so magical about the Armpits, especially for younger lesbians [who] were first coming out. ""Truffy created an environment where people were really supported in their identity. It changed people's lives, it really did."" Latimer joined the Armpits just after she reached the summit of the football pyramid: representing her state at the National Championships while also being called up to represent Australia at the 1987 Women's Invitational Tournament in Taiwan, the precursor to the pilot Women's World Cup in China the following year. However, she said, had she not joined the Armpits when she did, her football career may not have lasted much longer. ""It brought back my love of football, that team,"" she said. ""I'd felt burnt out for a while and felt like I was either going to quit or needed to go to a club where I could actually just have fun. I'd lost the fun. ""It was also so much about family. The Armpits really brought that out. I lived and breathed it, and I think the nurturing of us as players was one of the most important parts. ""I became a better person there. One of the things Truffy incorporated there was mutual respect, where we all had a voice and everybody was listened to. ""So it made me a better footballer, a stronger footballer, in every way."" However, as the Armpits' reputation grew, so too did the abuse and discrimination — both on and off the field. ""In the early years, there were many occasions where we were subjected to some quite horrible verbal abuse from women in other teams, who were egged on by their supporters. ""A few times when we were physically abused, as well,"" Maginnis said. ""The tackles were awful. There was one club we played against and they were kicking six pints of blood out of us. ""We said afterwards, 'Let's not play them again' and forfeited all later games. ""I got king-hit in the back of the head once when the referee was looking the other way. ""And because we did well with each other, because we were so overt with our sexuality, when the homophobia came up externally — from the association, when they twigged that we weren't going away — all the stereotypes came to the fore: lesbians as predators, is it safe to send young girls out to play the Armpits? ""Those conversations were happening in the South Australian Women's Soccer Association. ""Those stereotypes still exist today. When my contemporaries say, 'Oh, it's easy to be out as a queer woman these days, they're everywhere,' I say to them, 'It's not! There's still the internal journey. That's just as difficult as ever.'"" Despite it all, the Armpits thrived. They won their division, twice, and even got promoted to the state's top-tier competition, only for their application to be knocked back by the association, who claimed they wanted ""even numbers"" in each league. For Latimer, there were silver-linings to the discrimination they experienced, be it on the sidelines or from decision-makers above: They became stronger players, driven by the desire to prove themselves to everybody who doubted or questioned them. ""It made me want to play harder,"" she said. ""We would still get people making fun of us, but that made me a stronger footballer. ""It lifted the club, as well, because it brought out the best in us rather than making us drop our heads. We spoke with our feet. ""We became a better team because of it. Eventually, we were able to block out the noise and just play football."" These days, the Armpits are no more. After 33 years, they officially folded in 2015 and donated much of their memorabilia to the State Library of South Australia. While the club may no longer exist, their legacy has been carried on by other LGBTQIA+ clubs that have popped up around the country, including the Flying Bats, the Sydney Rangers and the Melbourne Rovers, all of which contest the annual Justin Fashanu and Julie Murray Cups. The folding of the Armpits also hasn't stopped Maginnis from continuing to create a safer and more inclusive world for queer people, going on to work at the Bfriend LGBTQIA+ peer support service at Uniting Care Wesley, Adelaide, as well as cancer care services and support networks to help prevent violence against women. She still participates in football when she can, watching the celebration around A-Leagues club Adelaide United hosting their inaugural Pride Round with joy earlier this year, as well as the many Matildas who are now out and proud about their sexuality — although it's no substitute for being out there on the wide, open field herself. ""I think any opportunity to have people go, 'What does Pride Round mean?' and have that conversation will make a difference somewhere to somebody,"" she said. ""I understand the stuff about tokenism — the same with [the] Indigenous Round — but those things make a difference. Seeing the rainbows on the back of Adelaide United men and women at the weekend: For me, it keeps the conversation going. ""The ones who the conversation matters most to are those who are still trying to make sense of what it means to be attracted to someone of the same gender, or to be non-binary or transgender, or to have any sense that they are not heterosexual. ""Those things can only be of help, whether it's Pride Round in football, whether it's the opportunity to see gay men and lesbians depicted in the media in a really ordinary way that takes away the awful stereotypes. ""For me, I'll very happily support pride rounds and have conversations with people [who] want to know what it's about. ""We had a bit of traditional success, but the real success was how we kept going. And we kept ourselves safe and looked out for each other and had a lot of fun. ""For me, that's the thing that gives me strength and makes the world a joyful place to live in, because we matter to each other. We find each other and we gather each other up and keep ourselves and each other safe. That's what it's all about.""

18,'It feels good': Remote football team plays first game in two years with COVID travel restrictions lifted at last,sport,"  On a red dirt field with only sparse patches of green, the Bidyadanga Emus have pulled on their footy boots at the team's home ground for the first time in two seasons. Access restrictions into remote Aboriginal communities, imposed at the start of the pandemic to limit the spread of COVID-19, were lifted last week. The easing of the travel ban means sport and cultural activities can return to normal in communities because visitors can now enter for non-essential reasons — and one of those is football. At a smoking ceremony marking the start of play, elder Angelina Nanudie was excited to celebrate the return of football to Karajarri country at Bidyadanga, around a two-hour drive south of Broome. ""I'm welcoming the Cable Beach mob to play in my country,"" she said. ""What we're doing is getting the scent of the grass so that people can have that smell and be safe. ""This is our first home game after the COVID … it feels good."" In the Kimberley — a region where Australian rules football is often likened to religion — the ability to host home games again has breathed life back into communities that have been largely closed off to the world. Women's coach Michael Martin said the return of home games brought the whole community together after a long period of uncertainty. ""Football is always number one on the calendar,"" he said. ""It's just given people a chance to forget about all that [COVID-19] and come down and support their team and have fun. ""It's also an opportunity for men and women now to represent their communities."" The restrictions, which were imposed by the state government, had required visitors to secure police approvals to enter more than 200 communities between the Goldfields and the Kimberley. While state-level restrictions have eased, individual communities can still choose to apply their own restrictions about who can enter and why. Mick Albert from the Cable Beach Greenbacks said his side was happy to make the last-minute trip from Broome, as teams in the West Kimberley Football League reverted to pre-pandemic fixtures. ""We had to scramble now the community has opened up during the week,"" he said. ""We were still unsure if we were coming down to play. ""We had to check who had cars and who had spots available and do RAT tests as well."" Community nurse Latham Rogers took it upon himself to pick up elders from around the community and bring them to the oval to ensure they didn't miss the big match. It's something he's done for eight years, but he says Saturday's game held particular significance. ""We're making sure we are looking after the oldies in the community, bringing them down and letting them be part of the atmosphere, watching the young people play sport,"" he says. ""Often the oldies wouldn't have the opportunity to come down to watch the games and would stay at home."" Mr Rogers prepared plates of fresh healthy food and served tea and coffee to elders throughout the game. ""Whether it's a barbecue, sandwiches, fresh fruit, baking, we provide all of that here,"" he said. ""That's just part of our goodwill to the community. ""It's also an opportunity to talk to our older community about making sure their vaccinations are up to date, whether they've had COVID, so it's a bit of a health talk as well."" Elder Joseph Munroe, who once played for the Bidyadanga men's side, enjoyed a sandwich as he watched the game from a fold-out chair under the shade of a tree. ""It [the team] is … the heart and soul for years, always will be, always was,"" he said. ""It's a nice feeling watching them play … really proud."" Mr Munroe was pleased to be back cheering from the sidelines on home soil after so many away games he couldn't attend during the pandemic. ""It was really hard for us not to travel to Broome, staying here in Bidyi, I was waiting until this COVID-19 went away to watch them play here on their home ground and in Broome,"" he said.

19,WACA employed paedophile junior coaching co-ordinator for 29 years,sport," Sport WACA employed paedophile junior coaching co-ordinator Roy Wenlock for 29 years The Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA) created a job for a now-notorious paedophile who subsequently worked for the organisation for 29 years between 1979 and 2007, the WACA has confirmed. WARNING: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse. Roy Wenlock, for whom the WACA created the full-time role of 'development officer' in 1979, was one of three sex offenders investigated in WA Supreme Court Justice Peter Blaxell's 452-page parliamentary inquiry into historical child sexual abuse at Anglican hostels, published in 2012. WACA chief executive Christina Matthews confirmed to ABC Sport that the organisation became aware of Wenlock's offending during the 2012-13 summer and has since taken a range of measures to address the issue, which is the subject of ongoing civil litigation against the WACA. In Justice Blaxell's report, Wenlock, who died in 2007, was revealed to have been a prolific abuser who gained sexual gratification from ""wrestling"" sessions — simulated sex in which Wenlock would ejaculate — with boys placed in his care between 1963 and 1977. In some cases, Wenlock's offending escalated to masturbation and oral sex with the boys. Blaxell's report was also unequivocal in its conclusion that Wenlock's grooming and abuse of boys continued at the WACA. One of those boys, now a man in his mid-40s, confirmed to ABC Sport that while performing WACA ""drinks boy"" duties under Wenlock's direction in the late 1980s, he was taken back to Wenlock's house with other boys and witnessed abuse. Between 1979 and 2007, Wenlock fulfilled a range of roles at the WACA, most of which gave him unsupervised access to children. For decades, he was the organisation's full-time development officer, conducting junior coaching clinics around the state, and also served as WACA ground announcer, museum curator, and as a WACA pennant umpire. He also umpired in junior competitions and was secretary of the Western Australian Youth Cricket Council. In 2000, Wenlock received the Australian Sports Medal for services to cricket. In 2012, Justice Blaxell concluded there was ""ample evidence to show that Wenlock would engage in grooming behaviour"" with boys he encountered across his four decades at the WACA. ""In this position he was required to engage in various cricketing activities with young teenagers, and he would sometimes invite individual boys back to his home,"" Blaxell wrote. There, Wenlock would ""encourage them to engage in 'wrestling'. The reputation that Wenlock acquired as a result of these activities was such that young cricketers would warn their friends: 'whatever you do, don't go to his house'."" 'Darren' (not his real name) was not aware of Justice Blaxell's findings when he spoke to ABC Sport, but he was among the boys who were taken from the WACA to Wenlock's house and says what he saw there mirrored the experiences of witnesses in the inquiry. In 1989, when Darren was in his early teens, Wenlock selected Darren and a male school friend to perform ""drinks boy"" duties for a Sheffield Shield game at the WACA ground. Darren said he was excited because the fixture in question — Western Australia vs New South Wales — featured Darren's idols, the Waugh brothers. ""My mate had done it previously,"" Darren told ABC Sport. ""I thought, 'This will be awesome'. I was excited because it meant we got to take food into the change rooms for the players and take turns to take the drinks out. It was really cool."" Darren said his discomfort started after play. Wenlock had arranged with parents that Darren, his friend and a few other boys would not be picked up from the WACA, but from Wenlock's house after a swim and some icy poles. At the house, Darren said, Wenlock encouraged the boys to wrestle him, something that struck Darren as ""so unusual and weird"" that he declined Wenlock's invitation. Darren said other boys did wrestle Wenlock. ""I found it quite confronting,"" he said. ""And it went on for quite a while."" Darren said that in his eagerness to meet more of his heroes, he volunteered for another day as a drinks boy, but he declined a second invite to Wenlock's house and resolved not to do the job again. ""I was uncomfortable with what was happening,"" he said. ""I can visualise it, and the feeling I associate with what I saw was that it was very uncomfortable."" Roy Hamilton Wenlock was once a ubiquitous and sometimes divisive figure in Western Australian cricket. As an umpire in the elite WACA competition, Wenlock was unpopular with players, who thought he was out of his depth and reliant on WACA support for ongoing selection. Regardless, in 1995 Wenlock was made a life member of the Western Australian Cricket Umpires' Association and remains so. Among colleagues in the WACA administration, Wenlock was considered gruff and strange, but the organisation valued his enthusiasm to take on duties others wouldn't, particularly the creation and administration of junior cricket programs and Wenlock's curation of the memorabilia collection that became the WACA museum. Following Wenlock's death at 75 in 2007, tributes in the WACA annual report described him as the ""spiritual father"" and ""inspiration"" of the museum and, and on account of his ground announcing duties, one of the WACA's ""most recognisable voices, if not faces"". A former bank clerk whose rise to prominence in elite cricket belied his self-confessed inability to play the game, Wenlock's parallel life as an abuser of boys is most extensively documented between 1963 and late 1977, when he served as a warden at St Christopher's House, the residential hostel at Northam High School. It is likely that Wenlock came to the attention of his eventual bosses at the WACA during his years as president of the Northam Cricket Association, for whom he administered a junior competition too, becoming a life member. ""The WACA created a new position of Development Officer in 1979 and encouraged Roy to apply,"" read his WACA obituary. ""He was successful and became an integral part of the administration."" Initially, Wenlock's wages were partly subsidised by the Western Australian government. ""He arranged coaching trips to the North West, pre-season cricket camps for umpires, and was unofficial collector and guardian of cricket trophies and photos that were often given to him. In 1983 he was appointed as the ground announcer at the WACA on match days. This caused him to curtail his umpiring ambitions."" But Wenlock, who had not faced police charges at the time of his death, gained greater notoriety posthumously, admonished by his former employers at the Anglican Church for the ""depravity"" of his offending against boys placed in his care. Wenlock's activities were described by an Archbishop as ""abhorrent – exploitative and abusive – and a gross breach of trust."" In the Anglican hostels inquiry, one former St Christopher's House pupil described Roy Wenlock as ""a powerful man with an intimidating presence … calculated and cunning… someone that you could never say 'no' to."" ""Whatever he said you had to do, or you knew there would be consequences."" The consequences were a range of sadistic punishment rituals, including violent canings that left at least one boy with a disfigured finger. But it was a practice of Wenlock's that became known among boys as ""bruting"" that caused the greatest damage. For 'bruting' sessions, Wenlock would invite boys to his private flat on the hostel's grounds for what Justice Blaxwell called ""the same bizarre and ritualistic form of physical contact which the boys had to perform for Wenlock's sexual pleasure."" The boys were forced to strip to their underpants and Wenlock usually did too, with one or the other often wearing leopard skin underpants or bathers provided by Wenlock. The pretence of 'wrestling' ended with Wenlock on his back on the floor, forcing the boy to straddle his pelvic area so the boy's buttocks were resting on his groin. Blaxwell explained: ""Wenlock would bounce around and pretend to try to buck the boy off while at the same time continuously moaning and repeating the words: 'you brute', 'you brute'."" ""The effect of this was that the boy's anal area would bump and grind against Wenlock's groin. Some former students distinctly recall Wenlock's erect penis rubbing against their bodies and of him ejaculating as a result."" The inquiry heard that boys endured these ordeals for up to two hours at a time. Some of the 18 men who gave evidence said they experienced the abuse only once, but one witness suffered the assaults on a weekly basis for his entire five years at the hostel. Others detailed feelings of disgust and shame in the aftermath. Evidence was also heard of graver assaults than the 'bruting' sessions. Wenlock plied one boy with alcohol and groped his genitals. Another boy was forced to masturbate Wenlock, abuse that escalated to oral sex and being forced into 'wrestling' sessions as an unidentified priest watched. Multiple students made complaints about Wenlock between 1975 and 1977, with one boy's story briefly attracting the attention of police, but their investigations amounted to nothing. In the inquiry, Justice Blaxell's harshest assessment was of then-St Christopher's board chairman and Archdeacon (later Bishop) Michael Challen who, in 1977, politely asked Wenlock to resign and offered the abuser ""effectively a glowing reference"", rather than sacking him and making it clear to prospective employers that Wenlock should not be given a job that put him in contact with children. Blaxell concluded that Challen's decision ""revealed a questionable sense of moral priorities for a clergyman."" ""By allowing him to leave 'quietly' they gave a higher priority to the reputation of the Hostel than to any concern for the future wellbeing of teenage boys with whom Wenlock might come into contact,"" Blaxell wrote. ""By these actions Bishop Challen increased the prospects that Wenlock would be able to sexually misconduct himself with young males in a similar fashion again."" WACA chief executive Christina Matthews told ABC Sport that the organisation has taken several measures to address its historical child sexual abuse problems and assured survivors they would be supported if they reported their abuse. ""I encourage anyone that has experienced any form of abuse when they have been involved in WACA programs to come forward and we will deal with it openly and honestly,"" Matthews said. The WACA is the only one of Australian cricket's powerful state associations to have signed up to the National Redress Scheme in response to the Royal Commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. Matthews said the WACA joined the scheme willingly and immediately, and that one survivor of Wenlock's abuse has already had his claim processed and approved. Matthews said the WACA first became aware of Wenlock's history during the 2012-13 summer, when a survivor approached the organisation to raise awareness and ensure child protection measures that had been lacking in the past were now in place.

""We reviewed our practices and became what you would probably call more aware of some of the dubious things these people do and how to prevent them,"" Matthews said. ""At the same time, child protection regulations were changing, so it all blended into that."" In recent months, former WACA staff who were colleagues of Wenlock told ABC Sport they'd been interviewed by lawyers acting for the WACA and asked for their recollections of Wenlock. Matthews confirmed that the WACA appointed external legal counsel in June 2021, in response to civil litigation being launched by a survivor of abuse by Wenlock. That case has not yet been resolved. ""Our position has always been to not hide from these things, and to try and make the process as less painful as possible for the victim,"" Matthews said. ""You've got to deal with the truth.""

20,'That gets me off the couch': Women want to see themselves reflected in coverage of sport and physical activity,sport," Sport From nuns to mums, weekend warriors to world champions, fitness fanatics to fanatical fans — women in sport want wider coverage Four nuns are playing football on a synthetic pitch, on a rooftop in Rome. Dressed in habits, they're having a fun kickaround, playing like nobody's watching (or covertly filming from afar). On a tight angle, one nun slots in a neat right-footer, and celebrates with her arms raised. Later, another nun loses a shoe when she kicks the ball, but like a true competitor it doesn't stop her from pushing on. The video quickly spread around the world, celebrating a group of women we don't normally see engaging in sport and physical activity. But for Rana Hussain, it wasn't a novelty at all — it made her feel seen. ""That image gets me up off the couch more than anything else, images of women that I can relate to,"" the diversity and inclusion leader and member of the Outer Sanctum podcast said. ""And, for me, a hijab-wearing woman, footage of covered nuns playing sport is so relatable. ""That's how I play sport. That's how I go to the gym. I wear loose fitting clothes. I cover my hair and, to see them do it, makes me feel like I can do it too."" For Hussain, and so many women like her, seeing themselves reflected is something they're desperate to see. So, when we look at women in sport, who are we seeing? Yes, there are the powerhouse world-beaters such as Sam Kerr, Ash Barty and the Australian women's cricket team who have become absolute fixtures on our sporting scene. But what happens when we dig a little deeper? Getty Images has one of the world's largest creative and editorial picture databases, and it has gathered what it calls ""visual GPS data"" around women in sport. Using internal search data, insights from visual experts, and market research, it has uncovered the current state of play when it comes to the visual representation of women in sport, and what audiences want. It has found there is significant coverage of sportswomen around major events such as the Olympics, but it dramatically drops to 7 per cent visibility in the media outside of these times. And it's worse for those from diverse and under-represented backgrounds. Kate Rourke is the head of creative insights, Asia Pacific at Getty Images and iStock. She says that Getty's customers, including media outlets, advertisers and brands, use less than 1 per cent of people with a disability in their visuals. LGBT+ women and non-binary people also represent less than 1 per cent, and less than 4 per cent are people from ethnically diverse backgrounds. ""We are predominantly seeing Gen Z being visualised in sport, 95 per cent have slim bodies, and then a further 70 per cent are of white ethnicity,"" Ms Rourke said. A Griffith University study looking at the media representations of women at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games found outlets promoted images of ""white women celebrating and smiling"", and ""whiteness and normative femininity were presented as 'natural' and 'neutral'."" It also found that ""there was a recurrent representation of successful sportswomen as predominantly able-bodied, young, white, and conforming mostly to traditional understandings of femininity (i.e., smiling, heterosexual, in passive poses, wearing makeup and jewellery)."" That resonates with Hussain. ""I feel like women in sport in Australia is still very much a particular group of women, and it's just not reflective of how many of us do love sport and play sport,"" she said. ""And I think part of that is just because, naturally, our focus is on the elite games, and the people [who] are making it through to elite sport aren't yet representative of our population."" Ali Tucker-Munro can also relate. She's a proud Kamilaroi woman, and the head coach of the GWS Giants Netball Academy. ""I think we've got to really be playing a part in the media of breaking down this stereotype of what an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person looks like in this country,"" she said. ""Our cultural identity is really complex for a range of reasons. [It's] obviously been influenced by past government policies around assimilation. ""I heard a story of a player being questioned about her cultural identity, because of the colour of her skin, like, 'You can't have experienced racism'."" ""Always having one player interviewed all the time, because of the colour of their skin, it shouldn't diminish or devalue another person's experience as well. ""When we talk about interviewing and portraying First Nations female athletes, [it's about] giving that broad breadth. So what role can media and profiling our First Nations women play in helping people educate and inform people around that?"" Paralympian Eliza Stankovic-Mowle says it's essential to showcase people from all backgrounds, including people with disability. ""If it's not there, and you can't see it, it doesn't exist, does it?,"" she noted. ""So, the more we see it, the more it becomes mainstream, then the more we all just accept it, and it's seen for its beauty. Bank robber Russell Manser was destined for a life in prison before he discovered a new path by confronting his hidden trauma. Now he’s working to help others seek justice for crimes long buried. ""[For] young people, seeing people with disability in all walks of life, doing incredible things, it really just gives them the hope and the dream that they can be whatever they choose to be. ""Because, quite often, unfortunately, people with disabilities are still told that they can't. And, unless they see it, they believe they can't."" Ms Rourke also says that, while media outlets and advertisers do want to be more inclusive, there are underlying unconscious biases. ""We need to become much more aware of what those biases are, so that, when we are selecting content, or when we are going to be showing different female athletes, we are making sure that we are checking in on those biases,"" she said. It's pretty simple: Women want to see people like them. Ms Rourke says their research showed women mainly encountered bias due to body shape, age, gender and ethnicity. ""They want to see females of different body types, engaging in sport in some way,"" she said. ""We found with the image testing that we did, that women in Australia and New Zealand were twice more likely to respond to all different body types, they were likely to choose more different ethnic diversity from the visuals, and very much that social bonding, friendship groups engaging in sport is what they responded to. ""But, interestingly, the other thing they wanted to see was all ages engaging in sports. And then they also wanted to see all genders engaging in sports. ""And, if we want to encourage more participation, we want to encourage much more inclusion, then the way forward is to do that in terms of including this much more broadly."" Ms Rourke says one of the key parts of the research was breaking stereotypes around people with disability. ""One of the biases that we often see is this idea of either trying to show them very heroically, almost trying to overcome the disability that they might have,"" she said. ""When, in fact, all of our research is showing that they just want to be seen in every day [situations]. It is not about overcoming a disability. They live with disability."" ""I'm not just one thing. I'm so many different things. And that's what makes me proud to be me,"" Stankovic-Mowle said. ""So, I would like to think that I'm seen by the media as a woman, firstly, with a disability, but who is a mother, who is a sportsperson, who also has a career. And, first and foremost, who is happy, and I prioritise my physical and mental health. ""Showing that a life with a disability is just as incredible as anyone else's life, if not more incredible, because sometimes we get so many more opportunities and experiences that perhaps people without a disability don't have."" Non-binary Paralympian Robyn Lambird agrees media and advertisers can play a huge role in dismantling stereotypes and creating a more inclusive society. It's believed Lambird was the first adult with a visible disability to model in a national advertising campaign for a major Australian retailer, when they featured in a campaign for Target in 2016. And they were also the first 'out' non-binary athlete to win a Paralympic medal. ""In terms of marketing, and things like that, it's so subconscious, and we absorb so much from that,"" Lambird said. ""We create a picture of what our world looks like and the people involved in it. So, I think, disabled people need to be included in that. ""I don't think, as a brand, you can say that you're being diverse or inclusive if you aren't including people with disabilities. ""It's great to see how far we've come — in terms of body image and celebrating different body shapes and sizes — and I think it's just the next step."" And it's not just about celebrating those athletes who make it to the top — as they are still a very select few. ""If we only focus on elite sport, we will then just keep replicating the same kind of structures and power dynamics that do exclude a whole bunch of people,"" Hussain said. ""So, hand in hand with more coverage of women's elite sport, I want representation and visibility of community sport. ""And it's hard, because that's not always the sexy story or the interesting story that will necessarily get eyeballs. ""But I think there's a way to do it, with real authenticity of telling everyday stories and up and comers. I think, as brands and as storytellers, if we represent the whole picture, we'll build the whole pie for everybody and slowly bring everyone along."" Tucker-Munro wants to see greater awareness of the challenges Indigenous women face in being able to play sport, and for them to receive as much support and investment as men. ""In First Nations culture, and I'm talking obviously from my own lived experiences, a lot of our girls have kinship, caring responsibilities,"" she said. ""And oftentimes, it's them that actually have to play second fiddle to the brother, or whoever else in the family's got rugby league on Sunday. There's almost this overlooking [of] female athlete opportunities. ""And it's not about diminishing or devaluing our amazing Aboriginal men who were playing really well in sport. ""But it's about how do we broaden the narrative to really capture the added complexity and challenges for our female athletes, particularly in regional and rural centres. That's the gap"" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Lambird also wants greater awareness of athletes with a disability on a more consistent basis. ""It's not good enough to see disabled sports once every four years at the Paralympics. We need to be seeing it throughout the year so people can get to know these athletes and get to understand the games,"" they said. ""It's so important to see, not only sportspeople with a disability, but [also] people with a disability in all walks of life and what they can do,"" Stankovic-Mowle added. Whether they're nuns or mums, weekend warriors or world champions, fitness fanatics or fanatical fans, women in sport no longer want to be sidelined — they're ready to see themselves in the spotlight, in all their different forms.

21,Concerns breakwall upgrade could ruin surf in 'bodyboarding capital of Australia' ,sport,"  Port Macquarie's surf break, the 'bodyboarding capital of Australia', feared under threat by breakwall upgrade Port Macquarie is known as the ""bodyboarding capital of Australia"", home to a unique surf break, but locals fear it is under threat from works to repair its neighbouring breakwall. Three-time world bodyboard champion, Port Macquarie's Damian King, grew up surfing the breakwall. ""It's a very special and unique wave that the Port Macquarie breakwall produces, I have never seen anything like it around the world,"" he said. ""It's been promoted not only in Port Macquarie, but in NSW and Australia, and even around the world. ""It helped me do what I did and helped the generation before me and after me."" The NSW government plans to upgrade the breakwall, which runs along the Hastings River, to repair and stabilise the structure, and meet current safety and accessibility guidelines. There is concern among the surfing community that the work will result in a change to the shape at the end of the wall and impact the iconic surf break. ""If they follow the plan proposed I think it will change the water flow and change the sand, and we will lose what we have,"" King said. The government is seeking public feedback on the proposal, and a crowd from the surfing community turned out to a community session this week. Scott Lawrence with Port Macquarie Boardriders said changes to breakwalls in other areas had impacted surf breaks. ""We have had some feedback from other spots like the Tuncurry breakwall and Ballina breakwall, where they have altered the front of the walls and [riders say] it has ruined the wave that had been there,"" he said. Professor Rob Brander, a beach safety researcher from the University of New South Wales, said he believed the surf break would not be overly affected.

22,Concerns breakwall upgrade could ruin surf in 'bodyboarding capital of Australia' ,sport,"  Port Macquarie's surf break, the 'bodyboarding capital of Australia', feared under threat by breakwall upgrade Port Macquarie is known as the ""bodyboarding capital of Australia"", home to a unique surf break, but locals fear it is under threat from works to repair its neighbouring breakwall. Three-time world bodyboard champion, Port Macquarie's Damian King, grew up surfing the breakwall. ""It's a very special and unique wave that the Port Macquarie breakwall produces, I have never seen anything like it around the world,"" he said. ""It's been promoted not only in Port Macquarie, but in NSW and Australia, and even around the world. ""It helped me do what I did and helped the generation before me and after me."" The NSW government plans to upgrade the breakwall, which runs along the Hastings River, to repair and stabilise the structure, and meet current safety and accessibility guidelines. There is concern among the surfing community that the work will result in a change to the shape at the end of the wall and impact the iconic surf break. ""If they follow the plan proposed I think it will change the water flow and change the sand, and we will lose what we have,"" King said. The government is seeking public feedback on the proposal, and a crowd from the surfing community turned out to a community session this week. Scott Lawrence with Port Macquarie Boardriders said changes to breakwalls in other areas had impacted surf breaks. ""We have had some feedback from other spots like the Tuncurry breakwall and Ballina breakwall, where they have altered the front of the walls and [riders say] it has ruined the wave that had been there,"" he said. Professor Rob Brander, a beach safety researcher from the University of New South Wales, said he believed the surf break would not be overly affected. ""Anytime you build anything on the coast, and you modify the shape of something, it's always going to have some feedback effect on the waves and the currents,"" he said.

23,Baltimore Ravens star dies as year of tragedy continues for the NFL,sport," Sport Baltimore linebacker Jaylon Ferguson dies as horror year continues for the NFL Baltimore Ravens linebacker Jaylon Ferguson has died at age 26. Ferguson, nicknamed 'Sack Daddy', played three NFL seasons, all with Baltimore. He set the career sacks record in the college Football Bowl Subdivision (45) when he played at Louisiana Tech. Police said the cause of death is still to be determined. ""On June 21, 2022, at approximately 11:25pm, Northern District patrol officers responded to a home in the 400 block of Ilchester Avenue for a report of a questionable death,"" Baltimore police said. ""Once there, officers located 26-year-old Jaylon Ferguson, unresponsive, being treated by medics. Ferguson never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead on the scene by medics. No signs of trauma was found or foul play suspected at this time."" Ferguson was drafted by the Ravens in the third round in 2019, and played in 38 games as a pro with 4 1/2 sacks. ""We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,"" the Ravens said in a statement. ""He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon's family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon."" Born December 14, 1995, in St Francisville, Louisiana, Ferguson played high school football and basketball at West Feliciana. At Louisiana Tech, his 45 sacks were one better than another Ravens linebacker, Terrell Suggs, achieved at Arizona State. Ferguson was a third-team AP All-American in 2018. ""The LA Tech Family mourns this morning's tragic news of the sudden death of former Bulldog great, Jaylon Ferguson,"" the Louisiana Tech football program tweeted. ""We will remember his God-given talents on the field and his infectious personality off of it. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends."" Ferguson's death continues a year of tragedy for the NFL. Arizona Cardinals cornerback Jeff Gladney died in a car crash in June, while former running back Marion Barber died two days later aged 38. Steelers quarterback Dwayne Haskins was killed in April when he was struck by a truck having exited his vehicle after it ran out of petrol. In December last year, champion wide receiver Demaryius Thomas died after suffering a seizure. Ferguson's death came as news that Tony Siragusa, the charismatic defensive tackle who helped lead a stout Baltimore defence to a Super Bowl title, had also died. He was 55. Siragusa's broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. ""This is a really sad day,"" he said. ""Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony's loved ones."" Siragusa, known as 'Goose', played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore's 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defence that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. ""There was no one like Goose — a warrior on the field and a team unifier with a giving, generous heart who helped teammates and the community more than most people know,"" said Brian Billick, the coach of that Super Bowl-winning team. ""We would not have won the Super Bowl without him. This is such stunning, sad news.""

Jack broke her hand as she was warming up for Wednesday morning's 100-metres freestyle heats at the competition in Budapest. The 23-year-old, in her return from a doping ban, previously helped Australia to gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay on Saturday and silver in the mixed 4x100m medley relay on Tuesday. Australia still took victory in heat one, with teammate Mollie O'Callaghan swimming the fastest qualifying time, followed by Canada's Penny Oleksiak, the United States' Torri Huske, and world record holder Sarah Sjöström. Jack is just the latest high-profile swimmer to pull out of the competition. Hong Kong's Siobhán Haughey, the Olympic silver medallist in the 100m and 200m freestyle, withdrew on Monday due to an ankle injury. Four-time Olympic medallist Chad Le Clos withdrew from the men's competition on Monday due to health concerns.

25,"Collingwood star Jordan De Goey granted personal leave, no time frame on return to play",sport," Sport Collingwood star Jordan De Goey takes personal leave from Magpies Controversial Collingwood star Jordan De Goey has been given personal leave by the AFL club, with no time frame set on his return. It comes a day after he was hit with a $25,000 suspended fine and he apologised for his ""disrespectful"" conduct while partying in Bali, which was caught on camera. ""Collingwood advise player Jordan De Goey has been granted personal leave by the club and will not take part in the round 15 match against GWS [on Sunday],"" the club said in a statement on Thursday evening. ""Jordan has been absent from training this week and the club will continue to support him on his return to the football program."" Footage emerged on social media last week of De Goey, who was given permission by the club to travel to Bali on his mid-season break, making crude gestures while at a nightclub. The fine is suspended through to the end of the season and dependent on good behaviour. De Goey will also ""undertake further behavioural education"" in addition to an existing counselling program, but has avoided any suspension from playing duties. Collingwood have also put contract talks with the 26-year-old, who is entering free agency, on hold until season's end. ""The actions shown in the video footage are disrespectful and I accept that I have betrayed the trust the club showed in me by allowing me to take my mid-season break overseas,"" De Goey said in a statement on Wednesday. ""My actions have fallen short of the standards expected of me as a person, as an AFL footballer and as a representative of Collingwood. ""I had worked hard this year to establish trust and confidence in me to make better decisions and through no-one's fault but my own, I have undone that trust. ""Again, I apologise for my disrespectful conduct. I understand that I have let many people down and that I have much work to do to again rebuild trust."" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. The 26-year-old's statement was in stark contrast to his initial response via Instagram, where he had lamented ""persecution"" of athletes by the media. Collingwood chief executive Mark Anderson condemned De Goey's actions as demonstrating disrespect towards women. He was particularly dismayed by vision of De Goey pulling at a woman's top, almost exposing her breast. The Bali incident comes after De Goey was stood down by Collingwood last October when he was arrested for a drunken incident at a New York nightclub. Anderson also said on Wednesday that De Goey would speak in the next couple of days, but it is unclear whether this will now happen given the player is on leave. The AFL said Collingwood had ""handled the matter appropriately"" and the league wouldn't take further action against De Goey, while condemning his behaviour as setting a bad example.

26,Supercars driver launches on-air tirade against Adelaide 500 race critics,sport,"  Supercars driver Nick Percat lashes out at 'crazy' critics of Adelaide 500 race return Supercars driver Nick Percat has launched an extended on-air tirade over the Adelaide 500 race, labelling critics of the event's return as ""crazy"" and ""infuriating"". Appearing on ABC Radio Adelaide this morning after it was yesterday revealed that half the track needed resurfacing, Percat took exception to claims about the level of traffic disruption those works would cause. ""Honestly, you guys are crazy. It infuriates me,"" Percat said. ""This event injects $45 million into the economy and you're worried about missing out on one weekend of people going shopping. ""Every other country — if you watch motorsport — is kicking goals, biggest crowd attendances. ""Then we have Adelaide still pushing back. It's infuriating, honestly."" The next Adelaide 500 will be held in December after a decision to scrap the event was overturned by SA's new government. In making his comments, Percat — who is South Australian — was in part responding to Adelaide City councillor Alex Hyde, who said it would take five months for a ""total set-up and pack-down"" of the grandstand and other infrastructure in Victoria Park, which is currently accommodating a COVID testing station. ""Most of that [work] will be in the park, but there will be a lot of other works going on around it,"" the councillor said. ""On balance, we're glad to see the race back and that means filling up hotel rooms and filling up restaurants. ""[But] I'm really concerned about the effect this will have on accessibility to the city and thus the impact on that retail trade leading up to Christmas, because obviously this has always been done in March."" But Percat — who began by saying ""I've got to cut you off"" — insisted the financial benefits of the event outweighed the inconveniences. ""It's not five months of road closures — they start working there five months out because the event has not been there for a few years,"" the driver said. ""Then they have to resurface some roads, which happens every day because roads deteriorate, racetracks deteriorate. ""You've had two years of a bloody marquee set up there and you couldn't drive around that parkland. ""You guys are just missing the big picture of putting South Australia on the map, again."" While some listeners disagreed with Percat's criticisms, others endorsed them, with one tweeting that the driver's ""passion on air"" was ""refreshing"" to hear.

27,'Gutted' Tyler Wright to miss World Surf League event due to visa issue,sport," Sport Two-time world champion Tyler Wright has been left ""absolutely gutted"" after a visa issue ruled her out of competing at the upcoming World Surf League event in Brazil. The Australian's 2022 title hopes were already in doubt after COVID-19 forced her out of the G-Land event in Indonesia, and then complications from the virus meant she was not ready to compete at the recent El Salvador Pro. Those setbacks saw her slip to sixth in the rankings, but she was keen to claw her way back up at the Rio Pro in Rio de Janeiro, which starts on Thursday. However, Wright announced on Instagram on Tuesday she would not be able to enter the country in time to compete. ""Devastated to let everyone know that due to a transit visa not coming through in the specified time I am unable to make it to Brazil,"" she wrote. ""All other alternative options were extensively looked into, however the current travel climate meant it was impossible for me to arrive in time for the contest. ""Absolutely gutted, so much work went into getting me ready for Brazil with my team. Absorbing this and we keep moving forward."" Only the top five surfers qualify for the season-ending finals in California, meaning Wright will need some big results in the final two events of the year to be part of the title-deciding action.

28,Serena Williams makes winning return in Eastbourne doubles after a year out,sport," Sport Serena Williams partners Ons Jabeur for women's doubles win in Eastbourne in her first match in a year Serena Williams has made a winning return to action at the Eastbourne International, coming from a set down with partner Ons Jabeur to beat Sara Sorribes Tormo and Marie Bouzkova 2-6, 6-3 (13-11) in the women's doubles. Age: 40 WTA singles titles: 73 Grand slam singles titles: 23 Previous tournament: Wimbledon 2021 (rd 1) Weeks at number one: 319 Current singles ranking: 1204 The former world number one had not played competitive tennis since limping out of last year's first-round match at Wimbledon — where she has won seven of her 23 grand slam singles titles — in tears due to a leg injury. Back on court and on grass again, Williams stepped up preparations for Wimbledon, where the main draw starts next Monday, having been granted a wildcard to enter, alongside Tunisian Jabeur in the opening round at Eastbourne. Looking rusty with some loose early shots, 40-year-old Williams, who has slipped to 1,204th in the singles rankings, saw her serve broken in the fourth game and there was no way back as Spaniard Sorribes Tormo and her Czech partner took the opening set. Williams, who was sporting black tape on her face to help with a sinus problem, had no answer as Sorribes and Bouzkova made three successive breaks at the start of the second to help put them in a commanding position. However, a ferocious volley from Williams helped her and Jabeur hold serve to make it 4-3, before the American showed further signs she was starting to find her rhythm with a booming forehand down the line to break their opponents' serve. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Williams served out the next game to take the match to a final set tie-break, which swung this way and that, with both pairings having match points before Sorribes Tormo missed a volley at the net to gift her opponents victory. ""It was so fun to play with Ons,"" Williams said. ""We had fun. ""I caught some fire behind me! I needed that. It was good. We're just taking it one day at a time."" Earlier at Eastbourne, British number four Katie Boulter stormed to one of the biggest wins of her career with a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 win over 2021 Wimbledon runner-up Karolina Pliskova, while Jodie Burrage completed a day to remember for Britain by beating world number four Paula Badosa 6-4, 6-3.

29,Will Brad Fittler's shock positional switch pay off in State of Origin II?,sport," Sport Will Api Koroisau's shock State of Origin start be the spark New South Wales need to save the series? As the newly minted New South Wales starting hooker, Api Koroisau admits he has big shoes to fill, replacing incumbent number nine Damien Cook. ""'Cookie' has done an amazing job and nobody is going to replace what he has done,"" Apisai Koroisau told ABC Sport. The Rabbitohs star has started as hooker for 13 consecutive State of Origin matches but will start from the bench for Game II after the Blues' shock loss in Sydney earlier this month. Koroisau doesn't want to get overwhelmed by the pressure, knowing he has to step up in Perth for New South Wales to keep their series hopes alive. ""To be honest I am trying not to think about it like that — at the end of the day it's just a job that needs to be done, it's not like we are doing anything too different or too crazy out there, it's the same thing we do every week,"" Koroisau said. Starting the Panthers rake in just his second Origin appearance is just one of seven big changes to coach Brad Fittler's side going into the must-win clash. Koroisau wants to prove he's worth the gamble, not by emulating Cook's style but by instead playing his own game to his own strengths. ""What I'll bring is maybe just a bit of a steady head, try and move us around the ruck a bit, a bit more energy there in that middle, I'll do my best and see what happens,"" Koroisau said. While the series opener was by no means a thumping defeat, Koroisau feels the Blues performance was far from good enough, saying there's plenty for the side to work on after the 16-10 defeat. ""Our ruck speed playing the ball, how slow it was for us and how quick it was for Queensland, so defensively we have to be a bit better and quicken up our attack,"" Koroisau said. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter ""Our supports were down as well so there's plenty of room for improvement."" In an effort to find that improvement, Fittler has taken a stern approach to his side's Perth preparations – calling his players into camp on Sunday night in Sydney and departing early on Monday morning for a full week of training. The Blues also won't break camp for a day, as they did before Game I, with the squad to stay together for the full seven days in the lead-up to the match on Sunday. It's a very different approach to Queensland's coach Billy Slater, who will arrive with his charges in Perth late on Thursday. Koroisau will be joined by his ex-panthers teammate Matt Burton, who will debut in the centres after Jack Wighton was ruled out due to contracting COVID-19. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""I'm over the moon, there's a lot of energy in the group, and I'm looking forward to the week,"" Burton told ABC Sport after his first session with the squad. ""The boys have been really good, they all got around me so it makes it a lot easier on me, looking forward to getting out there."" Burton is certain his experience with the Panthers, where he played a crucial role in the side's march to the 2021 premiership, will make all the difference for New South Wales as he attempts to brush off the pressure and keep the Blues on track for a fourth series win in five years. ""It obviously helps a lot, knowing those boys from last year, we have a few combinations there and I can't wait to use them,"" Burton said. ""You know the pressure is always there, but we are feeling confident going into the game.""

30,analysis: The NRLW is expanding at breakneck speed. Will women's rugby league be ready for the future?,sport," Sport The NRLW is set to radically expand in the next 12 months. But is women's rugby league ready for such rapid growth? The world of women's rugby league is changing faster and faster all the time. That's the thing about progress – it's a path that leads down a hill, so the further things go, the faster they get there. And women's rugby league is hurtling down the hill. Friday night will be the last time the State of Origin series is contested in a single match before it expands to two next year. After three new clubs joined the NRLW for 2022's first season the league, flush with success, fast-tracked expansion from two new teams for 2023 to four new sides, meaning the competition will have more than doubled in size in less than three years. Growing Origin is a no-brainer, but flooding the NRLW with new clubs is a more complex discussion, with some of the game's biggest names split on whether the league is ready for ten teams. ""It's nearly doubled with what we've got at the moment and we're already struggling to fill up those last few spots on the teams as is,"" Newcastle and New South Wales prop Millie Boyle said. ""I know the game is growing, I'm not sure if it's growing at the pace where they can put in those new teams."" Boyle, a member of the Rugby League Players Association women's advisory group, also takes issue with what she believes to be a lack of consultation from the NRL on the viability of such radical expansion. ""We're on there, but they're going to make their own decisions. I guess they'll say we're whinging whatever happens – 'they say we're not big enough, they say there's not enough teams, they say there's too many',"" Boyle said. ""We'll never be able to make everyone happy. They make the rules and you can't grow unless you grow. I thought it would be two teams, but it's not up to me. ""Four teams will be a big jump, I guess with the new marquee spots and the new CBA we'll spread girls out again and get them to new areas all over the country, especially down in Canberra and up in North Queensland."" When Sam Bremner announced she would take time away from rugby league to start a family, people treated it like a retirement. Now she's making her return to State of Origin after a four-year absence. The NRLW took four years to expand following it's launch in 2018, a slow-burn approach which ensured there was always enough elite-level talent to fill out the existing teams. It meant that when the league finally pulled the trigger on growing the game, they were able to spread out enough star players to ensure the new teams were competitive. Things didn't work out perfectly – Newcastle were winless in their first campaign – but every other team won at least two games and for the most part, matches were closely fought and competitive. Providing new avenues and pathways and growing the sport is important, but so is producing a high-quality product on the field. If the quality of play rises, as it did this year, it means better ratings, stronger crowds and increased interest from fans both old and new. It's easier to sell, which means more people will buy it. If there is more teams than there is talent there's a danger of scores blowing out and the competition losing it's lustre as the snake starts to eat it's tail. Given Canberra, Cronulla, North Queensland and Wests Tigers must all find enough players to fill out a competitive roster and given there was a winless side in a six-team league it's a fair question to ask if that will be possible. What will help matters is that each of the four clubs has a strong grassroots program – Cronulla and the Tigers have fielded teams in the NSW Women's Premiership since 2019, the Raiders have a Tarsha Gale Cup (Under 18s) side and the North Queensland Gold Stars, who will presumably provide many of the Cowboys players, won the Queensland Women's Premiership grand final earlier this month. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter And, as Blues veteran Sam Bremner points out, if there are more spots available it creates more opportunities for players to fill those spots, which should help grow participation. Bremner, who has played at the top level of women's rugby league since 2012 and has witnessed the game's transformation over the past decade first-hand, knows the old ""you can't be what you can't see"" adage still rings true. ""It is a really big jump, but the best thing that ever happened to women's rugby league was that we exposed it,"" Bremner said. ""I remember going to a school after we won the World Cup and they asked the kids 'hands up if you've ever heard of the Jillaroos' and one boy stood up and said 'yeah, I know them, they play hockey'. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""From then, we started exposing women's rugby league and all these girls started playing and I think having more opportunities are going to make girls think it's possible for them, and then the depth continues to grow. ""It is a really big leap, but I have faith we can fill those spots. It's an exciting time for women's rugby league. ""Girls can see us on TV and we say it all the time but it's true, you can't be what you can't see."" Regardless of how this new round of expansion goes, it's unlikely the NRLW will be slowing down. The NRL already wants to expand again - South Sydney want in for the 2024 season and Penrith are keen to field a team as soon as possible. Unless the four new sides are an unmitigated disaster, the game will keep flying down the hill until it either levels out or topples over. The careful, slow approach is over. Sometimes, if you wait until you're ready you never get ready at all, and the NRL has decided the future is coming and it's coming fast.

31,Australia spun out in Colombo as Sri Lanka clinches ODI series,sport," Sport Sri Lanka beats Australia by four runs in Colombo to clinch ODI series 3-1 with a game to play Australia's looming challenge of ""extreme"" turning Sri Lankan Test wickets has been laid bare, after being spun out of the one-day series with a four-run defeat in Colombo. Chasing 259, David Warner played a lone hand with 99 as Australia capitulated from 4-189 in the 36th over to be all out for 254 and down 3-1 in the five-match series. The margin could also have been far worse, if not for Pat Cummins's 35 and Matthew Kuhnemann scoring 14 from the final over off Dasun Shanaka before being caught in the ring on the final ball. But it couldn't paper over Australia's uphill battle against spin. Seven wickets fell to the slower bowlers, as Sri Lanka played five turners and sent down 43 overs from them on a used wicket that spun well into the night. Just over a week out from the first Test in Galle, the hosts' win will likely confirm the blueprint on how they plan to beat Australia in the red-ball format. Legspinner Jeffrey Vandersay took 2-40, offspinner Dhananjaya de Silva 2-39 and mystery spinner Maheesh Theekshana 1-40. Warner meanwhile had looked in control after Aaron Finch (0), Mitch Marsh (26), Marnus Labuschagne (14) and Alex Carey (19) all came and went. The opener was cagey in the early overs, before taking on Theekshana. He hit 12 boundaries in his knock, going hard through the covers and driving superbly. And when he reached 99 Warner looked almost certain to end the longest century drought of his international career, which now sits at 48 innings across all formats. But the match then swung violently in Sri Lanka's favour, handing them their first bilateral one-day series win over Australia at home since 1992. With Warner at the non-striker's end, Travis Head (27) was bowled by Dhananjaya, before Glenn Maxwell was trapped lbw by Theekshana next over. And when Warner finally got back on strike, Dhananjaya drew him off balance and beat his outside edge to have him stumped. Cameron Green followed shortly after, before Cummins (35) and Kuhnemann's late efforts. The collapse will no doubt have evoked memories of the 2016 Test tour for the locals, when Australia struggled to combat the spin in the 3-0 series loss. ""This is extreme spin; you don't usually see these type of wickets,"" Warner said. ""You only see them here. India is completely different. They don't turn like that. They're actually good wickets. And they turn later on day three or four (of Tests). ""So everyone has to prepare as well as they can. It's about being busy. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""It's about committing. ""It's about batting long periods of time. And unfortunately, in the subcontinent, one little mistake will cost you."" The good news for Australia on Tuesday was that their two best players from 2016 are returning to fitness, with Mitchell Starc and Steve Smith both sighted in the nets with a red ball after finger and quad injuries. Cummins also bowled nicely on field, taking 2-37 and unlucky not to have another wicket early when he hit Charith Asalanka's leg stump with the left-hander on one. However the bail did not fall off, allowing Asalanka to lead Sri Lanka from 3-34 to 258 with his maiden international century of 110 from 106 balls.

33,"Jordan De Goey apologises for 'disrespectful conduct', receives suspended fine",sport," Sport Jordan De Goey apologises for 'disrespectful conduct' in Bali, receives suspended $25,000 fine AFL star Jordan De Goey has been handed a $25,000 suspended fine by Collingwood and has apologised for his ""disrespectful"" conduct while partying in Bali. Footage emerged on social media last week of De Goey, who was given permission by the club to travel to Bali on his mid-season break, making crude gestures while at a nightclub. The fine is suspended through to the end of the season and dependent on good behaviour. De Goey will also ""undertake further behavioural education"" in addition to an existing counselling program. ""The actions shown in the video footage are disrespectful and I accept that I have betrayed the trust the club showed in me by allowing me to take my mid-season break overseas,"" De Goey said in a statement. ""My actions have fallen short of the standards expected of me as a person, as an AFL footballer and as a representative of the Collingwood Football Club. ""I had worked hard this year to establish trust and confidence in me to make better decisions and through no one's fault but my own, I have undone that trust."" The 26-year-old's statement was in stark contrast to his initial response via Instagram, where he had lamented ""persecution"" of athletes by the media. Collingwood condemned De Goey's actions as disrespectful towards women. ""There was certainly one aspect of that that we were really concerned about and there's the social media content and the video that showed him basically disrespecting women and tugging at the clothing,"" Anderson said. ""That was something that for us, in addition to some other things, but that was the thing that for us we couldn't tolerate and showed that it was disrespectful of women and it's something as a club that we can't stand for and don't stand for. ""Regardless of whether it was consensual and the environment that was created and we understand that it was (consensual) ... the values of respect for women is that that behaviour is not acceptable."" The Bali incident comes after De Goey was stood down by Collingwood last October when he was arrested for a drunken incident at a New York nightclub. Anderson said De Goey would speak in the next couple of days but couldn't confirm whether he would face GWS on Sunday. The AFL said Collingwood had ""handled the matter appropriately"" and the league wouldn't take further action against De Goey, while condemning his behaviour as setting a bad example. ""His actions were not acceptable and were not of a standard that the game or the public expect of AFL players,"" AFL football boss Andrew Dillon said. Meanwhile Magpies youngsters Jack Ginnivan and Isaac Quaynor have apologised for a now-deleted video where they rated imaginary women as part of a TikTok trend.

34,"World Rugby changes concussion protocols, with 12-day break to become the norm",sport," Sport World Rugby agrees to changes to concussion protocols, with 12-day break to become the norm The vast majority of elite-level rugby union players diagnosed with a concussion will not be able to return to play for 12 days as a result of changes being introduced by the sport's world governing body from July 1. World Rugby is following recommendations by an independent concussion working group after a review of the latest scientific evidence. The current regulations allow players who fail a head-injury assessment during a game to be back on the field seven days later if they follow return-to-play protocols. While that could still be the case for some, provided they get the approval of an independent concussion consultant, the majority will be out of the game for five more days. The updated criteria being used to judge how quickly players can return after showing obvious concussion symptoms now includes their history of concussions. These new criteria will be in place for next month's men's Test series that will feature match-ups including England v the Wallabies in Australia and Ireland v the All Blacks in New Zealand. They will also affect upcoming Wallaroos fixtures, with Australia due to take on New Zealand in two tests in August. ""It is going to be a new mindset for coaches and players,"" said World Rugby's chief medical officer Dr Éanna Falvey. ""Our approach means it is now overwhelmingly likely a player diagnosed with a concussion won't play in their team's next match. ""World Rugby firmly believes that scientific evidence supports our protocols, but we are continually monitoring and testing them to ensure that they are fit for the modern game. ""We recognise that there are differences in concussion symptoms and concussion history, and this process enables us to further protect elite players by individualising their rehabilitation. Kim Klomp competed in one of the nation's top football leagues in the 1980s and 1990s but, after he retired, he began suffering from depression and suspected something was wrong with his brain. ""It also keeps in place all the benefits of the previous protocols, which have been so successful in beginning to tackle under-reporting of symptoms, which evidence shows that, while improving, remains an issue."" The changes were also lauded by World Rugby chief executive Alan Gilpin. ""There are always going to be head impacts and there are always going to be concussions in rugby, so we are never going to eradicate that with the nature of the sport we have,"" Mr Gilpin said. ""But we want people comfortable that we have got a game that is safe to play at all levels and the sport is doing its best to protect and look after players' safety and welfare. ""We are making progress. There are lots of areas where we have advanced. You can never do too much in this area.""

35,Rugby league bans transgender players from women's internationals after FINA's ruling on swimmers,sport," Sport International Rugby League bans transgender women as it looks to create an inclusive policy after FINA ruling The International Rugby League (IRL) has banned transgender women from matches, as numerous sports review their policies after FINA's decision on swimming was announced on Monday. Swimming's world governing body voted to restrict the participation of transgender athletes in elite women's competitions and move towards having an ""open"" category in some events as part of its new policy. FINA's new rules say transgender women are eligible to compete in women's competitions only if ""they can establish to FINA's comfortable satisfaction that they have not experienced any part of male puberty beyond Tanner Stage 2 [of puberty] or before age 12, whichever is later"". Weightlifter Laurel Hubbard broke down barriers simply by competing in women's competitions, but the answers to many of the questions you might have heard about her inclusion are no, no, no, no and no. World Athletics and FIFA said they would review the rules in their sports, while the IRL announced a ban on trans women from international women's matches ""until further research is completed to enable the IRL to implement a formal transgender inclusion policy"". The IRL said it came to its decision based largely on the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) ruling last year that it was up to individual sporting bodies to determine their own policies around participation. ""In the interests of avoiding unnecessary welfare, legal and reputational risk to International Rugby League competitions, and those competing therein, the IRL believes there is a requirement and responsibility to further consult and complete additional research before finalising its policy,"" an IRL statement said. ""The IRL reaffirms its belief that rugby league is a game for all and that anyone and everyone can play our sport. The IRL said it would consult with the women's teams playing at the Rugby League World Cup in October and November to try to put together an inclusion policy, ""which takes into consideration the unique characteristics of rugby league"". ""The IRL will continue to work towards developing a set of criteria, based on best possible evidence, which fairly balances the individual's right to play with the safety of all participants,"" the statement read. Chair of the IRL board Troy Grant acknowledged the organisation had a lot of learning to do. ""The IRL transgender decision is not one based on gender. It is one based on biology and physiology,"" he said. ""We are getting as informed as much as we can but we, like the rest of the sporting world and broader community, have much to understand.""

36,'Get a grip': Ballon D'Or winner Megan Rapinoe criticises exclusion of trans athletes,sport,"  'Get a grip': Ballon D'Or winner Megan Rapinoe criticises growing exclusion of trans people from sport Two-time Women's World Cup football champion and former Ballon D'Or winner Megan Rapinoe has defended the inclusion of transgender athletes in sport as more governing bodies, including FIFA and World Athletics, consider tighter restrictions on trans people's participation. Warning: This article contains discussion of suicide. Speaking to Time Magazine on Monday, Rapinoe said much of the decision-making from governing bodies that excluded trans people was misinformed, and that the rationale behind blanket bans was both unethical and not supported by evidence. Her comments come as FINA, world swimming's governing body, voted to further restrict trans women from competing in elite competitions. ""I'm 100 per cent supportive of trans inclusion,"" Rapinoe said. ""People do not know very much about it. We're missing almost everything. Frankly, I think what a lot of people know is versions of the [political] right's talking-points, because they're very loud, they're very consistent, and they're relentless. ""At the highest level, there is regulation. In collegiate sports, there is regulation, and at the Olympic and professional level. It's not like it's a free-for-all where everyone's just doing whatever. ""Show me the evidence that trans women are taking everyone's scholarships, are dominating in every sport, are winning every title. I'm sorry, it's just not happening. ""So we need to start from inclusion — period. And, as things arise, I have confidence that we can figure it out. But we can't start at the opposite. That is cruel. And, frankly, it's just disgusting. ""We really need to take a step back and get a grip on what we're really talking about here because people's lives are at risk. Kids' lives are at risk with the rates of suicide, the rates of depression and negative mental health and drug abuse. ""We're [framing] everything through 'God forbid a trans person be successful in sports'. Get a grip on reality and take a step back."" While those who believe trans women should be excluded from sport have defended their right to ""free speech"", little airtime has been given to examining the science behind the claims being made. Rapinoe, who plays alongside Canadian women's national team and non-binary, trans footballer Quinn at NWSL club OL Reign, has used her high-profile platform to advocate for social causes for several years. She was the first footballer in the world to kneel in solidarity with NFL player Colin Kaepernick, was a leader in the US women's national team's fight for equal pay, and regularly uses interviews and award acceptance speeches to shine a light on issues affecting the LGBTQIA+ community, of which she is part. ""I am not just speaking for me,"" she said. ""I'm speaking for a lot of people. ""For a long time, I was the only player that was 'out'. And, so, just being the only spokesperson and making sure I'm setting the right example, saying the right things, whether it comes to gay marriage or difficult and nuanced topics like trans inclusion in sports. ""Those are the challenges of just continuing to stay educated. ""Nothing goes unsaid. Speak it plainly. And I'm gonna speak it loudly, and I think that helps other people who maybe don't have the ability to do that, or who aren't in a place to do that quite yet."" The United States is facing its own reckoning when it comes to trans people's inclusion in sports, with several Republican-controlled states banning trans people from all sport, despite not being able to provide evidence to support it, while others have passed laws requiring school-aged girls ""suspected"" of being trans to receive physical genital examinations to ""prove"" their gender presentation matches their biological sex characteristics. For Rapinoe, these blanket sports laws not only disproportionately affect an already-marginalised community, but they also feed into a discourse where success in elite sport takes priority over the rights and freedoms of trans people. ""I think people also need to understand that sports is not the most important thing in life, right? Life is the most important thing in life,"" she said. During the election campaign, focus turned to the issue of transgender women in sport, leaving more significant issues unchallenged, writes Tracey Holmes. ""And so much of this trans inclusion argument has been put through the extremely tiny lens of elite sports. That is not the way to be framing this question. ""We're talking about kids. We're talking about people's lives. We're talking about the entire government coming down on one child in some states, three children in some states. ""They are committing suicide because they are being told that they're gross and different and evil and sinful and they can't play sports with their friends that they grew up with. It's monstrous. ""I would also encourage everyone out there who is afraid someone's going to have an unfair advantage over their kid to really take a step back and think, 'What are we actually talking about here?' ""We're talking about people's lives. I'm sorry, your kid's high school volleyball team just isn't that important. It's not more important than any one kid's life.""

37,'Distraught': Detained WNBA star Brittney Griner unable to talk to wife due to US embassy's lack of staff,sport," Sport Brittney Griner makes 11 unanswered calls to wife from jail in Russia with US embassy unstaffed WNBA star Brittney Griner tried to call her wife nearly a dozen times through the American embassy in Russia on Saturday, but was unable to connect because the phone line at the embassy was reportedly not staffed. Cherelle Griner provided the update on Monday, saying the phone calls came on the date of the couple's fourth anniversary. The couple has not been able to speak by phone in the four months since the two-time Olympic gold medallist's arrest in Russia, where she remains in jail. Their long-awaited call was to take place on Saturday, after the couple finally received Russian government approval. However, the day came and went without any contact, leaving an anguished Cherelle Griner to wonder what went wrong. On Monday, she said she learned that Brittney Griner had tried to call 11 times over a period of several hours, dialling a number she'd been given for the US embassy in Moscow. The couple had been told that call would then be patched through to Cherelle Griner in Phoenix. However, each time Brittney Griner rang, the call went unanswered, because the desk at the embassy where the phone rang was apparently unstaffed on Saturday. ""I was distraught. I was hurt. I was done, fed up,"" Cherelle Griner told The Associated Press, adding that she was in tears. ""I'm pretty sure I texted [Brittney Griner's] agent and was, like: 'I don't want to talk to anybody. It's going to take me a minute to get my emotions together, and just tell everybody I'm unavailable right now.' ""It just knocked me out. I wasn't well. I'm still not well."" Brittney Griner, a seven-time WNBA All-Star who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, was detained at a Russian airport on February 17 after authorities there said a search of her bag revealed vape cartridges containing hashish oil. On Monday, the State Department released a statement saying they ""deeply regret that Brittney Griner was unable to speak with her wife because of a logistical error"". The department reiterated that it has no higher priority than the safety of Americans overseas and that it remains in regular contact with families of hostages and wrongful detainees. In an interview with the US television network NBC news, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the US basketballer was guilty of drug offences and denied she was a hostage. For Cherelle Griner, the experience has exacerbated already simmering frustrations about the US government's response to her wife's case. Although US officials have repeatedly said they were working behind the scenes to get the WNBA star home from Russia, Cherelle Griner said she was ""very pissed"" about the incident. ""I find it unacceptable and I have zero trust in our government right now,"" she said. ""If I can't trust [the government] to catch a Saturday call outside of business hours, how can I trust [them] to actually be negotiating on my wife's behalf to come home? ""That's a much bigger ask than to catch a Saturday call."" Cherelle Griner said a contact in the US government had apologised to her for the error. She added that she had since since learned that the number Brittney Griner had been given to dial typically processes calls from prisoners on Mondays through Fridays, which is why no one was there to transfer the call. When Brittney Griner was arrested in May, the State Department designated her as wrongfully detained, moving her case under the supervision of its Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, effectively the government's chief hostage negotiator. Russian state-run news agency Tass reported last week that her detention had been extended until July 3. Basketball star Brittney Griner remains detained in Russia and it's unclear how an unexpected prisoner exchange deal that saw Russia free a US marine veteran will affect the the WNBA star. Cherelle Griner said she was still hoping to talk to, or meet with, President Joe Biden, but ""at this point it's starting to feel like a no"". So far, Cherelle Griner says she's had to rely exclusively on others' assessments about her wife's condition. Lawyers and consular affairs officials have been able to speak to the basketball star, but her wife has not. ""This was such a big moment, because this would have been the first time where I truly could tell if she's OK,"" Cherelle Griner said. ""This would have been the first time for me to actually just hear her in real time and to truly know if she's OK, or to know if she's seconds away from not being in existence anymore.""

38,"FIFA, World Athletics review transgender rules after swimming's change",sport," Sport World Athletics and FIFA reviewing transgender policies after FINA ruling World football's governing body and athletics administrators are reviewing their transgender eligibility policies after swimming passed new rules that restrict transgender participation in women's events. On Sunday, swimming's world governing body FINA voted to restrict the participation of transgender athletes in elite women's competitions and create a working group to establish an ""open"" category in some events as part of its new policy. The new policy states that transgender women are eligible to compete in women's competitions only if ""they can establish to FINA's comfortable satisfaction that they have not experienced any part of male puberty beyond Tanner Stage 2 [of puberty] or before age 12, whichever is later"". Sebastian Coe, president of World Athletics, told the BBC the organisation's council would discuss their regulations at the end of the year. Coe praised FINA for taking the decision, which has been criticised by trans rights advocates, who have regularly challenged claims that trans women dominate women's sport. For example, the swim that sparked much of this debate, Lia Thomas's win in the 500-yard freestyle at US college championships, was nine seconds slower than the NCAA record set by Katie Ledecky five years ago. Coe said it was important to protect the integrity of women's sport, saying ""if it's a judgement between inclusion and fairness, we will always fall down on the side of fairness"". ""We see an international federation asserting its primacy in setting rules, regulations and policies that are in the best interest of its sport,"" Coe told the BBC. Weightlifter Laurel Hubbard broke down barriers simply by competing in women's competitions, but the answers to many of the questions you might have heard about her inclusion are no, no, no, no and no. ""This is as it should be. We have always believed that biology trumps gender, and we will continue to review our regulations in line with this. We will follow the science. ""We continue to study, research and contribute to the growing body of evidence that testosterone is a key determinant in performance, and have scheduled a discussion on our regulations with our council at the end of the year."" Last year, the IOC issued a ""framework"" on the issue, leaving eligibility decisions up to individual sports bodies, but adding that ""until evidence determines otherwise, athletes should not be deemed to have an unfair or disproportionate competitive advantage due to their sex variations, physical appearance and/or transgender status"". World Athletics' current rules cap testosterone levels at five nanomoles per litre (5nmol/L) for transgender athletes and for competitors with differences in sex development (DSD) in some women's running events. The athletics governing body has attracted criticism in the past for its handling of gender-related issues, with the treatment of South African middle-distance star Caster Semenya garnering headlines around the world and ending up in front of numerous courts and tribunals. A spokesperson for FIFA said it was in a consultation process over a new policy. ""FIFA is currently reviewing its gender eligibility regulations in consultation with expert stakeholders,"" the spokesperson said. During the election campaign, focus turned to the issue of transgender women in sport, leaving more significant issues unchallenged, writes Tracey Holmes. The spokesperson said the process was ""ongoing"" so would not comment further ""on specifics of proposed amendments to the existing regulations"". FIFA said it was taking guidance from medical, legal, scientific, performance and human rights experts and also the position of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). ""Should FIFA be asked to verify the eligibility of a player before the new regulations will be in place, any such case will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, taking into account FIFA's clear commitment to respect human rights,"" the spokesperson said. Last week the International Cycling Union (UCI) tightened its rules on transgender participation by increasing the transition period on low testosterone to two years and reducing the maximum permitted testosterone level.

It was joy and relief for the 20-year-old Sydney swimmer who had missed out on a medal in the 400m freestyle on Saturday night by the barest of margins. Going into the championships in Budapest, the 1,500m freestyle was the only women's event at a worlds in which an Australian swimmer had not reached the podium. Pallister pipped compatriot Moesha Johnson on Monday to wipe out that omission, as she came third behind record-breaking American Katie Ledecky. Sixteen-year-old Katie Grimes, also from the United States, was second, 4.07s ahead of Pallister. ""It's really special to win a medal,"" Pallister said. ""I was touched out by .08 [of a second] in the 400m and I remember getting back to the hotel and I was just devastated. ""It's really exciting coming to my first senior international meet and coming back to a pool that I loved three years ago. Moving forward it's a really nice stepping stone to see what I can do in the future. I think if I work the back end more rather than just attacking the front end then it's an event that I could do something really special in in the future."" Johnson, who swam a personal best, said: ""I just went out there tonight just wanting to put down the best swim that I could and get some experience internationally, so to come overseas and race some of the best in the world has been a real honour. ""Hats off to Lani for such a good swim, I've seen her train the house down for the last six months and she deserves every bit of this."" It was Ledecky's fourth 1,500m freestyle title at the worlds. She never looked threatened and clocked 15:30.15 — just under 10 seconds more than her world record from 2018. Ledecky's gold was her record-extending 17th world title and second of this championships. Pallister was 18.81 seconds off Ledecky's pace and 6.79 seconds ahead of Johnson. But there was disappointment for Australia's golden boy of Saturday night, Elijah Winnington, in the men's 200m freestyle as he finished eighth. Winnington, the gold medalist in the 400m freestyle, was second-fastest off the blocks but was overtaken by the field, finishing 2.61 seconds behind 17-year-old Romanian David Popovici, who set a world junior record to win the men's 200m in 1:43.21. Madi Wilson and Mollie O'Callaghan carried their form through from the heats of the women's 200m freestyle to qualify second and third fastest for Tuesday night's final.

As a two-time World Cup winner with the Jillaroos and a mainstay for New South Wales since her debut in 2012, she was unquestionably one of the best players and biggest stars in women's rugby league — plus an important cog in the launch of the first NRLW season later that year as one of the faces of St George Illawarra. But life, and Bremner, had other plans. Due to injuries and the birth of her two children, the star fullback hasn't played for the Blues since and has only appeared in four NRLW matches total, including none this season – which makes the 30-year old's return to the New South Wales squad for Friday's Origin clash with Queensland all the more remarkable. ""I'm really proud to be here. It's been difficult, but it's been so rewarding, and it's a big part of my sense of belonging, playing rugby league and being around the girls,"" Bremner said. ""Coming into camp and being around the girls and being in this really professional, high pressure environment, I really missed that. It might sound crazy, to say you really missed it but I'm so happy to be back amongst this. ""I don't want people to think that just because something's hard or nobody else has done it or it seems near impossible that it's OK not to do it. If somebody thinks it can't be done, that really drives me."" Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter Bremner, who will be the Blues' 18th player on Friday, is the only player selected in either interstate squad without appearing in this year's NRLW competition, with her slashing form in the New South Wales women's premiership series enough to earn her an Origin berth. While she admits there were times when she questioned if she'd ever return to the top level, Bremner hopes her story inspires others who ever face the choice between top-level sport and motherhood. ""The whole experience gave me a lot of perspective. When you're an elite athlete a lot of your world is about you,"" Bremner said. ""It's about how you perform, how you conduct yourself, it's what you do for the team; after having children I have a deeper understanding that the world doesn't revolve around me. ""The world is a lot bigger than me, and the reasons why I play football are bigger than me and what I want to achieve. ""It's showing people you can follow your dreams even if it's difficult, and even if there's not a clear pathway towards what your dream looks like, you can create it yourself. ""I knew it would be a stretch to make this side from Harvey Norman (women's premiership), but I loved that people thought it might not be possible. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""The other thing is, I'd love it if my teammates – if they chose to have a family – to not feel like they have to choose between two of their biggest loves. ""I want to show my teammates … you can have it all."" Bremner returns to a different Origin arena than the one she's known. The expansion of the NRLW this season means the playing standard has lifted, with more players being exposed to an elite training and playing environment. Bremner, who is yet to confirm her NRLW future for this year's second season, says she worked hard to maintain her skills during the lengthy lay-off, and should disaster strike the Blues' spine on Friday she'll be ready to step back in.

41,"Club withdraws women's football team from WA league as more players resign amid racism, sexism claims",sport,"  Racism, sexism claims at South Bunbury Football Club leads to withdrawal of women's team An embattled Western Australian country football club has taken the ""unprecedented"" move of withdrawing its three-time premiership women's team amid claims of racist and sexist behaviour within the club. Almost the entire women's team at the South Bunbury Football Club has now resigned halfway through the season in response to the alleged incidents. In one such incident, a male club leader was forced to apologise after referring to being at a strip club during the women's season launch. It was alleged he said ""he needed bigger pants"" to contain his excitement at being in a room full of ""pretty girls"". Another flashpoint came in May where a rival player, Noongar man Hayden Yarran, was racially vilified by one of South Bunbury's male league players. Twelve players in the South Bunbury Football Club women's team have quit halfway through the season. That led the women's team coach, Maxwell Jetta, to resign in protest of his club's handling of the incident. He was promptly followed by his assistant coach and more than a dozen players. The South Bunbury women's team forfeited its weekend match after being unable to field a team. On Monday afternoon, the South West Football League (SWFL) announced the club had withdrawn its women's team from the competition. The SWFL said in a statement what was happening at the club was ""obviously unprecedented"" and it would work through the ramifications. Team captain and one of the club's first female players Bethany Bond said pulling the team was a decision of the board and not discussed with the remaining players. Following the weekend forfeit, Ms Bond said she was left with about four girls who wanted to continue playing this season. ""It's heartbreaking after six years of hard work and all of the dedication we've put into this team … to see that all just crumble is extremely sad, but I wasn't surprised,"" she said. Ms Bond said that while she had not personally experienced sexism, she was aware of sexist remarks aimed towards teammates throughout the year that had made them feel uncomfortable. ""Personally, I thought we had a good culture, but coming into this year I did feel like the board didn't really respond to our women's players really well,"" she said. ""Girls have felt uncomfortable and when they've tried to express that, it hasn't been dealt with properly."" Ms Bond said the future of women's football at the club was unclear. ""This is going to affect the club for years,"" she said. ""I feel like people will avoid playing there next year and I honestly don't know if any of the girls will go back."" The ABC has contacted the South Bunbury Football club for comment. Emily Wilson, 20, has been a club member since she was a child and currently plays for the affiliated South Bunbury netball team. She claimed to be one of several women who were spoken to inappropriately at the season launch night. Ms Wilson said she felt singled out by being called ""gorgeous Emily"" by an older man. ""In the moment I sort of laughed it off but I think everyone at the club looked shocked, even the boys, but no one really stood up and said, 'That's wrong',"" Ms Wilson said. ""I've tried to be a part of the club and laughing at these jokes, laughing through my embarrassment. ""I felt like I needed to be okay with these jokes and language that's passed around the club to be respected by the male members but really it just makes you feel really small. ""Unfortunately, I think you kind of learn at the club that you're not really as valued as a woman just for being a woman."" A group of players from the women's netball team have since sent an open letter to the club urging them to do better when dealing with racism and sexism. The ABC understands the club will have a board meeting tonight to address the issues raised by the female members.

42,East Gippsland footballers face long wait for paramedics after mark that stopped match,sport,"  Country footballers wait two hours for ambulance to treat suspected spinal injury at East Gippsland A country Australian rules football match ground to a halt at the weekend after clubs waited nearly two hours for an ambulance to take a player to hospital with a suspected spinal injury. The senior East Gippsland Football League match between the Lakes Entrance and Orbost-Snowy Rovers football netball clubs took place at Lakes Entrance Recreation Reserve early on Saturday afternoon. Twenty-two minutes into the first quarter, Orbost-Snowy Rovers full-back Jessie Pescod went up in a marking contest, fell awkwardly, and landed on top of another player, Orbost Snowy Rovers Football Netball Club president Royston Nettleton said. ""Everyone around it could hear the cracks and the force of the impact and he just didn't move from there,"" he said. Club trainers immediately called Ambulance Victoria and received advice not to move Mr Pescod before further assessment. ""We always fear the worst when it's back and neck and spinal-related, so everyone was in a bit of shock,"" Mr Nettleton said. ""I suppose we think the worst but hope for the best."" The game was at first suspended, and then cancelled, after it became clear an ambulance would not be arriving soon. Ambulance Victoria staff called trainers back half an hour after the first call to try to assess Mr Pescod over the phone. A mobile intensive care ambulance (MICA) arrived and helped move Mr Pescod inside. Two off-duty paramedics from the netball team then organised to pick up an unstaffed ambulance from the local station and took the man to Bairnsdale hospital. ""We believe it was two hours from the point of the accident to the point where he left the footy,"" Mr Nettleton said. ""We're very thankful for those girls that went and retrieved the ambulance and decided to log on on their day off,"" he said. Mr Pescod was eventually cleared of serious spinal injury but received heavy bruising to his back. In a statement, an Ambulance Victoria spokesperson confirmed only the MICA paramedic had attended the accident. ""The call came during a busy period for our crews,"" the spokesperson said. ""Ambulance resources are allocated based on clinical need and prioritised to the sickest patients, particularly those with life-threatening conditions.""

43,'It feels good': Remote football team plays first game in two years with COVID travel restrictions lifted at last,sport,"  On a red dirt field with only sparse patches of green, the Bidyadanga Emus have pulled on their footy boots at the team's home ground for the first time in two seasons. Access restrictions into remote Aboriginal communities, imposed at the start of the pandemic to limit the spread of COVID-19, were lifted last week. The easing of the travel ban means sport and cultural activities can return to normal in communities because visitors can now enter for non-essential reasons — and one of those is football. At a smoking ceremony marking the start of play, elder Angelina Nanudie was excited to celebrate the return of football to Karajarri country at Bidyadanga, around a two-hour drive south of Broome. ""I'm welcoming the Cable Beach mob to play in my country,"" she said. ""What we're doing is getting the scent of the grass so that people can have that smell and be safe. ""This is our first home game after the COVID … it feels good."" In the Kimberley — a region where Australian rules football is often likened to religion — the ability to host home games again has breathed life back into communities that have been largely closed off to the world. Women's coach Michael Martin said the return of home games brought the whole community together after a long period of uncertainty. ""Football is always number one on the calendar,"" he said. ""It's just given people a chance to forget about all that [COVID-19] and come down and support their team and have fun. ""It's also an opportunity for men and women now to represent their communities."" The restrictions, which were imposed by the state government, had required visitors to secure police approvals to enter more than 200 communities between the Goldfields and the Kimberley. While state-level restrictions have eased, individual communities can still choose to apply their own restrictions about who can enter and why. Mick Albert from the Cable Beach Greenbacks said his side was happy to make the last-minute trip from Broome, as teams in the West Kimberley Football League reverted to pre-pandemic fixtures. ""We had to scramble now the community has opened up during the week,"" he said. ""We were still unsure if we were coming down to play. ""We had to check who had cars and who had spots available and do RAT tests as well."" Community nurse Latham Rogers took it upon himself to pick up elders from around the community and bring them to the oval to ensure they didn't miss the big match. It's something he's done for eight years, but he says Saturday's game held particular significance. ""We're making sure we are looking after the oldies in the community, bringing them down and letting them be part of the atmosphere, watching the young people play sport,"" he says. ""Often the oldies wouldn't have the opportunity to come down to watch the games and would stay at home."" Mr Rogers prepared plates of fresh healthy food and served tea and coffee to elders throughout the game. ""Whether it's a barbecue, sandwiches, fresh fruit, baking, we provide all of that here,"" he said. ""That's just part of our goodwill to the community. ""It's also an opportunity to talk to our older community about making sure their vaccinations are up to date, whether they've had COVID, so it's a bit of a health talk as well."" Elder Joseph Munroe, who once played for the Bidyadanga men's side, enjoyed a sandwich as he watched the game from a fold-out chair under the shade of a tree. ""It [the team] is … the heart and soul for years, always will be, always was,"" he said. ""It's a nice feeling watching them play … really proud."" Mr Munroe was pleased to be back cheering from the sidelines on home soil after so many away games he couldn't attend during the pandemic. ""It was really hard for us not to travel to Broome, staying here in Bidyi, I was waiting until this COVID-19 went away to watch them play here on their home ground and in Broome,"" he said.

45,'We have no safety net': Blues coach Fittler defends seven changes for Origin II,sport," Sport NSW State of Origin coach Brad Fittler says he has to change tactics and personnel after loss to Queensland in game one NSW coach Brad Fittler has defended his decision to make seven changes to his Blues squad after the narrow loss in the State of Origin series opener, insisting he couldn't afford not to ""reassess"". Ryan Matterson, Kotoni Staggs, Reagan Campbell-Gillard and Tariq Sims have all been dropped from the 17 that lost 16-10 to Queensland, with Jack Wighton (COVID-19) the only forced change. Jacob Saifiti and Tyson Frizell are also out of the extended squad for Origin II, to be played in Perth on June 26. But Fittler said the only option after a defeat was to change tactics, especially when the three-match series was on the line. ""When you get beaten, you need to reassess,"" he said. ""We have no safety net at the moment. ""We went into the first game thinking a certain way about how the game would go and what we could do but it didn't happen."" Fittler has yet to name his 17 but confirmed Matt Burton and Stephen Crichton would form a new-look centre pairing. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter The duo has only one game of Origin experience between them — Crichton came off the bench in a lukewarm showing in Sydney. ""Jack Wighton obviously can't play and I just thought of Matt Burton, with the way he's playing (for the Bulldogs),"" Fittler said. ""What Crichton does with Penrith, he's a great defender."" Jake Trbojevic will return to the 17 for similar reasons. Jai Arrow will start on the bench for the Maroons as Billy Slater confirms fresh blood will replace the injured Xavier Coates. ""Just the way the game went in game one, I think we needed someone really defensively-minded,"" Fittler said of his decision to select the Manly middle forward. Fittler explained he had dropped Sims with one eye on the years ahead; Sims will be 33 in February and could choose to retire when his contract expires after 2023. ""He's done a fantastic job for NSW. We really appreciate what he's been doing but we're looking towards the future,"" Fittler said. Fittler has repeatedly stressed the importance of versatility to the Blues' set-up and said the inclusion of Sharks enforcer Siosifa Talakai and Roosters forward Angus Crichton would help cover all bases. ""(Talakai) started the season in the middle, played on an edge and also has played centre,"" Fittler said. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""He was unlucky not to make the first game. He's someone we've been watching and we've been very excited watching. ""(Angus Crichton) is playing really powerfully at the moment. There are different ways he can play, in the middle or on an edge, but I'm really happy with the way he's going."" Penrith hooker Api Koroisau looks set to start from the bench but Fittler said his selection did not mean the Blues had lost faith in incumbent number nine Damien Cook, who has been below his best in a hot-and-cold South Sydney outfit. ""That'll be a tactical change, going in with two hookers,"" Fittler said. ""Between (Cook) and (South Sydney teammate) Cam Murray, we've got a lot of confidence in them.

46,'Absolutely awesome stuff': Aussie Jack Miller provides unforgettable moment for MotoGP fan in Germany,sport," Sport Australian Jack Miller finishes third in the MotoGP then goes out of his way to hand a fan his gloves Australian Jack Miller has survived scorching conditions to claim third in the German MotoGP, before providing an unforgettable moment for a fan in the crowd. Reigning world champion Fabio Quartararo extended his lead in the overall standings by finishing first, while fellow Frenchman Johann Zarco finished second and Miller rounded out the podium. But it was moment after the race that left fans and commentators praising the Queenslander. Before the race started a fan was shown in the crowd with a poster that read ""Jack, wanna exchange gloves for a t-shirt?"" Miller was then filmed in the pits smiling at the camera and waving a glove. After the race had finished, Miller continued around to where the fan was sitting, and went off circuit to deliver his gloves to the appreciative spectator. And it happened after a gruelling race. ""It was probably one of the hardest races physically I've ever done,"" Miller said. Quartararo said he also battled through the race as he claimed back-to-back MotoGP wins after success at Catalan. ""I'm tired, I was sick most of the weekend and was coughing during the race, but I am super happy,"" he said. ""I am not thinking of the championship.

47,'I have wrestled long and hard with myself': Cate Campbell addresses FINA ahead of transgender athlete restriction decision,sport," Sport Cate Campbell uses speech to FINA to back restriction on transgender athletes in women's elite swimming Australian swimming champion Cate Campbell has addressed world swimming body FINA to offer her support for restricting transgender athletes from competing in elite women's competitions. FINA voted to restrict the participation of transgender athletes overnight, and to create a working group to establish an ""open"" category for those athletes, in some events, as part of its new policy. Campbell — a four-time Olympic gold medallist — joined former American swimmer Summer Sanders in addressing FINA before the decision was made. The 30-year-old said she had made the difficult decision to support the restriction, while still encouraging transgender athletes to be a part of the swimming community. ""We see you, value you and accept you,"" Campbell said. ""My role, however, is also to stand up here, having asked our world governing body, FINA, to investigate, deliberate and uphold the cornerstone of fairness in elite women's competition. ""And it pains me — that this part of my role — may injure, infuriate and, potentially, alienate people from an already marginalised [transgender] community. ""Believe me, I have wrestled long and hard with myself, with what to say and do. I am aware that my actions and words, no matter what I say, will anger some people — whether they are from the [transgender] community or from the cisgender female community."" Campbell — who moved to Australia from Malawi in 2001 as a nine-year-old — said she understood the importance that sport played in inclusion, but said fairness was a ""cornerstone"" of professional competition. ""If inclusion is one of the cornerstones of sport, then the other would be fairness, fairness in regards to competition, especially elite, professional competition,"" she said. ""The incongruity that inclusion and fairness cannot always work together is one of the reasons why it is so difficult to talk about this topic. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""Usually, they are terms of absolutes which work together, yet science now tells us that, in this issue, they are incompatible."" Fellow Australian swimmer Maddie Groves was critical of Campbell's comments, and asked if she was ""okay with ostracising an already maligned group"". ""There are already gender diverse people in swimming and I’m guessing they’re not feeling very accepted [right now],"" Groves said on Twitter. ""Shame on everyone that supported this discriminatory and unscientific decision."" FINA's decision — which is the strictest ruling from an Olympic sports body — states that male-to-female transgender athletes are eligible to compete, only if ""they can establish to FINA's comfortable satisfaction that they have not experienced any part of male puberty beyond Tanner Stage 2 [of puberty] or before age 12, whichever is later"". The policy was passed with a roughly 71 per cent majority after it was put to the members of 152 national federations with voting rights who had gathered for the congress at the Puskás Aréna in Budapest. In 2001 my family and I relocated from the small African country Malawi to Brisbane, Australia. A family of soon-to-be seven, we knew no-one and knew nothing about the city we would be calling home. Almost as soon as we had landed, my parents started looking for ways to integrate us into the Australian community. And that is how, at the age of nine — much to my consternation, for I had been enjoying the warmth of my bed — I found myself being taken to my first swimming club. It was there, in the bustling suburbs of Brisbane, that a shy, tall, freckly girl, with a strange South African accent and absolutely no fashion sense, found her place. A community to be a part of. People to help me understand the subtle nuances of talking ""Australian"" — that, when my coach said, ""See you this arvo"" he meant ""See you this afternoon"". I felt included, valued, seen for who I was, and accepted for it. Inclusion. This, I think, is one of the core principles underpinning sport — and is one of the gifts sports gives society. It creates a community, drawing people together, irrespective of background, race or religion, while also fighting the growing obesity and mental health epidemics. In Australia, it is estimated that 40 per cent or 11.1 million people aged over 15 participate in some type of community sport, while 62 per cent of children aged under 15 participate in community sport at least once per week. I am sure these numbers could be taken and extrapolated to many countries around the world. If inclusion is one of the cornerstones of sport, then the other would be fairness, fairness in regards to competition, especially elite, professional competition. Unlike in community or amateur sport, in elite sport, winning and losing goes hand in hand with politics, money and power. Creating a place where men and women can come up against the best of their contemporaries and battle it out — down to 100ths and 10ths of a second. This battle, this standing up and comparing of wills and physique is what draws people to watch sport — to see who can squeeze the very last ounce out of their bodies and minds and emerge victorious. Without fair competition, sport in its elite sense, would cease to exist. Usually, inclusion and fairness go hand in hand. To create a place that is inclusive, is to create a space that is fair. Transgender, gender-diverse and non-binary athletes' inclusion in the female category of elite sport, is one of the few occasions where these two principles come into conflict. The incongruity that inclusion and fairness cannot always work together is one of the reasons why it is so difficult to talk about this topic. Usually, they are terms of absolutes which work together, yet science now tells us, that in this issue, they are incompatible. I stand before you, as a four-time Olympian, a world champion and a world record holder. I stand before you, as a beneficiary of fair, elite competition. Yet my job today is not to explain the nuances of FINA's transgender policy. Nor is it to defend the conclusions reached by medical and legal professionals of much greater intellect than mine. My role is to stand before you, as an athlete who has enjoyed many, many years in this sport and who hopes to continue to enjoy a few more years. To stand here and tell the transgender and gender-diverse community that we want you to be part of the broader swimming community. We see you, value you and accept you. My role, however, is also to stand up here, having asked our world governing body, FINA, to investigate, deliberate and uphold the cornerstone of fairness in elite women's competition. And it pains me, that this part of my role may injure, infuriate and, potentially, alienate people from an already marginalised [transgender] community. Believe me, I have wrestled long and hard with myself, with what to say and do. I am aware that my actions and words, no matter what I say, will anger some people — whether they are from the [transgender] community or from the cisgender female community. However, I am asking everyone to take a breath, to absorb before reacting. Listen to the science and experts. Listen to the people who stand up here and tell you how difficult it has been to reconcile inclusion and fairness. That men and women are physiologically different cannot be disputed. We are only now beginning to explore and understand the origins of these physiological differences and the lasting effects of exposure to differing hormones. Women, who have fought long and hard to be included and seen as equals in sport, can only do so because of the gender category distinction. To remove that distinction would be to the detriment of female athletes everywhere. The creation of this policy did not stem from ""feelings"", what we ""felt"" was the right thing to do. The policy was created with the inclusion of medical professionals, legal professionals, athletes, coaches and people from the transgender community. It is a policy that pays attention to inclusion, but prioritises fairness. Ultimately, this not about winners and losers, it is about investigating and developing a policy which accurately represents the science and draws a line to protect the fairness of the female category distinction in elite sport. Not community sport, not amateur sport — elite, professional sport. I want the broader swimming community to be a place of safety and acceptance for the gender-diverse — and I call on all the federations sitting within this room to examine your own policies to ensure the world of swimming remains inclusive. It is my hope that young girls all around the world can continue to dream of becoming Olympic and World Champions in a female category prioritising the competitive cornerstone of fairness. However, it is also my hope that a young gender-diverse child can walk into a swimming club and feel the same level of acceptance that a nine-year-old immigrant kid from Africa did all those years ago.

48,Maroons confirm Origin debutant for game two as Jai Arrow starts on the bench,sport," Sport Maroons squad revealed for Origin game two as Murray Taulagi gets the call-up Queensland coach Billy Slater has kept faith with a winning side after the Maroons took the series lead with a 16-10 win in game one. Injuries to winger Xavier Coates and lock Reuben Cotter prompted the main changes to the squad, with Murray Taulagi coming in for Coates and while Tino Fa'asuamaleaui has moved into the number 13 jersey, and Lindsay Collins comes off the bench to fill the number eight spot. Jai Arrow will start on the bench. The announcement follows the decision by NSW coach Brad Fittler to make seven changes to his squad ahead of the must-win game for the Blues at Perth Stadium on Sunday. South Sydney forward Arrow's decision to invite a woman into the team's Gold Coast camp last year breached the NRL's strict COVID-19 protocols and prompted a fine and suspension from Origin III. However, new coach Slater absolved Arrow of his sins during a pre-series heart-to-heart and the 26-year-old is now poised to play the 10th game for his state. ""I wasn't involved last year. He's earnt it through his actions this year,"" Slater said. ""I've played with Jai. I know what he brings and he would have been disappointed not making the 17 in game one. ""It was impressive the way he handled it, but I didn't make [the decision not to pick him] to test him."" Brisbane winger Corey Oates and underrated Gold Coast backrower Beau Fermor have been added to the extended squad, while Reece Walsh replaced Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow (HIA).

49,England's Matt Fitzpatrick wins three-way battle for US Open golf crown,sport," Sport England's Matt Fitzpatrick wins the US Open at Brookline by one shot from Scottie Scheffler and Will Zalatoris English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick has broken through to win his first major title, holding his nerve to win the US Open by a single shot. On a dramatic final nine at Brookline, the lead chopped and changed between three main protagonists. The overnight leaders, England's Matt Fitzpatrick and American Will Zalatoris, were back and forth with world number one Scottie Scheffler, as no one could make the winning break. But the 15th proved the pivotal hole, as Zalatoris missed a long par putt and Fitzpatrick sank a long birdie putt to establish a two-shot buffer. The world number 18, who won the US Amateur title in 2013, held on to finish on 6-under, winning by a shot from Scheffler and Zalatoris. Before claiming the title, Fitzpatrick had one more big shot to play, as he drove into a fairway bunker on the 18th, apparently handing the advantage to his playing partner Zalatoris. However, he held his nerve and hit a brilliant recovery to land it 15 metres beyond the flag to let it run down. He just missed his birdie putt to seal victory, but Zalatoris' birdie putt to force a playoff barely slid by the hole. ""If I'm brutally honest, I hit a 3-wood into the fairway bunker (on 18) and if there's one shot I really haven't been good at, it's a fairway bunker shot. ""But then I hit one of the best shots I've hit, all-time."" The win was Fitzpatrick's first on the PGA Tour. ""It's what you grow up dreaming of,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""It's what I've worked for, for such a long time. To do it here for my first major title is so great."" The Englishman, only the fourth from his country to win the US Open in 100 years, said his patience was the key to victory. ""I said to Billy (caddie Billy Foster), if I hit 18 greens I think I've got a chance,"" said Fitzpatrick, who managed to hit 17 greens in regulation. ""I near as dammit did it (hit 18)."" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Scheffler and Zalatoris both finished on 5-under. Last year's Masters champion, Hideki Matsuyama, had the round of the day, charging into the top five with a 5-under 65 for a 3-under total of 277. But he was too far back to really threaten the top three. American Collin Morikawa shot a 4-under 66 to finish joint fifth alongside Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy on 2-under. Australia's Marc Leishman and Adam Scott finished together on 2-over, tied for 14th. Min Woo Lee shot a final round of 3-over to finish at 5-over, while Todd Sinnott ended the tournament a further shot back at 6-over.

50,"Kaylee McKeown drops her best event, wins silver in 200 IM at world titles",sport," Sport Australia's Kaylee McKeown wins a silver medal in women's 200m individual medley at world swimming titles Kaylee McKeown has grabbed Australia's second individual medal of the world swimming championships — a 200m medley silver — but only after a shock decision not to compete in her best event. Australians in finals on day two The triple Olympic champion caused a surprise in Budapest by ruling herself out of Sunday morning's preliminaries of the 100m backstroke, the event she dominated in Tokyo and the distance at which she holds the world record for that stroke. Because the semi-finals were taking place less than 20 minutes before the medley final later in the afternoon, McKeown took the decision to throw all her efforts into proving herself a global champion all-rounder. However, even though the 20-year-old had to give best to keep up with American star Alex Walsh, a dominant winner in 2 minutes 07.13 seconds, McKeown was adamant that the decision to go for the pressure-free, medley option had paid off. ""I wasn't really expecting to come up and podium tonight. It was more just getting the international experience,"" said the Queenslander, who was 1.44 seconds adrift of Walsh, clocking 2:08.57, but ahead of US bronze medallist Leah Hayes, who set a world junior record of 2:08.91. ""Sadly, I pulled out of this event at the Olympics to focus on the backstroke and this is the perfect refresher for the next three years — just taking the pressure off — and it was really good, mentally, for me,"" said McKeown. ""At the start of this year, I wasn't even sure if I'd be doing Worlds or Commonwealth Games because of my shoulder injury, so I'm really proud of myself that I've managed to get here and gather the momentum to get on the podium in my first event."" 400m freestyler Elijah Winnington and the women's 4x100m freestyle team give Australia a golden start at the world swimming championships in Budapest. Yet her decision not to compete in the 100m backstroke had seemed baffling when she had appeared one of the Dolphins' key bankers for gold. It's a busy week of action for McKeown, so her decision was also clearly taken with an eye to the future and ensuring she was not overly pressured. However, it might have been frustrating for the Redcliffe swimmer to see the qualifiers for the 100m backstroke final led by American Regan Smith's 57.65 — two-tenths of a second outside McKeown's landmark best. She was never really in the hunt for gold in the four-stroke event discipline, after being left trailing on the opening butterfly leg by Walsh and not eating into her lead as much as she had hoped with her powerful backstroke. McKeown had hoped to add to Australia's golden start, on Saturday, when both Elijah Winnington in the 400m freestyle and the women's 4x100m freestyle team both triumphed. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. However, Winnington has given himself another chance of a medal by qualifying for the 200m freestyle final as fifth-fastest (1:45.53). Olympic 200m breaststroke champ Zac Stubblety-Cook finished seventh in his weaker, 100m event, in 59.65, behind Italian winner Nicola Martinenghi (58.26). West Australian Brianna Throssell battled home sixth (56.98) in the women's 100m butterfly as 19-year-old Torri Huske took the gold for the US in 55.64, narrowly missing the world record. The international highlight of the day was multi-Olympic champion Caeleb Dressel winning the 50m butterfly, his second gold of the weekend after being part of the victorious 4x100m freestyle squad. Isaac Cooper and Mitch Larkin missed out on making the 100m backstroke final, finishing 12th and 13th on their semi-final times, while Jenna Strauch's strong finish couldn't get her into the women's 100m breaststroke showdown.

51,Sri Lanka produces record chase as Australians beaten in third ODI match,sport," Sport Sri Lanka beats Australia by six wickets in Colombo to take a 2-1 lead in the ODI series The Australian team insist they didn't err by going without a frontline leg-spinner after weathering a six-wicket defeat by a record-breaking Sri Lanka stand in Colombo. Australia looked in the box seat after Travis Head helped them to 6-291 on a slow wicket, before the hosts (4-292) were barely troubled completing their pursuit, with nine balls to spare, on Sunday. Pathum Nissanka hit his maiden ODI century, with 137 in the chase, while Kusal Mendis managed 87 in a 170-run second-wicket stand between the pair before retiring, hurt, with cramp. That helped Sri Lanka to their biggest-ever chase against Australia, as they went 2-1 up in the five-match series with back-to-back wins over the tourists for the first time in 20 years. However, beyond this bilateral series, bigger questions continue to remain around Australia's bowling structure ahead of next year's World Cup in India. With Adam Zampa back home on paternity leave, Australia decided not to play Mitchell Swepson. They were also not helped by a dewy surface, at night, after initially winning the toss and batting, as the pitch sped up and turned less in the second innings. Matthew Kuhnemann (0-61 from 10 overs) and Glenn Maxwell (1-44) were left as Australia's chief spinners, with Cameron Green (0-31 off five overs) preferred as a pace-bowling all-rounder ahead of Swepson. Where the Sri Lankans were able to get great purchase out of their wrist-spinner, Jeffrey Vanderlay, and his return of 3-49, the tourists were forced to turn to Marnus Labuschagne (0-49) for seven overs of leg breaks. ""You can always look back at a lot of decisions and wonder what was the right one,"" captain Aaron Finch said. ""We still felt that was the right combination to go for on this wicket with how slow it looked. ""You saw in the first half of the game it was very stoppy and turned quite a bit. We thought it would continue to do that but it played a bit better under lights."" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Swepson's absence also calls into question whether Australian officials will persist with him in the Test team as a second spinner to Nathan Lyon on turning wickets. Albeit in a different format, Swepson has now played just one of the first three ODIs, with Tanveer Sangha the only other real fit red-ball option on the tour. Pat Cummins was also rested in Sunday's loss, as Josh Hazlewood and Jhye Richardson bowled tightly but struggled to have pressure built around them. After Maxwell got the only early wicket of Niroshan Dickwella for 25, Hazlewood (1-57) and Richardson (2-39) caused the only other minor damage late. However, by then, the game was gone thanks to Nissanka. The right-hander was brilliant though, producing the shot of the innings when he advanced at Hazlewood and hit him over mid-wicket for six. He also slog-swept Maxwell for another big six and finished with 11 other boundaries before falling to Richardson with seven needed. Head had earlier continued his fine form with the bat, hitting an unbeaten 70 from 65 balls just a week after whacking a century for Australia A. With Steve Smith out and nursing a minor quad strain, Aaron Finch scored 62 and Alex Carey 49 as Australia had to grit and fight their way to a decent total.

52,Unusual crash sets up Verstappen win in F1 final lap showdown,sport," Sport Daniel Ricciardo 11th as Max Verstappen wins F1 Canadian Grand Prix Max Verstappen has extended his lead in the Formula 1 drivers' championship with a flawless performance in Canada. Australian Daniel Ricciardo finished 11th in his McLaren which did not show the same competitiveness as it did during qualifying. Verstappen survived a 16-lap sprint to the finish after a safety car was called when Yuki Tsunoda crashed his car coming out of the pit lane. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz finished second with Lewis Hamilton third in his Mercedes. A safety car on lap 49 of 70 when Tsunoda crashed coming out of the pits set up the exciting finish. Sainz was leading Verstappen, but the eventual race winner had made an extra stop and had fresher tyres. The safety car allowed Sainz to pit for new tyres, dropping him behind Verstappen but giving him the chance to hunt down the Dutchman for his first career F1 win. Despite having DRS (drag reduction system) down the straights, Sainz was never able to make the move on his rival, with his maiden win still elusive. Verstappen said the straight-line speed of his car was a major difference in those final laps, handing him his sixth victory of the season. ""I think overall they (Sainz) were very quick in the race, so it would have been really tough for me to close that gap to the end, even on fresher tyres,"" he said. ""It was really exciting at the end I was giving it everything I had. ""The last few laps were a lot of fun."" Verstappen's victory is the sixth consecutive race win for the Red Bull team. Ricciardo was unable to convert his ninth-place starting position into a points-finish during a tough race for McLaren. Despite looking competitive during the rain-affected qualifying, both McLaren cars struggled for pace in dry conditions. Ricciardo was in 10th late in the race but was overtaken by Aston Martin's Lance Stroll with five laps to go. McLaren teammate Lando Norris had a horror race in Canada, finishing 15th.

53,analysis: AFL Round-Up: Top-eight chaos as season sits perfectly poised for the run home,sport," Sport AFL Round-Up: Top-eight chaos as 2022 season sits perfectly poised for the run home It was a week of upsets and top-eight movement, setting the table for the home stretch of an enthralling season. Welcome to the Round-Up, where we digest the week that was. Of all of the three bye weeks, this one felt the most bye week-ish. The big dogs at the top of the ladder had a week off, so attentions were turned a little lower down. Luckily the goings on down there — and by that we mean from about fourth to 12th — is pretty compelling. In fact we've got one of the craziest finals races in recent memory brewing here. The big movers this week were Richmond, whose win over Carlton both went some way to re-establishing the old order and brought the Tigers back into flag consideration. Such is the evenness of this season across the board, Richmond's experience on the biggest stage and in the biggest games will become an asset. The same could be said for Geelong, who have once again quietly been sucked in by the gravitational pull of the top four. We've said all year there is likely to be one vacant spot in the top four and any number of teams capable of taking it. Right now, the smart money would be on one of Geelong or Richmond making it their own by the end of the season. Perhaps that is overreacting to one round, but it's hard to get too hyped about Sydney or St Kilda after their massively disappointing showings this weekend. Both were smacked by teams well below them on the ladder, mustering little fight and showing little resolve once their attacking instincts were headed off. The Swans in particular have been wildly unpredictable this year, their best just about untouchable and their worst barely worth registering. Collingwood, Gold Coast and the Western Bulldogs are lurking just outside that top eight now. Sporadic brilliance might not be enough to cut it in the race for the eight this year. We normally try not to get too ahead of ourselves in the Round-Up, but it's hard not to look at next week and not get excited. It's as if these three bye weeks were all just to set us up for round 15, when the 2022 season moves into its glorious home stretch with everything still up for grabs. Check out these fixtures: It's probably good that Richmond publicly told Shai Bolton off for his showboating, but internally I hope they were far less critical. He is a special player whose flair and showmanship should be protected at all costs. West Coast produced their best performance of the year this week, and Geelong one of their more timid. In a weird win-win, the Eagles would have been happy with their intent and performance and the Cats simply happy to get out of there with the points. We put a line through Port Adelaide last week here. Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. As long as there is a mathematical chance, any team with those key-position weapons can't be completely discounted. It was hard to know where to look during the Giants' and Bulldogs' 80s throwback game, but it was very easy to know where not to look. Cody Weightman's elbow. Returning to play after that might go some way to killing off some of the chatter around the young gun and ""the way he goes about it"". Good for Essendon. It would have been pretty easy to shut up shop in the third quarter after St Kilda basically erased the deficit in about five minutes, but to find the willingness to go again shows there is still something about this team. The Dons can really underline the point with a win over West Coast next week. Wil Powell's injury was the sort of one that can rattle teammates so thoroughly they struggle to see out the game. The Suns couldn't afford that and did well to finish the job. But holy cannoli, poor Wil Powell. Here we take stock of who is leading the race for the season's individual awards. A slow week in the Rising Star race with many of the frontrunners sitting out, but Nic Martin gave a timely reminder of his credentials. We've still got Nick Daicos in front for now, but it's going to be genuinely exciting to see which of the chief contenders — Daicos, Martin, Jai Newcombe and Sam De Koning — run away with this thing. Sam Draper can take home mark of the week honours with this solid entry. Not nearly enough to trouble Cam Zuurhar's lead though. Slim pickings on the goal front his week too, so we'll chuck it to Jack Billings for this one from the same game. Ed Langdon's grip on the GOTY title remains.

54,Giants advance to Super Netball preliminary final with win over Magpies,sport," Sport Giants advance to Super Netball preliminary final with win over Collingwood Magpies The Giants remain in the hunt for successive Super Netball grand final appearances after a strong second-half effort set up a 55-48 home elimination final win over Collingwood in Sydney. Trailing by three points at half-time and two inside the last two minutes of the third quarter on Sunday, the Giants hit three successive two-point shots to lead 43-39 at the final change. Collingwood got the deficit down to two, but goal shooter Jo Harten made five successive shots to swell the Giants buffer to seven. England stalwart Harten, who shot 40 from 44 including four of six Super Shots, was rock solid as was wing attack Maddie Hay. The Giants missed more shots than the Magpies but the home team hit six of nine Super Shots, while Collingwood netted just one of three. ""I think there's still so much to brush up on, we were a bit wasteful of our centre pass tonight, little errors, communication breakdowns really frustrated me, but it's really easily fixed,"" Harten said. The Giants, who lost last year's grand final to cross-town rivals NSW Swifts, now face a preliminary final next Saturday away to minor premiers Melbourne Vixens, who lost Saturday's major semi-final to West Coast Fever. ""They (Vixens) have threats all over the courts. I'm not going to pick a threat, they are a team I greatly admire,"" Giants coach Julie Fitzgerald said. The Giants, notched a 12th straight Super Netball win over Collingwood, who have lost all three of their elimination finals. Magpies coach Nicole Richardson was proud of her team's effort but was frustrated by some of the officiating in the second half, particularly four offensive contact calls against Collingwood in the circle. ""I was told the intensity of the game lifted in the second half so the umpiring had to change,"" Richardson said. ""I was super frustrated because what was allowed in the first half compared to the second was very different. ""In terms of where our year has been, they fought hard and I'm super excited and can't wait see what this group can do next year."" In a tight first quarter in the first finals match played at Sydney's Ken Rosewall Arena, neither team led by more than three with the Giants up 13-11 at the first change. The Magpies outscored the home team 17-12 in the second quarter to lead 28-25 at half-time. ""I thought we looked a little bit nervous in the second quarter, we were just a little bit tentative in everything we did trying to keep the ball. We didn't give it when we could,"" Fitzgerald said.

Matt Burton, Angus Crichton, Clint Gutherson, Jordan McLean, Victor Radley, Siosifa Talakai and Jake Trbojevic all come in to the 22-man squad. Burton, McLean, Radley, Talakai, Joseph Suaalii and Nicho Hynes are in line for possible debuts.

Canterbury's Burton is in contention to play left centre in place of Staggs but there is no place for fellow Bulldog Josh Addo-Carr, who has scored five tries in the three games since being snubbed for Origin I. Api Koroisau will likely come off the bench to assist Rabbitohs hooker Damien Cook, who was oddly quiet in the Game I defeat after being a non-playing squad member for Game I. Fittler resisted the urge to parachute in returning South Sydney star Latrell Mitchell, who is yet to play in the NRL since suffering a hamstring tear in April and then testing positive for COVID.

56,'Not just a game': Every week the Daly River Buffaloes travel eight hours for footy. This weekend they played on home soil,sport,"  Daly River Buffaloes' only home game lifts community spirits with art and footy festival In the vast outback of the Northern Territory, the tyranny of distance takes on a new meaning — but when it comes to footy, nowhere is too far. It was a twist of fate, and a last-minute call that saw the Daly River Buffaloes rise to the challenge of the Big Rivers Football league — a major step up for the local footy team. ""One of the other senior sides in the Big Rivers Football League in Katherine pulled out,"" the team's president John Bonson said. ""We got a phone call basically saying if you're interested, can you get sponsors, can you commit every weekend and possibly be in the competition for the next 10 years? ""We just jumped at the chance."" It's been no easy feat to get from the tiny remote community of Nauiyu, set on the banks of the Daly River, to Katherine. Every weekend the team hustles onto a bus at the crack of dawn for the eight-hour round trip, navigating twisting roads, flat tyres, and wild buffaloes big enough to stop a car in its tracks. But on Saturday, the team played its one and only fixture on home soil. And hundreds of people came to watch. ""This isn't just a game. This is like a grand final,"" Mr Bonson said. The goals flowed in a blistering contest, with the Buffaloes keeping up the pressure as they took on the Katherine Camels. Spectators came from hundreds of kilometres away and screamed their support from the sideline. It was the first time the community had welcomed visitors in big numbers since the start of the pandemic, and emotions were high. ""We were locked down for nearly two and a half years and it was scary,"" community leader Dr Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr Baumann AM said. ""When I heard the boys were having a home game I spoke to the art centre and I said 'Hey, why don't we combine with the boys?' The idea sparked the community's inaugural Art and Footy day, and for Dr Ungunmerr Baumann watching her team for the first time was galvanising. She said she hoped the weekend's event would be the first of many. ""You could almost feel everybody's heartbeat going with the excitement, whether it was a goal or a behind they still cheered them on … and I'll tell you, they can scream,"" Dr Ungunmerr Baumann said. Growing the home game into a mainstay on the NT calendar was a sentiment shared by Labor member for Daly, Dheran Young. ""Something I've always pictured is this [event] to be even bigger and better than the Tiwi Islands Grand Final,"" he said. ""I don't want to speak too soon but Daly River is only two hours from Darwin."" In round two of the Big Rivers Football League, the Buffaloes lost by two points to the Katherine Camels in a close contest. But this week they were looking for the win. ""We got skill, we got speed … some really formidable footballers, but it's more than just football,"" Mr Bonson said. ""Football and sport in the community is a great vehicle, it's not just about the game and it's not just about reaching the summit. It's the journey along the way. ""Around here since we got into the league the energy and spirit has just lifted so much … it far outweighs any negatives."" After a tough game, that saw the Katherine Camels maintain the upper hand right through to the last quarter, the Katherine team secured a victory, winning 16 goals to 10.

58,Gruesome injury to Powell mars crucial Suns win over Crows,sport," Sport Gold Coast Suns beat Adelaide by 43 points as gruesome injury to Wil Powell mars crucial win Gold Coast have overcome the loss of Wil Powell to a horrific leg injury, beating Adelaide by 43 points in a boost for their AFL finals hopes. The Suns triumphed 18.8 (116) to 10.13 (73) at Carrara Stadium on Sunday to move within one win of the top eight. But celebrations were tempered after Powell was dragged down in an attempted tackle by Adelaide's Ned McHenry during the third quarter and immediately grabbed at his lower right leg. McHenry called for medical assistance and broadcast vision showed what appeared to be a break above Powell's right ankle, with his foot at an awkward angle. Play was held up for more than five minutes while medical staff attended to Powell on the field before he was driven away on a medi-cab. The vision was so gruesome that the television broadcaster opted not to show a replay. ""Wil's such a good clubman and brings such good energy to our footy club and we love him,"" Suns co-captain Jarrod Witts told Fox Footy. ""Hopefully it's not too bad but it didn't look too good. ""We probably lulled there for a bit after the injury but we were able to get it back on our terms."" Gold Coast led by 29 points when Powell went down. They also lost Connor Budarick to a hamstring injury, while Adelaide's Riley Thilthorpe was substituted out with an ankle injury soon after the restart. Goals to Taylor Walker and substitute Lachlan Murphy helped Adelaide close to within 20 points by three-quarter time. But the Suns held off their opponents and kicked away with eight goals in the final term to post a third consecutive win, their fifth in six games. Mabior Chol, Izak Rankine, Ben Ainsworth and Levi Casboult kicked three goals each as Gold Coast compiled a triple-figure score for a third straight outing. Rankine also had two goal assists and 10 score involvements in an unselfish display. Matt Rowell (19 disposals, seven clearances), Noah Anderson (27, five) and Touk Miller (24, three) fought hard for the Suns in the middle. Adelaide's Rory Laird (42 disposals, five clearances), Matt Crouch (31, seven) and Sam Berry (25, 12) all tried to lift the visitors over the line and Darcy Fogarty kicked two goals. After trailing by six points at quarter-time, the Suns took control with a six-goal second term. Chol kicked two quick goals to spark the run and two for Holman at the start of the third quarter extended the home side's dominance. At that stage they had kicked eight of nine goals. The Powell and Budarick injuries threatened to derail the Suns but they resisted the Crows' attempts at a fightback, dominating the final term.

59,Bulldogs record six-year first in rout of Wests Tigers,sport," Sport Canterbury Bulldogs beat Wests Tigers, Canberra Raiders survive dogged Newcastle Knights fightback The Bulldogs have backed up last week's stunning victory over the Eels by hammering the Wests Tigers 36-12 The Bulldogs dominated possession on their way to a six tries to one victory that saw the Dogs notch 30 points or more in consecutive games for the first time in six years. It is the first time that the Bulldogs have won consecutive NRL matches in a single campaign since round 22 and 23 of the 2019 season — a 59-match run. ""That was the talk the whole week,"" Matt Burton told ABC Grandstand of the importance of backing up from Monday's victory. ""We played well last week but the biggest thing was coming here today and doing it all again. ""I'm really proud of the boys."" Jeremy Marshall-King burrowed over from dummy half to open the scoring for the Bulldogs before a Josh Addo-Carr misread in defence gave the prolific David Nofoaluma an extra inch of space to collect a cross-field kick and burrow over in the corner to level the scores. Jake Averillo scored either side of half time to help the Dogs to a lead that would never seriously be threatened for the remainder of the match, much to the delight of their increasingly thrilled supporters. Lebanon international Jacob Kiraz, who provided an inadvertent assist for Averillo's second, crossed himself soon after as the Dogs opened up the left edge defence. Kurtis Morrin was sent through to score on debut after some more slack defence from the Tigers, who were bereft of possession for long periods. When they did come within a outstretched arm of scoring, Aaron Schoupp intercepted and went the length of the field to score another. Paul Vaughan was sent to the bin in the closing minutes, allowing James Tamou the space to dart through and score a late consolation for the sorry Tigers, who fell to a third successive defeat. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Addo-Carr and Burton both threatened at times, the former running for 161 metres and an assist for Morrin's try. Burton kicked six-from-six off the tee as well as sending a number of teasing bombs up out of hand. The Tigers day started badly, losing Alex Twal inside the opening 90 seconds after he was left reeling following contact with Burton. Burton's arm appeared to land on Twal's neck as the pair fell to the ground following the kick at the completion of the Dogs' first set, precipitating a lengthy delay as the medicart was called. Twal was later seen smiling in the sheds but played no further role in the contest. Hudson Young's last-minute solo try saved Canberra's blushes as the Raiders held off the Knights to record a dramatic 20-18 victory. With the Raiders out of interchange options due to injury and James Schiller nursing a collarbone injury in back play, Young spotted Kalyn Ponga out of position on the third tackle to nudge a kick in behind the line and cross under the posts. ""I thought it was gunna get away from us,"" Young told ABC Sport after the game. ""[I] dunno why I kicked it, but I did."" Young was more certain when talking to Fox Sports though, saying the move had its inception during the week. ""I seen him [Ponga] on the short side and I actually told one of our coaches I was gunna try and do that this week, so [I'm] happy I pulled it off,"" he said. ""I just play off-the-cuff footy and I'm loving my time at the moment."" The Raiders were trailing by four at the time after the Knights produced a stunning comeback from 14-0 down to lead 14-18 with time running out. The Raiders had run in three unanswered tries in 14 first-half minutes through Nick Cotric, Matthew Timoko and Xavier Savage. But the Knights, who were easily second-best in the opening 40, struck back through Nick Cotric just before half time, sparking a dramatic comeback that bought them within two minutes of a remarkable win. With Ponga visibly distressed with a stomach complaint, the Knights were long odds to peg the Raiders back. However, a late shot on Ponga from Elliott Whitehead that saw the Englishman sent to the bin and placed on report gave the Knights the impetus to run over the top of their hosts. Mat Croker crossed in the next play with the Raiders down to 12, followed shortly after by Edrick Lee to put the Knights ahead by two. Lee thought he had a second with nine minutes remaining after Xavier Savage's attempt to keep a 40/20 attempt in play backfired. However, the Raiders were given a huge let off when the Bunker correctly ruled that Croker knocked on when challenging Savage for the ball. That decision proved crucial when Young bounced out of one tackle before grubbering through to himself to hand Jamal Fogarty a simple conversion in front of the posts to save the Raiders' blushes.

60,Min Woo Lee faces tough challenge as lead Aussie at US Open,sport," Sport Will Zalatoris, Matt Fitzpatrick hold third-round lead at US Open, Min Woo Lee the best-placed Australian six shots back Two weeks after his sister Minjee Lee won the US Women's Open at Pine Needles, Min Woo Lee emerged as the leading Australian at the men's edition in Massachusetts. Selected scores after round three However, the 24-year-old has little hope of pulling off a unique family double after a fine third-round of 1-under-par 69 left Lee on 2-over, six shots off the pace. On a day where most players went backwards at Brookline, Min Woo Lee was one of just seven players to finish under par for the third round. The Perth star took another big stride towards confirming himself as Australia's next big thing in men's golf with a steely display in typically tough US Open conditions. Sharing 17th spot on his US Open debut, Lee will enter Sunday's final round with a shot of bettering his tie for 14th at his maiden Masters in April. The best round of the day came from Will Zalatoris, who shot a 3-under 67. Zalatoris picked up three birdies and a bogey on the front nine, then held steady on the way home, adding another birdie on the par-4 15th to finish the day on 4-under. Also on 4-under was England's Matt Fitzpatrick, who had a 2-under 68. Spanish star Jon Rahm looked set to take the lead heading into the final round, but he ran into trouble on the par-4 18th. After landing in a bunker on the left side of the fairway, Rahm's next shot hit the lip of the bunker and came back, requiring another iron shot to get clear. He finished with a double-bogey six on the final hole, for a round of 1-over 71, to sit one shot back from the leaders on 3-under. The course was playing tough — overnight joint leaders Collin Morikawa and fellow American Joel Dahmen both fell away in the third round. Morikawa had a horror day, with a 7-over 77, while Dahmen shot a 4-over 74 to be three shots from the lead. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. World number one Scottie Scheffler shot to the outright lead at 6-under for the championship midway through his third round, before losing five shots in four holes on the back nine to finish at 2-under. Veterans Adam Scott and Marc Leishman are the next best Australians after Min Woo Lee, sitting in a tie for 45th at 4-over. Scott carded a 2-over 74, with Leishman posting a 75. After a golden start to his round, Todd Sinnott finished at 6-over following a 76. The qualifier opened with two birdies in the first five holes to claw his way back to level with the card, but racked up three bogeys and a double on the back nine.

61,"Two golds for Australia on day one of swimming world titles, while Katie Ledecky wins 400m free",sport," Sport Australia's Elijah Winnington, women's 4x100m freestyle relay win gold on day one of world swimming titles Elijah Winnington has powered to his first global gold while the all-conquering 4x100m women's relay team won again, to give Australia the perfect flying start to the world swimming championships. Australians in finals - day 1 Winnington earned redemption after his Olympic disappointment, speeding to an emphatic victory in the 400m freestyle, the first final of the entire, week-long program in Budapest, on Saturday. Inspired by his lead, sprint freestylers Mollie O'Callaghan, Madi Wilson, Meg Harris and Shayna Jack maintained Australia's recent dominance in the event, winning the last race of the day with the fifth fastest time in history, 3 minutes 30.95 seconds. A superb launch pad for the Dolphins also saw Kyle Chalmers deliver an anchor leg masterpiece in the men's 4x100m, enabling his teammates William Yang, Matthew Temple and Jack Cartwright to celebrate the most unlikely silver behind a dominant US quartet. The 22-year-old Gold Coast freestyler Winnington kicked it all off after the opening ceremony, swimming the race of his life and even flirting with the world record for much of his 400m final. He eventually settled for a new, lifetime best of 3:41.22 as he demolished the field at the Duna Arena in the Hungarian capital by more than one-and-a-half seconds and became the fifth fastest, ever, at the distance. Ian Thorpe is the only Australian to have gone quicker than his mark, which was the fastest in the world this year. ""It's incredible. I was really relaxed. I'm just trying to enjoy this experience and that definitely helps,"" the ecstatic Winnington said. ""In the last call room, I've heard the noise, the MC's voice and it was a total boost for me. ""I haven't had this feeling for a long time."" Last year, Winnington — who's suffered from nerves before — was left crestfallen after going into the Olympics with high hopes but finishing only seventh in the final. This time, he set off operating inside German world record holder Paul Biedermann's mark of 3:40.07 set 13 years ago, admitting afterwards he hadn't realised that. Meanwhile, 2016 Olympic champ Mack Horton just missed out on making the final from the morning prelims but Winnington took it to top-ranked German, Lukas Martens (3:42.85), from the start. Winnington led through the first half of the race before Martens controlled the next two lengths, which only prompted a blistering finish from the Aussie who powered down the final stretch in just 26.5 seconds while the German faded badly. Even without three of the quartet who blitzed the world record en route to Olympic gold in Tokyo, the 4x100 women were way too good for the rest, with O'Callaghan (52.70sec), Wilson (52.60), Harris (53.00) and Jack finishing with 52.65 on her global return after a two-year doping ban. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. In the equivalent men's event, Chalmers, the Rio Olympic champ, recorded the seventh-fastest 100m relay leg ever as he picked up more than a second on the last leg to edge out Italian Lorenzo Zazzeri and snatch the silver by just 0.15 seconds. And in the women's 400m, Australian Lani Pallister was just 0.08 seconds outside a medal in fourth, as Katie Ledecky reclaimed her crown but failed to grab back her world record off Ariarne Titmus. In the absence of Australian Titmus — who pipped the great freestyler to the title in 2019 and took her world record in 3:56.40 last month — the American legend clocked 3:58.15 for her fourth world 400m free title. Wollongong's Brendon Smith was fifth in the 400m IM (4:11.36), which was won by the brilliant French all-rounder Leon Marchand, who threatened Michael Phelps' venerable world record of 4:03.84 before settling for the second-fastest time ever (4:04.28).

62,Nick Kyrgios loses battle of the big servers to miss German grasscourt final,sport," Sport Nick Kyrgios's Wimbledon preparation continues, losing Halle grasscourt semi-final to Poland's Hubert Hurkacz Nick Kyrgios has found himself upstaged in a battle of the monster servers as Hubert Hurkacz ruined the Australian's hopes of reaching a first grass-court final in Halle. Kyrgios — in such brilliant form all week at the German event that he fancied his maiden final on the green stuff was firmly on the cards — met his match in an almost inevitable tie-break decider in Saturday's semi-final, losing 6-4, 6-7 (7/2), 6-7 (7/4) to Hurkacz. It was a grievous disappointment for the 27-year-old but there was definitely enough in Kyrgios's big week to encourage him, with Wimbledon a little more than a week away. The Australian was quite brilliant behind his own serve, unbroken and having given up just two break points the whole match. However, ultimately, he was beaten at his own game as Hurkacz pounded down 27 aces, the most he's ever delivered in any match. So Kyrgios, who was even more prolific, with 30 aces, couldn't capitalise on his first-set domination, when he was the more aggressive and ambitious of the pair. Neither player was troubled on their own delivery until the ninth game of the opener when two brilliant forehand winners helped Kyrgios land what was to be the only break of the match to go 5-4 ahead. He sealed the deal with two aces in the following game but, from then on, he never really threatened Hurkacz on serve as the Polish world number 12 began to grow in confidence. With some inevitability, it all came down to one final tie-break shoot-out, with Hurkacz earning the crucial mini-break as Kyrgios failed to deal with a floated deep service return. ""One or two shots was the difference,"" Hurkacz conceded. ""Definitely super close. Nick played a really, really great match. He's a great player, so it was definitely a super tough one."" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Kyrgios, on his debut at the German venue, was deprived of a chance of playing world number one Daniil Medvedev in Sunday's final, after the Russian survived a set point in the first stanza before beating German hope Oscar Otte 7-6 (7/3), 6-3. However, although there was one flashpoint with Kyrgios — he picked up a warning for ball abuse after he smashed one high, wide and out of the arena in a moment of frustration — this will be a week he can look back on with real satisfaction. For the man who reckons that he's a top-five player on grass courts really did indeed look like one for much of the week and he will go on to one final Wimbledon warm-up tournament in Mallorca next week, believing he's on course for perhaps his best week at SW19. One thing is for sure — nobody, as Hurkacz intimated, will want to meet this dangerous floater in the main draw of a grand slam event in which he's previously reached one quarter-final and the last 16 on two other occasions.

63,'That gets me off the couch': Women want to see themselves reflected in coverage of sport and physical activity,sport," Sport From nuns to mums, weekend warriors to world champions, fitness fanatics to fanatical fans — women in sport want wider coverage Four nuns are playing football on a synthetic pitch, on a rooftop in Rome. Dressed in habits, they're having a fun kickaround, playing like nobody's watching (or covertly filming from afar). On a tight angle, one nun slots in a neat right-footer, and celebrates with her arms raised. Later, another nun loses a shoe when she kicks the ball, but like a true competitor it doesn't stop her from pushing on. The video quickly spread around the world, celebrating a group of women we don't normally see engaging in sport and physical activity. But for Rana Hussain, it wasn't a novelty at all — it made her feel seen. ""That image gets me up off the couch more than anything else, images of women that I can relate to,"" the diversity and inclusion leader and member of the Outer Sanctum podcast said. ""And, for me, a hijab-wearing woman, footage of covered nuns playing sport is so relatable. ""That's how I play sport. That's how I go to the gym. I wear loose fitting clothes. I cover my hair and, to see them do it, makes me feel like I can do it too."" For Hussain, and so many women like her, seeing themselves reflected is something they're desperate to see. So, when we look at women in sport, who are we seeing? Yes, there are the powerhouse world-beaters such as Sam Kerr, Ash Barty and the Australian women's cricket team who have become absolute fixtures on our sporting scene. But what happens when we dig a little deeper? Getty Images has one of the world's largest creative and editorial picture databases, and it has gathered what it calls ""visual GPS data"" around women in sport. Using internal search data, insights from visual experts, and market research, it has uncovered the current state of play when it comes to the visual representation of women in sport, and what audiences want. It has found there is significant coverage of sportswomen around major events such as the Olympics, but it dramatically drops to 7 per cent visibility in the media outside of these times. And it's worse for those from diverse and under-represented backgrounds. Kate Rourke is the head of creative insights, Asia Pacific at Getty Images and iStock. She says that Getty's customers, including media outlets, advertisers and brands, use less than 1 per cent of people with a disability in their visuals. LGBT+ women and non-binary people also represent less than 1 per cent, and less than 4 per cent are people from ethnically diverse backgrounds. ""We are predominantly seeing Gen Z being visualised in sport, 95 per cent have slim bodies, and then a further 70 per cent are of white ethnicity,"" Ms Rourke said. A Griffith University study looking at the media representations of women at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games found outlets promoted images of ""white women celebrating and smiling"", and ""whiteness and normative femininity were presented as 'natural' and 'neutral'."" It also found that ""there was a recurrent representation of successful sportswomen as predominantly able-bodied, young, white, and conforming mostly to traditional understandings of femininity (i.e., smiling, heterosexual, in passive poses, wearing makeup and jewellery)."" That resonates with Hussain. ""I feel like women in sport in Australia is still very much a particular group of women, and it's just not reflective of how many of us do love sport and play sport,"" she said. ""And I think part of that is just because, naturally, our focus is on the elite games, and the people [who] are making it through to elite sport aren't yet representative of our population."" Ali Tucker-Munro can also relate. She's a proud Kamilaroi woman, and the head coach of the GWS Giants Netball Academy. ""I think we've got to really be playing a part in the media of breaking down this stereotype of what an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person looks like in this country,"" she said. ""Our cultural identity is really complex for a range of reasons. [It's] obviously been influenced by past government policies around assimilation. ""I heard a story of a player being questioned about her cultural identity, because of the colour of her skin, like, 'You can't have experienced racism'."" ""Always having one player interviewed all the time, because of the colour of their skin, it shouldn't diminish or devalue another person's experience as well. ""When we talk about interviewing and portraying First Nations female athletes, [it's about] giving that broad breadth. So what role can media and profiling our First Nations women play in helping people educate and inform people around that?"" Paralympian Eliza Stankovic-Mowle says it's essential to showcase people from all backgrounds, including people with disability. ""If it's not there, and you can't see it, it doesn't exist, does it?,"" she noted. ""So, the more we see it, the more it becomes mainstream, then the more we all just accept it, and it's seen for its beauty. Bank robber Russell Manser was destined for a life in prison before he discovered a new path by confronting his hidden trauma. Now he’s working to help others seek justice for crimes long buried. ""[For] young people, seeing people with disability in all walks of life, doing incredible things, it really just gives them the hope and the dream that they can be whatever they choose to be. ""Because, quite often, unfortunately, people with disabilities are still told that they can't. And, unless they see it, they believe they can't."" Ms Rourke also says that, while media outlets and advertisers do want to be more inclusive, there are underlying unconscious biases. ""We need to become much more aware of what those biases are, so that, when we are selecting content, or when we are going to be showing different female athletes, we are making sure that we are checking in on those biases,"" she said. It's pretty simple: Women want to see people like them. Ms Rourke says their research showed women mainly encountered bias due to body shape, age, gender and ethnicity. ""They want to see females of different body types, engaging in sport in some way,"" she said. ""We found with the image testing that we did, that women in Australia and New Zealand were twice more likely to respond to all different body types, they were likely to choose more different ethnic diversity from the visuals, and very much that social bonding, friendship groups engaging in sport is what they responded to. ""But, interestingly, the other thing they wanted to see was all ages engaging in sports. And then they also wanted to see all genders engaging in sports. ""And, if we want to encourage more participation, we want to encourage much more inclusion, then the way forward is to do that in terms of including this much more broadly."" Ms Rourke says one of the key parts of the research was breaking stereotypes around people with disability. ""One of the biases that we often see is this idea of either trying to show them very heroically, almost trying to overcome the disability that they might have,"" she said. ""When, in fact, all of our research is showing that they just want to be seen in every day [situations]. It is not about overcoming a disability. They live with disability."" ""I'm not just one thing. I'm so many different things. And that's what makes me proud to be me,"" Stankovic-Mowle said. ""So, I would like to think that I'm seen by the media as a woman, firstly, with a disability, but who is a mother, who is a sportsperson, who also has a career. And, first and foremost, who is happy, and I prioritise my physical and mental health. ""Showing that a life with a disability is just as incredible as anyone else's life, if not more incredible, because sometimes we get so many more opportunities and experiences that perhaps people without a disability don't have."" Non-binary Paralympian Robyn Lambird agrees media and advertisers can play a huge role in dismantling stereotypes and creating a more inclusive society. It's believed Lambird was the first adult with a visible disability to model in a national advertising campaign for a major Australian retailer, when they featured in a campaign for Target in 2016. And they were also the first 'out' non-binary athlete to win a Paralympic medal. ""In terms of marketing, and things like that, it's so subconscious, and we absorb so much from that,"" Lambird said. ""We create a picture of what our world looks like and the people involved in it. So, I think, disabled people need to be included in that. ""I don't think, as a brand, you can say that you're being diverse or inclusive if you aren't including people with disabilities. ""It's great to see how far we've come — in terms of body image and celebrating different body shapes and sizes — and I think it's just the next step."" And it's not just about celebrating those athletes who make it to the top — as they are still a very select few. ""If we only focus on elite sport, we will then just keep replicating the same kind of structures and power dynamics that do exclude a whole bunch of people,"" Hussain said. ""So, hand in hand with more coverage of women's elite sport, I want representation and visibility of community sport. ""And it's hard, because that's not always the sexy story or the interesting story that will necessarily get eyeballs. ""But I think there's a way to do it, with real authenticity of telling everyday stories and up and comers. I think, as brands and as storytellers, if we represent the whole picture, we'll build the whole pie for everybody and slowly bring everyone along."" Tucker-Munro wants to see greater awareness of the challenges Indigenous women face in being able to play sport, and for them to receive as much support and investment as men. ""In First Nations culture, and I'm talking obviously from my own lived experiences, a lot of our girls have kinship, caring responsibilities,"" she said. ""And oftentimes, it's them that actually have to play second fiddle to the brother, or whoever else in the family's got rugby league on Sunday. There's almost this overlooking [of] female athlete opportunities. ""And it's not about diminishing or devaluing our amazing Aboriginal men who were playing really well in sport. ""But it's about how do we broaden the narrative to really capture the added complexity and challenges for our female athletes, particularly in regional and rural centres. That's the gap"" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Lambird also wants greater awareness of athletes with a disability on a more consistent basis. ""It's not good enough to see disabled sports once every four years at the Paralympics. We need to be seeing it throughout the year so people can get to know these athletes and get to understand the games,"" they said. ""It's so important to see, not only sportspeople with a disability, but [also] people with a disability in all walks of life and what they can do,"" Stankovic-Mowle added. Whether they're nuns or mums, weekend warriors or world champions, fitness fanatics or fanatical fans, women in sport no longer want to be sidelined — they're ready to see themselves in the spotlight, in all their different forms.

64,"Meet the Adelaide Armpits, the 'ratbag lesbian feminists' who were pioneers of Australian sport",sport,"  'A bunch of ratbag, lesbian feminists': The coming-out story of the Adelaide Armpits, Australia's first LGBTQIA+ football club Truffy Maginnis was sitting at a bus stop in Fremantle in 1981 when her life changed forever. Born and raised in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles, Maginnis always suspected the world had something different in store for her. She'd felt that way ever since she was young, particularly after falling madly in love with Chrissy, a girl who was twice her age. However — surrounded by a strict, devout Catholic family, at a time when religion was tangled up in the decades-long conflict sweeping across the country — Maginnis knew she had to keep that part of herself hidden. In 1978, when she was old enough to support herself, she relocated to London, lured by the city's cosmopolitanism, its feminist activism and its blossoming LGBTQIA+ community. She started going to bars and clubs, community halls and social gatherings, trying to meet women who were just like her. As soon as she opened her mouth, though, her tumbling, curling accent would give away where she was from and many women would hesitate to engage or avoid her entirely. But there was one group who didn't care: a brassy band of loud Australians she met out in town one rollicking night. They immediately took Maginnis under their wing, inviting her to visit them back home in Western Australia. That's how she ended up sitting at a Fremantle bus stop on a warm morning in 1981. Because that's when a car pulled up right in front of her, and Pat — a well-known lesbian from Perth — rolled down the window. ""You waiting for a bus?"" Pat asked, leaning casually over the frame of the door. ""Yes,"" Maginnis replied. Pat looked up and down the road: ""They don't come 'round here,"" she said. She glanced back at the pale Irishwoman sitting quietly on the metal seat. ""Where do you want to go? We'll give you a lift."" After Maginnis shuffled into the car, Pat asked: ""Are you here for the women's festival?"" ""No, but I've seen the posters."" ""Well, we'll take you there."" It was the chance encounter that set her life on a totally different course. ""Suddenly, being Irish was a boon,"" Maginnis, now in her mid-60s, told ABC. ""Being Irish in Australia, everybody loved me. ""And because Pat brought me in — and she was an important person in the lesbian community in Perth — I was 'in' from then. I just soared. ""It was the most glorious experience because I'd never felt like I fit in anywhere before. ""It was extraordinary, that sliding-doors moment. If I hadn't been at that bus stop, I wouldn't have met these women, and we wouldn't have started the Armpits."" Alongside other women, football was the other love of Maginnis' young life. Growing up, girls couldn't play organised football in Northern Ireland. Instead, they were ushered into hockey and camogie (an all-women version of hurling), which were deemed more suitable sports for ""ladies"". Maginnis never gave up, though. She played football on her own in local parks or with her brothers and all the village lads on weekends. She'd stay outside until the sky grew dark and slept with the scuffed ball in her arms at night. It wasn't until she left Perth for Adelaide in her mid-20s and a friend, Anne Francis, asked if she wanted to start a team, that Maginnis realised women could actually play football in organised competitions. ""We met at the Exeter pub,"" Maginnis recalled. ""When we got there, Anne had already gone to the association and got all the paperwork. For me, it was so exciting. I already knew some of the women there, but others were unknown to me. ""In those days, Anne would have identified as a 'lesbian feminist', and so wanted to play sport in a way that wasn't about having to be the best or having to win, but to be able to be safe as a lesbian playing in a sports team."" And so, the Adelaide Armpits — Australia's first LGBTQIA+ football club — was born. ""If you rocked up, you got a game,"" Maginnis said of the early years. ""You didn't have to be a good player. There was only me and one other woman who'd ever played football before, Roxy. So that's how it started. ""1982 was our first season, and we thought we'd just play for a couple of years and have a laugh and that'll be the end. But the Armpits actually went for over 30 years in South Australian competitions. ""And the women who came to play … some were sporty like me. Others weren't, but they just wanted to have a safe space. So there was a real consciousness that we were representing something that was not seen around the place."" The Armpits developed a reputation almost immediately. Their uniform was a mish-mash of shirts that they dyed themselves in various shades of purple. Their team name was an allusion to the radical, separatist second-wave feminist movement flourishing across Australia in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They didn't care about winning games and would applaud opposition teams for scoring against them. There were no coaches, no captains and no hierarchies. They were, as Maginnis described, ""a bunch of ratbag lesbian feminists"". While they began as an all-lesbian team, they eventually welcomed any woman who wanted to join — some of whom had been struggling in secret with their own sexuality but had no space to be themselves. ""I certainly had conversations with women after they'd been in the team for a while who said, 'You know, I just felt like I'd come home when I came into the Armpits',"" Maginnis said. ""And that's very moving. It softens your heart. The team became a place where women could feel like they were at home. Where they went back to maybe wasn't like that, but when they came to play with us on a Sunday or came to training, it felt like a home for them. A family for them. And we were. ""That was the hope. When we met that day at the pub, that's what we talked about. We wanted this to be a place that women who identified as lesbians, or who didn't mind being assumed to be lesbians, could come and play. ""You don't have to be good to play sport. You just have to find somewhere where you'll be welcomed and can belong. ""From the beginning, it was an expression of lesbian culture in a different sort of way. It wasn't about playing pool at the pub or going to bars — those safe social spaces for lesbians at the time. ""This was something else. People were intrigued by us."" One of the women who eventually joined the Armpits was Jill Latimer, who represented the Matildas in the late 1980s. Latimer played for the Adelaide University team alongside former national team vice-captain Moya Dodd, and like everybody else in South Australian football, knew who the Armpits were from the start. Maginnis recalls a young, shy Latimer coming along to watch them play in the early days, hiding behind some nearby trees so she wouldn't be seen. ""She knew her sexuality, but it wasn't possible for her to be out,"" Maginnis said. ""She'd come and watch us and think, 'Maybe this is possible for me.' ""Over the years, we heard that. The Armpits seemed to represent something to other same-sex-attracted women about what was possible when it was safe for them."" ""That was definitely true,"" Latimer told ABC. ""I was out to my family at that stage, but nobody else. Only a few people that I knew and trusted who were the same. ""In those days, the Armpits did get a lot of abuse on the sidelines — and we did as well. People [were] saying, 'Girls shouldn't be playing soccer' and getting laughed at because they were lesbians. ""So, I think I was a bit afraid of that at first, as I was discovering more about my sexuality at that time. ""But I always wanted to play in their team. I was getting a bit burnt out where I was, so that was one of the reasons, plus knowing the women personally. ""And I did bring other players with me from Dynamo Uni over to the Armpits as well. I admired Truffy and what she was doing and really believed in it. ""I never looked back once I became a member of the Armpits. I felt like I was home. I felt brave, as well, that I was also making a stand. I could be my authentic self there. ""That's what was so magical about the Armpits, especially for younger lesbians [who] were first coming out. ""Truffy created an environment where people were really supported in their identity. It changed people's lives, it really did."" Latimer joined the Armpits just after she reached the summit of the football pyramid: representing her state at the National Championships while also being called up to represent Australia at the 1987 Women's Invitational Tournament in Taiwan, the precursor to the pilot Women's World Cup in China the following year. However, she said, had she not joined the Armpits when she did, her football career may not have lasted much longer. ""It brought back my love of football, that team,"" she said. ""I'd felt burnt out for a while and felt like I was either going to quit or needed to go to a club where I could actually just have fun. I'd lost the fun. ""It was also so much about family. The Armpits really brought that out. I lived and breathed it, and I think the nurturing of us as players was one of the most important parts. ""I became a better person there. One of the things Truffy incorporated there was mutual respect, where we all had a voice and everybody was listened to. ""So it made me a better footballer, a stronger footballer, in every way."" However, as the Armpits' reputation grew, so too did the abuse and discrimination — both on and off the field. ""In the early years, there were many occasions where we were subjected to some quite horrible verbal abuse from women in other teams, who were egged on by their supporters. ""A few times when we were physically abused, as well,"" Maginnis said. ""The tackles were awful. There was one club we played against and they were kicking six pints of blood out of us. ""We said afterwards, 'Let's not play them again' and forfeited all later games. ""I got king-hit in the back of the head once when the referee was looking the other way. ""And because we did well with each other, because we were so overt with our sexuality, when the homophobia came up externally — from the association, when they twigged that we weren't going away — all the stereotypes came to the fore: lesbians as predators, is it safe to send young girls out to play the Armpits? ""Those conversations were happening in the South Australian Women's Soccer Association. ""Those stereotypes still exist today. When my contemporaries say, 'Oh, it's easy to be out as a queer woman these days, they're everywhere,' I say to them, 'It's not! There's still the internal journey. That's just as difficult as ever.'"" Despite it all, the Armpits thrived. They won their division, twice, and even got promoted to the state's top-tier competition, only for their application to be knocked back by the association, who claimed they wanted ""even numbers"" in each league. For Latimer, there were silver-linings to the discrimination they experienced, be it on the sidelines or from decision-makers above: They became stronger players, driven by the desire to prove themselves to everybody who doubted or questioned them. ""It made me want to play harder,"" she said. ""We would still get people making fun of us, but that made me a stronger footballer. ""It lifted the club, as well, because it brought out the best in us rather than making us drop our heads. We spoke with our feet. ""We became a better team because of it. Eventually, we were able to block out the noise and just play football."" These days, the Armpits are no more. After 33 years, they officially folded in 2015 and donated much of their memorabilia to the State Library of South Australia. While the club may no longer exist, their legacy has been carried on by other LGBTQIA+ clubs that have popped up around the country, including the Flying Bats, the Sydney Rangers and the Melbourne Rovers, all of which contest the annual Justin Fashanu and Julie Murray Cups. The folding of the Armpits also hasn't stopped Maginnis from continuing to create a safer and more inclusive world for queer people, going on to work at the Bfriend LGBTQIA+ peer support service at Uniting Care Wesley, Adelaide, as well as cancer care services and support networks to help prevent violence against women. She still participates in football when she can, watching the celebration around A-Leagues club Adelaide United hosting their inaugural Pride Round with joy earlier this year, as well as the many Matildas who are now out and proud about their sexuality — although it's no substitute for being out there on the wide, open field herself. ""I think any opportunity to have people go, 'What does Pride Round mean?' and have that conversation will make a difference somewhere to somebody,"" she said. ""I understand the stuff about tokenism — the same with [the] Indigenous Round — but those things make a difference. Seeing the rainbows on the back of Adelaide United men and women at the weekend: For me, it keeps the conversation going. ""The ones who the conversation matters most to are those who are still trying to make sense of what it means to be attracted to someone of the same gender, or to be non-binary or transgender, or to have any sense that they are not heterosexual. ""Those things can only be of help, whether it's Pride Round in football, whether it's the opportunity to see gay men and lesbians depicted in the media in a really ordinary way that takes away the awful stereotypes. ""For me, I'll very happily support pride rounds and have conversations with people [who] want to know what it's about. ""We had a bit of traditional success, but the real success was how we kept going. And we kept ourselves safe and looked out for each other and had a lot of fun. ""For me, that's the thing that gives me strength and makes the world a joyful place to live in, because we matter to each other. We find each other and we gather each other up and keep ourselves and each other safe. That's what it's all about.""

65,WACA employed paedophile junior coaching co-ordinator for 29 years,sport," Sport WACA employed paedophile junior coaching co-ordinator Roy Wenlock for 29 years The Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA) created a job for a now-notorious paedophile who subsequently worked for the organisation for 29 years between 1979 and 2007, the WACA has confirmed. WARNING: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse. Roy Wenlock, for whom the WACA created the full-time role of 'development officer' in 1979, was one of three sex offenders investigated in WA Supreme Court Justice Peter Blaxell's 452-page parliamentary inquiry into historical child sexual abuse at Anglican hostels, published in 2012. WACA chief executive Christina Matthews confirmed to ABC Sport that the organisation became aware of Wenlock's offending during the 2012-13 summer and has since taken a range of measures to address the issue, which is the subject of ongoing civil litigation against the WACA. In Justice Blaxell's report, Wenlock, who died in 2007, was revealed to have been a prolific abuser who gained sexual gratification from ""wrestling"" sessions — simulated sex in which Wenlock would ejaculate — with boys placed in his care between 1963 and 1977. In some cases, Wenlock's offending escalated to masturbation and oral sex with the boys. Blaxell's report was also unequivocal in its conclusion that Wenlock's grooming and abuse of boys continued at the WACA. One of those boys, now a man in his mid-40s, confirmed to ABC Sport that while performing WACA ""drinks boy"" duties under Wenlock's direction in the late 1980s, he was taken back to Wenlock's house with other boys and witnessed abuse. Between 1979 and 2007, Wenlock fulfilled a range of roles at the WACA, most of which gave him unsupervised access to children. For decades, he was the organisation's full-time development officer, conducting junior coaching clinics around the state, and also served as WACA ground announcer, museum curator, and as a WACA pennant umpire. He also umpired in junior competitions and was secretary of the Western Australian Youth Cricket Council. In 2000, Wenlock received the Australian Sports Medal for services to cricket. In 2012, Justice Blaxell concluded there was ""ample evidence to show that Wenlock would engage in grooming behaviour"" with boys he encountered across his four decades at the WACA. ""In this position he was required to engage in various cricketing activities with young teenagers, and he would sometimes invite individual boys back to his home,"" Blaxell wrote. There, Wenlock would ""encourage them to engage in 'wrestling'. The reputation that Wenlock acquired as a result of these activities was such that young cricketers would warn their friends: 'whatever you do, don't go to his house'."" 'Darren' (not his real name) was not aware of Justice Blaxell's findings when he spoke to ABC Sport, but he was among the boys who were taken from the WACA to Wenlock's house and says what he saw there mirrored the experiences of witnesses in the inquiry. In 1989, when Darren was in his early teens, Wenlock selected Darren and a male school friend to perform ""drinks boy"" duties for a Sheffield Shield game at the WACA ground. Darren said he was excited because the fixture in question — Western Australia vs New South Wales — featured Darren's idols, the Waugh brothers. ""My mate had done it previously,"" Darren told ABC Sport. ""I thought, 'This will be awesome'. I was excited because it meant we got to take food into the change rooms for the players and take turns to take the drinks out. It was really cool."" Darren said his discomfort started after play. Wenlock had arranged with parents that Darren, his friend and a few other boys would not be picked up from the WACA, but from Wenlock's house after a swim and some icy poles. At the house, Darren said, Wenlock encouraged the boys to wrestle him, something that struck Darren as ""so unusual and weird"" that he declined Wenlock's invitation. Darren said other boys did wrestle Wenlock. ""I found it quite confronting,"" he said. ""And it went on for quite a while."" Darren said that in his eagerness to meet more of his heroes, he volunteered for another day as a drinks boy, but he declined a second invite to Wenlock's house and resolved not to do the job again. ""I was uncomfortable with what was happening,"" he said. ""I can visualise it, and the feeling I associate with what I saw was that it was very uncomfortable."" Roy Hamilton Wenlock was once a ubiquitous and sometimes divisive figure in Western Australian cricket. As an umpire in the elite WACA competition, Wenlock was unpopular with players, who thought he was out of his depth and reliant on WACA support for ongoing selection. Regardless, in 1995 Wenlock was made a life member of the Western Australian Cricket Umpires' Association and remains so. Among colleagues in the WACA administration, Wenlock was considered gruff and strange, but the organisation valued his enthusiasm to take on duties others wouldn't, particularly the creation and administration of junior cricket programs and Wenlock's curation of the memorabilia collection that became the WACA museum. Following Wenlock's death at 75 in 2007, tributes in the WACA annual report described him as the ""spiritual father"" and ""inspiration"" of the museum and, and on account of his ground announcing duties, one of the WACA's ""most recognisable voices, if not faces"". A former bank clerk whose rise to prominence in elite cricket belied his self-confessed inability to play the game, Wenlock's parallel life as an abuser of boys is most extensively documented between 1963 and late 1977, when he served as a warden at St Christopher's House, the residential hostel at Northam High School. It is likely that Wenlock came to the attention of his eventual bosses at the WACA during his years as president of the Northam Cricket Association, for whom he administered a junior competition too, becoming a life member. ""The WACA created a new position of Development Officer in 1979 and encouraged Roy to apply,"" read his WACA obituary. ""He was successful and became an integral part of the administration."" Initially, Wenlock's wages were partly subsidised by the Western Australian government. ""He arranged coaching trips to the North West, pre-season cricket camps for umpires, and was unofficial collector and guardian of cricket trophies and photos that were often given to him. In 1983 he was appointed as the ground announcer at the WACA on match days. This caused him to curtail his umpiring ambitions."" But Wenlock, who had not faced police charges at the time of his death, gained greater notoriety posthumously, admonished by his former employers at the Anglican Church for the ""depravity"" of his offending against boys placed in his care. Wenlock's activities were described by an Archbishop as ""abhorrent – exploitative and abusive – and a gross breach of trust."" In the Anglican hostels inquiry, one former St Christopher's House pupil described Roy Wenlock as ""a powerful man with an intimidating presence … calculated and cunning… someone that you could never say 'no' to."" ""Whatever he said you had to do, or you knew there would be consequences."" The consequences were a range of sadistic punishment rituals, including violent canings that left at least one boy with a disfigured finger. But it was a practice of Wenlock's that became known among boys as ""bruting"" that caused the greatest damage. For 'bruting' sessions, Wenlock would invite boys to his private flat on the hostel's grounds for what Justice Blaxwell called ""the same bizarre and ritualistic form of physical contact which the boys had to perform for Wenlock's sexual pleasure."" The boys were forced to strip to their underpants and Wenlock usually did too, with one or the other often wearing leopard skin underpants or bathers provided by Wenlock. The pretence of 'wrestling' ended with Wenlock on his back on the floor, forcing the boy to straddle his pelvic area so the boy's buttocks were resting on his groin. Blaxwell explained: ""Wenlock would bounce around and pretend to try to buck the boy off while at the same time continuously moaning and repeating the words: 'you brute', 'you brute'."" ""The effect of this was that the boy's anal area would bump and grind against Wenlock's groin. Some former students distinctly recall Wenlock's erect penis rubbing against their bodies and of him ejaculating as a result."" The inquiry heard that boys endured these ordeals for up to two hours at a time. Some of the 18 men who gave evidence said they experienced the abuse only once, but one witness suffered the assaults on a weekly basis for his entire five years at the hostel. Others detailed feelings of disgust and shame in the aftermath. Evidence was also heard of graver assaults than the 'bruting' sessions. Wenlock plied one boy with alcohol and groped his genitals. Another boy was forced to masturbate Wenlock, abuse that escalated to oral sex and being forced into 'wrestling' sessions as an unidentified priest watched. Multiple students made complaints about Wenlock between 1975 and 1977, with one boy's story briefly attracting the attention of police, but their investigations amounted to nothing. In the inquiry, Justice Blaxell's harshest assessment was of then-St Christopher's board chairman and Archdeacon (later Bishop) Michael Challen who, in 1977, politely asked Wenlock to resign and offered the abuser ""effectively a glowing reference"", rather than sacking him and making it clear to prospective employers that Wenlock should not be given a job that put him in contact with children. Blaxell concluded that Challen's decision ""revealed a questionable sense of moral priorities for a clergyman."" ""By allowing him to leave 'quietly' they gave a higher priority to the reputation of the Hostel than to any concern for the future wellbeing of teenage boys with whom Wenlock might come into contact,"" Blaxell wrote. ""By these actions Bishop Challen increased the prospects that Wenlock would be able to sexually misconduct himself with young males in a similar fashion again."" WACA chief executive Christina Matthews told ABC Sport that the organisation has taken several measures to address its historical child sexual abuse problems and assured survivors they would be supported if they reported their abuse. ""I encourage anyone that has experienced any form of abuse when they have been involved in WACA programs to come forward and we will deal with it openly and honestly,"" Matthews said. The WACA is the only one of Australian cricket's powerful state associations to have signed up to the National Redress Scheme in response to the Royal Commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. Matthews said the WACA joined the scheme willingly and immediately, and that one survivor of Wenlock's abuse has already had his claim processed and approved. Matthews said the WACA first became aware of Wenlock's history during the 2012-13 summer, when a survivor approached the organisation to raise awareness and ensure child protection measures that had been lacking in the past were now in place. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""We reviewed our practices and became what you would probably call more aware of some of the dubious things these people do and how to prevent them,"" Matthews said. ""At the same time, child protection regulations were changing, so it all blended into that."" In recent months, former WACA staff who were colleagues of Wenlock told ABC Sport they'd been interviewed by lawyers acting for the WACA and asked for their recollections of Wenlock. Matthews confirmed that the WACA appointed external legal counsel in June 2021, in response to civil litigation being launched by a survivor of abuse by Wenlock. That case has not yet been resolved. ""Our position has always been to not hide from these things, and to try and make the process as less painful as possible for the victim,"" Matthews said. ""You've got to deal with the truth.""

66,West Coast Fever earn right to host Super Netball grand final after knocking off Vixens in semi,sport," Sport West Coast Fever earn right to host Super Netball grand final after knocking off Melbourne Vixens 71-62 in semi The West Coast Fever have stunned the Melbourne Vixens, winning their Super Netball semi-final 71-62 and booking a spot in the grand final. A monumental shooting performance from Jhaniele Fowler led the Fever, who burst out of the blocks with an intensity the Vixens could not match, to victory. The result helps Super Netball save some face, as Perth had already been controversially chosen to host the deciding game. The Fever's win means they would have won that honour anyway. ""We wanted to earn the right to host the grand final and we've done that. I'm so proud of the girls today,"" Fever captain Courtney Bruce told Fox Netball. The class of Fowler and defensive mastery from Bruce and Sunday Aryang came to the fore as the Fever opened with a 19-10 quarter before leading by 12 goals at half-time as the Vixens buckled under the pressure with a series of uncharacteristic errors. Things went from bad to worse for the home side in the third quarter as they continued to unravel, trailing by as many as 21 goals before finals debutant Rahni Samason closed the term with three straight super shots to cut the Fever's lead to 56-42. Samason's long-range accuracy (10 two-point goals from 14 attempts) proved to be one of the few positives for the Vixens, the final margin of nine goals not reflecting the Fever's dominance of possession over the four quarters. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. The result was a triumph for former Adelaide Thunderbirds coach Dan Ryan as he directed the Fever back to the grand final in his first season at the helm. ""He's just taking our game plan to another level. He's definitely recognised that we've been there in the past and it's just been a few tweaks and his absolute passion,"" Bruce said about Ryan's impact on the Fever. The Vixens will play the winner of Sunday's minor semi-final between the Giants and Collingwood Magpies in next week's preliminary final, co-captain Liz Watson confident her squad can put the disappointment of their semi-final loss behind them. ""To put out a performance like that you don't deserve to go through to a grand final, to be honest,"" Watson said. ""We've got another week … we just need to bring it from the start because we were just missing right from the first whistle today.""

67,Crusaders claim 11th Super Rugby title with dominant win over the Blues,sport," Sport Record-breaking Crusaders beat Blues in pulsating Super Rugby Pacific final in Auckland The Crusaders have dominated the ladder-topping Blues to win the Super Rugby Pacific final 21-7 at a sold-out Eden Park in Auckland. The powerhouse Christchurch-based franchise claimed a record-extending 11th Super Rugby crown as they snapped the Blues' 15-match winning streak with a ruthless display in wet and slippery conditions. Scrum half Bryn Hall and winger Sevu Reece scored tries either side of half time, while Richie Mo'unga ran the game with a brilliant display at fly half and contributed 11 points from the boot. The Blues, roared on by a big home crowd, were simply unable to get on the front foot and unleash their talented backs until it was too late. Scrum half Finlay Christie gave them a sniff of hope with an opportunist try in the 59th minute, but a defensive mix-up gifted Reece a score four minutes from time to put the result beyond doubt. It was a sixth straight title for the Crusaders under coach Scott Robertson after they won the last three editions of trans-continental Super Rugby and the domestic Super Rugby Aotearoa competition in the last two years. ""We've always talked about effort on both sides of the ball,"" said All Blacks lock and Crusaders veteran Sam Whitelock. ""It's not always about scoring points, sometimes it's about stopping them from scoring."" Super Rugby relaunched this year as a Pacific-focused championship, but the final result was the same as 10 of the 24 editions of the pre-COVID competition. On display were the steely defence, dominant set-piece, forwards who battle for every breakdown and backs who looked to attack at every opportunity that are in the DNA of the Christchurch-based dynasty. The Blues, dominant in the early years of the competition, had looked to usurp the Crusaders on the back of a high-octane attack but initially looked shell-shocked at the intensity of the contest. For all their domination of territory and possession in the opening half, the Crusaders had only a drop goal and penalty from Mo'unga to show for their efforts until just before the break. Leicester Fainga'anuku had earlier been held up over the line and the hulking winger was stopped just short when he launched himself at it again. Argentine flanker Pablo Matera was pushed back from close range but Hall cleverly dabbed the ball down for a try through a jumble of legs after an excellent ruck clean out by Whitelock, who was dominant in the loose and at the lineout, which the Crusaders dominated. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. It was a turnover from another fluffed Blues lineout that led to a Crusaders penalty which Mo'unga converted for a 16-0 lead after 46 minutes. Christie finally got the Blues on the board when he pounced on a loose ball at the back of a Crusaders scrum for a converted try that cut the deficit to 16-7, but even that was too steep a mountain to climb against the visiting defence. ""Tonight wasn't our night, we really weren't good enough,"" said Blues fly half Beauden Barrett. ""Really disappointing, we had a good season, we wanted to come here and do a job here tonight. It's a tough one to swallow."" ABC/Wires We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

68,Jordan De Goey calls out 'media persecution of athletes' as Pies investigate Bali videos,sport," Sport Jordan De Goey calls out 'media persecution of athletes' as Collingwood investigate Bali videos Jordan De Goey has criticised the media for its ""persecution of athletes"", as Collingwood investigate footage of of him partying in Bali. Social media footage of De Goey emerged showing the controversial Magpie in a club, dancing and making crude gestures on the Indonesian party island. De Goey travelled to the island during Collingwood's mid-season break. ""The Collingwood Football Club is aware of video footage involving player Jordan De Goey that was taken in Bali in recent days,"" the Magpies said in a statement on Saturday. ""The club will comment further as soon as it is in a position to do so."" De Goey released a short statement on Instagram thanking his family and friends for their support. ""I want to openly address the relentless pursuit and persecution of athletes by the media to create an uneducated, bias [sic] and ill-informed narrative that has gone too far,"" De Goey said. ""I am one of the lucky ones with amazing support, however not all athletes are so lucky. ""This will end in tragedy if no one speaks up. It's time for change. #enoughisenough"" A woman with De Goey in the social media footage defended the Magpie utility. ""I can't believe the backlash towards Jordy and myself over here in Bali … Nothing to see here,"" the woman posted on Instagram. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Collingwood last October stood down De Goey after the 26-year-old was arrested for a drunken incident at a New York nightclub. De Goey and a friend were arrested at a Manhattan rooftop bar following an alleged brawl with other patrons. In January, De Goey pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment at a hearing at the Manhattan Criminal Court and was ordered to complete 10 counselling sessions with a focus on anger management and alcohol treatment. He was stood down by Collingwood during the legal process and returned to training in January. De Goey falls off-contract with the Magpies at season's end and was permitted by the club to travel to Bali during their 12-day mid-season bye. But the move sparked outrage among AFL pundits, with Collingwood's 1990 premiership captain Tony Shaw among them. ""He's probably not a smart person … that's twice now,"" Shaw told Melbourne radio station 3AW. ""If I'm the football club, I would say, 'do you understand what you have done?'. ""Even though you don't know because you're probably stupid and you don't understand that this has been seen in the light it's been in Melbourne."" Retired St Kilda great Nick Riewoldt labelled De Goey selfish. ""You always get a pretty good indication of someone's professionalism and how much they care about their career when you look at the choices they make,"" Riewoldt told Fox Footy. ""Every player has the right to go abroad during the break. ""But it's a choice … Jordan chose indulgence over discipline in this case. ""Unfortunately it seems to be a pretty regular theme for him that he prefers pampering over discipline from a football point of view."" Former Essendon player Adam Ramanauskas gave an alternate view on ABC Sport, saying there is ""no issue"" with De Goey travelling to Bali. ""Let's be honest, it's a perfect storm for the media,"" Ramanauskas said. ""Players are on a break, they can do what they like.

69,'They made us pay': Wallaroos surrender 10-0 lead to fall to Canada defeat,sport," Sport Wallaroos beaten in Pacific Four finale by Canada An undisciplined Wallaroos side has squandered a double-digit lead to lose 22-10 to Canada and finish winless in the Pacific Four Series. Australia finished the four-nation round robin tournament with one point at the bottom of the table. Two Canada tries in six minutes either side of half-time on Saturday turned the game around in wet conditions in Whangarei, New Zealand. A third try three minutes from full time gave the scoreboard a more realistic look as world number four ranked Canada dominated possession and territory. They had twice as many carries and eighth-ranked Australia had to make 100 more tackles and gave away 10 more penalties. Australia were down a player for the last eight minutes when reserve prop Madison Schuck was sin-binned, as referee Lauren Jenner finally lost patience after warning them for committing numerous infringements. ""We obviously came out very strong and in that second half we gave away too many penalties,"" Wallaroos captain and flanker Shannon Parry told Stan Sport. ""Canada is a quality team and they made us pay."" For the second time in the series, Australia couldn't hold on after leading 10-0 and conceded more than 20 straight points. The Wallaroos executed well from a lineout with hooker Ashley Marsters crashing over in the fourth minute from a rolling maul. Winger Lori Cramer converted and added a penalty to give Australia a 10-0 lead inside 13 minutes. However, they spent most of the rest of the half on the back foot and only dogged defence and some Canadian handling errors preserved the lead. Cramer held up Canada prop DaLeaka Menin over the line, but the gold defensive wall was finally breached just before the break, when Canada hooker Emily Tuttosi scored in identical fashion to Marsters. Captain and number 8 Sophie de Goede converted to ensure Australia held just a three-point lead at half time. Canada halfback Justine Pelletier scampered over the line early in the second half after de Goede detached from the back of a scrum. De Goede missed the conversion from in front, but Canada took control and Australia rarely threatened to score. Australia withstood a 23-phase passage, but Canada were subsequently awarded a close range penalty which De Goede converted in the 64th minute and reserve forward Alex Ellis scored their third try just before the end. ""Massive credit to Australia, especially in this rain that was super physical and they came out swinging,"" player of the match de Goede said. In the second half Australia struggled to maintain possession, fumbling on a number of occasions, as Canada continued to dominate. Back rower Grace Kemp, who made her debut off the bench, provided a rare second half highlight for the Australians with one barnstorming run. ""I think there's a lot to take away for a young group, we've really come together over this tour, even though we haven't got the results,"" Parry said. ""We've learnt a lot about ourselves, I think it will put us in good stead come World Cup towards the end of the year.""

70,"The Eels and Roosters put on a show after Penrith, Cronulla record wins",sport," Sport Parramatta Eels beat Sydney Roosters in NRL thriller, Penrith Panthers, Cronulla Sharks win Parramatta has bounced back after Monday's shocking performance against the Bulldogs with a thrilling, 26-16 victory over the Roosters at Western Sydney stadium. The five-try half from the Eels, jam-packed with scintillating offloads and bullocking runs up the middle was completely at odds to the individualistic display last time out. ""We were pretty disappointed with how we went last week, it was pretty embarrassing to be honest,"" Clinton Gutherson said. ""We got a bit of a kick up the backside during the week."" Whatever was said during the week, it helped the Eels rediscover their best form as they scored five brilliant tries through Dylan Brown, Isaiah Papali'i, Gutherson, Maika Sivo and Reed Mahoney in the first half alone. Joseph Suallii scored once in each half for the Roosters either side of a Sitili Tupouniua score, but were always second best in front of 21,757 supporters. A bloodied James Tedesco said the Roosters were ""flat"" in the first half and gave themselves too much to do in the match. ""We fought back in the second half but … we've just got to be better than that."" At times it appeared there was nothing the Roosters could do to contain the Eels, particularly for Sivo's try — his first since returning from an ACL injury. Starting on the right, the Eels offloaded and scampered free of Roosters tacklers before spinning the ball left for the massive Fijian to crash over. The next try was almost as good, with seamless passing down the right sending Mahoney over. The Roosters lost Egan and Nat Nutcher to head injuries on a torrid night for the tri colours. The Roosters have dropped out of the eight after losing four of their last five matches. Mitch Moses, who added three conversions and helped steer the Eels around the park, said the Eels wanted to ""come out and prove a point"". ""We showed a lot of mental toughness there, we turned up for each other and it was a good hit back from last week."" Penrith were far from perfect, but the Premiers-elect were still too good for the New Zealand Warriors, running out 40-4 victors in Redcliffe. Tries to Moses Leota, Dylan Edwards and Taylan May, all converted by Nathan Cleary, handed the Panthers a comfortable 18-0 lead at the break. The Panthers continued where they left off after the restart with Brian To'o, Isaah Yeo and Liam Martin all crossing for further scores. Josh Curran added a late consolation off the back of a booming 40:20 kick from Reece Walsh, who added the extras to ensure the Warriors were not zeroed. However the Panthers had the final say, To'o scoring an acrobatic second in the corner after some lovely work from Jarome Luai to complete the scoring and a seven-try to one rout. It was the Warriors' seventh consecutive loss, expertly ground into submission by Cleary, fullback Dylan Edwards, second-rower Liam Martin and lock Isaah Yeo. Halfback Cleary was always a play ahead of the Warriors. He tormented them with an array of kicks on top of his slick running and passing game. It was in stark contrast to Warriors halfback Shaun Johnson, who failed to trouble the Panthers' defence and is fighting for his place in the side. The Panthers took some time to find the precision expected from the NRL's benchmark team. Two handling errors inside the first five minutes provided an uncharacteristic start but when they eventually clicked they were near unstoppable. It was the Warriors' final home game in Redcliffe before they return home permanently for the first time since before the COVID-19 pandemic. ABC/AAP Cronulla has hung on to defeat an ill-disciplined Gold Coast side 18-10 in a scrappy, error-strewn encounter in what were ideal conditions at the Coffs Harbour International Stadium. The Sharks, who move into the top four at the expense of Brisbane, leaped into a 10-0 lead thanks to tries from Sione Katoa and Matt Moylan inside the opening quarter. However, the Titans fought back to be all square at the break after Beau Fermor and Greg Marzhew crossed. A converted try from Blayke Brailey five minutes after the restart, followed by a penalty goal from Nicho Hynes — on what was his birthday and his 50th NRL appearance — helped the nominal home side to an 18-10 lead that they held through to the conclusion. """"Very sloppy … we almost got our pants pulled down there at the end,"" Brailey told ABC Grandstand after the match. ""[Cronulla coach Craig Fitzgibbon] wants us to be a defensive side … not happy at all."" ""I think across the board [the errors] is something we're gunna need to address just to give ourselves a opportunity to compete against those big sides and play the type of footy that we want to,"" Moylan told Fox Sports after the match. ""There's still a bit of work to do."" Titans full-back AJ Brimson — returned to the side after missing last week with COVID — threatened to make things interesting in the closing minutes, but knocked on attempting to ground a Patrick Herbert kick. Greg Marzhew went the length of the field in the closing seconds, after a wonderful flick pass from Jarryd Wallace inside his own ten metres, but it was cruelly chalked off after the bunker Moylan was judged to have knocked on earlier in the play. The game was punctuated by a litany of errors from both sides, numbering 15 for the match for the Sharks and eight for the Titans. ""We ground it out and got the win in the end,"" Hynes told Fox Sports. ""If we're gunna compete with the best teams in the competition, we need to be way better. ""We're giving away silly penalties in our own end when we're getting pretty good kicks away … we're making some silly offloads, errors. ""We need to take a really good look at ourselves, review those areas and stop doing those silly things so we can compete with the best teams.""

71,Steph Gilmore adds another title to record tally for most women's wins ever in world surfing championships,sport,"  Steph Gilmore builds on record for most women's wins on World Surf League with El Salvador Pro victory Australian seven-time world champion Stephanie Gilmore has won the El Salvador Pro, registering her 33rd career title to build on her own record for the most women's wins in the history of the surfing world tour. The Australian defeated American Lakey Peterson in the final of the World Surf League event in Punta Roca, after eliminating Caroline Marks in the semis and compatriot Isabella Nichols in the round earlier. American Griffin Colapinto took out the men's title, beating world number one Filipe Toledo in the final. The wins catapult both Gilmore and Colapinto to third place in their respective rankings as the tour heads to Brazil for the third-last stop of the season. The top five men and women after the 10-event world tour will compete in a one-day finals competition in California in September. ""Muchas gracias El Salvador, this is amazing,"" Gilmore said. ""Once I got past Caroline, I was super confident and I knew I could do it. ""Lakey is an amazing surfer, so I knew it was going to be a tough final but it doesn't get any better. I love doing this, I love winning, I love doing this sport. ""I would love to win another world title, but it's a long road. There's a lot more competition to be surfed and a lot of hard work to do, but this is just an amazing experience and I'm so happy to be here."" In the 40-minute women's final, Gilmore had just 1.03 to her name with 11 minutes remaining. Peterson had compiled a two-wave total of 9.67 by that stage, but Gilmore pulled out the goods when she needed it most, following up a 7.33 ride with a 5.67 to snatch the lead with just minutes remaining. Peterson could not find a winning ride from that point on, handing Gilmore her first tour victory of the year. The men's final also came down to the wire as Toledo, who opened with a stunning 9.57-point ride, held the lead and priority with four minutes remaining on the clock. Colapinto needed a 7.01 to take the lead, and he set off on a wave in the dying minutes after Toledo decided not to take it. The American pulled off a tail-high reverse followed by a 360-degree reverse to secure an eight-point ride and snatch victory.

72,Bulldogs prevail in 35-goal shootout against fierce rivals Giants,sport," Sport Western Bulldogs beat GWS in 35-goal shootout at Giants Stadium, Geelong move into top four The Western Bulldogs have kept their finals hopes alive with a 20-point victory in an AFL shootout with arch-rivals GWS at Giants Stadium. The goals flowed in a blistering and even contest until the Bulldogs kicked away with five unanswered majors late in the third term to set up a 19.11 (125) to 16.9 (105) triumph on Saturday night. Enigmatic forwards Toby Greene and Cody Weightman set the tone for the old-school goalfest with three each in the first term, the Giants co-captain finishing with a career-high seven while the Bulldogs young gun booted five. Aaron Naughton also kicked five majors for the Bulldogs while Jack Macrae (37 disposals, one goal), Adam Treloar (31) and skipper Marcus Bontempelli (28, one) found plenty of the ball. Jesse Hogan slotted three for the Giants as co-captain Stephen Coniglio (32 touches, two goals) and Tom Green (32) continued their strong form. A Bulldogs loss to GWS would have left the 2021 grand finalists two wins out of the eight with nine rounds remaining but a 7-6 record keeps them within touching distance of the top eight. But the victory could come at a cost for the Bulldogs with defender Taylor Duryea landing awkwardly before he was subbed out with a knee injury early in the opening term. Weightman's night also looked set to end early when he suffered a nasty elbow injury and had to be helped from the field in the third term but the 21-year-old returned shortly after and played out the match despite heavy strapping on his arm. The Giants were also hit hard on a night of injury carnage with Braydon Preuss subbed out in the second term with a lower leg issue and James Peatling forced to sit out the last quarter due to hamstring tightness. There were few signs early of the rivalry that has become one of the most heated in the AFL as a fast and furious opening term produced 11 goals and a three-point lead for the Bulldogs. The shackles remained off in the second quarter as the teams combined for the highest half-time total score this season with the Bulldogs leading 10.6 to 9.7. The teams also set a new mark for the highest combined score at the final change this year with 16.9 to 11.8 but the Bulldogs were able to surge to a 29-point lead off the back of winning clearances 14-4 for the third term. The match continued in similar fashion in the final quarter to end with the highest combined score of 230 so far this season. The Bulldogs play Hawthorn next on Friday night while the Giants will take on Collingwood on Sunday week. Tom Hawkins has registered his 700th AFL goal as Geelong overcame a major scare to post an 18-point win over West Coast at Perth Stadium. The Cats were expected to stroll to victory against a bottom-of-the-table Eagles outfit that had registered just one win all year. But buoyed by the return of premiership stars Elliot Yeo, Willie Rioli and Dom Sheed, West Coast hit the lead early in the third quarter. The margin was just 11 points in favour of the Cats with seven minutes remaining in the match, but Hawkins' third goal of the game sealed the 12.9 (81) to 9.9 (63) victory in front of 32,526 fans. Hawkins kicked goal number 700 in the second quarter when he won a lucky free kick, with the 33-year-old becoming just the 26th player to achieve the feat in VFL/AFL history. West Coast suffered a huge blow before the match when star midfielder Tim Kelly was ruled out with illness. They were dealt another blow 10 minutes into the second term when defender Jeremy McGovern suffered a game-ending rib injury after being bumped by Jeremy Cameron. McGovern was sent to hospital for scans. Cats goalsneak Tyson Stengle kicked three goals to continue his fine form this year, while Cam Guthrie (25 disposals, 13 clearances) was also influential. Jake Waterman, Jamie Cripps, and Josh Kennedy booted two goals apiece for West Coast, while Yeo tallied 22 disposals across half-back in just his third AFL match of the year. The result was West Coast's ninth loss on the trot, a club record. But they will be heartened by the much-improved effort. West Coast spent the week celebrating the 30-year anniversary of their grand final triumph over Geelong in 1992. The Eagles showed plenty of fight in the opening term, with their intense tackling helping keep them in the match. A goal after the siren from Hawkins in his only touch of the term gave the Cats a 13-point edge at quarter time, and the storyline was going to script when Geelong skipped out to a 25-point lead early in the second quarter. But West Coast refused to give in, unleashing a four-goal blitz to claw their way back into the match. Jack Petruccelle's behind early in the third quarter gave the home side a one-point edge, but Geelong did enough from that point on to secure their ninth win of the season and replace Carlton in fourth spot. Port Adelaide have overcome the loss of two injured players to down Sydney by 23 points and revive their AFL finals hopes. The Power triumphed 12.10 (82) to 8.11 (59) at Adelaide Oval on Saturday to sneak within two wins of the top eight. Port duo Zak Butters (knee) and first-gamer Brynn Teakle (collarbone) were both hurt in a 10-minute span in the second quarter. After leading by four points at half-time, the Power steamrolled Sydney with a six-goal burst in a third term punctuated by two brain fades from Swans ruckman Peter Ladhams, playing against his former club for the first time. Ladhams threw Port's Lachie Jones to the ground some 50 metres behind play - the resultant free was paid downfield and gifted Sam Powell-Pepper a goal. Two minutes later, Ladhams tackled Power star Ollie Wines and then crudely punched the Brownlow medallist in the ribs while he was on the ground. That act also resulted in a downfield free which was converted into another Port goal. Ladhmans was dragged to the bench as Sydney's resistance broke: Port booted 6.2 to nothing in a tick under 17 minutes to create a match-defining 42-point lead. Power forward Todd Marshall dominated with four goals, his attacking colleague Charlie Dixon kicked two and Wines was superb with his 33 disposals featuring six inside 50s and 11 clearances. Port backmen Riley Bonner (27 touches) and Darcy Byrne-Jones (28 possessions) provided dash while Connor Rozee (29 disposals, eight inside 50s) was influential in midfield. The Power defence contained Sydney's tall forwards with Lance Franklin kicking one major and Sam Reid and Logan McDonald kept goal-less. Isaac Heeney was the standout for the Swans, kicking four goals, while and Luke Parker (25 touches, 10 clearances) and Callum Mills (27 disposals, one goal) toiled gamely. But the third term fade-out would alarm coach John Longmire, particularly given the bright start from his team. The seventh-placed Swans raced to a 19-2 advantage in the first quarter with their three big guns - Franklin, Heeney and Mills - all scoring goals. But Port kicked 12 of the next 14 goals despite suffering double injury blows in the second term. Dynamic midfielder Butters was substituted out of the game with a left knee injury, suffered when twisting awkwardly in a Harry Cunningham tackle. And just 10 minutes later, ruckman Teakle, who joined Port in the mid-season draft two-and-a-half weeks ago, hurt his left collarbone in a bump with Swan Justin McInerney.

73,Aussies win big at Para Swimming Championships in Portugal,sport,"  Aussies dominate on night six of the World Para Swimming Championships in Portugal With the Commonwealth Games just around the corner, Australia's para-athletes have continued to stake their claim as podium favourites, taking out five more medals at the World Para Swimming Championships in Madeira, Portugal overnight. Night six was headlined by Paralympian Rowan Crothers OAM, who won his second gold of the championships, beating Stefano Raimondi in the dramatic final sprint of the Men's 100 metres Freestyle S10 final to touch the wall in just 50.70 seconds. It means the 24-year-old clocked the second-fastest ever 100m freestyle swim for any athlete with disability. In another nail-biting finish, Australia's Mixed 4x100m Medley Relay S14 team just missed out on gold by 0.01 second in the Championship's new event. Great Britain clinched top spot, with a time of 4:08 and will head into their home games in Birmingham this July with the tide of momentum at their backs. Dolphin leader Katja Dedekind also made history in the pool, setting a new Oceania record in the Women's 400m Freestyle S13 Final, with a personal best time of 4:34.68 to claim silver in her third event. Timothy Hodge added to his Championship medal haul, taking out bronze in the Men's 100m Backstroke Final S9 with a time of 1:01.88, while the squad's most experienced swimmer, Matthew Levy, also won bronze in his second race of the night, clocking 1:24.36 in the Men's 100m Breaststroke SB6 Final. Australia have won six gold, 15 silver and nine bronze medals at this World Para Swimming Championships. The success will give the team a lot of confidence heading into Birmingham, which will see the largest para-sport program integrated in the history of the Commonwealth Games, as well as being the first event where more medals are available for women than for men. Other para-events include athletics, wheelchair basketball, cycling, lawn bowls, para-powerlifting, table tennis and triathlon. Wheelchair basketball 3 x 3 will make its debut as part of the para-sport program, while three able-bodied sports — women's cricket T20, 3x3 basketball, and mixed synchronised diving — will also appear for the first time.

74,"Cameron Smith misses cut at US Open, Adam Scott battles to stay in touch with leaders",sport,"  Cameron Smith tanks at US Open as Adam Scott keeps Aussies' hopes alive Cameron Smith has missed the cut as Adam Scott was fighting desperately to stay in touch during another rough and tumble round at the US Open in Massachusetts. Smith's hopes of challenging for a first major championship bit the dust at Brookline after a second disappointing round with Australia's world number six following up an opening 72 with a frustrating 74. He slumped to six over par for the tournament, ensuring he would miss the halfway cut this weekend. Playing in his 84th consecutive major, the former world number one Scott continued to be Australia's brightest ray of light but will need a weekend charge after a three-over 73 left him seven shots adrift of clubhouse leader Collin Morikawa. Starting on the back nine, Scott mixed two birdies, with two bogeys to remain in red numbers at the turn. A double-bogey five on the second, his 11th hole, threatened to derail Scott before a bounce-back birdie on the fourth steadied the ship. However, Scott copped a nasty break when he almost holed out for eagle on the next, only for his ball to ricochet off the pin and spin several metres away from the hole. Two late bogeys compounded his woes and left the 2013 Masters champion in a tie for 38th, with little-known countryman Todd Sinnott. A sectional qualifier in Japan, the 439th-ranked Sinnott posted his second successive 71 to impressively survive the cut at two over, the same score Marc Leishman was on with two holes of his round remaining. And two weeks after his sister Minjee Lee won her second major at the US Women's Open, Min Woo Lee also looked set to secure a weekend tee time after a late rescue act in his second round. Lee eagled his penultimate hole, the eighth, sinking an 18-footer that ensured he battled back to three over for the tournament after a level-par round of 70. However, the tournament is over for Smith and fellow Australians Lucas Herbert and Jed Morgan. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Smith had his work cut out after a difficult opening round and his hopes of a fast start were quickly scuppered on Friday morning. The Queenslander found the thick, rough stuff in front of the green at the par-three second, and swished angrily at the grass after failing to get within 30 feet with his second shot. After a bogey there, his mood was hardly improved with further dropped shots at the fourth and sixth, leaving him with a mountain to make it to the weekend. But it only got worse: A wayward drive at the 10th and the failure to extricate himself from a tough greenside lie at the 15th led to two more bogeys. A tee shot to five foot, at the par-3 16th, eventually earned Smith his first birdie in 23 holes but it was too little, too late, with the cut line projected to be at four over. Herbert crashed to 13 over, with a horror 79, while Morgan ended at 16 over after following up his disastrous opening 82 with a 74. Chasing the third leg of a career grand slam, Morikawa grabbed the solo lead at five under, with a 66, the low round of the day. He led fellow American Hayden Buckley (68) and Spain's defending champion, Jon Rahm (67), by a shot.

75,"The Pymble pool damaged spines and was 'almost unrideable', but these '70s skaters loved it",sport,"  Skateboarders remember Sydney's Pymble pool, an 'almost unrideable' bowl that launched a scene In the late 1970s, Rob ""Wedge"" Francis helped his mates bucket water out of a disused pool in Pymble, Sydney, with an old rubbish bin. After that, he said Australian skateboarding ""went vertical"". ""We just kept throwing ourselves at it until we figured out the physical mechanics of throwing yourself up a wall,"" he said. ""You felt like a rockstar."" More than 40 years since they were strapping sandpaper to their boards for grip, the skateboarding culture Wedge and his mates helped forge, has evolved into an Olympic sport. But the heart and soul remains the same and these 60-something blokes still skate, albeit with a few injuries. Wedge said when he first started skating in 1975 it was a ""craze"" but yet to find itself in popular culture. ""We didn't know what it was. It certainly wasn't defined,"" he said. ""Skate culture wasn't even a word until 20, 30 years later."" Without the skate parks or bowls commonly seen today, he said ""if you wanted to skate it, you pretty much had to create it"". ""Everything else just disappears,"" Wedge said. ""We skated on the street, the local service station, there was a spillway, then we found a roof of a toilet block."" Taking inspiration from American skateboarding magazines, Wedge and his mates began to shift towards a more competitive, and dangerous, form of skating more commonly seen today. Matthew Thomas was at a skate contest in Sydney, featured in Youth Group's music video for Forever Young, in the mid-1970s. ""They were all riding super flex [decks], and we were on wooden boards,"" Mr Thomas said. ""It wasn't skateboarding as we knew it."" Mr Thomas said he then discovered Pymble pool which took days just to ""figure out how to skate"". ""That was a brain explosion of the most profound order,"" he said. ""Its influence across Australian skateboarding is very real."" Melbourne-based skater Chris Hatten said Pymble pool's reputation grew, even if ""by today's standards, that pool is almost unrideable"". ""With five-foot of vert and three foot of transition, that means you need to go up to the top, your acceleration down is phenomenal and then you've got to change direction, 90 degrees, instantly,"" Mr Hatten said. Matthew Thomas said it pushed skaters to modify and develop new boards. ""You couldn't buy anything. They were not in shops. I imported a board from America,"" he said. ""We used to stick sandpaper on to the boards to give it grip. ""Wedge turned up with an incredible board where he scooped it out — I think he made the first concave board."" Even with the innovation, Pymble pool proved too difficult and Mr Thomas said it ""finished my skating career"". ""I did my spine. I ended up having spine surgery,"" he said. More purpose-built skate bowls were built and competitions held, including the 1979 Australian championships won by Wedge. ""Maybe the top three of us that were vying to win the competition … I'd be coaching my mate so he could beat me,"" Wedge said. ""Everyone looks after each other. There's a whole bunch of unwritten rules. No one tends to snake each other."" Wedge said he achieved the ""dream job"" and became a professional skateboarder but the broader culture took decades to develop. ""Skaters are everywhere and it's become respectable,"" he said. Wedge now runs the Moss Foundation, a charity which will be auctioning art at the Gold Coast's Mint Art House Saturday evening, to fund new water wells in Africa. ""The mix of art and skate, it's a caring culture,"" he said. ""As opposed to girls and women having to go to a muddy pond to find water for their family, we're helping reduce disease but also empowering girls to go get an education."" Mr Thomas said the separate skate cultures that emerged in Sydney and Melbourne 40 years ago helped shape today's scene. ""Two cultures developing in exactly the same way,"" he said. It may be in the Olympics, but don't tell anyone at Bowlzilla that skateboarding is just a sport. It's a culture. ""When you go to a bowl or a skate park, there's a pecking order and there's a respect and there's a passing on — it's never ending."" Mr Hatten said after going their separate ways, he finally caught up with old skate mates like Wedge about 15 years ago and has remained close since. ""Catching up with all those guys again, was the most cathartic thing I've ever done,"" he said. ""Their skate styles were the same as they were 30 years beforehand."" Wedge said he was still as keen a skater but takes care. ""When you get to the big bowl and drop in, every time could be your last, especially when you're in your 60s,"" he said, ""I skate to stay on now. You've got to respect it.""

After a glittering playing career that included winning the Champions League with Liverpool and amassing almost 60 caps for Australia, Kewell retired from the game in 2014 and immediately began his coaching badges. His first appointment was as head coach of the Watford under-21 team in July of 2015 before going on to manage clubs in England's lower leagues, including Crawley Town, Notts County, Oldham Athletic and, most recently, Barnet. As part of Celtic's off-season restructure, Kewell was sought out by Postecoglou to take over from former assistant coach and club legend Stephen McManus, who will now lead the club's reserve team. Postecoglou's impact at Celtic has been rapid, taking the club back to the top of the Scottish Premier League in his first season in charge and to direct qualification for next season's Champions League. Celtic fans have warmed to Postecoglou just as quickly, with his name incorporated into songs and even making its way into wedding speeches. ""I am really pleased that Harry has agreed to join my staff,"" Postecoglou said. ""He knows the game inside-out at the highest level and wants to play football the way myself and my team see it. ""I know he is hugely excited about joining Celtic. He is well aware of the scale of the club, what our ambitions are. I know he will make a really positive difference to my team."" The former Socceroos boss has reportedly been a long-time admirer of Kewell's prospects as a coach, almost hiring the 43-year-old as an assistant while in charge of Melbourne Victory in 2016. This appointment is Kewell's highest-profile coaching role since retiring, although he has never managed to stay at a club for longer than two seasons. Most recently, he was sacked by Barnet after seven games without a win. His hiring also continues Postecoglou's legacy of mentoring up-and-coming Australian coaches, which has included working alongside Peter Cklamovski, Arthur Papas and John Hutchinson while at Japanese club Yokohama F Marinos. ""It is a massive honour to join Celtic and team-up with Ange,"" Kewell said. ""He and his backroom team and the players have done brilliantly in their first year together, producing winning football in a great style. To turn things around and become champions so quickly is a huge testament to Ange and everyone else at the club. ""The manager is synonymous with attacking, exciting football, something he delivered on last season and something I know Celtic fans have loved right across the generations. ""We will be aiming to give our fans more of the same going forward and I look forward to playing my part in bringing this to our supporters. ""I'm ready to work and am really looking forward to getting started."" This week marks the 100th anniversary of the Socceroos, who played their first ever match against New Zealand on June 17, 1922. The two nations will play a two-game friendly series in September to mark the occasion as Australia fine-tune their squad ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar in November.

77,"Rafael Nadal aiming for Wimbledon, despite 'strange' nerve pain",sport,"  Rafael Nadal aiming for Wimbledon return, despite 'strange' nerve pain in his foot Rafael Nadal intends to compete at Wimbledon later this month as he attempts to win a record-extending 23rd grand slam title. After winning both the Australian and French Opens this year, the 36-year-old told media on Friday that the pain in his injured foot has eased thanks to radiofrequency ablation treatment and that he will travel to London on Monday to start his preparation for the tournament. ""I'm happy. I haven't been limping for a week,"" Nadal — who won Wimbledon in 2008 and 2010 — told a news conference in Mallorca. ""I have noticed changes with the treatment — [I] still have strange sensations — [so,] sometimes I can't feel my foot, but the pain that did not allow me to support my weight on my foot has subsided."" Nadal said that he would continue to assess how he is feeling after a week of training and exhibition matches after undergoing a procedure. ""My intention is to play Wimbledon, but it will all depend on what happens with my body this next week,"" Nadal said. ""I'm without pain for a week and have been practising, so it tells me there may be a chance to play in the tournament. ""With this treatment, sometimes one part of my foot goes numb, sometimes another [part], and sometimes I have cramps in my foot. But it seems to be normal. Apparently, after a few weeks, the nerve is reorganised — so let's hope that, when this is reorganised, everything will be fine."" Last month, Nadal said that he had arrived at Roland Garros after suffering a flare-up of Müller-Weiss syndrome, a degenerative ailment affecting his foot, and that he had competed while receiving pain-killing injections prior to each match, but does not want to repeat that at other tournaments. The issue — which forced him to take five months off in 2021 — returned in Rome, prior to the French Open, after he came back in May from a six-week injury break. Nadal has not played Wimbledon since 2019, when he reached the semi-finals. The tournament was not held the following year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and he missed the 2021 competition due to injury. He last reached the Wimbledon final 11 years ago, when he finished runner-up to Novak Djokovic. ""I haven't played on grass for three years and I have to adapt. Every day, I have been recovering sensations and feeling better. I have a week left before playing and I have to test myself, little by little,"" Nadal said. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""Advancing in the first rounds is crucial. If you advance, you pick up the pace to reach the end. You have to survive no matter what."" Nadal also confirmed that his childhood sweetheart and now-wife, Maria Francisca Perello, is pregnant with their first child. ""If everything goes well, I'm going to be a father,"" he beamed. ""I'm not used to talking about my private life. We live more peacefully with a lower profile. I don't expect that my life will change much with it. ""At the moment, all has worked well for me and I am not a friend of changing what works well. My intention is to play Wimbledon, rest, then Canada and then be ready for the US Open.""

78,"analysis: After Peru, it's back to the drawing board for Socceroos boss Graham Arnold",sport,"  After the Socceroos' gruelling World Cup qualification, it's back to the drawing board for head coach Graham Arnold Just for a moment, Graham Arnold can take a breather. There is relief all around now that the Socceroos have qualified for the FIFA World Cup. He held his head in his hands during the penalty shootout against Peru; unable to bring himself to watch, he relied instead on the reaction of the players and staff around him to know whether Australia was going through or whether his job finished there and then, on the sidelines of Khalifa International Stadium. But if you thought the road to qualification was dramatic, that's not the half of it. Off the pitch, Arnold has had to be many things, from psychologist to politician, navigating COVID-19 challenges, player crises, and more, with the tenacity of a world-class boxer mixed with the strategic mindset of a chess grand master. Now, 1,008 gruelling days after this qualification period began, he has a brief moment to sit and reflect on the journey so far. What comes to mind, at first, is something Justin Langer once said. ""I read this great article Justin Langer wrote when he was Australian cricket coach, talking about how lonely coaching the national team is, and it resonated very much with me,"" Arnold told The Ticket. The Socceroos coach is quick to point out he has ""great staff"" around him which, ""especially during COVID, was very special"". But despite their unflinching support, not a single one of them can know the extent of the constant stomach churn and inner debate a head coach must wrestle with incessantly. Building a team culture that unites a group of journeymen in order to achieve something greater than their individual talents is a 24/seven mission. All the while, the loneliness of a head coach knows the media will be quick to doubt you, seizing on any perceived weakness. Their words impact those closest to you like poisonous darts finding their target, sometimes sowing the seeds of discontent in the minds of some of those watching on from head office. A head coach accepts the position with the sword of Damocles hovering overhead. ""That's something that's never bothered me because you can only focus on what we can do, and I'm just here to help the players,"" he said. ""Coaching has changed so much over time… the generation of people and the players. ""Just being there to support the players, more than being a 'dictating' coach, which I probably was when I was younger. ""Now it's more about the players taking ownership, and caring for the players, and making sure that they're mentally right and you're showing that type of support. ""These boys, they've been through a lot over the last year and a half with COVID, not being able to get back to Australia. ""Some of these boys had long COVID and missed a couple of camps, and then we lost players due to COVID. I missed two camps with COVID as well, and so it's been tough. But when you stick at it [and] really make those sacrifices, then everything is possible and achievable."" While COVID has been the great disruptor to many people's lives over the past two years, one gets the sense it has become a blanket of sorts, masking many other personal crises that players have gone through and which Arnold has had to deal with. What the world sees when the team plays a game is like the serving of a meal: those who consume it are oblivious to what happened during its lengthy preparation. ""What you get on the field is what you actually do off the field,"" Arnold said. ""If, off the field, you build a great culture, a family culture where people care for each other, and people are prepared to work for each other, and people are loyal to each other, then you get the result on the field. ""At the end of the day, the game is only 90 minutes, but if the players don't go out on the pitch and be prepared to give everything they've got for each other, then you're never going to be successful. ""One of the most important things in coaching is making sure you get that right."" Arnold's journey to this year's World Cup has been 40 years or more in the making. As a kid, he played rugby league at school and soccer on weekends. He was coached throughout his junior years by his dad in an era when well-being meant nothing and toughening up was all that mattered. For more than a decade, Arnold was a Socceroos striker in a national team that came agonisingly close to breaking the team's decades-long World Cup drought, but it wasn't to be. Destiny sometimes arrives through a different door than the one we walk through. ""It has been a long journey,"" Arnold said. ""But I just have the passion for Australian football. I just want to help kids and help the players fulfil their dreams, because I feel very blessed and privileged that I've had the life that I've had in Australian football. If everyone could have a life like I've had, I'd be very happy."" So, what's it going to take for the Socceroos to win a World Cup? ""I don't think I'll be alive when that happens, but the game in Australia — the growth in the game — means the Socceroos are only as strong as the development system. ""People talk about the golden generation and all those players, and they're all in the Premier League and all that… and that's all around the development system. ""We have to get the game right at junior level because there's so many different things that are happening that shouldn't be happening for the kids."" Expense being one of them. The cost of tapping into development football has shut out large sections of the Australian community. With many families priced out of junior football, one club in Perth has waived fees and signalled a new direction for grassroots sport, writes Samantha Lewis. ""One hundred per cent. Most people that are successful in life are the ones that have been brought up the hard way, and they can't afford to play the game."" Does that description fit with Arnold's own childhood experiences? ""Yes,"" he says. ""I lived in my grandmother's garage for 24 years. That's where I grew up. ""My mum and dad had no money. My dad was a cab driver. My mum died when I was 18 or 19. ""I learned the hard way. And living in the garage was probably not the greatest upbringing, but I had a fantastic family around me… my brother was a fantastic support for me over all these years. ""When you get bought up the hard way, that's when you appreciate things more in life."" The greatest players of all time have emerged from the struggles Arnold describes: Those who develop their skills in bare feet or on dirt roads are those who know they must fight to survive. Nothing is handed to them. It is no surprise they also have a love affair with the game: they play with a different kind of passion. There are plenty of Australians who love the international game but are priced out of the pathway system that leads to the national team. Arnold can't fix that. Football Australia can. The Moriarty Football Foundation is one that is knocking on the door with a huge, mostly untapped cohort of young First Nations players that are talented but raw; hungry for the same opportunities others are handed. Arnold's mission now is to work on a few more surprise moves, like this week's goalkeeper substitution, replacing Socceroos captain Mat Ryan with Andrew Redmayne, leaving Peruvian penalty takers perplexed. That psychological ploy was likely the difference in getting Australia to the World Cup while Peru has to wait four more years. ""I need a break for a bit,"" Arnold says. ""I've been away for seven weeks already now and managing fifty-odd people every day, it gets quite fatiguing. ""But the most important thing is they are happy and the staff and the players have an integrated mindset. ""I will have a break and the boys all go back to their clubs and today there's a clean sheet of paper again. Those boys, the ones who qualified us, it's not automatic that those 23 are selected (for the World Cup). ""They've got to go back to their clubs and work hard and perform well because to play for your nation we need the elite. ""I'll be watching them… sitting back and enjoying watching them play."" Arnold is reminded there are only 23 Wednesdays until Australia plays France in its opening match in Qatar. ""Is that right? I haven't even thought about it,"" he laughs. The time for reflection is over. It's back to the drawing board for Graham Arnold, only the third Australian in history charged with guiding the Socceroos through a World Cup campaign.

79,"Injury, COVID wreak havoc for Origin II with one star out and another in doubt",sport," Sport Blues star Jack Wighton tests positive to COVID-19, ruled out of State of Origin II NSW have been dealt a massive blow ahead of the second State of Origin with barnstorming centre Jack Wighton set to be ruled out of their must-win clash with COVID-19. The Canberra playmaker will miss the Raiders' clash with Newcastle on Sunday after contracting the virus, which requires him to spend seven days in isolation. ""Raiders five-eighth Jack Wighton has been ruled out of Sunday's match against the Knights due to COVID protocols,"" the club announced late on Friday. ""Wighton will follow COVID return to play protocols once his isolation is completed next week."" Coach Brad Fittler is set to name his Blues line-up on Sunday with NSW needing victory in Perth next Sunday after Queensland won the series opener in Sydney. Wighton was a certainty as the stand-out in their shock 16-10 loss. They are set to depart Sydney for Perth on Monday to begin preparations and Wighton could possibly join the squad late in the week, however, it would be a massive gamble if he would be up to playing Origin. Wighton was shifted from his usual five-eighth role into the centres to cover the loss of injured stars Latrell Mitchell and Tom Trbojevic. Mitchell has recovered from his hamstring injury but is yet to play a NRL game. The door is open for Penrith's Stephen Crichton, who came off the bench in Sydney, to start at left centre in relief of Wighton with Canterbury's Matt Burton, South Sydney's Campbell Graham and Cronulla's Siosifa Talakai also in contention. Burton's existing combination with Blues duo Jarome Luai and Brian To'o, with whom he won a premiership at the Panthers last year, could be an edge in his favour. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter Queensland could be forced into a change of their own after Cowboys lock Reuben Cotter was a late scratching from his side's win over Manly due to a hamstring strain. Cotter went down in the warm-up and is in doubt for Origin II with Jai Arrow and Patrick Carrigan the candidates to replace the rugged North Queenslander in the starting line-up. Arrow, 18th man in Sydney, could be a straight replacement for Cotter, who impressed in his Origin debut as he played all 80 minutes, made 51 tackles and ran for 134 metres. If Carrigan was moved to the 13 jersey, Brisbane's Tom Flegler could be his replacement on the bench for his second Origin appearance after he debuted in last year's dead rubber.

80,Hungry Bombers dent Saints's top four hopes with upset win,sport," Sport Essendon beat St Kilda by 35 points as Bombers put the brakes on Saints' top four hopes Jake Stringer's crucial third-quarter contribution has helped Essendon find a circuit-breaker in their horror AFL season with a 35-point upset of St Kilda. The Bombers, missing prolific ball-winner Darcy Parish through injury, did it the hard way in their 15.17 (107) to 11.6 (72) triumph at Docklands Stadium on Friday night. They were left stunned when a 28-point half-time advantage vanished at the start of a see-sawing third term. The Saints piled on five goals in 14 minutes before the Bombers hit back with the next six majors, including two from Stringer at important stages, to rebuild a match-winning lead. There was pressure on Stringer after what coach Ben Rutten dubbed a ""poor"" return from injury the previous week and he had no impact in the first half against St Kilda. However, the explosive forward provided the spark when needed with 2.1 from nine disposals in the third term to help stave off the Saints' challenge. It led to Essendon's third win of a disappointing campaign, snapping a four-match losing streak in the process. For St Kilda (8-5), the result was a blown chance to move into the top-four amid a hot race for finals spots. Zach Merrett (25 disposals), Dylan Shiel (25) and Jye Caldwelll (23) won plenty of the ball in Parish's absence and Peter Wright kicked four goals in his 100th game. Andrew McGrath impressed in defence, where the Bombers were undermanned but stood tall. St Kilda's forwards had a distinct height advantage but rarely managed to make it count, with Max King (one goal) and Tim Membrey having little impact against Jordan Ridley and Jayden Laverde. Small forwards Jade Gresham (three goals), Jack Higgins and Jack Billings (both two) were dangerous around goal for the Saints. Gresham was outstanding with 28 disposals and four clearances, with Jack Sinclair (31 disposals) busy as always. Criticised for a flat start to their 150th anniversary match against Carlton last week, the Bombers turned up the pressure and pounced on St Kilda's early errors. It led to a 16-point Essendon lead at the first break that would have been greater if not for some wayward shots at goal. The margin grew to 28 points by half-time as seven different goal-kickers gave the Bombers their second-highest first-half score of the season. Rowan Marshall and Paddy Ryder kicked the opening two goals of the second half from marks to kick-start the Saints' challenge before Essendon steadied and hung on for a big upset.

81,Three tries in four minutes: Late North Queensland hurricane blows Manly away ,sport," Sport North Queensland storm home against Manly, Storm end Brisbane's winning streak It was another big Friday of NRL action with North Queensland scoring three tries in four minutes late in the match to blow Manly away before Melbourne handed Brisbane their first defeat in almost three months. Check out all the news, scores and stats below. A second-half collapse from Manly has handed North Queensland a 28-26 win at Brookvale Oval, but the Cowboys were left counting the cost of a mounting injury toll. Leading 26-12 with seven minutes to go on Friday night, the Sea Eagles imploded as tries from Connelly Lemuelu, Reece Robson and an 85-metre effort from Valentine Holmes in the space of four minutes flipped the script to ensure Todd Payten's men return to Townsville with two competition points. They will do so heavily scarred, however, with Queensland State of Origin hopefuls Reuben Cotter and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow going down with injury. Cotter, who made his Maroons debut with a sterling performance in Origin I, pulled out of the warm-up with a hamstring complaint. Tabuai-Fidow, who had been vying with teammate Murray Taualgi to take Xavier Caotes' spot on the wing, failed a HIA. The 20-year-old flyer copped a bang to the head when Manly centre Morgan Harper slid in with his knees while the Cowboys winger was picking up a loose ball. Without the talismanic Cotter the Cowboys were slow out of the blocks, with Christian Tuipolotu and Morgan Harper putting the Sea Eagles ahead 10-0 after 24 minutes. Coen Hess batted back a Chad Townsend aerial bomb with Townsend regathering and kicking a speculative cross-field kick out to Holmes. The Cowboys centre tiptoed down the sideline and then dotted down to get North Queensland's first of the night and cut Manly's halftime lead to just four. Jeremiah Nanai and Tuipolotu traded tries and with a narrow lead, and having lost Kieran Foran to a HIA, Manly needed a moment of inspiration. It came in the shape of a 40/20 kick from workmanlike hooker Lachlan Croker, who pounced on an in-goal grubber from Daly Cherry-Evans on the next to push Manly ahead. Croker soon doubled his tally to push the Sea Eagles out to 26-12 with 15 minutes to go. But with good field position the Cowboys were able to chip away at the hosts' advantage. Robson dived over from close range after a Nanai offload before Lemulemu backed up a Taulagi break. With five minutes left on the clock, Cherry-Evans had the ball dislodged from his grasp after a scrum and Holmes picked it up to run the length of the field. Cherry-Evans had a crack at a 50-metre field goal on the last play of the game but his effort faded away to the right of the sticks. AAP Melbourne have shown Brisbane who is boss, winning their NRL top-four clash 32-20 in an arm-wrestle on Friday night. The Broncos hadn't won in Melbourne since 2016 but arrived with high hopes of breaking that drought and banking an eighth successive win. The teams were locked at 16-16 at halftime, with Brisbane winger Corey Oates crossing twice to put his hand up to replace injured Xavier Coates in the Queensland State of Origin line-up. Storm winger Dean Ieremia then took his turn to shine, collecting his own double in the second half as the home side got back on top. Both times Melbourne sent the ball wide with centre Justin Olam finding the youngster on the fly. Melbourne dominated the early exchanges and came up with the first try of the night with Tui Kamikamika running on to a Harry Grant pass and crashing over line. But the Broncos got their motors started and scored three times in nine minutes to hit the front. As well as Oates' haul, Maroons flyer Selwyn Cobbo touched down on the other wing. With skipper Adam Reynolds out with a rib injury, Tyrone Roberts stood up in the No.7 jersey with his kicking and passing game en pointe. In the Cobbo try he took on hard-hitting Storm centre Justin Olam and then fired a cut-out pass for the 20-year-old to dive across in the corner. Kotoni Staggs' sideline conversion opened up a 16-6 lead for Brisbane after 28 minutes but they let Melbourne back into the game as halftime closed. Cobbo spilt a Jahrome Hughes' kick that was pounced on for Cameron Munster to score and then Hughes and fullback Nick Meaney combined before the halfback showed his speed to race to the line to level. After six tries in the opening stanza they proved harder to come by in the second half with Ieremia coming up with the goods in the 56th and 63rd minutes. Hughes capped a starring performance with a clever grubberkick into the in-goal which he followed up to put the result out of doubt. Ezra Mam scored a consolation try with three minutes on the clock after a Billy Walters' break but it was the second-placed Storm's night.

82,'I just hope we can make this normal': Supercars hit the track in Darwin with inaugural Indigenous Round,sport,"  Young Indigenous racers take the track for Supercars' inaugural Indigenous Round in Darwin's Hidden Valley Ryan Jenyns has loved motor racing for as long as he can remember. The event is the inaugural Indigenous round for Supercars The Racing Together team is training young Indigenous motorists as a pathway into the sport The team has plans for expansion into the Northern Territory in coming years He's always wanted to be part of a racing team, but while he was growing up, there were no Indigenous role models in the sport for him to look up to. ""We've definitely been treated a bit differently and looked down on a little bit. But I definitely think we can make a change,"" he said. The change Jenyns is hoping to usher in has its roots in his team, Racing Together, which travelled from Queensland to be part of the Supercars Darwin Triple Crown. The team is full of First Nations youths looking to make their mark in the sport. From Friday and across the weekend, they are taking part the inaugural Indigenous Round of Supercars. Braedyn Cidoni is the driver of the team's prized Hyundai Excel, which is competing in the combined sedans category. He said having an Indigenous round was a good initiative. ""It's good to see them actually making a difference,"" he said. ""Seeing all the Indigenous liveries has been massive."" While the team want to increase First Nations representation in Australian motorsports, they say they are focused on the job at hand. ""I just hope we can make this just normal, because it hasn't been normal,"" Jenyns said. Brimming with confidence, team manager Tristin Mitchell-Delaney said the team was loving both the weather in Darwin and its chances at winning the category. ""It's a good atmosphere … I think we have a pretty high chance. We're already in the top four without being able to get into fifth gear,"" he said. Garry Connelly and wife Monique are the team behind Racing Together. Before starting the team, Mr Connelly said he spotted a gap in representation in Australian motorsports. ""We looked at the Australian motorsport scene and there's something like 30,000 people employed, and there were no Indigenous people,"" he said. ""I think ultimately what we're doing is setting an example."" The team trains young First Nations people in the sport in the hopes to secure full-time jobs in the sector. So far, the plan appears to be working. ""We've had three of our first intake of 10 already get full-time jobs in motorsport-related industries,"" Mr Connelly said. Mr Connelly said the achievements of the team so far were only the beginning. ""What we'd like to do is to expand into Townsville later this year, and then hopefully our next step after that will be Darwin,"" he said. ""I think it'd be great for the for the Indigenous kids up here to have something like this to get involved in.""

He said he learnt a lot from the tough, physical game. ""Their strikers just didn't stop moving and they are obviously just so experienced from playing overseas in South America and their striker plays in Italy at the moment,"" he said. ""To know that we can match it with the top teams in the world, push the boundaries of the better teams, compete with them physically, tactically — just gives so much confidence."" It has been a rollercoaster ride going from top club player for the Central Coast Mariners in the 2021/22 season to an appearance for the A-League All Stars team against Spanish giants Barcelona in Sydney to selection for Australia against Peru. He has also locked in a three-year contract with Scottish club Heart of Midlothian. ""I am going to be a third (Australian) over there at this current time and there has been a fair few before my time as well,"" he said.

Bloom said the win was particularly sweet because it was the first time she had ever been out in the water without her husband Cam pushing her onto waves. Bloom said she was surprised when the competition organisers deemed she had the upper body strength to compete without him. ""I was super nervous, but then in my mind I was like, 'OK, what have you wanted to do ever since your accident', and that is to be able to go surfing on my own,"" Bloom said. ""So I competed on my own and I did pretty well; I won! I couldn't believe it. It was awesome."" Mark ""Mono"" Stewart from Byron Bay, a veteran of competitive adaptive surfing, took out the men's Any Kneeling Kneel division. Coming off a perfect-score tube ride in one of his heats,  Stewart snuck in the overall win by a margin of 0.04. In the midst of treatment for a melanoma tumour in his lung, Stewart said he thought he was travelling to Hawaii to farewell his friends. However, a month before the competition, a scan revealed the tumour had halved in size. ""So I went over there with the full intent of saying, I will see you all again."" Stewart said the positive atmosphere of the competition and the Hawaiian ""mana"" helped him go from from being wheelchaired down to the water at the beginning of the competition, to striding into the water. ""The gods were looking after me, you have no idea how happy I am at the moment."" Twenty-six-year-old Adelaide surfer Jocelyn Neumueller won the prone assist women's division, only two years after first getting into the sport. Nuemueller said she was stoked to be involved in the inaugural professional event for adaptive surfers. ""It is so great to be recognised as professional athletes, with a world championship tour to compete in, that also offers prize money,"" she said. ""This is a great step forward for equality in the sport, but also in raising awareness of the sport and its benefits, and getting more people involved."" Lennox Head surfer Matt Formston won the men's Partial Vision division, in conditions he described as 'challenging' because of a lack of swell. Formston was assisted by his spotter, coach and best mate Michael ""Crispy"" Crisp. Crisp said the Australian performance in Hawaii was extraordinary. ""It's just amazing to see surfers that are often in wheelchairs, just have such inspiration and touch and feel with waves."" A fifth Australian competing in Hawaii was South Australia's Chloe Murnane, who came third in the prone assist division. The team will be ranked in first place as the competitors wax up for the next event to be held in California in September. Australia is also set to host an event when the tour heads to Surf Lakes wave pool in Yeppoon in August next year.

85,"Called up for Matildas friendlies, Mackenzie Hawkesby takes her chance to stake World Cup claim",sport,"  Matildas next gen Mackenzie Hawkesby takes a chance to stake her claim for World Cup selection Mackenzie Hawkesby dreamed of playing for the Matildas as a little girl while growing up in Figtree in Wollongong, and this week she received that call-up to the national women's squad. ""This is about the proudest moment you can have as a person,"" she said. ""It's something that you wait for and want as a footballer, but to get the actual call was really surreal. ""When the squad was announced there was a lot of emotions. It's been a whirlwind couple of days and I'm really thankful."" After an outstanding A-League Women's season, the 22-year-old Sydney FC midfielder helped secure Sydney a grand final birth, scoring five goals in the season including a hat trick against the Wellington Phoenix. Described as The Sky Blues' playmaker, Hawkesby was named the squad's Player of the Year. ""[I] had a great season with Sydney and [was] very happy with how the team went and my overall performance in that,"" she said. ""I was able to show a bit more of the player I am like and I am hoping that can transition me into the national squad."" The former Illawarra Stingray is one of the fresh faces Matildas head coach Tony Gustavsson has called up as part of the 24-player squad to take on Spain and Portugal in the June FIFA International Window. Hawkesby will be joined by five of her Sydney FC teammates as some of the senior members of the national squad including Sam Kerr, Caitlin Foord, Hayley Raso, and Alanna Kennedy are given a rest. The roster still includes a lot of experience with Clare Polkinghorne, Emily Van Egmond, Katrina Gorry, and Emily Gielnik, with the Matilda's longest-serving goalkeeper Lydia Williams expected to notch up her 100th cap in the friendlies. ""This squad is a mixture of the new generation coming through, plus a mixture of the other generation that has been there for a while, so it is huge opportunity for me,"" Hawkesby said. She will fly to Europe on Sunday to join the camp in preparation for the friendlies against Spain, ranked 7th in the world, and Portugal. ""I think Spain are one of the top teams in the world, a lot of the girls there have played for Barcelona so I think it is going to be a really good test and challenge for us to see what we are like,"" she said. She is hoping her first call up to play for the Matildas is a chance to stake her claim for 2023 World Cup selection. ""I know what the Matildas DNA is all about, it's about that never-say-die attitude,"" Hawkesby said. The Matildas will face the two Euros-bound nations on Sunday, June 26, and Wednesday, June 29, with coverage live and free on Network Ten and Paramount+.

86,'One of the all-timers': Curry claims finals MVP as Warriors claim NBA title,sport," Sport Golden State Warriors claim NBA title after Steph Curry masterclass downs Boston Celtics The Golden State Warriors are NBA champions once again, topping the Boston Celtics 103-90 on Thursday night for their fourth title in the last eight seasons. Stephen Curry, who was named the finals MVP, scored 34 points for the Warriors. It is the franchise's seventh championship overall. And this one completed a journey like none other, after a run of five consecutive finals, then a plummet to the bottom of the NBA, and now a return to greatness just two seasons after having the league's worst record. For Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and 2015 Finals MVP Andre Iguodala, it is a fourth championship. The first three rings came in 2015, 2017 and 2018, when Golden State was dynastic and made five consecutive trips to the finals — the first four of which formed a fierce rivalry against LeBron James's Cleveland Cavaliers. Injuries, including ones that sidelined Thompson for two-and-a-half years, and roster changes changed everything. But this season, with Thompson returning around the midway point, the Warriors were finally back. Champions again, denying the storied Celtics what would have been their record 18th championship, one that would have allowed Boston to break a tie with the Los Angeles Lakers for the most in league history. This tale for the Warriors ended much differently than their previous finals appearance against Toronto in 2019, which saw Kevin Durant tear his Achilles tendon in Game 5 and then Thompson tear his ACL in what became the Raptors' title-clincher in Game 6. The aftermath of that loss was exacerbated by Durant's decision to leave that summer in free agency to join the Brooklyn Nets and Thompson's own Achilles injury while rehabilitating his knee injury. It thrust a Golden State team into a rebuild that became a reload. The Warriors used their two-year hiatus from the NBA's biggest stages to retool their roster – adding past number one draft pick Andrew Wiggins — who excelled in his first finals, stepping in as top-scorer when Curry struggled in Game 5 — along with another rising star in Jordan Poole. For Golden State coach Steve Kerr, it is a ninth championship overall after winning five as a player. He is the sixth coach to capture four titles, joining former mentors Phil Jackson and Gregg Popovich, as well as Red Auerbach, John Kundla and Pat Riley. Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 34 points in Game 6. Al Horford added 19. Jayson Tatum finished with 13 points, but shot just 6/18 from the field. Boston also committed 22 turnovers, which was perhaps the biggest nail in their coffin. It was just the fifth defeat in 22 title-series appearances for the Celtics, who turned their season around to have a chance at this crown. Boston was 25-25 after 50 games, then went on an absolute tear to get to the finals and nearly claim what would have been just the franchise's second championship since 1986. It was the third consecutive season affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, and while things were closer to normal, pictures and video of the championship celebration will forever serve as a reminder that the virus was still an issue. NBA commissioner Adam Silver could not be at the game because he remained in the league's health and safety protocols related to the virus. The redesigned Larry O'Brien Trophy – the golden souvenir given to the NBA champions – was presented to the Warriors by deputy commissioner Mark Tatum instead.

87,Netball Australia boss open to gambling sponsorship amid financial struggles,sport,"  Netball Australia CEO Kelly Ryan open to gambling sponsorship but denies organisation is facing financial ruin Netball Australia CEO Kelly Ryan has denied reports that the sport is on the verge of financial collapse but says it must look for ""commercial opportunities outside the sport"", which could include gambling sponsorships, as it works to repay its debts and stabilise the organisation. Speaking on ABC News Breakfast on Friday, Ryan, who took over as CEO last year, said taking money from gambling companies was not ""out of the realms of possibility"" as the organisation looked to generate more revenue following reports that its coffers took a $7.2 million hit over the past two years, leaving the organisation in $4 million of debt. ""The reality is that gambling sponsorships are very significant and very lucrative in sports,"" Ryan said. ""Netball has to put itself a little bit more outside its comfort zone in terms of what it does contemplate and consider. ""A lot of things have to make sense for a deal of that nature, but there are plenty of other commercial opportunities that sit outside the sport as well that haven't been materialised yet, and that is something we've got to take a really good look at. ""We have to understand the commercial viability of the [Super Netball] league, the make-up of the assets and how it flows between teams and the league, and more importantly, we need to drive the consumer connection with the sport: turning the grassroots participation base, which is incredibly strong across the whole country, into avid fans of Super Netball and also the Diamonds. ""That will help propel the commercial model of the sport, so that's what we're fixated on now."" Ryan's comments come the day after a News Corp investigation claimed that years of poor financial management dating back to the beginning of the SN series, as well as an over-reliance on special government handouts, had meant the sport could face foreclosure within 12 months if debts were not settled. The report suggested that NA did not have ""a commercially viable plan"" after walking away from the Trans-Tasman series to launch the current competition in 2016, with consecutive years of revenue losses resulting in debts of approximately $4 million that must be paid by the end of 2023. Following a damning report into Netball Australia's finances, tensions with its own players are reaching breaking-point. Ryan was not part of NA when that decision was made, but said the move to the SN from the Trans-Tasman series was in the sport's best interests at the time. ""It's definitely not a mistake,"" she told ABC Local Radio earlier on Friday. ""I think that the league is phenomenal. It is an absolutely first-class league with first-class athletes, so it's definitely not a mistake. ""What we need to do from a sport point of view is make sure it realises its full potential from a commercial [perspective]. Unfortunately, female sport doesn't attract the value in sponsorship dollars that some of our male counterpart sports do, so we really need to challenge and change that because it is absolutely worth the investment in every sense. ""The sport offers a lot and gives back a lot, so we just need to be focused that it is a commercial asset, that netball is a commercial business, and we need to start thinking with that mindset so we can change the way it's been tracking."" Another strategic decision, which caused outrage among fans and players, included selling the 2022 SN grand final to Perth — a decision Ryan said was geared towards netball's overall growth strategy. ""The decision to move the grand final this year was absolutely a decision that we made a number of weeks ago. We did think that was in the best interests of the sport,"" she said. ""It makes so much sense from a sustainability point of view, but more importantly, the ability to strategically grow the sport across different parts of the country. ""So it was a big move and it was a bold move, and I know it's challenging when you do make big changes, but that's the position that we're in. ""We don't want to limp out of the situation that we're in; we want to come out of it really quickly and really strongly and therefore we've got to make some of these really tough commercial decisions, but we do it because we know the sport is going to be better for it."" According to the report, other issues that have affected netball's financial position include the previous broadcast deal, increased player payments (which consume 92.85 per cent of the new broadcast money), and bank loans on assets.

88,'It's not a great look': Richmond coach takes aim at Bolton after he taunted Blues opponent,sport," Sport 'It's not a great look': Damien Hardwick responds to Shai Bolton showboating during Richmond's clash with Carlton Shai Bolton made a mistake in taunting opponent Sam Docherty before kicking an important goal in Richmond's narrow AFL win over Carlton, Tigers coach Damien Hardwick says. Bolton caused controversy early in the final quarter of Thursday night's contest at the MCG when he held the ball aloft in front of the chasing Blues defender while running into an open goal. It was the first major of the final term in a fiery contest but Bolton's premature celebration almost came back to bite him on the backside as the Tigers rode a late challenge and hung on to win by 15 points. ""It's not us, it's not what we're about and he'll be regretful, no question,"" Hardwick said. ""He'll be accountable and responsible for it. ""It's certainly not part of who he is and part of what we are. ""We're disappointed but we'll work our way through it and support him and he'll learn some great lessons from it. ""It's not a great look."" The incident seemingly stemmed from an exchange between Bolton and Docherty during a three-quarter time melee, which flared up when Patrick Cripps took exception to a push from Dion Prestia that caused the Blues' skipper to hit his head on teammate Sam Walsh's leg. The majority of players from both sides rushed to remonstrate with each other as tension boiled over between the traditional rivals. Hardwick said Bolton's action was likely borne out of frustration after his previous confrontation with Docherty. ""Yeah, probably, but the reality is that's what footy is all about,"" Hardwick said. ""One of the things we always want to do is honour our competition and that (action) does go against that."" Carlton coach Michael Voss tried to play a straight bat when quizzed on Bolton's decision to taunt Docherty. ""I wouldn't even dare dream to coach a player from another team,"" Voss said. ""That's for Dimma (Hardwick) to deal with and I'll deal with my own players. ""I'm pretty firm on that. ""If he feels that (action is) adequate, well, that's fine, but I won't be losing any sleep over it.""

89,Injury scare for Steve Smith as Sri Lanka defeats Australia second ODI,sport," Sport Injury scare for Steve Smith as Sri Lanka defeats Australia in second ODI in Pallekele Australia will be sweating on the fitness of Steve Smith after the star batsman appeared to tweak a leg muscle during the tourists' 26-run ODI loss to Sri Lanka. Chasing 216 for victory off 43 overs under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method on Thursday (local time), Australia was on track at 5-170, with Glenn Maxwell in hot form at Pallekele. But Maxwell's departure for 30 off 25 balls and the run-out of Alex Carey (15) sparked a collapse of 5-19 as Australia was bowled out for 189 in 37.1 overs. Sri Lanka had posted 9-220 in 47.4 overs before a rain delay of more than two hours halted proceedings. The home side's fighting victory levelled the five-match series at 1-1. Sri Lanka paceman Chamika Karunaratne was the hero with 3-47, snaring the key scalps of Smith and Maxwell to go with his run-out of Carey. Smith called for medical attention after pulling up lame while pushing hard for a second run during Australia's run chase. The 33-year-old received strapping to his left thigh area, and was able to bat on. Smith was dismissed a few overs later for 28. A two-Test series against Sri Lanka starts on June 29. Australia has endured a horror run with injuries during the tour, with Ashton Agar (side), Marcus Stoinis (side), Sean Abbott (finger), Kane Richardson (hamstring), Mitchell Starc (finger) and Mitch Marsh (hamstring) all injured. Stoinis, Abbott and Richardson have already been sent home, while Agar is no guarantee to play again on tour. ""I'm definitely not playing any more of the one-dayers,"" Agar said. ""I've got a bit of a tear in my side, which isn't great. ""Hopefully, maybe around the second Test match (I can return), being optimistic."" Agar's injury had a silver lining, with debutant spinner Matthew Kuhnemann proving he will be more than a handy back-up ahead of next year's ODI World Cup in India. Kuhnemann snared 2-48 off 10 overs in an impressive ODI debut, with the left-armer adapting to the conditions expertly. Mitchell Swepson struggled at times in just his third ODI appearance, finishing with 1-58 off his 10 overs. Maxwell was full of smiles on the way to 2-35 off 10 overs, while pace aces Pat Cummins (4-35 off 8.4 overs) and Josh Hazlewood (0-26 off seven) were at their impressive best. But it was the performance of Kuhnemann that would have given the national selectors the biggest satisfaction given the need for spinning depth at the 2023 ODI World Cup. ""We were on our way to get on the team bus for the Aussie A squad,"" Kuhnemann explained of his call-up. ""I got a tap on the shoulder from the selector on tour, and he told myself and [Travis] Head to pack our bags and get to Kandy as soon as possible. ""It's been pretty crazy. Pretty overwhelmed at the moment. ""I was so nervous. When Finchy told me I was going to open the bowling alongside Josh, I didn't know what to expect.""

90,These stories show sports journalism is about more than noise and action,sport," Sport AIPS Awards show sports journalism has moved on from mere results and action. It's about changing lives Beyond the noise of a sporting contest – be it a FIFA World Cup qualifier, an Olympic 100m sprint, or a junior basketball match at a suburban court – lies a complex web of back stories that have given rise to the growing genre of sports journalism, quite separate to sports reporting. Those who choose to specialise in it use the prism of sport to explain the complexities of the world we live in with its geopolitical, cultural and social divides. This week in Doha, as the Socceroos wrote the next chapter in their own individual and collective histories, a group of sports journalists from every continent gathered in the same city to have their work recognised at the International Sports Press Association (AIPS) Awards gala. The photographic portfolios, investigations, colour pieces and broadcast documentaries revealed an incredible depth of story-telling excellence that often goes unnoticed. ""One hundred and seventy-two runners started this ultramarathon – 21 of them never came back."" So began the gold medal-winning ""best colour piece"" by Wufei Yu (China) and Will Ford (USA) published in Runner's World. It's a haunting account from those who survived the tragedy of China's 2021 Yellow River Stone Forest ultramarathon. Experience counted for nothing as a freak cold snap left runners stranded between checkpoints, unable to go forward, too cold to go back. From the lead group of six, only one survived. The story asks how it all went so wrong, speaking to survivors, some of whom are still struggling with what they experienced. This is not just the reporting of a sports event, this is journalism at its finest. ""I think sports journalism is often associated only with celebrity and entertainment culture,"" Ford told The Ticket. ""But there's so much greater humanity you can highlight through its lens – especially in the social, political, and anthropological sense."" In the far west of Ghana, on the banks of the Pra River, is a small town described by journalist Francis Hema as 'inspiring footnotes rather than headlines'. He won the Best Broadcaster Young Reporters category with his story of hope emerging from what many might call a village of despair. Young boys, children of subsistence farmers and fishers, dream of an alternative universe where they are big-time footballers playing on a world stage: they play for the Pra Babies Football Club where a young coach struggles himself to teach the boys, to feed them and kit them in order to develop within them a sense of pride in who they are and where life might take them. ""It's very difficult,"" coach Roland Fiifi Ackon tells Hema. ""You don't get support from anyone."" Hema focussed on Pra Babies but there are teams like it all over Ghana, it is where the journey started for many of the hundreds of Ghanaians now playing in every major league in the world. ""Young footballers in Ghana and Africa struggle a lot,"" Hema said. ""I hope my story on Pra Babies will change the narrative and the major stakeholders will give footballers at the grassroots the needed attention to help them reach their full potential. ""What drives me as a sports journalist is to see my stories impact the lives of people around me and the society at large."" French journalist Matthieu Darnon won the Video Documentary award for his confronting expose on the 28 seconds in the life of former F1 driver Romain Grosjean where he was literally on fire. The driver hit a metal barrier in the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix, splitting his car in half as it exploded into a fireball. His wife was watching live on TV thinking she had become a widow. His best friend was commentating the race, trying to remain in control and coherent as his mind was out of control, flooded with emotion as the devastating scene played out in front of him. Grosjean himself said he will never be the same and that, like his car at the time, his life now is in two parts – before and after November 29, 2020. ""I remember it all. There's a fire. I'm kind of stuck. And to be blunt I'm in deep shit. The body has relaxed, the brain is accepting, and they're both telling you that, well, this is the end."" Darnon, the documentary maker, said journalists who do what he does are in a privileged situation. ""As journalists of sports, we have the great chance to follow people who are testing the human limits, either mentally or physically, which brings them to situations that normal people couldn't even imagine,"" he said. ""Actually, it's quite rare to see your husband almost perish in flames live on TV. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""This is what I've tried to narrate in this documentary with Romain's experience in his car … what his family and his friends endured during those frightening seconds of his crash."" There is neither the time, nor the capacity, to list here in detail the merits of every award winner, but I wish I could. This small snapshot provides context to what it means to be a sports journalist. There were stories of war in Afghanistan and Ukraine, of Paralympians fleeing to compete in Tokyo after the Taliban took over their country knowing it was likely they would never return home or see their families again. There's a story of the Algerian men's football team of the 1980s who were unaware they'd been doped by their Russian coach until a number of them later in life gave birth to children who all had mental impairments. And there's one about a baseball team started in Fukushima to try to heal the people after a nuclear meltdown and tsunami left them broken and bereft. At the start of the awards function, held in the middle of Doha's Khalifa International Stadium — one of the venues for the FIFA 2022 Men's World Cup in December, AIPS President Gianno Merlo paid tribute to two journalists who for him personified what the awards, now in their fourth year, are all about. Shireen Abu Akleh was a Palestinian-American journalist who worked for Al Jazeera's Arabic channel before being shot dead in May this year while reporting on an Israeli raid on a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. Vladislav Dunaienko, an AIPS Young Reporter in 2019, is now an older, wiser Ukrainian who in the space of months went from reporting on football matches in his country to fighting the invading Russian military. ""I created these awards to give importance to what we do,"" Merlo said. ""Because usually the journalists are very humble; in one way humble can sometimes also mean stupid. ""Not to promote your profession is crazy. We promote everybody else (in sport) but not ourselves when we do good. ""I can tell you – reading and looking and listening (to all the award nominations) I have learned a lot of things, some things that I could not imagine, and this is the most important thing… it can change lives. ""For this reason, I wanted to recognise Ukraine… because this young guy (Vlad Dunaienko) is really one of millions of young guys and others whose mental health has been destroyed by these events. ""In three months he became a different man, a man perhaps with less hope than before, with less enthusiasm. He will see always the dark side of the moon. ""These are the real stories, this is real life… human rights, match-fixing, corruption, the problems we face every day we must speak about. Working out of two rooms in Sydney, a quarantine hotel room in Brisbane and an office in London, this is how four people guided a large group of at-risk female athletes and their dependents to Kabul airport and onto RAAF planes. ""In 1969, for the first time, I went to cover the European Athletics Championships in Athens… the secretary-general of AIPS at that time was the man in charge of accreditation there. ""This guy gave me my first accreditation and it changed my life. So, for this reason, I hope to change the lives of somebody else."" Sports journalism tells us about more than sport, it reveals who we are, what drives us, showcasing our strengths and exposing our weaknesses. The work recognised in Doha this week was the pinnacle of more than 1700 submissions from over 130 countries – there was not a single match report or result amongst them, evidence that sports journalism has come of age. Tracey Holmes won first place in the audio category of the AIPS Sport Media Awards 2021, for her episode of The Ticket titled Afghanistan Rescue Mission, Australia Steps Up.

91,analysis: How Tonga can turn their golden generation into a glorious future,sport," Sport Can Tonga turn their golden generation into a new era of stars? A Tongan team sheet is eagerly awaited these days, but the most important names in Dean Young's squad for next Saturday's clash with New Zealand might have escaped your notice. It wasn't Daniel Tupou and Kotoni Staggs, because in the ""Origin vs Test"" discourse there's almost always only going to be one winner: interstate football surpassed the international game as the pinnacle of the sport some time ago. Tonga will almost definitely get them for the World Cup, but not when there's a blue jersey to be worn in Perth. It wasn't Moeaki Fotuaika or Joe Ofahengaue either, although they were important as well. The two props missed out on selection in the top 17 due to the quality of forwards available, a fair wrap given the two were playing for the Maroons this time last year and a mark of the increasing talent pool the Tongans have at their disposal. For the first time since he made his historic defection, it's not even Jason Taumalolo. The Cowboys lock changed international rugby league forever when he switched from New Zealand to Tonga in 2017, turning the Pacific Island nation into a powerhouse who have since beaten New Zealand, Great Britain and Australia. The pandemic warped everyone's perceptions of time and cost rugby league its best chance of capitalising on Tonga's rise – that 2017 World Cup and Tonga's run to the semifinals and the vision of Mt Smart Stadium turning into a singing sea of red flags for the semifinal against England, one of the greatest Test matches ever played, doesn't feel like it was five years ago. But it was, and the passage of time is why the most important Tongan players in Young's squad are potential debutants Talatau Amone, Tolotau Koula and Will Penisini. All three of them seem like stars of the future, but they are still at the beginning of their rugby league careers – Koula and Penisni are just 19, while Amone is the elder statesman of the group at 20. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. That means they were in their mid-teens when they saw Taumalolo pick up the red jersey over the black and white, when they saw Siosuia Taukeiaho, Manu Ma'u, Andrew Fifita and David Fusitu'a follow Taumalolo's lead, when they witnessed Tonga's brutalising win over New Zealand in Waikato and their gallant defeat to England in that semifinal. Their formative rugby league memories aren't just packed with NRL moments and Origin series, but also of Tongan triumphs. Players like Amone and Koula and Penisini are the final by-product of Taumalolo's decision all those years ago, the ripple effect we could not perceive back then but surely knew must have been coming. They are the first of the new generation, the sons of a tomorrow that was promised five years ago and has finally arrived. Taumalolo was always going to play well for Tonga — when he made his switch, he was arguably the best player in the world and certainly the best forward. Fifita had come off a brilliant Origin series for the Blues and was selected in the Kangaroos squad before coming home. Ma'u was one of the best backrowers in the league and Taukeiaho one of the best props. Fusitu'a was a year off becoming the NRL's top try scorer. It was as close to a golden generation of talent as Tonga were likely ever to get, but golden generations don't always keep glittering once everyone grows up and gets old and moves on. Coming across a boon of talented players who are all the same age is a blessing, but to make the most of that blessing it has to be converted into something more sustainable. That's easier said than done, and there's no exact formula for it, but Tonga has the chance to do it. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter Taumalolo and Tuakeiaho are the only members of that original five who have been named in Tonga's top 17 for next weekend. Fifita is in the extended squad but seems to have moved into the same elder statesman role he plays for the Sharks. Ma'u and Fusitu'a are in Super League and should make the World Cup squad, although competition will be fierce. The Tongan side finally has a past that was put up in lights and can be easily and fondly remembered, and the benefit of that comes in the future, in players like Amone, Koula and Penisini, and other potential debutants like Haumole Olakau'atu and Keaon Koloamatangi, who weren't there as players when the revolution began but were there as Tongans. The red jersey always meant a lot, back to the days Tonga played their first matches in the 1980s. It meant history and family and connecting to one's culture and giving back to the community that meant so much. But now, there are also past glories to celebrate and those glories inspire the next generation of players to emulate their heroes and create a legacy of their own. The record books might say Queensland's incredible Origin dynasty is over, but in new coach Billy Slater, the eight-year winning streak is still alive. And they can talk about those games from 2017 and beyond the same way Queenslanders talk about 1995 and the eight in a row, the same way New South Wales fans talk about 2014 and Bryan Fletcher's hand grenade, and the same way, in generations past when a Test jersey was the pinnacle of the sport, Australian fans would remember the Rorke's Drift Test and the Swinton Massacre and the Invincibles and the Unbeatables and all the other great Kangaroo sides. The past can be more than history and memory if it's used as the fuel that fires the present into the future. That's how a golden generation becomes more than just a good tournament or two or a handy win here and there. That's why Amone and Koula and Penisini, and other young players like 19-year-old halfback Isaiaya Katoa, are so important. Their Tongan careers are beginning in a brand-new world, a world where Tonga can stand up to anybody and bow to nobody, a world where Tonga isn't a stepping stone to something greater – they're just something great.

92,Tension mounts as relationship between players and Netball Australia reaches boiling point,sport,"  Tension mounts as relationship between Super Netball players and Netball Australia reaches boiling point Australian netballers say they are fed up with the governing body's lack of transparency, after another key decision regarding Super Netball was dropped on them with little notice and zero consultation. In response, Netball Australia (NA) acknowledged it had work to do to repair some of the hurt the players are feeling, but remained adamant it is committed to developing a sustainable sport. On June 1, with just two rounds left to play in the regular season, News Corp revealed the 2022 Super Netball grand final would be played at Perth Arena, after NA took bids from various state governments. Up until this point, the location for the biggest game of the year had almost always been determined by the victors of the major semi-final, rewarding the successful team with home-court advantage. Three days after the story broke, NA and the WA government publicly announced the news together, confirming the decision was financially motivated, divulging the dire situation the sport had found itself in during the pandemic, owing close to $4 million in debt and reporting a $7.2 million loss in revenue the past two years. Despite this, NA is set to give a large chunk of the $300,000 cash it will pocket in its estimated $650,000 grand final deal back to the players, with the champions set to be awarded $100,000 in prize money and the runners up receiving $25,000. The move raised eyebrows when it was announced, and even more so when NA pointed its finger at the players in a NewsCorp report on Thursday, suggesting one of the main reasons it is struggling is because the players receive 92.85 per cent of the sport's broadcast revenue for their wages. Former Diamonds shooter and recently retired Collingwood Magpies player Nat Medhurst told The Netty Life podcast she was confused. ""If you're in that much financial strain, why would you give away such a large portion of the cash component of the deal to the playing group – it really just feels like they're trying to buy them off,"" she said. ""It shows the board have zero idea or understanding of what motivates these players and the meaning associated with playing a game like this and potentially winning it in front of their home crowd."" The Australian Netball Players' Association (ANPA) released a statement on social media via their president, Diamonds defender Jo Weston, suggesting the tensions between the playing group and governing body were reaching breaking point. The biggest issue, they say, is the withheld information and absence of communication, considering the item was first raised by the NA board as an agenda with the eight club chief executives in late April, while players weren't informed of the plan (or of the desperate financial state of the sport) until the decision was already finalised four weeks later. Now these players, like Medhurst, are starting to question the board members' motives. ""I don't agree with the way it's been carried out and it makes me question whether these people are just using netball as a stepping stone, making these big decisions and then leaving a mess once they leave to try and get onto bigger boards,"" she said. ""I don't think they value our game, there is not enough communication between the board and the playing group or the clubs, so no-one understands where the board is actually coming from and what they hold valuable to them. ""I just hate the fact that we're selling ourselves so cheaply, we've done it for so many years … And that's gone as far as how much we sell off players to do appearances for absolutely nothing. … In the past media would only come to us because they needed to fill a gap and it all comes back to us devaluing ourselves because we have this reputation of just jumping for anything."" Medhurst's concerns would likely not be put to rest after NA signed a new ongoing broadcast deal with Fox Sports for this season that will only generate $7 million for netball per year when it actually costs $8 million per year to run the Super Netball competition. The findings of the independent State of the Game review, released in December 2020 and led by Australian legend Liz Ellis, suggested the sport needed to change its governance structure. Some of these recommendations were adopted, such as the merging of the Super Netball Commission and the NA board, now made up of five independent directors, three member-voted directors and chaired by Marina Go. But there were two other key recommendations made that are yet to be implemented. One of them was to ensure one of these people, at minimum, identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. The other was to add an athlete director that could speak on behalf of the players. This athlete director could not be a current member of the Diamonds or a Super Netball team but must have played in either of those capacities in the past 10 years. Former ANPA vice-president and Sunshine Coast Lightning player Maddy McAuliffe said if NA were to follow through on this, it would go a long way towards repairing its relationship with the players. McAuliffe made her national netball league debut with the Lightning in their inaugural season of 2017 and was an active member of the ANPA before stepping away from netball at the end of 2021. ""The input of the players was largely unconsidered the whole time I was playing,"" she told the ABC. ""It feels like players aren't being treated as key stakeholders and so having a position on the board would mean that you immediately get that representation and chance to drive player input. ""We completely understand the commercial aspect of the game and that other stakeholders need to be taken into consideration, but we have been left out of a lot of key decisions, including the recent grand final one, as well as others like the super shot, bonus points and more."" In the past three years, netball has attracted criticism for its handling of rule changes, salary cap breaches, player contracts and the CBA, standoffs between clubs over COVID-impacted matches and now this grand final decision. There has been a change in leadership during this time, as of June last year, when Kelly Ryan took over as chief executive and promised a new era of transparency. The super shot, in particular, shows NA has made a habit of dropping bombshells on the Super Netball competition within mere weeks before they come into effect. Despite previous objections from players and fans, the polarising rule was introduced six weeks ahead of the 2020 season, when teams were in the final stages of their preseason preparations with their rosters already determined. To make matters worse, the players were told it was going to happen three months after they had agreed to take a 70 per cent pay cut in order to keep the sport running. Finding out the news a day or so before it was announced to the public. ""The frustration for the players has been that, historically, we've always been incredibly cooperative with NA and have consistently acted in the best interests of the sport,"" McAuliffe said. ""At the beginning of the COVID outbreak in Australia, we were asked to take a significant pay cut for five weeks, before JobKeeper later became available. ""The minimum salary was $30,000 a year then, so if you think about the enormity of that type of reduction, those players are earning like $200 to $300 a week – which is barely enough to pay rent – and overnight we got 80 players to agree to that. ""So when NA come out and say things like 'the decision-making process was too quick, we couldn't consult the players', it really is tough for us to understand because we've sacrificed our own interests for the betterment of the sport and done so on a really tight turnaround before."" With players about to head into Super Netball finals and the Diamonds off to Birmingham for the Commonwealth Games not long after that, they say their focus will be diverted in the coming months and that it will be hard for them to keep pushing their message. Although some have spoken about the potential of protesting in some way to wake up NA, McAuliffe said this anger is unlikely to come in the form of a strike as the players are aware of the negative impact this could have on their fans and young netballers who want to see them play. It will be interesting whether these tensions see them push harder in their negotiations for the Diamonds collective player agreement that are currently underway and set to be finalised before the upcoming Games. ""It really is about Netball Australia making it clear that they're going to involve us in the decision-making processes about the competition,"" McAuliffe said. ""At the end of the day that's what you want on any board anyway; you want representation of your key stakeholders, you want people to understand the commercial reality, but you also want people to understand the players' point of view … the other thing that would be helpful in that sense is that our players are very involved at a grassroots level, so we actually have a good grasp with what the fans want too."" Chief executive Kelly Ryan has offered a response on the matter: ""We know there is work to do within the sport to repair some of the hurt the players are feeling. Our players are now seeing the financial difficulty of the sport and we remain committed to developing a strong and sustainable sport — that will mean sometimes we will need to make decisions quickly if we believe the industry will be better for it. There are decisions for the organisation to determine, and there are decisions that we absolutely need to consult the players about. Netball Australia has a number of key stakeholders, including the players, and it isn't always possible to consult all stakeholders when matters are commercial in confidence. Last year Netball Australia and its eight voting Member Organisations unanimously endorsed reforms to create the foundation for a more dynamic, efficient and innovative administration of Australia's number one participation sport. One of the key reforms was a commitment to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and athlete representatives are appointed to Board positions in accordance with the State of the Game Review recommendations. We are currently seeking nominations from Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander candidates to join the Board, and we hope to make an appointment as soon as possible. There are currently no further Director vacancies on the Board, but we are committed to appointing an athlete representative as soon a position becomes available. Our sport will be better for having First Nations and athlete representation at the Board level.""

93,Dragons far too good for Souths in Wollongong,sport," Sport St George Illawarra Dragons beat South Sydney 32-12 in Wollongong South Sydney's NRL season has hit its lowest ebb, flogged 32-12 by St George Illawarra with rookie halfback Lachlan Ilias hooked during a first-half mauling in Wollongong. In easily their worst performances of the year, the Rabbitohs trailed 32-0 at half-time with Ilias benched by coach Jason Demetriou after just 28 minutes. The first-half effort marked the Dragons' best opening 40 minutes since April 2001, with Ben Hunt superb in attack and Zac Lomax far improved on last week's loss to North Queensland. Mikaele Ravalawa bagged a double on the right wing, while Talatau Amone had easily his best game in first grade. The win lifted the Dragons back into the top eight for the first time since round two, helping them celebrate Andrew McCullough's 300th game in style. And while Souths managed a minor fightback midway through the second half, it did little to paper over the cracks of a team that has suffered from inconsistency all year. The Rabbitohs missed 21 tackles in the first half alone, as the Dragons kept pace with the clock for the majority of the opening 40. The hosts' first try set the tone for the night, when Lomax hauled in a Hunt kick and stepped his way through the defence and put his half-back over. Hunt had a hand in another try when he went to the line and put Jack de Belin through some poor defence, while he also kicked for Moses Suli to set up another four-pointer. Fullback Cody Ramsey claimed a try in the first-half rush, while Ravalawa was the beneficiary of a Lomax flick pass when he twice brushed off Alex Johnston in the one play. Even Cameron Murray was not immune to the defensive errors, beaten by Amone when the Dragons' five-eighth skipped around him and put Ravalawa across. About the only thing more lacklustre than the Rabbitohs' defence was the stadium security, who allowed a pitch invader to stay on field for a full minute. The man seemingly became bored as he jogged up and down the field, before he was eventually stopped by Dragons forward Blake Lawrie with security only walking to him. The stoppage at least briefly sprung the Rabbitohs into action, with Damien Cook and Murray both crossing shortly after. But their faint chance of a comeback was quickly killed off when Hunt intercept a ball on his own line, capping off a superb night for the Dally M leader. The Rabbitohs will at least get Latrell Mitchell back in round 16 against Parramatta, but questions loom over Ilias' place in the team after his early benching.

94,Tigers take top eight spot with win in the wet over Carlton,sport," Sport Richmond beats Carlton by 15 points on wet night at the MCG, as Tigers grab a spot in the top eight Bookends Tom Lynch and Dylan Grimes have helped Richmond to a 15-point win over a fast-finishing Carlton, lifting them back into the AFL's top eight. The Tigers, with three goals from Lynch and Grimes keeping Charlie Curnow quiet, led by as much as 35 points and rode a huge fourth-quarter challenge to prevail 11.15 (81) to 9.12 (66) at a wet MCG. The Tigers (8-5) have now won six of their last seven games and are looming large ahead of a huge game against Geelong next week. But there was a sour note to their latest triumph, with tall utility Noah Balta substituted out of the match with a hamstring injury in the final term. Already undermanned, Carlton lost Jack Martin (lower leg) and mid-season draftee Sam Durdin (knee) to injuries. The Blues (9-4) also squandered the chance to draw level with each of the top three teams with 10 wins apiece. Richmond kicked the first six goals in persistent rain on Thursday night and led by 28 points early in the final term before three goals from Harry McKay in four minutes flipped the game on its head. A Jack Newnes snap appeared to have put the Blues back within three points with all the momentum on their side, but was correctly ruled touched on review. Less than a minute later, Shai Bolton won a contest with Sam Docherty at half-forward and set up Maurice Rioli Jnr, who passed off to Shane Edwards for the Tigers' steadying goal. Bolton had caused controversy at the start of the final term when he taunted Docherty on the way into an open goal and it almost came back to bite him. The incident seemingly stemmed from an exchange during a three-quarter time melee, which flared up when Patrick Cripps took exception to a push from Dion Prestia that caused the Blues' skipper to hit his head on teammate Sam Walsh's leg. Richmond midfielder Prestia (33 disposals, 13 clearances) stood up in the absence of superstar Dustin Martin, who missed through illness. Liam Baker (27 disposals), Kane Lambert (22) and ruckman Toby Nankervis were also influential as the Tigers' engine room got on top. Cripps had 34 disposals in his 150th game and Walsh (34) was busy throughout against the tide, while McKay finished with four goals. Carlton, held goalless in the final quarter against Essendon in round 13, didn't manage a major against Richmond until George Hewett's hurried snap floated through at the 16-minute mark of the second term.

95,Western Bulldogs star Bailey Smith banned for illicit drug use,sport," Sport Western Bulldogs' Bailey Smith banned for two matches by AFL for conduct unbecoming over drug photos Western Bulldogs star midfielder Bailey Smith has been banned for two games by the AFL for ""conduct unbecoming"". The action follows an AFL investigation after the emergence on social media of pictures and video, from late 2021, showing Smith with a bag of white powder at a party — the 21-year-old later admitted using illicit substances. The ban is in addition to his existing two-match suspension for headbutting Geelong's Zach Tuohy, so Smith will not be available for the Bulldogs until round 18. The AFL said in a statement that Smith would also be unavailable to play VFL matches during the period of his suspension. The Bulldogs accepted the length of the ban and released a statement saying they would continue to support Smith's wellbeing. ""Bailey has shown clear contrition and remorse over recent days, and has spoken openly and maturely about his challenges,"" Bulldogs chief executive Ameet Bains said in the statement. ""As we have stated, we do not condone the behaviour in question and remain very disappointed it occurred. ""We are pleased however that Bailey has assumed unqualified responsibility for the mistake he has made and is intent on learning from it. ""We will continue to strongly support Bailey through this difficult period. Our primary responsibility to him and all of our players is to ensure that their health and wellbeing is safeguarded."" Smith has been one of the biggest breakout players in the AFL, playing a key role in the Western Bulldogs' run to last year's grand final. He took time away from the game after the season for mental health reasons and said during that time he made poor decisions, admitting to using illicit substances. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""After much reflection, I am now in a position to confess to indulging in behaviours in late 2021 of which I am deeply ashamed,"" Smith said in a statement last week after the release of the images. ""I do not have an excuse for those behaviours, however the state of my mental health over that period post grand final dramatically deteriorated, and I spiralled out of control, leading to poor decision making and actions at the time. ""The depth of my emotions over that period, coupled with some of my behaviours, have reminded me that, as a person, I am still very much a work-in-progress.""

96,Daria Saville's injury comeback continues with return to world's top-100 rankings ,sport," Sport Daria Saville completes return to world's top-100 players for the first time since August 2019 Daria Saville has made the long, tough climb back into the world's top 100 players despite being knocked out in the WTA grass-court event in Berlin. Australia's number two proved no match on the green stuff for world number six Maria Sakkari, who beat her 6-1, 7-5 in the last 16 of the Wimbledon warm-up event on Wednesday. But there was a huge consolation prize for the Melbourne player, with Saville celebrating her return to the WTA's top 100 for the first time since August 2019 after a debilitating battle with injury. Saville had to take 10 months out of the sport and had a rough recuperation from an Achilles operation which made the former top-20 player wonder if she would ever get back to her previous levels. But the 28-year-old, who was ranked as low as 627 at the start of February, has risen over 500 places in four and a half months, delivering tremendous performances in Indian Wells and Miami and being the top Australian singles player, man or woman, at the recent French Open. Next week, she will be back up, provisionally, to number 95 in the rankings, accompanying 45th-ranked Ajla Tomljanovic as the only Australian women in the leading 100. The match of the day in Berlin saw Karolina Pliskova edge Bianca Andreescu 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9-7). Wimbledon finalist Pliskova struck down a dozen aces against the 2019 US Open champ Andreescu, though she had to fight back from a break down in the third set before prevailing in two hours 11 minutes. French Open finalist Coco Gauff got off to a winning start with a 6-2, 7-6 (7-2) first-round victory over fellow American Ann Li. Daria Kasatkina rallied to beat Russian compatriot Ekaterina Alexandrova 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 and will meet Sakkari in the quarters. Meanwhile, Nick Kyrgios obliterated his racquet, got embroiled in another officiating bust-up and was on the verge of giving up — yet still managed to battle through to perhaps his best win of the year against Stefanos Tsitsipas on the Halle grass. The ever-combustible but always-engrossing Australian came from a set down to knock out the second seed 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 in the traditional pre-Wimbledon tournament in Germany on Wednesday. It was a brilliant encounter, decorated by some of the Australian wildcard's most dazzling pyrotechnics on the grass-court surface he thrives on but also featuring familiar moments when he was seemingly on the verge of a meltdown. He admitted afterwards he had been close to giving up but his courtside team helped him through to a quarter-final date with sixth-seeded Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta. After losing an opening set which world number six Tsitsipas controlled, Kyrgios ended up smashing his racquet to smithereens, repeatedly hammering it against the side of his courtside bench. He received a code violation and, when leading 2-0 in the second set, got involved in another heated argument after being penalised for a time violation when receiving serve. After being judged by the chair umpire Timo Janzen to have kept the server Tsitsipas waiting, Kyrgios protested, sat down and demanded the supervisor be called before he eventually continued. He told the umpire that the penalty was ridiculous as he was one of the fastest players in the world. In previous matches this year, similar wars have seen the Australian go on to lose his cool, his focus and then the match. But on this occasion, the 27-year-old's brilliance came to the forefront instead, as he regained his focus to earn his 24th victory over a top-10 player — a remarkable statistic for a man still to make the top-10 himself. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. His victory came with some astonishing tracer forehands and with the help of one outlandish recovery forehand, played from behind his own back, which seemed to derail Tsitsipas. Asked how he'd managed to win in a post-match courtside interview, Kyrgios said: ""My team. My girlfriend, my physio, my best friend, my manager, they just kept me in it, got me over the line. ""At times, I felt like giving up, frustrated, and Stef was rolling but, I don't know, they somehow dug me out of a hole."" Kyrgios felt his time warning had been for show. ""Umpires, I don't think they understand… Everyone here in Halle was looking forward to seeing me and Stef play, they (umpires) just want to be relevant. The match was going fine, the crowd was enjoying it — it was completely unnecessary."" Asked if he'd found it hard to stay focused, Kyrgios shrugged: ""Not really. As you can see from the scoreboard, I focused pretty well. Lost the first set, and regained my focus and got it done."" 6-1.

97,analysis: From the SCG to Kardinia Park — do ground sizes contribute to the end result in AFL games?,sport,"  From the SCG to Kardinia Park — do ground sizes contribute to the end result in AFL games? Hang around the outer, or the TV, long enough and you'll hear talk of how the grass changes men. Or, more precisely, the lack of it. From its very start the rules of Australian Football were imprecise to one of the core features of the sport. The original rules merely said that the ground should not be more than 200 yards (182m) wide, with the length to be determined by agreement of each captain. Aside from the kick out posts — 20 yards on each side of the goal — the space that footy occupied was haphazard. Since then, the places that footy is played has changed to the march of time. Paddocks of space have been gradually enclosed by grandstands, occasionally with urban infrastructure shaping ground sizes. In the smallest state of Tasmania, the grounds tend to be on the smaller side, with North Hobart Oval only just longer than 150m. In the farmland of the Murray, grounds push the 200m mark, acres of space both on and off the ground. And in Adelaide wings are often square, fitting in between city streets. Differences also exist in the modern day AFL, with no two grounds exactly the same. Each ground has its own fingerprint on the game itself. How does the ground shape the type of footy game played on it? When footy in Melbourne gets talked about, the MCG is often at the heart of the conversation. Long held up as the standard setter for AFL venues, the MCG is the widest ground in current use. It sits among other short and wide grounds in the northern states, all with relatively expansive surface areas. There was also more variability in the VFL era, with the narrower grounds like Kardinia Park and Glenferrie Oval in the mix with the gigantic Waverley Park. Recent decades have seen the league trend towards things being more standard. For example, the formerly postage stamp sized SCG has been progressively lengthened since 2007. Now, the Swans' home is a pretty typical ground of the ""short, wide, high area"" variety like the Gabba or MCG. Despite this, most fans still think of the SCG as being a small ground. A big factor in this is the placement of the cameras at the ground, shifting the perspective of it. Due to the smaller grandstands and heritage character of the ground, the angle of the standard sideline shot at the SCG compresses the action, making the field seem tiny. Stadia built this century, such Docklands, Perth Stadium, Giants Stadium and the rebuilt Adelaide Oval, have all been examples of a new sensible middle. They've collectively set a sort of modern orthodoxy — a bit narrower and a bit longer than the MCG — but not as extreme as the notoriously long Kardinia Park or Subiaco. Given the differences in ground sizes, the average punter could reasonably expect vastly different styles to dominate on different sized grounds. The reality is that the effect is more muted than perhaps in years past. On longer grounds, the goal is a few metres further away from both the middle and the other goal. That fact means that teams have to work a tiny bit harder to get the ball inside 50, and get shots on goal, with the average disposals for both slightly higher. For the more statistically minded, the effect is pretty small and the relationship is not uniform. Even though this effect is small, it might be the biggest effect that ground size alone has on the modern game. Another area often cited is that bigger grounds mean more open space for players, and less congestion. While it seems logical that more total space would create more uncontested footy, the data tends to indicate otherwise. There's little relationship between smaller grounds and a larger share of contested possessions. The reason for this is likely down to how football is played now at the top levels. Instead of the full length and breadth of the ground being used at all times, play is usually compressed into an area about the size of a soccer pitch. This area shifts depending on the location of the ball and the team in possession but rarely exceeds that loose area. The effective spacing of players on both sides of the ball is critical given the use of advanced zone and pressing defences. Players are rarely positioned more than two and a half kicks away from the play, as opposed to staying near their ""field"" position. That means that congestion is an almost constant presence on the game, despite the size of the broader ground. This also likely impacts the other stylistic elements of the game, such as the ability for players to find space for uncontested marks and the impact of tackles on the game. Instead, it is team tactics and game plans that have a far bigger effect on how games look and are played. But there might be one exception to this. It's been a good 15 years for Geelong fans, with the Cats experiencing a level of success that the club hasn't seen for at least half a century. Key to that success has been their ability to win at home and build a fortress out of Kardinia Park. Long and narrow, Kardinia Park is the most unique ground right now. It has a wing that has been clipped straight, reminiscent of the suburban Adelaide grounds. Despite the uniqueness of the Park, little distinguishes it from other grounds statistically. While Geelong has largely played an idiosyncratic style in the past four years, they have largely played the same way at and away from Kardinia, including while COVID hubbing outside Victoria in 2020. Geelong found success since 2019 by making sure they retained possession, picking defences apart with kicks to open teammates. On defence, the Cats have shown an innate ability to cover space and close off opposition targets, with help defenders almost always arriving in the nick of time. Geelong's style doesn't reflect their surroundings, but it does highlight that they train at both Kardinia and the MCG-sized oval at Deakin University's Elite Sports Precinct in Waurn Ponds. There is one distinct effect present at Kardinia, however. The narrowness of the ground means that there are more throw ins proportionally compared to ball ups than at any other ground. Strangely, other narrow grounds don't share this trait, indicating it might be down to the oddly shaped wing or the wind howling off the bay. Anyone who has braved the elements and donned the colours in the middle of winter knows the impact of wind and rain on a game of football. Phrases like ""a four goal wind"" have entered the lexicon, indicative of when you are pushing it uphill. The physical location of a ground is one of the few ground impacts on the game — especially where games are held in wet cities or wind tunnels. Docklands, with its climate controlled dome conditions, plays differently to the mudpit that was Glenferrie. The roar of the local crowd also has a small effect, with teams generally doing better with a loud, passionate crowd supporting them and intimidating umpires. The lack of impact of ground sizes speaks to the intent of the founders of the game — that the players make the game, and not where they play it. A good team will be a good team no matter the size or shape of the ground, which is how footy should be.

98,F1 confirms Australian Grand Prix to remain in Melbourne until at least 2035,sport," Sport F1 confirms Australian Grand Prix to remain in Melbourne until at least 2035 The Australian Grand Prix will remain in Melbourne until at least 2035, with Formula One extending its contract for another 10 years. From next year, feeder series Formula 2 and Formula 3 racing will also be added to the event. Australian GP organisers have also committed to upgrading the paddock and pit lane. The contract had been due to expire in 2025, but the new agreement will extend the race's time at Albert Park to 40 years. It caps off a wildly successful return for F1 in Melbourne this April, after a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This year's estimated attendance at Albert Park reached 419,000 across the four days, the largest crowd for a weekend sporting spectacle in Australian history. ""I am delighted to confirm that Melbourne and the Albert Park circuit will continue to be on the Formula One calendar until 2035,"" F1 president and chief executive Stefano Domenicali said in a statement. ""The race has always been a favourite for the fans, drivers and the teams, and Melbourne is an incredible and vibrant international city that is a perfect match for our sport."" In 1996, the event moved from South Australia to Victoria and has been a fixture on the F1 calendar ever since. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""The resounding popularity of the Formula One Australian Grand Prix for over two decades stepped up to a new level in 2022 and the addition of F2 and F3 means that future events will continue to offer new races for fans to enjoy,"" Australian Grand Prix Corporation chairman Paul Little said in a statement. Motorsport Australia also welcomed the decision to lock in the Melbourne race long-term. The Australian GP used to be the season opener, however, Bahrain has held that honour over the past two years. F1 is yet to confirm its competition schedule for next year but is aiming for 24 events on the schedule. Las Vegas and Qatar are already locked in for 2023, while the South African Grand Prix in Kyalami could return next year. The French GP at the Paul Ricard Circuit will be dropped after next month's race.

99,"Racist, sexist behaviour and ‘vulgar’ stripper comment prompts half of women's football club to quit",sport,"  South Bunbury Football Club women's team players quit over claims of racist, sexist behaviour More than half of a women's football team in regional Western Australia has quit over what they describe as racist and sexist behaviour within their own club, including a club leader's ""vulgar"" comment about strippers. Twelve players, as well as their coach, at the South Bunbury Football Club women's team have walked away halfway through the season. In one incident, a male club leader was forced to apologise after referring to being at a strip club during the women's season launch. It's alleged he said ""he needed bigger pants"" to contain his excitement at being in a room full of ""pretty girls"". The team walkout came after an on-field incident in May where a rival player, Noongar man Hayden Yarran, was racially vilified by one of South Bunbury's male league players. That led the three-time premiership coach of the women's team, Maxwell Jetta, to resign in protest of the way his club handled the incident. The South Bunbury women's team wore black t-shirts with Mr Jetta's initials and kneeled to the ground at their match in a show of support on June 5. The call to action was organised by assistant coach and vice captain Kate Fielding, who then received a four-week suspension for breaching several codes of conduct. At least 12 more players have since left the club altogether, including Ms Fielding. Ms Fielding said she was not told specifically what the suspension was for, but claimed it was due to her involvement in the demonstration. ""The club's response to us trying to do something was appalling, they basically wouldn't let us do anything,"" she said. ""I have a strong stance against racism and I'm happy to be vocal about it and put myself out there and I don't think it's a coincidence that I'm the one serving a four-week suspension."" The ABC has spoken to several players, including Amber Boyd who was also part of the team's leadership group. She said the events that took place had forced her to leave the sport entirely and return to playing soccer. ""They're trying to build a reputation now on the back of this saying 'this isn't who we are' but the way they're going about it is discounting the actual issue,"" Ms Boyd said. ""They're not taking responsibility … and they're not owning that one of their players said [the racist remark]."" Karyn Beeson was leaving the club after almost four years and said she was disheartened by everything that had happened. She said the club could have done ""so much more"" but instead ""buried their heads in the sand"" on the racial vilification incident. ""In all my time I believed that the club stood for equality and that they had certain morals and values that I myself believe in,"" Ms Beeson said. ""Over the last six months the club has shown a lack of priority for those morals and values. ""We work so hard as a society in 2022 to bring awareness to [racial vilification] and it's just disappointing to see that the club hasn't kept up or embraced change that we've fought so hard for."" Ms Fielding said the club had conducted racial vilification training before the on-field incident which she described as a ""ticking the box"" seminar. ""It's been a real battle the last three years, we've had great success on the field but off the field it's been hard,"" Ms Fielding said. Ms Fielding said she had raised concerns to club officials about ""disgusting"" and ""vulgar"" comments made by men at the club about the women's team. She said the women's team were likened to ""strippers"" by a male club member during the season launch at the start of this year. ""Someone said they had never seen so many pretty girls in a room since he was at a strip club in Melbourne,"" she said. In a formal complaint to the club seen by the ABC, Ms Fielding said the man also told the women he ""needed bigger pants"" because he was ""getting too excited"". ""In 2022, I just don't know how those sorts of comments are still being made,"" Ms Fielding said. The man was made to apologise to the women's team after the incident. But Ms Boyd said it was not an easy process. ""We went around in circles, and we were saying we just want an apology from this guy who's upset us and they just didn't see how that was a solution,"" she said. ""It was just very frustrating."" Ms Boyd said it was disappointing a club as old as South Bunbury, which was celebrating its 125-year anniversary, was not taking the lead on issues surrounding racism and sexism towards the women's club. South West Football League president Barry Tate said while the league did not get involved with club matters, he was concerned. ""This is very concerning to see what is happening at South Bunbury Football Club and seeing the amount of players obtaining clearances to other clubs in the last probably seven days,"" he said. Mr Tate said the claims about sexual comments being aimed at female players was ""alarming"" but was not privy to all of the information and would speak to the club. South Bunbury Football Club's president Leigh Wright has declined to comment about the sexist behaviour said to be experienced by its female players. But in an initial statement to the ABC, the club said while it would not be drawn on specifics, Ms Fielding's suspension was issued after repetitive and ongoing disrespect towards the club and officials. The club confirmed nine players had requested transfers to other clubs. ""We wish the players all the best for their future football endeavours and sincerely thank them for their contribution to the club,"" the statement reads. In a letter sent to sponsors on Thursday afternoon, the club said when the women's team asked if they could wear black t-shirts in a stance against racism, they were told they couldn't because it needed to be approved by the board and sponsors. The statement said Ms Fielding's actions were ""pre-meditated"" and in direct contradiction to team managers' instructions. The club was fined $200 by the South West Football League tribunal over the racist abuse suffered by Mr Yarran, and was ordered repeat the racial vilification seminar. The club was also this week ordered by the league to issue a formal apology to Mr Yarran and his club. A local netball team has also made a colourful stance against racism. The Eaton Boomers netball team played wearing yellow, black and red arm bands and took a knee during their game at the weekend. Eaton Boomers netball club president Eleanor Yates said they wanted to show their support to Mr Yarran, Mr Jetta and the South Bunbury women's football team. ""We wanted to really send a powerful message that basically in our community it will not be tolerated,"" she said.

100,Why Justis Huni knows he's yet to silence his critics despite his dominant victory,sport," Sport Justis Huni yet to silence critics despite Australia's top heavyweight dominating Joe Goodall He may have won over Jeff Fenech but Justis Huni knows his critics will remain after accounting for Joe Goodall in his heavyweight boxing return. The 23-year-old had to wait almost exactly a year since beating Paul Gallen to improve his record to 6-0 at Brisbane's Nissan Arena on Wednesday. Huni picked apart his 29-year-old rival, a former sparring partner who, like him, medalled at the amateur world championships before turning professional. But for all his speed, precision and smarts, it was Huni's power — or lack of it — that meant many pundits were not confident he could handle the rejuvenated Goodall. And despite Huni's clear victory — he won an unanimous points decision 100-90, 98-92, 98-93 — the fighter knows the knock will remain after Goodall finished on his feet. ""About the power? Not really,"" he said when asked if he had silenced some critics. ""But I'm still here and got my zero (zero losses) so I'm happy."" Huni landed an incredible 194 punches in 10 two-and-a-half-minute rounds to close up Goodall's left eye. ""If the right punch lands then it'll come. But I've been in the game for a long time, I'm not going out there to look for it,"" he said. ""I learnt that in my first couple of fights."" A world-title winner in three divisions, Fenech poked the bear earlier in the week when he questioned Huni's power. But he was blown away by the craft of the 110kg monster he said was throwing combinations usually reserved for the divisions far below Huni's. Justis Huni faces his biggest professional test against his former sparring partner Joe Goodall and, although it's not quite make-or-break, it could set the victor on a path to greatness. Labelling it a ""masterclass"", he said Goodall displayed ""skills far superior to any heavyweight I've seen in a long, long time"". Victory came after a 12-month spell forced by injury and illness and landed Huni the WBO Oriental, IBF Pan-Pacific and WBC Australasian heavyweight belts. Importantly, it also granted him top-15 rankings in those three sanctioning bodies, placing him in the conversation for a world-title fight. But, even with Anthony Joshua's high-profile English boxing promoter Eddie Hearn in the stands, Huni's team will not rush to send him overseas. It is expected his promoter Dean Lonergan will line up two more fights in Australia this year and potentially keep him on home shores in 2023 to solidify his base. Possible opponents include current Australian champion Kris Terzievski, who beat Gallen to win the belt Huni vacated during his 12-month absence from the ring, and New Zealand's Kiki Leutele, who Huni was initially set to fight in May.

101,North Queensland is getting an NRLW team with hopes to lure female stars home,sport,"  North Queensland Cowboys join the NRLW under expanded women's competition The North Queensland Cowboys have secured their spot in the NRLW, carving a new elite pathway for women in rugby league heartland. The club will join the Canberra Raiders, Cronulla Sharks and Wests Tigers as part of a major expansion of the women's competition for the 2023 season. It was a pinch-me moment for players like 19-year-old Jordii Mahendrarajah from Townsville. ""I've been playing since I was 10 years old with the boys,"" she said. ""It's always been a dream to wear a Cowboys jersey."" The teenager plays for the Gold Stars – North Queensland's premiership-winning team in the state league. Now, she has her sights set on a Cowboys debut. ""Seeing this team being built is just insane — it's really emotional,"" she said. ""I always thought that if I were to make NRLW, I would have to pack my bags and move to a different city."" The NRLW was established in 2018 with just four teams. Ten teams will compete from 2023, and the NRL has flagged its intention to eventually have a women's side at every club. Cowboys chief executive Jeff Reibel said the creation of an elite North Queensland women's team was the culmination of years of investment in local talent. ""Our club was born [in 1995] to give North Queenslanders the opportunity to stay in North Queensland and shine on the national stage,"" he said. ""With our admittance into the NRLW competition, we can now do that for males and females."" Eight players from the Gold Stars – who come from Cairns, Townsville and Mackay – were contracted to other NRLW teams this year. Cowboys head of football, Michael Luck, said he hoped most would come home for the 2023 season. ""We'd like to think that a pretty fair contingent of the girls that are now playing in the NRLW will be playing in the Cowboys jersey next year,"" he said. ""That's why we put the bid in and why we waited five years to do it – so that we could fill the team with players from up here."" The Cowboys will be the third Queensland team in the NRLW, joining the Gold Coast Titans and the three-time premiership-winning Brisbane Broncos. The club will have about a year to recruit players and coaching staff. The NRL has forecast ""significant growth"" in the salary cap, which is currently set at $350,000 per team. But Mr Luck said he could not envisage players being able to quit their day jobs immediately. ""But if it continues to grow how it has grown over the last couple of years, I wouldn't think it would be far away that we could see our first couple of full time professionals within the next couple of years,"" he said. Mr Reibel said the name of the new women's team was still under consultation. ""No matter what we are, we'll all be Cowboys,"" he said.

102,analysis: 'Who are these blokes?': the Socceroos' 'Aussie DNA' isn't what you think,sport,"  'Who are these blokes?': The other kinds of 'Aussie DNA' threaded throughout the Socceroos Last week, following the Socceroos' World Cup qualifying win over the United Arab Emirates, News Corp. published a column that suggested the Australian team were largely unknown entities. ""Go the Socceroos. But who are these blokes?"" the title read. ""I've scrolled through the starting team and mostly come up with blanks. Who's Bailey Wright? Isn't he in the World Surf League? One of Tyler Wright's brothers? ""Who's Jackson Irvine? The Wests Tigers halfback? Martin Boyle? Didn't he win The Voice? Jamie Maclaren? At last, a recognisable name. The Bathurst 1000 winner. ""Point being, without well-known figures such as Harry Kewell, Tim Cahill and Mark Viduka, the Socceroos have an identity crisis."" Setting aside the admission the writer did not watch the game, the question around who the Socceroos are in their post-""Golden Generation"" glow does reflect a wider perspective of the casual Australian sports fan — as well as the lack of storytelling across many mainstream media platforms about who these new, young, exciting Socceroos players really are. The lack of awareness is due, in part, to the circumstances the team have found themselves in over the past three years. Their qualification campaign for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar has been one of the longest of any nation in the world. Their first qualifier began all the way back in September of 2019, with a 3-0 win over Kuwait, but then took a 500+ day pause the following year as the COVID-19 pandemic put a stop to global sport. Their final qualifying game ended on Tuesday morning in a dramatic penalty shoot-out win against Peru, 1,008 days after the whole process began. After a tense, exhausting 120 minutes in Doha, Australia emerged victorious over their rivals and will play at the 2022 World Cup. Not only that, but the Socceroos' disappearance from the public consciousness was also due to them playing 16 of their 20 qualification games away from home, largely in the Middle East, due to border closures and quarantine regulations. That meant games were played in the latest or earliest hours of Australia's mornings. Without the Socceroos on home soil, then, they were out of sight, and therefore out of mind. Luckily, the team's final, heroic win against the higher-ranked Peru — which saw photos and stories splashed across almost every newspaper in the country — means the interest in the current crop has reached fever pitch. So, in order to assist those still asking, ""who are these blokes?"", ABC has provided a selection of some of the Socceroos players who made Australian history by qualifying for their fifth consecutive men's World Cup. We start, of course, with the man of the hour: goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne. Known as ""Redders"", the 33-year-old Sydney FC shot-stopper made just his third appearance for Australia when he came on to replace captain Mat Ryan in the final 10 minutes of the Peru game. He is the true A-League journeyman, having represented five different clubs around Australia over the course of 14 seasons. It got to the point where, in 2016, Redmayne contemplated quitting the A-League altogether, completing a barista course with the plan to work at a friend's cafe while finishing his degree on the way to becoming a primary school teacher. ""I just didn't think I was good enough, to be honest. It was a pretty rough stage in my life,"" he told News Corp. a few years later. But Redmayne stuck it out, ultimately linking up with his first goalkeeping coach John Crawley at Sydney FC in January of 2017 — the same man who also coached the gloveman Redmayne replaced on Tuesday, Mat Ryan. From there, Redmayne grew, emerging as the club's number one following the departure of fellow Socceroo Danny Vukovic. Since then, the ""Grey Wiggle"" has been the Sky Blues' saviour on multiple occasions, especially from the penalty spot, helping the club win the 2019 A-League Men grand final against Perth Glory through similarly theatrical shoot-out heroics. It was Crawley, too, who opened the Socceroos door to Redmayne after he joined Arnold's coaching unit in 2019, and who was one of the only members of the entire Australia staff and team who knew about Tuesday's shock substitution plan. The humble giant may have only played a small role in the larger Socceroos campaign, but Redmayne's story echoes that of many others. They include Jamie Maclaren, Adam Taggart, Rhyan Grant, Mitchell Duke, Andrew Nabbout and Craig Goodwin, who have spent most of their senior careers in the A-League Men. While it's a competition that may not be regarded as one of the world's best — but which has provided full-time football, professional environments, financial stability and an opportunity to grow — it has been ideal, even for late-bloomers like Redmayne. It is testament to the A-Leagues' ability to produce national players that the majority of Socceroos — 17 of 23 players listed against Peru — started right here at home, representing one of the country's 12 ALM teams. As one of the Socceroos' most experienced players, 31-year-old Aziz Behich has been Mr Dependable for Australia throughout their World Cup campaign. A snowstorm back in January was the only thing stopping him from appearing in every single qualifier, and he's one of the first players Arnold lists on his team sheet, which included both play-off games. The son of Turkish-Cypriot migrants, Behich emerged through Victoria's football pathways with Green Gully SC before debuting for Melbourne Victory's senior team in January 2010. He made the switch to cross-town rivals Melbourne Heart later that year, where he slowly transitioned from his more attack-oriented youth football to become one of the country's most dependable left-backs. Behich's heritage meant he was eligible to represent three nations — Turkey, Cyprus, and Australia — but he chose the latter when he accepted his first senior call-up in 2012. Soon afterwards, Behich helped blaze a trail that many other young Socceroos have since followed: spring-boarding from the ALM to ply his trade overseas, first with Turkish club Bursaspor and then with Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven. He returned to Turkey following the 2018 men's World Cup in Russia, where he remains with Giresunspor. Behich, along with Mat Ryan, Trent Sainsbury, Tom Rogic, Mat Leckie, Aaron Mooy, and Bailey Wright, is part of that middle generation of Socceroos connecting the legendary players Australia remembers to the emerging group of talent. They're the ones who have not been quite as highly celebrated for ensuring the Socceroos maintained their World Cup appearance streak, which the win over Peru has extended to a historic five in a row, but who have maintained club careers abroad and been crucial in handing down the lessons they learned from the legends of the game to those still to come. Like the more senior players, Behich relishes his mentoring role in bringing through the likes of young defenders like Kye Rowles, Fran Karačić, Joel King, and Nathaniel Atkinson, all of whom have been introduced into the fold over the course of these qualifiers. ""All these young boys coming in … they've been brilliant,"" he said before the Peru game. ""We have a great mix of experience and a lot of young boys coming in through the Olyroos [U-23 team], which is great to see. ""They had a few good games in the Olympics and, working with Arnie, I think they'll only get better. ""With new players coming into camp, and for us as older players, it's all about making them feel welcome and just to be comfortable so they can show their best football when they get the chance. ""Our success so far is about brotherhood. Every time we come together, it's like we've never been apart."" One of those emerging talents Behich speaks of is 25-year-old Ajdin Hrustic, the midfielder who scored the Socceroos' winner against the UAE last week. Hrustic, alongside Kenny Dougall and Jackson Irvine, represents a different kind of Australian player: one who, after playing youth football in Australia, skipped the A-Leagues altogether and moved straight to Europe in order to chase the dream. Hrustic started out in England with Nottingham Forest before joining clubs in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands when he was still a teenager, working his way through the tiers before signing a contract with Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt in 2020. In May, he became the first Australian to win the UEFA Europa League — Europe's second-biggest club trophy — after defeating Scottish side Rangers, scoring in the penalty-shootout decider. Like Behich, Hrustic was also eligible for multiple nations including Bosnia and Romania through his parents, but despite being contacted by the former in 2017, turned down the offer due to his desire to represent the country of his birth: Australia. Largely overlooked by the Australian national teams since moving overseas, his dedication to his football eventually got him noticed by the Olyroos later that year, making his ""A"" international debut for the senior team in 2018. Despite being one of the outsiders at the beginning of Australia's tumultuous qualifiers, Hrustic's technical abilities, vision and goal-scoring ability have seen him become a regular starter for the Socceroos and one of the players that overseas media singled out as one of the team's most talented and dangerous attacking weapons. He's part of a cohort of younger and fringe players who may not have spent significant time Down Under (or, in the case of players like Karačić, Martin Boyle, and Harry Souttar, any time at all), but who have felt a calling to pull on the green and gold and represent Australia none the less. Finally, one of the Socceroos' most exciting players of this generation is winger Awer Mabil, who scored Australia's final penalty against Peru before Andrew Redmayne's crucial save. The 26-year-old represents our new migrant story: a first-generation arrival from Kenya whose family sought refuge and opportunity on our shores. It was in his birthplace — the Kakuma refugee camp — that he first learned how to play football, using a rolled-up sock or a bundle of plastic bags in place of a ball and practising with bare feet in the sand. He arrived in Australia with his family in 2006, settling in Adelaide, where his talent was quickly noticed and nourished. He made his debut for Adelaide United when he was just 17 and earned his first call-up to the Socceroos the following year, scoring his first goal for his adopted country in 2018 and celebrating alongside fellow debutant and South Sudanese refugee, Thomas Deng. His club football has taken him around the world from Denmark to Portugal to Turkey, with a move to Spain now on the horizon. As he told media after the Socceroos' win over Peru: in the moments he was preparing to take the decisive spot-kick, running through his mind were images of his family, the opportunities provided by Australia, and how he could use this one act to give back. ""I knew I was going to score,"" he said. ""It was the only way to say 'thank you' to Australia on behalf of my family. ""My family fled Sudan because of the war. I was born in a hut, a little hut: my hotel room here is definitely bigger than the room we had as a family in that refugee camp. ""For Australia to take us in and resettle us, it gave me and my siblings and my whole family a chance at life. That's what I mean by thanking Australia for that chance of life, that chance of opportunity."" These players might not be the household names of Kewell, Cahill, or Viduka, but they are arguably much more representative of the ""Aussie DNA"" than that which head coach Graham Arnold emphasised over the course of these final two play-offs. While their gutsy win over Peru certainly embodied the mateship and underdog spirit often associated with a more mythologised Australian identity — the kind associated with 20th-century politics and parochial bush poems — they also reflect an Australia that is more modern, more real, and more relevant to the rest of the country. They're a group who have embraced the opportunities Australia has provided them while also striving for more, with many taking themselves off to lesser-known clubs and leagues abroad to keep their dream alive. They're a group who have shown remarkable resilience and commitment to the larger Socceroos project, spending extended periods of time away from family and friends as Australia battled through their COVID-ravaged qualifiers. They're a group filled with young and emerging players who have stepped up to fill the voids left by departed or absent veterans, carrying the at-times-unbearable weight of the Socceroos' own history on their shoulders. They're a group whose belief in themselves and each other has seen them weather the storm of growing media criticism, as well as the fading hopes of a footballing public who all but wrote them off against their Tuesday opponents. But most of all, they're a group who reflect Australia's multicultural, migrant-rich population, perhaps more so than any other national team we have. Since the first Socceroos team was established in 1922, they have been one of the most accurate reflections of the country's ever-shifting cultural landscape: from the English and Scottish immigrants who first introduced the game in the late 19th century, to the influx of European families who embraced First Nations footballers during the two world wars to, more recently, the arrival of Asian, Arab, and African communities fleeing war and persecution, or simply seeking a better life in Australia. The country's multicultural threads are all tied together, as they have always done, in this Socceroos team with all the current players descending directly from these histories. From Redmayne and Behich to Hrustic and Mabil, this group has emerged from all backgrounds and experiences to meet here, in these moments, to help each other thrive. They are the global game in local colours. This is the true ""Aussie DNA"" that the Socceroos embody: a team that not only represents the story of Australian football but the story of Australia itself. So if someone ever asks you ""who the hell are these blokes?"", you can confidently point to the diverse, vibrant nation around you and say: ""This is who they are.""

103,High-profile Australian sports administrator Kitty Chiller sanctioned by international gymnastics body,sport," Sport High-profile Australian sports administrator Kitty Chiller sanctioned by international gymnastics body Kitty Chiller, the former chief executive of Gymnastics Australia — and now deputy CEO of the National Sports Tribunal — has been sanctioned by an international gymnastics body. Chiller, who stepped down from her role in gymnastics earlier this year, has been banned from representing the International Gymnastics Federation for two years following ""judging irregularities"" at the 2021 Oceania Continental Championships in rhythmic gymnastics. Gymnastics Australia (GA) must also pay a fine of 5,000 Swiss francs ($7,200) as part of the determination by the Disciplinary Commission of the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation, a body that adjudicates disputes in global gymnastics. GA and Chiller, as well as two judges and a technical director who were also sanctioned, have 21 days to appeal. Chiller — who is also a member of the Australian Olympic Committee executive — declined to provide more information on the irregularities or indicate whether she would accept the sanctions when contacted by the ABC through her employer. The claimed irregularities stem from the Oceania Championships in May last year which doubled as a selection trial for the 2021 Olympics. On that day, Lidiia Iakovleva narrowly beat Alexandra Kiroi-Bogatyreva in the individual competition to secure her place in Tokyo. GA previously noted on its website a ""technical irregularity"" affected the event.

104,Four new teams confirmed to join expanded NRLW competition in 2023,sport," Sport NRLW to expand to ten teams in 2023 with Canberra, North Queensland, Cronulla and Wests Tigers to join the league The NRLW will expand to a 10-team tournament in 2023 after Cronulla, North Queensland, Canberra and Wests Tigers were awarded licences for the competition on Wednesday. As first reported by AAP last month, the NRL has opted to take a more aggressive approach with an expansion of the women's game. ""We have a blueprint for investing in the women's game at all levels. We have seen from with the quality of the 2021 NRLW Premiership and the tremendous growth in female participation that we have capacity for sustainable growth,"" said ARLC chairman Peter V'landys. ""The commission have again demonstrated that the women's game is a strategic priority. The quality of the club submissions was excellent. ""The commission had always left the door open to expand to a 10-team competition based on the quality of the applicants, and we have seen that come through both in the success of the 2021 Premiership and the quality and applications made by clubs."" The league had initially planned to go to eight teams in 2023 and then 10 in 2024, but has decided to fast-track the competition's growth. ""Today is another exciting milestone in the growth of Women's Premiership,"" said NRL CEO Andrew Abdo. ""The Sharks and the Tigers have strong teams in the Harvey Norman NSW Women's Premiership, and the Raiders and the Cowboys already have strong participation bases. ""We will continue to work with all NRL Clubs on the plans for further expansion beyond 2023 and the right time for each club to potentially enter the NRLW Premiership."" The tournament, which started in 2018 with four clubs, added three further teams earlier this year as Newcastle, Parramatta and Gold Coast joined foundation clubs St George Illawarra, Brisbane and Sydney Roosters. This year's second NRLW season is expected to kick off in late August.

105,How Brett Kimmorley plans to put the fan back into footy for the battling Wests Tigers,sport," Sport How interim Wests Tigers coach Brett Kimmorley plans to bring fun back to footy for battling joint venture Brett Kimmorley certainly has his work cut out for him as interim coach of the lacklustre Wests Tigers. His new side are 13th on the ladder with 10 losses and three wins for 2022, and they cratered badly enough in recent weeks to cost Michael Maguire his job. Over four seasons, Maguire's old-school, crack-the-whip, tough-love approach didn't help break the club's lengthy finals drought. Rather, results and morale at the club seemed to deteriorate even further. In Kimmorley's 12-week audition as interim coach, he will bring a softer, more rewarding and supportive style of coaching to address the club's woes. ""My first job is being a dad to four daughters, so that's the approach I want to take into my coaching life. You become a person players can talk to and trust,"" Brett Kimmorley told ABC Sport. ""I want to be there for them when we are all hurting, let them know ... we all have to get through this difficult time together, and enjoy the good rewards that come, too."" While the locker room may have been an intimidating, even punishing place under Maguire, Kimmorley wants to bring back the fun. ""I'd like to think I am a decent person and this game should be enjoyable – when you go to work you want to enjoy doing it, if you don't like it you don't put the effort in,"" Kimmorley said. ""I will be firm and focused on being skilful, whilst having fun and caring about the people."" It won't all be sunshine and roses – Kimmorley wants to reward hard work and motivate his players to drive themselves. Those that don't reach those standards might find themselves out of a job. ""I think working hard is very important – all the success I had as a player was through hard work and being extremely tough on yourself and how you prepare for a game,"" Kimmorley said. ""It's about getting people who are 100 per cent committed to play for the Wests Tigers, wanting a future here, we have to trust and believe in what we are doing rather than finding the easy way out."" His positivity extends to Brent Naden's lengthy suspension for his lifting tackle on Manly's Jake Trbojevic over the weekend. ""The big thing I am trying to say to players is that we can't control everything,"" Kimmorley said. ""Brent's been suspended, it's part of life. Someone else will get the opportunity to train hard and show what you can do. Good luck to you and let's rip in on Sunday afternoon against the Bulldogs."" Wests haven't won a second half all season, which again rang true in Kimmorley's first game in charge. After trailing 6-4 at the break, the Tigers conceded four unanswered tries in the second stanza. Addressing these second-half collapses is one of Kimmorley's first priorities. ""I'll be continually trying to coach them under pressure and fatigue at training so they can do that for longer periods in the game. We have to work out how we can play for 80 minutes,"" Kimmorley said. ""It's hard to teach resilience or how to handle adversity, especially when fatigued — it's something we have to practise, practise, practise. ""In rugby league when you get caught taking a rest it burns you big – this has happened most games this year – we have to address how that's happened."" The former New South Wales, Kangaroos representative has always aspired to be a coach and isn't taking the opportunity lightly. This is an opportunity he's been building towards for years. ""This is something I have wanted since I was playing, being halfback and steering the side around I was given more detail about the game plan from coaches about why we are going to do things, when asked (to coach) it was something I certainly jumped at,"" Kimmorley said. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""I love the game, it's given me everything on and off the field. It's a huge challenge for myself, but I am extremely honoured. It's a massive achievement. ""I went to the Canberra Raiders as an NRL defensive coach so I know how that works. I've been a halves coach at Canterbury when Des Hasler was there – I learnt a lot from Des about how to run an organisation, then I coached my own team (head coach of the Tigers' under-20). ""I've been part of the Tigers pathway system for the last 12 months so I understand better than most people outside the football club how many good things are happening for long-term success."" While Kimmorley acknowledges top-line success could be a long way off, he's sure the club's long-suffering fans will have plenty to cheer for eventually. It could begin as soon as this weekend when the club takes on the 15th-placed Bulldogs, who are coming off a shock win over Parramatta on Monday but have struggled for consistency all season. ""We are not going to be successful or a top-four team straight away, short-term fixes aren't going to change anything. We have to be patient, unfortunately, as a Wests Tigers fan, but there are good things coming,"" Kimmorley said. ""I'd like to think that we've gone through the darkest days in this short-term, but there's still lots to improve on.""

106,Why this pool party is likely to be the Socceroos' last World Cup play-off celebration,sport," Sport Why this pool party is likely to be the Socceroos' last World Cup play-off celebration The victorious Socceroos arrive home at Sydney airport on Wednesday afternoon from the latest instalment of World Cup play-off penalty heroics. The shootout victory over Peru harked back to the 2005 team and John Aloisi's decisive spot kick. World football has changed radically in those intervening 16 and a half years, as the influence of Middle Eastern nations has grown, and kick-offs have been allowed to go backwards. But the world game is set to witness nothing short of a revolution in the next four. And it means the rollercoaster experience of a shootout with a spot in the World Cup on the line is set to be not for Australia, but for others. Andrew Redmayne's sudden-death save, with World Cup participation up for grabs, triggered an intense outpouring of joy for fans from the Ahmed bin Ali Stadium to Australian lounge rooms. In the hours since, defender Trent Sainsbury has not let an injury slow down his post-match celebrations. The 30-year-old missed the victory over the UAE last week and the Peru match with a knee complaint. But he, alongside captain Maty Ryan and striker Mitch Duke, has shared videos of the Socceroos partying in Qatar following the match. While players complained about a lack of beer on the coach back from the stadium in a country that prohibits public drinking, the ales clearly flowed back at the hotel. Winger Martin Boyle was even captured partaking in what appears to be shisha. The scenes recall perhaps Australian football's most iconic moment in 2005 and its aftermath, when John Travolta made an appearance in the dressing room, also following a World Cup play-off shootout victory. Several players will arrive back in Sydney on Wednesday afternoon. The Qantas charter that ferried the players back from Uruguay in 2005 has been replaced by a Qatar Airways commercial flight. But a larger change made by FIFA in 2017 will affect how the Socceroos qualify from now on. The first World Cup in 1930 in Uruguay involved just 13 nations, and the tournament moved to a 16-team format from 1934. The size increased to 24 teams in 1982, then 32 in 1998. FIFA decided in 2017 to expand the 2026 showpiece to a gargantuan 48 teams. The governing body currently has 211 affiliated associations, meaning close to one-quarter of members will reach the sport's grandest stage in four years' time. At the time, FIFA president Gianni Infantino defended the decision following criticism from clubs: “We are in the 21st century, and we should shape the World Cup for the 21st century. Football is more than Europe and South America; football is global.” The move gives developing nations a greater chance at taking part, and eight places will automatically go to Asian teams. Australia qualified automatically as one of the top four teams in Asia for the 2010 and 2014 tournaments. For 2018 and 2022, Australia slipped into the Asian play-off, but in both cases beat their Asian rivals in what was effectively a fifth-place decider. The experience in recent campaigns consolidated Australia's familiarity with the play-off, which goes back to painful defeats to Uruguay, Iran and beyond. But Australia now has a chance to put the World Cup play-off to bed. An expanded intercontinental qualifying tournament in 2025 will provide a last chance for two teams to qualify. But if the Socceroos were to return to this play-off environment — and with it the kind of do-or-die shootout drama from 2005 and 2022 — they would do so as the ninth best team in Asia. Despite the team's recent slump, and the odd slip-up against a lesser Asian side, that is barely imaginable. Which means the Socceroos' celebrations might now have to wait for the big dance.

107,From socks to Socceroo: Awer Mabil's World Cup journey is the stuff that dreams are made of,sport,"  Awer Mabil's journey from refugee camp to the World Cup is the stuff that dreams are made of The family of Awer Mabil has known both heartbreak and exquisite elation, and the events of early Tuesday morning (Australian time) emphatically fall into the latter category. With the score of the Socceroos' penalty shootout against Peru locked at four-all, Mabil stepped up to take his kick. For a 26-year-old whose childhood ambition had been to play on the biggest stage, the stakes could hardly have been higher — win the shootout and advance to the World Cup finals, or lose it and languish for another four years. ""He had a dream that one day … he would play at a World Cup and he would represent Australia,"" Mabil's uncle Peter Kuereng told ABC Radio Adelaide's Sonya Feldhoff. ""At the age of 11, that's when he had that vision."" Mabil's penalty kick was a drama within a drama. Amid cheers and jeers, he walked slowly to the penalty box, placing the ball on the spot and then adjusting it. In the moments that followed, any signs of nerves dissipated. Cooly and casually, and off a short run, Mabil approached the ball and then dispatched it past Peruvian goalkeeper Pedro Gallese, who had dived the other way. It was the game's penultimate kick, giving the Socceroos an edge that they would capitalise on moments later, when Andrew Redmayne produced a Mark Schwarzer-esque save to complete Australia's quest for a berth in Qatar. For Mabil, national glory spelled personal fulfilment — qualification was the realisation of that youthful ambition to reach the peak of the round ball game. His uncle expressed the same sentiment, but more laconically, with the understatement typical of someone whose pride is tempered by modesty. ""That dream is now achieved,"" Mr Kuereng said. World Cups tend to encourage talk of destiny, rather than contingency — of how things might otherwise have been. Furthermore, football produces so many stories of triumph in the face of adversity that the exceptional challenges confronted by Mabil — which include personal tragedy — can be obscured by his success in the game he loves. ""As a young boy he grew up in the refugee camp and that's where he started dreaming of playing soccer and playing [in] a bigger tournament,"" Mr Kuereng said. The refugee camp in question was at Kakuma in Kenya. Established in the early 1990s, it provided basic shelter to hundreds of thousands of people, many of them children whose parents had been forced to flee from countries including what is now South Sudan. Mabil was born in Kakuma, which is about as removed from the playing fields of an elite college as one could possibly imagine. But as an incubator for sporting and other talent, it puts many more renowned institutions to shame. Among its 'alumni' are AFL player Aliir Aliir and model Adut Akech. It was within the confines of the Kakuma camp that Mabil played soccer with other refugees. Their chosen ball was a rolled-up sock — which, ironically, they kicked with bare feet — although they sometimes had enough plastic bags to fashion a sphere. ""They rolled them and they became hard, and that's what they used as a football,"" Mr Kuereng said. In 2006, with the help of his uncle, Mabil and his family secured passage to Australia and settled in Adelaide. His sporting prowess stood out, and the preternaturally skilful Mabil made his A-League debut for Adelaide United at the age of 17. His call-up to the national senior side came in 2018. But, in another irony, he just missed that year's World Cup — his debut game was the Socceroos' first after the tournament. Months later, as Mabil was preparing to take to the field against the United Arab Emirates, his 19-year-old sister, Bor, was killed in a car crash in Adelaide's north. ""He was playing soccer for Australia when he [received] the news of the loss of his sister,"" Mr Kuereng said. The driver had alcohol and MDMA in his system when he lost control at excessive speed, and was later jailed. ""Every day since my child died, I cannot spend more than 30 minutes without thinking and crying about her death,"" Bor and Awer's mother told an Adelaide Court in 2019. ""My two oldest sons are struggling to accept Bor's death."" Several years before that tragedy, Awer had returned to Kakuma. The result of the trip was the organisation Barefoot to Boots, which Mabil established with his brother to ensure better ""health, education, and gender equality"" outcomes for refugees. While its focus is humanitarian, it also aims to promote the game that has made Mabil an international sporting figure. ""You can see a lot of young kids being introduced to soccer, and that is because of Awer,"" Mr Kuereng said. ""It is a great honour for Awer to represent his community and … African people here at Australian level."" For Mabil, the World Cup beckons — but the enormity of the journey that has taken him there isn't lost on him. ""It means a lot to Awer,"" Mr Kuereng said. ""In spite of a lot of challenges, he made it.""

108,Australian Blind Cricket star Steffan Nero sets world-record 309 not out off 140 balls,sport," Sport Australian Blind Cricket star Steffan Nero breaks record at International Inclusion Series Australian Blind Cricket opening batter Steffan Nero has scored a world-record 309 not out off 140 balls against New Zealand in Brisbane. Brisbane is currently hosting the International Cricket Inclusion Series, with the national blind squad playing five T20 and three one-day international matches against New Zealand. Australia is leading the series 6-0, with two ODIs to be played before the series concludes on Friday. Nero's triple century breaks the world record of 262 not out set by Pakistan's Masood Jan at the 1998 Blind Cricket World Cup. ""It's a dream in and of itself to play for Australia, so making a century for Australia is one of those lifelong memories you'll never forget,"" Nero said. The record-breaking innings saw Nero smash 49 fours and one six, hit with a reverse sweep on the first delivery. ""There are times in an over where I'm just like, OK, I'm going to take this guy to town, hit him out of the park,"" he said. ""So, I think the ball just went into the right spot. It's one of my strengths, the reverse sweep. I play it all the time."" Asked how his body was feeling after such a long innings, Nero said the ""mental strain"" was the most challenging. ""I imagine for anyone — including a fully sighted person — it's a big mental strain, but with vision impairment we have to expend a lot more energy trying to concentrate, especially with the ball moving around and the glare,"" he said. ""That's one thing I think a lot of people don't realise [about blind cricket], just the mental aspect of straining your eyes for that period of time can be quite taxing."" Dealing with glare was a topic Nero discussed last Thursday when he met with captain of the Australian women's cricket team, Meg Lanning. With the score of 309 not out, he now becomes only the eighth Australian cricketer to score a triple century across all cricket formats, joining the likes of David Warner and Michael Clarke. His score will also be recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records. After missing out on a bat in the first match of the series, Nero has scored three consecutive centuries, including 113 (46), 101 not out (47), and 309 not out (140). That takes his average to an extraordinary 523 runs, with a strike rate of 224.5. Asked what he put his success down to, Nero answered: ""A lot of hard work and dedication."" Originally from Western Australia, Nero moved to New South Wales to enrol in Law at Notre Dame University and he balances cricket with work and study. While participation rates of women and girls in sport steadily grows, are women in leadership positions keeping pace? ""It can be quite a lot at times, [including] lots of evenings and weekends, but I've always been a very goal-driven person,"" Nero said. Making his feat even more impressive was the fact that — until the current series — he had not played for Australia since 2018, with matches cancelled during the pandemic. This year's International Cricket Inclusion series marks the first time blind, deaf and intellectual disability (ID) teams have played international cricket at the same time. Nero said the event had attracted much-needed and welcomed media attention to the sport. ""The media exposure has been absolutely fantastic,"" he said. ""Being in mainstream media, that's where we want the exposure so that everyday people can see our sport, but also other vision-impaired people too. ""It means they might see it on the news and push and strive to play as well.""

109,Queensland could be the last place this unique sport is still being played,sport,"  Vigoro was a popular sport last century and is still 'alive and swinging' in Queensland Queensland is probably the last place in the world keeping the unique, cricket-inspired sport of vigoro alive. Ipswich, Boonah, and Cairns remain the last towns and cities fielding teams of what used to be a sport for schoolgirls from about the 1920s. The principles are the same as cricket — there are two teams, players make runs after hitting a ball, and can get caught out, bowled out, run out, and, of course, the winner scores more runs than the other team. However, vigoro tournaments pit teams of 12 against each other, not 11 like in cricket, and two bowlers take turns to bowl consecutively — one with a red ball, the other with a white ball. The bat is shaped like a kayak paddle with a shorter handle. Fourth-generation vigoro player and Queensland Vigoro Association secretary Rachel Savage told ABC Radio Brisbane's Kat Feeney the sport was ""alive and swinging"", although ""not as big as we used to be"". There used to be eight vigoro associations in Queensland, one in NSW, and one in Tasmania, but just four remain. Originally marketed as a sport for girls — the hard cricket ball was deemed far too dangerous for young ladies to play with — Ms Savage said some clubs do let boys up to the age of 15 play. Girls and women, however, were still the target group for clubs. ""We don't let the men play"", Ms Savage said, but ""each club has their own rules"". ""There are a lot of younger boys playing our sport rather than cricket because they all get a go and it's much quicker. ""They all think it's easy until they get out there."" Callers to ABC Radio Brisbane were overwhelmingly in favour of restoring vigoro's popularity and one fan, Brisbane physiotherapist David Peirce, shared an image of his mother's school team. Played in a much faster time frame than traditional cricket games, vigoro has been compared to the popular T20 style of the game. In fact, Ms Savage maintains, tongue in cheek, that the T20 concept was ""stolen"" from vigoro. Regardless, she would also love to see the game played at the Brisbane 2032 Olympics. ""We have the facilities and it really is a great sport for all ages, all abilities. You don't have to be the world's best player, you don't have to bowl,"" Ms Savage said. ""We just love people getting out there playing our sport. It's very family-oriented. I'm the fourth generation of my family to play. ""And, it's a very friendly sport, although our A grade side does get very competitive."" The season starts again in October.

110,NZ coach slams 'atrocious' refereeing as All Whites miss out on World Cup,sport," Sport New Zealand coach Danny Hay criticises refereeing as All Whites miss out on World Cup after 1-0 play-off loss to Costa Rica Furious All Whites coach Danny Hay believes his side were on the end of some ""atrocious"" officiating after New Zealand suffered a 1-0 loss to Costa Rica in their World Cup play-off. Former Arsenal striker Joel Campbell's third-minute goal was enough to send the Central American nation to a third-straight World Cup as the All Whites twice fell on the wrong side of crucial video assistant referee (VAR) decisions at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Qatar. An equaliser by Chris Wood late in the first half was ruled out for a foul in the build-up after referee Mohammed Abdulla consulted his pitch-side monitor. The New Zealanders' sense of frustration only increased in the second-half when Abdulla sent off substitute Kosta Barbarouses for a challenge on Francisco Calvo. The United Arab Emirates' official had originally booked Barbarouses for the challenge but changed his decision after once more viewing a replay pitch-side. Hay said a referee of Abdulla's experience should not have been put in charge of such a key fixture. ""I thought some of the officiating, at times, was absolutely atrocious. People can make their own mind up about that,"" Hay said. ""When we saw the announcement and then we looked at what Australia and Peru had last night with good, quality European officiating, I thought FIFA have made a mistake there in such an important game. ""I think they've let us down by putting somebody in charge that clearly has not officiated at this sort of level."" Socceroos substitute goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne danced his way into national folklore this morning – and the internet went on a wild emotional rollercoaster ride with him. It's the third qualifying campaign in a row that New Zealand has fallen at the final hurdle, after losing play-offs to Mexico and Peru in their past two World Cup cycles. Hay's team had a disastrous start at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, with Campbell hitting the back of the net with the first shot of the match. The 29-year-old got his foot to a cross from the left before New Zealand's defence, steering the ball past Oli Sail and into the far corner of the net. That would be Costa Rica's only shot of the opening half, however, as the All Whites pressed hard for a leveller. Wood twice created opportunities for youngsters Matthew Garbett and Alex Greive, but both squandered the chances. Newcastle United striker Wood forced Costa Rica captain Keylor Navas into a double-save moments later, but it wasn't until the 39th minute when the big New Zealand forward thought he had scored. Wood steered a Garbett cross past Navas after it eluded the Costa Rican's defence, but Abdulla ruled Garbett had committed a foul, winning the ball back before his cross. Costa Rica made a triple change at half-time, bringing on ex-Fulham midfielder Bryan Ruiz, but New Zealand were still dominating the possession, shots and territory. Even after Barbarouses's 69th-minute dismissal, New Zealand pressed for a goal with Clayton Lewis's long-range effort in the 76th minute forcing a smart diving save from Navas. ""It's obviously hurting players at the moment but I thought we were by far the better team,"" Hay said. ""I don't even think that was in question. ""There was one team dominating. One team trying to play good, quality football. One team trying to create chances and that was us."" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Costa Rica's qualification completes the full 32-nation line-up for November's World Cup, with Los Ticos to be in Group E alongside European heavyweights Spain and Germany, as well as Japan in Qatar.

111,Bairstow smashes England's fastest century since 1902 to complete extraordinary run chase,sport," Sport Jonny Bairstow scores fastest England century since 1902 to lead side to record run chase over New Zealand Jonny Bairstow has scored England's fastest test century since 1902 to lead England to victory over New Zealand by five wickets, clinching the three-match series with a Test to spare. The Yorkshireman smashed 136 in 92 balls, reaching three figures off 77, one more than Gilbert Jessop required in 1902 against Australia at The Oval. England had been set 299 to win on Tuesday in a minimum 63 overs. It was a record run chase at Trent Bridge, but roared on by a full house which had been admitted for free, they got there with 13 overs to spare. The overall boundary count, 250 with 24 sixes, was the highest in Test history and the run total, 1,601 was the highest in a Nottingham Test. The match was the perfect example of the positive brand of cricket new skipper Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum want to play. ""It was set up for the way we want to play; run into the danger rather than back away and stand still,"" Stokes said. ""We wanted to put as much pressure as possible on the New Zealand attack, and once Jonny gets his eye in there's no stopping him."" New Zealand skipper Tom Latham was standing in for Kane Williamson who was ruled out with COVID-19. ""I don't think I've seen an onslaught in a Test match like it,"" Latham said. At 4-93 mid-afternoon, with first innings centurions Ollie Pope (18) and Joe Root (3) both out cheaply, 299 seemed a stiff target. Bairstow and skipper Ben Stokes then added 46 in 52 balls to take England to 4-139 at tea with 38 overs remaining and the run-rate 4.21. After tea, New Zealand decided to try and bounce Bairstow out despite the short leg-side boundary. The next 16 balls then went for 42 runs, including 29 to Bairstow. New Zealand eventually changed tactics, but it was too late. The first nine overs after tea went for 102. When Bairstow was caught behind off the persevering Trent Boult (3-94) the pair had added 179 in 20.1 overs. Stokes (75 not out off 70 balls), supported by Ben Foakes (12 not out), then took England to victory despite a knee injury that could leave him in doubt for the third Test, starting in Leeds on June 23. While participation rates of women and girls in sport steadily grows, are women in leadership positions keeping pace? Stokes, having won the toss, had put New Zealand in on Friday and saw them score 553. But England, scoring quickly, put on a total of 539, before dismissing New Zealand for 284 just before lunch on the final day, setting up the run chase. Daryl Mitchell, who made 190 in the first innings was left on 62 not out after Matt Henry (18) and Kyle Jamieson (1) were dismissed by Stuart Broad, and Trent Boult (17) by Jimmy Anderson. New Zealand, with Jamieson unable to bowl because of a back injury, made an early inroad when Boult dismissed Zak Crawley for a duck. The wickets of Pope and Root were followed by Alex Lees for a bright 44, which led to Bairstow coming to the crease and making his century in record time.

112,Nature Strip speeds to King's Stand Stakes victory at Royal Ascot,sport," Sport Nature Strip beats top field in King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot for jockey James McDonald, trainer Chris Waller Australian super horse Nature Strip has pulverised a world-class field at Royal Ascot, proving himself again the king of the sprinters. Trainer Chris Waller's Everest winner underlined why he is rated the world's best sprinter as jockey James McDonald drove the seven-year-old to an emphatic victory in the King's Stand Stakes at Britain's royal meeting on Tuesday. It was a devastating display from the eight-time Australian Group 1 winner, who began as 9-4 second-favourite in the stand-out international clash with the more-fancied American dual Breeders' Cup winner Golden Pal. It turned into a mismatch, with Golden Pal missing the break while Nature Strip, not the sharpest out of the stalls either, took control two furlongs (400m) from home before powering away to win by four and a half lengths. ""He's just an absolute freak of a horse,"" declared McDonald, whose only concern in the five-furlong, 1,000m sprint was loose horse Khaadem, who had left his jockey stranded after a problem in the stalls, looming up alongside. ""That riderless horse gave me a fright. I thought, 'How has one gone with him?'"" McDonald said. ""I saw the American horse charge through too and at the two-[furlong] pole, and I thought, 'Are you going to come?' and he had no response, and away went Nature Strip."" McDonald reckoned Nature Strip, winner of the $15m Everest at Randwick last October, had again ""silenced a few critics"". It was only Australia's seventh win at the world-famous festival and Waller's first after finishing runner-up in the Diamond Jubilee stakes with Brazen Beau in 2015. ""It was breathtaking,"" smiled Waller, after watching Nature Strip finish way clear of Twilight Calls (11-1) and Acklam Express (200-1). Crowds are back at the track in Sydney as the Chris Waller-trained Nature Strip wins the $15 million feature race The Everest at Royal Randwick. ""It means a lot. We don't get a chance to come up and race against English, Irish, French and American horses, so to be able to bring a horse all this way and to win the way he did, it was pretty special. ""He's [been] a very good horse for a very long time. He's in the twilight of his career but he's just learned to be a racehorse now. ""He was a tricky horse early on but he's got better with his years. He's matured."" The trainer of the great Winx reckoned it had been an important day for Australian racing, 10 years since the great Black Caviar had also won at Royal Ascot. ""It's very important to showcase them (Australia's best horses) internationally,"" Waller said, after the gamble of bringing his charges on a 40-hour flight from Australia, with stops in Singapore and Dubai, paid off handsomely. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""Obviously, Australia's got a huge racing industry, breeding industry. [The] ratings stack up — Nature Strip's one of the highest-rated horses in the world, but until you do it on the main stage, it's another story. It'll just remind everyone how strong we are in Australia."" Waller, who also has Nature Strip's stablemate Home Affairs entered for Saturday's Platinum Jubilee Stakes, now has the decision whether to also let Nature Strip go for the double in that race, which would emulate the achievement of Australia's first Royal Ascot winner Choisir in 2003. ""We can make a decision later in the week,"" said Waller, who, with Queen Elizabeth II absent from her favourite meeting, collected his prize from her son, the Earl of Wessex.

113,'It's a date': Tennis legend Serena Williams takes up wild card entry to Wimbledon,sport," Sport Serena Williams to compete at Wimbledon after being offered wildcard entry to 2022 tournament Serena Williams is going to play at Wimbledon, after all. The All England Club announced on Tuesday that Williams was awarded a wildcard entry for singles, marking her return to grand slam action after a year away from top-level competition. With a professional era record of 23 grand slam singles trophies — and as big a star as tennis ever has seen — Williams is going to tune-up by playing doubles at a smaller grass-court event first, teaming with Ons Jabeur at Eastbourne, England, next week. Main draw play at Wimbledon will begin on June 27. Williams has not competed anywhere since sustaining an injury during the first set of her first-round match at the All England Club in 2021. And her name did not appear on the women's singles entry list released by the grass-court grand slam tournament earlier this month. However, Williams was among a half a dozen women given a spot in the singles draw on Tuesday, along with five British players: Katie Boulter, Jodie Burrage, Sonay Kartal, Yuriko Miyazaki and Katie Swan. Two other women will get invitations ""in due course"", the All England Club said. Seven of the eight men's wild-card berths were also announced, including one for three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka. Earlier in the day, Williams posted a photo of her white shoes on what appears to be a grass court and the message: ""SW and SW19. It's a date. 2022. See you there. Let's Go."" ""SW"" are her initials, of course, and ""SW19"" is the post code for Wimbledon. The 40-year-old American has won seven of her singles trophies at Wimbledon, the first in 2002 and, most recently in 2016. Williams was the runner-up there in 2018 and 2019 (the tournament was cancelled in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic). In 2021, Williams lost her footing on the slick grass and then her right leg buckled, leading to just the second mid-match retirement at any grand slam tournament of her career and the first since 1998. With the lack of activity since then, Williams — who first reached number one in July 2002 — is 1,208th in the WTA rankings this week. That is why she was not automatically placed in the Wimbledon field. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. While Williams has been sidelined, first Ash Barty and then Iga Świątek stepped into the opening left by her extended absence. Barty won Wimbledon last year and the Australian Open this January to solidify her hold on the number-one ranking, but then abruptly retired at age 25 in March. That allowed Świątek to rise to number one, and she has backed up that new status with an ongoing 35-match winning streak that included claiming a second French Open trophy this month. Her unbeaten stretch exceeds, by one, a 34-match run Williams put together in 2013 and equals one by Williams' older sister, Venus, for the longest since 2000. Adding Williams to the bracket at the All England Club adds quite a story line for this year's tournament. As things stood, the tournament was going to be filled with stories, given: the ban on players from Russia and Belarus because of the invasion of Ukraine, the subsequent removal of rankings points by the WTA and ATP tours, the 100th anniversary of the opening of Centre Court, and the addition of scheduled play on the fortnight's middle Sunday for the first time.

114,Glenn Maxwell stars as Australia beats Sri Lanka in rain-affected ODI,sport," Sport Australia beats Sri Lanka by two wickets in rain-affected first ODI at Pallekele Glenn Maxwell has helped Australia pull off their greatest chase against Sri Lanka, thumping an unbeaten 80 in his one-day international return to seal a rain-affected two-wicket win. Playing in an ODI for the first time since December 2020, Maxwell was the star as Australia completed their pursuit of a reduced target of 282 from 42 overs with nine balls to spare. Australia continually put themselves in front of the Pallekele series opener, only for limping spinner Wanindu Hasaranga to keep Sri Lanka in it by taking 4-58 while battling a serious leg injury. Australia looked in control at 2-126, 4-189 and eventually 5-228, before Hasaranga removed Alex Carey and Pat Cummins in the space of three deliveries. But ultimately, it was Maxwell who put on the big show he is so often renowned for. The 33-year-old pumped seven sixes in his 51-ball knock, pulling powerfully through the legside whenever the hosts got their lengths wrong. In the over after Carey and Cummins departed he also took 15 off Maheesh Theekshana, reasserting Australia's position. And while Ashton Agar became the eighth Australian to fall with 28 needed, Maxwell held his nerve to finish the job with two straight sixes in the penultimate over. ""We probably lost a few too many wickets and made it closer,"" Maxwell said. ""The run rate was at a controllable rate, but with the conditions keeping spinners always in the game and the quicks and their change ups. ""On that pitch you were never over the line until the last went over the rope, so it was nice to get the job done."" Initially chasing down Sri Lanka's 7-300, Maxwell's heroics came after Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch both hit 44 and Steve Smith controlled the early stage of the innings with his 53. ""That was an extraordinary innings by Maxwell,"" Finch said. ""It was pure class. He showed a lot skills and game smarts."" But it was not all positive for Australia. Agar could be added to their growing injury ward after leaving the field following the end of his 10 overs with the ball and reporting pain in his side. The visitors are already without Mitchell Starc and Mitch Marsh for the next ODI on Thursday, while Kane Richardson and Sean Abbott have both been sent home with injuries. Questions will also be asked of their bowling set-up ahead of next year's one-day World Cup on similarly slow wickets in India. With Adam Zampa back home on paternity leave, Australia still overlooked leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson on Tuesday and played three frontline quicks. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Agar (2-49) and Maxwell both bowled 10 overs each, while Marnus Labuschagne was called upon for three overs late. Australia's quicks struggled to get anything out of the slow pitch, as Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Jhye Richardson went for a combined 1-166 from their 26 overs. Meanwhile Hasaranga's brave effort with the ball came after he hit 37 from 19 balls late for Sri Lanka, hitting Richardson for five straight boundaries in the penultimate over. Kusal Mendis also struck 86 from 87, helping steady the ship after Sri Lanka went from 0-115 to 3-134 in their own innings.

115,Miracle escape as father and daughter survive horrific rollover at Finke Desert Race,sport,"  Father and daughter team Shannon and Keioni Lander survive horrific rollover at Finke Desert Race A woman whose Finke Desert Race dream ended in a spectacular crash on day one says the accident has not put her off racing in future events. Navigator Keioni Lander has spoken about the crash that happened alongside her father Shannon ""Wildman"" Lander, saying she did not have time to be scared. She said their trophy truck had handled well around the 8-kilometre prologue track and placed them in 36th position. ""We thought it was going to be good,"" she said. But at a jump at the 30km mark their race became unstuck when they hit a sandhill too fast. ""Our fuel tank is right at the back of the car and it was a full,"" Ms Lander said. ""I think the weight compressed the car, bucked us up, and we went nosediving."" Ms Lander said it had been hard to tell from the inside of the car how many times she and her father rolled. She held on to her seatbelt as the car was flipping. ""I wasn't really flopping around too much. I think my legs are getting thrown around a bit,"" she said. ""It kind of went blank for me. Not fully blank. I knew it was happening. Once the car came to a stop, Ms Lander was concerned for her father. ""I was just calling out for dad and making sure he was okay,"" she said. ""And once he responded I was just relieved."" Ms Lander said her father climbed out, followed by herself. ""Everyone was helping, but I originally got really dizzy once I got up,"" she said. ""So I sat down and a lot of people rushed over asking me if I needed anything."" She said that she was in shock. ""When I watched the video I'm thinking 'I can't believe me and dad were in there',"" she said. Ms Lander said her mother, Mischa Cartwright, was the first person she called after the accident. ""I knew that if she saw [the footage] she would be stressing out because she's up in Darwin,"" Ms Lander said. ""I think she was definitely worried once she saw the footage."" Ms Lander said she was proud of her father for all the hard work that went into getting themselves and their vehicle ready for this year's Finke Desert Race, and that the accident had not put either of them off racing in future Finkes. ""We're going to hopefully rebuild that car,"" she said.

116,"Julie was told she'd be in a wheelchair by 30. At 53, she is climbing for Australia",sport,"  How Julie and her teammates are climbing above the world's expectations When Julie Postma was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis as a teenager, she was told she would be unable to walk by the time she turned 30. More than two decades later – at age 53 — Julie has defied expectations, recently representing Australia in an international World Cup sport climbing competition in Salt Lake City. ""When I was diagnosed, it was, 'You have a disability, you just go and sit in a box' and the world ignores you,"" Julie says. ""So this has been about going back and doing those things that I never had the opportunity to do when I was younger. ""I was thrilled. I definitely climbed my best."" After getting into climbing as a fun form of physiotherapy a few years ago, Julie is now a member of Australia's national paraclimbing team. Despite having no funding nor formal support, the team is the most successful the country has ever seen. And, with a majority-female squad, women are leading the way, propelled by a volunteer-run climbing group for people with disabilities. With its dizzying heights and gravity-defying physicality, the adventurous sport of rock climbing may seem ill-suited to people living with a disability. Melbourne scientist and below-knee amputee Sarah Larcombe has recently proven just how wrong that is. In her international competition debut alongside Julie in May, Sarah won Australia's first ever World Cup medal and, to top it off, it was a gold medal. ""I was physically shaking from nerves,"" the 34-year-old says. ""They had the Australian flag up on a TV screen. They played the anthem and everything. It was a crazy feeling."" The win came after almost two years of intense physical training and months of fundraising. ""[It] was pretty difficult. It's a massive financial cost. The para-athletes are expected to be self-funded for these competitions,"" Sarah says. ""Being disabled is expensive in itself. We have a lot of extra expenses that, I think, most people wouldn't have to deal with."" Despite having to resort to a credit card to get there, Sarah says the sacrifices have been worth it. ""Climbing just feels so freeing, especially having a disability and feeling confined within your own body,"" she says. ""Getting on a climbing wall allows you to do things that you never thought you would be able to do … It's like solving a puzzle with your body."" Sarah is a member of Adaptive Climbing Victoria (ACV), a grassroots group founded in 2018 to help more people with disabilities experience rock climbing, both indoors and outdoors. The organisation's mantra is that everyone — no matter their ability — can climb. ACV chair Araminta ""Minty"" McLennan — who was born with cerebral palsy — says rock climbing, by its nature, is an adaptive sport because there is no one ""right"" way to climb. ""It doesn't matter how you get to the top, as long as you get to the top, people are happy,"" Minty says. ""And, if you have a disability, it doesn't define you. It might define the way that you climb … but it doesn't define you."" Minty says ACV's mission is to transform perceptions and attitudes towards disability. ""It's adjusting attitudes of ourselves and of the wider climbing community to help make more space for people with disabilities,"" she says. The group runs events and programs for people with disabilities at climbing gyms and outdoor crags, with a team of volunteers adapting the climbing set-up to the needs of the individual climber, using specialised equipment and a helping hand. Educating and working with climbing facilities so they can make space for people with disabilities to participate safely is another way the group is working to improve accessibility and inclusivity. ""Not only so that the people who are climbing feel safe, but also so the venue feels safe, facilitating that,"" Minty says. After discovering climbing was a perfect way to leverage her ""comically strong upper-body strength"", Minty says the benefits went far beyond the physical, giving her a sense of belonging and place in a welcoming community. ""I often say that climbing is the friendliest cult you will ever join … it becomes critical to the fabric of your life in many ways,"" she says. ""It had such an incredible impact on my life. I just want to be able to share that."" Like Sarah and Julie, Minty is on the national paraclimbing team. She's preparing to fly out to Europe for her first World Cup next week. Her big dream, though, is the Paralympics. ""It's definitely my big, hairy audacious goal,"" the 28-year-old says. ""The official party line is that it's slated to be included at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, so that gives me a few years."" While Sarah says she may be a little too old by 2028, she hopes her success will help raise awareness about the fledgling sport of paraclimbing and inspire other young girls living with a disability to dream big. ""Growing up … there wasn't a lot of visibility or representation of disabled athletes — or just disabled people in general — in the media at that time,"" Sarah says. ""It would have meant so much to me as a little girl to have seen someone there [who] looked like me."" Julie has been sidelined for the rest of this year's international competitions by a bout of COVID-19, but the mother-of-two is hoping to make it to next year's world championships. ""Having a degenerative and progressive condition can be hard because, in your heart, you know it's only going in one direction … a gradual decline over an extended period of time,"" Julie says. While in the past year the progression of her MS has meant she now uses a wheelchair much of the time, her climbing has continued to get better. ""To have something that I've been able to work at — and keep improving at, and doing better at, despite the body getting worse every year — has been really nice."" Julie's advice for anyone, no matter their age or impairment, is to just go for it: ""Don't let people tell you, 'No' or 'You can't', if you really want to do it, do it.""

117,Bill Dempsey steals the show at AFL Hall of Fame ceremony,sport," Sport Bill Dempsey steals the show at AFL Hall of Fame ceremony Football great Bill Dempsey was a star of this year's Hall of Fame award ceremony, telling the fascinating tale of his Simpson Medal. An icon in Perth, the 80-year-old lit up the room at Crown Melbourne after being inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame on Tuesday night. The athletic ruckman played 343 games across 17 dominant WAFL seasons for West Perth. He would return home to Darwin in summer to star in 10 NTFL campaigns for his beloved Buffaloes. Arguably Dempsey's finest hour as a player was the 1969 WAFL grand final as he combined with the legendary Graham ""Polly"" Farmer in leading West Perth to premiership glory. Dempsey was awarded the Simpson Medal as best-on-ground for his dominant performance. However, his medal was lost during the devastation of Cyclone Tracy which hit Darwin in 1974. Dempsey said he was able to have a replica made for him, with his mother proudly, but incorrectly, telling friends about her son winning the ""Simpson Desert Medal"". On Tuesday, Dempsey recalled the bizarre chain of events that led to his beloved medal being returned to him. Gold prospectors found the original medal in the Simpson Desert many years later, which was enough proof for Dempsey's mother to feel vindicated. ""She told me, 'Thank you for bringing it back,'"" Dempsey said in his speech. ""She said, 'What is Andamooka?' and I said, 'It's in the Simpson Desert.' ""She goes, 'Silly boy, I told you it was the Simpson Desert Medal.'"" A member of the Stolen Generations, Dempsey survived tremendous hardship as a child to become a football great in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.

118,"Port Adelaide great Russell Ebert made Australian Football Legend, Harvey and Pavlich among eight Hall of Fame inductees",sport," Sport Port Adelaide great Russell Ebert made a legend at Australian Football Hall of Fame Eight months after his death, South Australia football icon Russell Ebert has been made an Australian Football Hall Of Fame Legend. Indigenous greats Nicky Winmar and Bill Dempsey, AFL games record holder Brent Harvey and former Fremantle captain Matthew Pavlich headlined eight 2022 Hall Of Fame inductees. Along with Ebert, they were honoured on Tuesday night at a function in Melbourne. Ebert — who died of cancer on November 5 aged 72 — is the Hall Of Fame's 32nd official Legend. His wife, Dian, accepted the honour. Ebert ranks with North Adelaide's Barrie Robran, already a Legend, as two of the the greatest players in South Australia football history. The skilled and tough centreman played a club-record 392 games for Port Adelaide from 1968 to 1978 and then 1980 to 1985, split by 21 games for North Melbourne in 1979 when he tried his hand at the then-VFL. He is the only player to win four Magarey Medals, the SANFL's equivalent of the Brownlow. Ebert captained the Magpies to their drought-breaking 1977 premiership, his first of three flags at Alberton. He also coached Port, as well as Woodville-West Torrens, in the SANFL, and then became a respected junior development coach in SA football. Winmar and Dempsey added a strong note of Indigenous greatness to this year's inductions. Winmar played 251 AFL games for St Kilda and the Western Bulldogs, but is best remembered for an iconic moment in 1993 when he defiantly raised his Saints jumper and pointed to his chest. The skilful utility made the gesture after Collingwood fans had racially abused him during a match at Victoria Park. Dempsey played 343 games for West Perth between 1960 and 1976, the second-most in WAFL history. The back pocket, a member of West Perth's team of the century, was the honoree in this year's Sir Doug Nicholls AFL Indigenous round. Harvey and Pavlich were inducted in their first year of eligibility, five years after their retirements at the end of the 2016 season. Harvey, North Melbourne's much-loved midfielder and small forward, is the AFL games record-holder, with 432. Pavlich is one of Fremantle's greatest AFL players, with 353 games for the Dockers between 2000 and 2016 and 700 goals. Mike Fitzpatrick, Michael Taylor, Terry Cashion and Ted Tyson were the other four inductees into this year's Hall of Fame class. Before he was the AFL chairman from 2008 to 2017 — a tumultuous term that featured the Essendon drugs scandal and the Adam Goodes racism controversy — Fitzpatrick was a premiership ruckman at Subiaco and Carlton. Fitzpatrick captained the Blues to their 1981-82 flags. Norwood premiership captain Michael Taylor had some great duels in the centre with Ebert, with Norwood-Port Adelaide the SANFL's fiercest rivalry. Taylor played 289 games for the Redlegs in the 1978s and 1980s, split by 94 games for Collingwood, and he is a Norwood Hall Of Fame Legend. Late Tasmanian great Terry Cashion was inducted for a career that featured the 1950 Tassie Medal at the national carnival and being named rover in the Tasmania team of the century. Ted Tyson, also deceased, was a West Australian goal-kicking machine who scored 1,203 goals in 228 games for West Perth between 1930 and 1945, at a remarkable average of 5.25 per match.

119,"This shouldn't be Justis Huni's make-or-break fight, but it will be his biggest test",sport," Sport Justis Huni vs Joe Goodall heavyweight boxing. How to watch, when is the fight It might be premature to think of this as Justis Huni's make-or-break fight. It should be — this is only his sixth professional outing. And yet, in boxing's inimitable fashion, Wednesday night's contest between Huni and Joe Goodall for the Australian Heavyweight title — as well as an alphabet soup of other regional titles — has been accorded the rare gravitas of a super fight. ""This will be one of the best heavyweight fights you see in Australia, probably since [1908] when Tommy Burns took on Jack Johnson down at Rushcutter's Bay, Sydney,"" Huni's promoter Dean Lonergan said at Monday's press conference. Huni, 5-0 (4 KO's), is Australia's prodigal son, judged by many as one of the most talented heavyweights the country has ever produced. As such, the all-Australian contest in Brisbane on Wednesday has been given the full big-fight treatment, including a pop-up ring in central Brisbane for the workouts and a well-attended public press conference. Huni is still on the path towards bigger and better things, but his fledgling career has seemingly stalled of late, thanks to a combination of injury and repeat COVID infections. The 23-year-old man-mountain from Logan has not fought in almost an entire year, since beating Paul Gallen on June 16, 2021 — a victory that came at the cost of his Olympic dream. This fight has been twice delayed and, given last week's shocking drive-by shooting of the Huni residence in Logan, the build-up has now reached fever pitch. Just 23 years old, Justis Huni is tipped to be the next big thing for Australian boxing. The 193cm Huni weighed in at a solid 110.05kg, the heaviest of his career and almost 4 kilos heavier than his last outing against Gallen. Goodall, slightly taller at 197cm, came in at a ripped 108.6kg. The winner of this fight is set to jump into the WBC, WBO and IBF world's top-15-ranked heavyweights, opening doors to some of the biggest names in the division. Eddie Hearn, owner of Matchroom Boxing and promoter of former two-time world heavyweight champ Anthony Joshua, is also reportedly set to be in attendance for the fight, which could open up even more doors for the winner. ""It's a massive opportunity. It's everything,"" Goodall said. Goodall, 8-0-1 (7 KO's), is well known to Huni. As young amateurs in Brisbane they sparred hundreds of rounds against each other as Goodall's stellar amateur career, which included a world championship silver medal and a Commonwealth Games bronze in Glasgow, took off. ""Ever since Justis turned pro I figured we would fight some day,"" Goodall said at the press conference. ""Everyone wants clean out their backyard before they move on."" Goodall, 29, has not yet fulfilled his potential in the professional ranks due to a litany of injuries, but has bounced back under the tutelage of 1984 Olympic silver medallist Kevin Barry in Las Vegas. Lonergan said that the match up ""seriously concerns"" him and that Goodall has come back from America a changed man who will be well-versed in boxing's ""dark arts"". Goodall refused to rise to Lonergan's accusations that he will bring ""dirty tricks"" to the ring, though, saying simply that he had ""tunnel vision"". However, last week Goodall warned Huni against underestimating him, and Barry admitted part of the game plan was to unsettle Huni. ""It's going to be physical,"" Barry said. ""We have too much respect for Justis's skill-set. If we go into a straight-out boxing contest, it's going to be very hard for us to win a 10-round decision here. ""We need to be physical, we need to take Justis hopefully here he's never been before."" As well as the pressure of defending an unbeaten record and shooting up the world ranking lists, additional focus has been placed on Huni's ability to land a serious knockout blow. Four of Huni's five victories have come inside the distance, but mostly through sheer weight of punches rather than a highlight-reel spark out. Meanwhile, seven of Goodall's eight wins have come by knockout, with six coming in the first round and the other in the second. That power will doubtless test Huni's chin — another attribute that critics have raised questions about since he was knocked out in sparing prior to the Gallen fight and suffered concussion after slipping on concrete, also in the build-up to that contest. ""This is what makes for a big fight,"" Goodall said at Monday's press conference. ""People come to see boxing for the power, the athleticism, the aggression, the violence even. ""People wanna see big head shots, blood. ""This fight could potentially give that."" From Goodall, whose coach described as a ""junkyard dog"" by Barry and ""hard iron"" by Huni's promoter Dean Lonergan, that's absolutely on the cards. But can Huni deliver that sort of violent conclusion? Huni has faced criticism for his relative lack of punching power, not least from Australian boxing legend Jeff Fenech, who told Fox Sports that Huni ""can't punch"". Thanks to his time in the amateur ranks, Huni has developed extraordinary hand speed for a heavyweight to capitalise on landing scoring punches as quickly as possible. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. In the professional ranks though, especially in the heavyweight division, landing scoring shots are less important than developing brutal one-punch power that can knock out an opponent with one blow — as demonstrated by ""Big Daddy"" Lucas Browne's first-round bludgeoning of Junior Fa on the George Kambosos-Devin Haney undercard. Huni has been relatively bullish in the lead-up, though, predicting a sixth-round stoppage victory with or without a clean one-punch finisher. ""I'm going to go out there and go for war and come back victorious,"" Huni said at Tuesday's weigh-in. ""My boxing abilities can help get me to where I need to. ""It's not it's not the end of the world if I don't have as much power as other guys. ""People have got that one-punch power but they won't be able to keep up with five, six punches coming at a time."" The fight card is set to get underway at QEII stadium in Brisbane at 7pm AEST. Huni and Goodall will likely make their ring walks a whole lot closer to 10pm, though. There are seven fights on the undercard, including unbeaten middleweight Andrei Mikhailovich. The fight will be available on Fox Sport's pay-per-view channel, Main Event, for $59.99.

120,'A lot more nerve-wracking': Aloisi hails Socceroos' spirit and new shootout legend Redmayne,sport," Sport John Aloisi says Socceroos' shootout was 'more nerve-wracking' than his own World Cup qualifying spot kick As the Socceroos lined up for the penalty shootout that would decide their World Cup fate, few people in the world could relate to the pressure of the moment as well as John Aloisi. It was Aloisi who famously stepped up and dispatched the winning spot-kick in 2005, beating Uruguay and securing Australia a first World Cup appearance in 32 years. Nearly 17 years later, Aloisi was just like the rest of us — sweating in front of the TV, hoping Andrew Redmayne and the team could get the job done. ""I can tell you now, it's a lot more nerve-wracking watching it than being involved in it and being able to control your own destiny,"" Aloisi said. This time around, Australia's hero wasn't a penalty taker but the goalkeeper between the sticks. It took a combination of Redmayne's unusual antics and strong hands to keep Peru's final penalty out, sending the Socceroos to a fifth straight World Cup. Aloisi knows better than most that that moment will change Redmayne's life. ""Andrew Redmayne stepped up in a clutch moment to make a big save,"" Aloisi said. ""Give credit to Graham Arnold, because he made that sub with one minute to go, taking off Mat Ryan — our number one keeper, and our captain — to put in Andrew Redmayne, and he made the save that helped us win the game. ""A lot of people will stop and talk to me about [Aloisi's winning penalty in 2005] and about me taking my top off (in celebration), but now I'm sure Andrew Redmayne will get to do the Wiggle dance a few times like he did in goals this morning."" Few gave Arnold's Socceroos much chance of qualifying after requiring wins over both the UAE and Peru in sudden-death playoffs. But Aloisi said the spirit of the team — which remains as strong now as it was in 2005 — had him in no doubt Australia would be Qatar-bound. ""I expected them to go through because I know what the Socceroos are all about,"" he said. ""That spirit that they show — especially when they are underdogs they show the world what they are capable of. Andrew Redmayne's surprise heroics embodied the risk, spirit, and character the Socceroos must now build upon. ""Time and time again we are able to do this. People are quick to criticise and write off our own, but the boys stuck together, stayed strong, they had the belief they could do it."" With qualification secured, now attentions will be turned to Qatar and the 2022 World Cup. The Socceroos have not progressed from the group stage since 2006, when Aloisi helped lead the team to a win over Japan and a draw with Croatia before the heart-breaking extra-time loss to Italy in the round of 16. Aloisi acknowledges the test that awaits, but says an emboldened Arnold and that famous Aussie spirit can once again make the impossible a reality. ""It's going to be difficult, we've got a very tough group. We've got France, Denmark and Tunisia,"" he said. ""But we're underdogs, and we should embrace and thrive on that spirit that Australians show and take it to them when we get to Qatar. ""It was very important for Graham Arnold, if he didn't win [against Peru] it would have been his last game. He wouldn't have been coaching the Socceroos in the future. ""He proved his doubters [wrong], he proved he is capable of doing it. He was strong in what he believed in and the way he wanted his team to play, and they ended up winning the game because of that belief. ""Now they can enjoy the moment, but it's about focusing for four months' time and the World Cup.""

121,'Fantastic to be able to race hard': Speeds high but injuries down in record-breaking Finke Desert Race,sport,"  Injury numbers down during record-breaking year for cars and bikes at NT's Finke Desert Race Records were broken in the car and bike categories of the iconic Finke Desert Race in Central Australia, held over the long weekend. The Finke Desert Race is a two-day annual event which sees hundreds of bikes and cars race from Alice Springs to the remote community Apatula (Finke) and back, on what is billed as the most challenging off-road course in the country. International motorsport champion Toby Price claimed his eighth King of the Desert title, setting a new record for fastest time on four wheels in the two-day event. Price, alongside navigator Jason Duncan, completed the race with an overall time of three hours, 21 minutes and 46 seconds. Price has previously conquered the race — billed as the most challenging off-road event in Australia — six times on a bike and one other time in a truck. ""If you'd [told] me back in 2010 that I would have won this event eight times [by now], I would have probably laughed at everyone,"" Price said. ""It's crazy. To get that second win in the truck now and actually have everybody here at the event and at the race, it actually does mean something and does count and we're stoked with that."" The pair competed together in 2018 and 2019 but did not finish the race. ""Third time's a charm. Here we are, we had some fun and no issues,"" Duncan said. Solo competitor Aaron James came in second, followed by Brent Martin and Ben Dawson in third. Alice Springs rider David Walsh also made record time, winning his third King of the Desert title in the bike category with an overall race time of three hours, 35 minutes and 45 seconds. Walsh beat the bike race record set by Toby Price in 2016 by 11 minutes. 'It feels amazing just to be at the front like this. It's an honour for me,"" he said. ""It's not something I thought I'd ever do watching it as a kid. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunities this race has given me."" New South Wales rider Jacob Smith took second place on the podium in his 13th Finke race, with West Australian Jack Simpson, just 43 seconds behind, coming in third. Spectators were directed to stand at least 20 metres back from the track this year in response to a fatal crash during last year's race when a vehicle veered off the track and into a group of onlookers, killing 60-year-old Nigel Harris. Race organisers warned the event would not continue beyond 2022 if there was another serious accident involving a spectator. ""Spectators have done a fantastic job adhering to the conditions,"" second-place car winner Aaron James said. ""The race committee have done a fantastic job at addressing the issue and as a racer it's fantastic to be able to race hard without any concern."" Walsh and Price both commented that the new rules gave them peace of mind while racing. St John's Director of Ambulance Services Andrew Thomas said the number of injuries during the event was down on previous years, and congratulated race organisers for enforcing new safety standards. ""Unfortunately there are going to be some people that flout the rules at times which is disappointing, cause those measures are there for their safety as well as the safety of the competitors,"" he said. ""But all in all, from our perspective it was a really good event."" Mr Thomas said St John's Ambulance staff treated about 30 people during the event. He said none of the competitors had serious head, neck or back injuries. ""Most of the injuries were limb injuries and unfortunately a couple of fractures,"" he said. Close to 60 St John's Ambulance staff were on hand at the start and finish lines, along the length of the track, and in helicopters during the weekend. Unrelated to the race, a nine-year-old girl received serious injuries when she was hit by a car driving on a track near where the event was taking place on Sunday afternoon. Mr Thomas said the girl had suffered injuries to her head and pelvis, and a fractured femur. She was transported to Alice Springs Hospital where she was in a stable condition in ICU on Tuesday. Northern Territory police said the driver, a 32 year old man, was not a competitor in the Finke Desert Race and was assisting police with inquiries. On Saturday morning, one man was flown to hospital in Adelaide in a critical condition and another left with a serious jaw injury following a head-on collision between the two motorbike riders who were not involved in the Finke Desert Race. The crash happened off the Maryvale Road, near Finke.

122,Five things you need to know about the Socceroos at the World Cup,sport," Sport The Socceroos have qualified for the World Cup finals. Here are five things you need to know about the tournament The Socceroos have won their way through to a fifth consecutive World Cup, thanks to a dramatic penalty shootout victory over Peru. Here are five things you need to know about the Australian team's challenge at this year's finals. The FIFA World Cup will be held in the Middle Eastern nation of Qatar, starting on November 21 and ending with the World Cup final, which will kick off at 2am AEDT on December 19. There will be 32 teams competing in Qatar, split into eight groups of four. The top two in each group will advance to the knockout stages. Matches will be held at eight venues, in or surrounding the capital, Doha. The final will be held at the 80,000-seater Luhail Stadium, 21 kilometres north of the capital. Australia, as the winner of the intercontinental play-off with Peru, has been drawn in Group D, alongside France, Tunisia and Denmark. This is a very similar group to the one the Socceroos were in four years ago in Russia, when Australia played France, Denmark and Peru. The Socceroos will play all their games at the Al-Janoub Stadium, 20 kilometres outside Doha. Their first game will be against France on November 23 at 6am AEDT. The Australians will next face Tunisia on November 26 at 9pm AEDT. Their final game will be against Denmark on December 1 at 2am AEDT. Four years ago, Australia failed to make it out of the group stage, finishing fourth behind France, Denmark and Peru with one point from three matches. This year's tournament shapes as a difficult task for Graham Arnold's men. France went on to win the World Cup in 2018, lifting the trophy for the second time. Andrew Redmayne's surprise heroics embodied the risk, spirit, and character the Socceroos must now build upon. Although they are not going quite as well at the moment, they are ranked three in the world and still have stars like strikers Kylian Mbappé, Karim Benzema and Antoine Griezemann, midfielder N'Golo Kanté, defender Raphaël Varane and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. The Danes are ranked 11 in the world, and on form would be expected to reach the second round along with the French. Their most famous player is star playmaker Christian Eriksen, who survived a heart attack during the Euro 2020 tournament, and has returned to Premier League football and looks set to be included in the Danish squad for Qatar. Tunisia are ranked 35 in the world, and this is the sixth time they have qualified for the World Cup finals. They have won only twice out of their 15 games at the tournament — the Tunisians are yet to make it to the knockout stages. Australia will need to beat Tunisia and get at least a draw out of France or Denmark to have a chance of progressing. Aside from the defending champions France, the favourites for the World Cup are all also former winners. Brazil has won the tournament a record five times, and will be again considered big chances, led by striker Neymar, attacking midfielder Raphinha, winger Vinícius Júnior and goalkeeper Alisson. The English team with star striker Harry Kane will want to go one step further after a tough loss in the Euro 2020 final. Spain will also be in the mix, with strikers Marco Asensio and Álvaro Morata among others. And the other big chance will be Argentina, led by superstar Lionel Messi, who will be hoping to win a first World Cup in what is probably his last finals. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. The big change for this year's World Cup is that the tournament has been scheduled for a November start. Normally, World Cups are held in the northern summer months, in July or August. This year the move has been made to avoid the intense heat of a Qatari summer, when temperatures can average 42 degrees Celsius or higher. To ensure comfort for fans and players, all eight open-air stadiums in use for the World Cup will be air-conditioned, using specially designed coolant systems.

123,analysis: Darkest before the dawn — how Graham Arnold has turned the fortunes of the Socceroos around,sport," Sport Just months ago the Socceroos were at their lowest ebb, but now Graham Arnold has a shot at redemption If the darkest hour comes just before the dawn, that hour for the Socceroos was on the 24th of March this year in Sydney. The Socceroos were soundly beaten 2-0 by Japan at the Stadium Australia that day, giving up any hope of direct qualification to the World Cup. While the Socceroos were shown up on the park, Football Australia (FA) board members were seething that the team's coach, Graham Arnold had broken COVID protocols by taking a walk on the beach and hit him with a $25,000 fine. Arnold, meanwhile, felt he had no support from FA given he had medical advice that he was just shedding the virus from his COVID infection earlier in the year. People close to Arnold say he felt heavily let down by FA and harboured doubts over whether he would keep his job. Meanwhile, with the team having jetted in from around the world, the Socceroos had to make do with Arnold coaching via Zoom for five days in the lead-up to what was then the most important game in a World Cup campaign that began in 2019. The side looked a rabble on and off the field. It had all started so well with a record 11-game winning streak, but once the wheels started wobbling, it wasn't long before they fell off altogether. The streak was followed by three losses, three draws and just one win as the drum beats started sounding for Arnold's sacking. FA held their nerve amid the cacophony and took the unusual step of announcing that Arnold would keep his job to the end of the World Cup campaign. Few thought it would last more than one or two more games. But the Socceroos got back on track with a win over Jordan in a friendly, before accounting for United Arab Emirates in the Asian play-off, and now the historic win over Peru. Twenty games over three years with only four at home through the ravages of the COVID pandemic took out numerous players, along with serious injuries. The Socceroos have done it the hard way, against all the odds, but they've done it. ""It was so hard, you know the whole campaign,"" Arnold said this morning when he finally found the strength to speak after the stress of the penalty shoot-out. ""The way they stuck at it, and the way they've committed themselves to it … incredible. ""I believe this is one of the greatest achievements ever – to qualify for this World Cup the way we've had to go through things."" Few could argue. The so-called Golden Generation that qualified for the 2006 World Cup finally exorcised the demons that haunted the team that had come so close on the two previous occasions. Socceroos substitute goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne danced his way into national folklore this morning – and the internet went a wild emotional rollercoaster ride with him. That team was full of stars: Harry Kewell, Mark Bresciano, Mark Viduka, Lucas Neill, Vince Grella, Scott Chipperfield, Mark Schwarzer, and the list goes on — all plying their trade at the highest levels of European football. Their qualification was vindication. The only comparison that can be made between the 2005 and 2022 Socceroos is that they both achieved qualification via the most nerve-testing of penalty shoot-outs. This team is something altogether different: a potpourri of A-League players and others from leagues around the world and only a couple in those top European sides. Players like Tom Rogic, Mat Ryan and Trent Sainsbury are now the only link to the Golden Generation, along with the coach. This team now has the chance to create its own legacy, its own image, free from the constraints of history. They may not have the talent of previous generations, but they've shown they can battle with the best of them. The Australian Boomers basketball side spoke glowingly of the culture in the team that had been passed down for generations when they made history winning their ""rose gold"" medal by coming third in the Olympics. There's little doubt that this side has some of that same spirit. The play-off hero, goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne, said Socceroos legend Tim Cahill had spoken to the team and told them that they had to make their own history. ""For the players (who) have gone on to cement a second and third World Cup for themselves and the young boys that'll experience their first World Cup, it's amazing,"" he said. Redmayne also spoke glowingly of Arnold. ""Everyone's a part of it and he makes everyone feel so welcome and so at home within this group,"" he said. ""Everyone feels at home when they do represent the country."" Harry Souttar is one of them – one of two Scots scouted to play for the Socceroos over the past few years. A few years ago he'd never set foot in the country. Last December he ruptured his ACL playing for Australia and he's still in rehab after a knee reconstruction. But he was there in Doha supporting the team and celebrating wildly with the rest of the players and staff when Redmayne pulled off the save that will go down in Australian sporting folklore. Souttar will be back in central defence when the Socceroos play their first match at the World Cup in November. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. He'll be joined by Celtic central midfielder and linchpin, Rogic, who missed these two matches. Sainsbury will likewise be back from injury. And Arnold — who before the Japan game bemoaned the fact that he couldn't instil any game plan for the Socceroos with his limited preparation — will have weeks in an intensive camp to hone his side. By merely qualifying, the Socceroos have given the game a massive shot in the arm. The CEO of the Australian Professional Leagues, which runs the A-League competitions, Danny Townsend, said the Socceroos' participation will remind everyone how big the game is. ""Nothing unifies football more than the World Cup and having the national men and women competing,"" he said. ""It will refocus attention on the game and give us a chance to unify the game in Australia and focus on working together to drive the opportunities that we know to exist."" But simply being there won't be good enough for the Socceroos, they'll want this journey to last as long as it possibly can. It's a new dawn for the Socceroos — and their destiny is in their hands.

124,"analysis: Unshackled from their past, the Socceroos are finally ready to embrace the future",sport,"  Unshackled from their past, the Socceroos' win against Peru shows they're finally ready to embrace the future Half an hour before the Socceroos' final World Cup qualifying match against Peru on Tuesday morning, head coach Graham Arnold was handed a small gold pin. The pin took the form of a medieval shield, the type often used on football club crests around the world. The detailing was quite simple: a sky-blue background, a bright gold kangaroo, a large black letter ""A"", and the number 1922. Arnold held the pin carefully, feeling the weight of it in his hands, before hooking it into the fabric of his shirt on the left side of his chest, right next to the bright green logo of Australia. The pin was given to Arnold to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first recorded Socceroos match, which took place a century ago this Friday. It was a small gesture, but one that captured the essence of Arnold's stewardship of this team and its story over the past few nerve-wracking months: namely, how he has navigated the transition from the past to the future. On the one hand, Graham Arnold is one of the last remaining links to a chapter of the Socceroos' history that is now drawing to a close. As both a player and a coach, he has been part of the national team set-up during its most significant moments over the past three decades, from the World Cup qualifying loss to Iran in 1997, to the famous win over Uruguay in 2005 and, now, to the team's fifth consecutive appearance in Qatar later this year. On both sides of the white line, Arnold has helped define the history, culture, and identity of the Socceroos as modern fans have known them. The reverence with which he wears the small gold pin on his chest is not feigned: his story and the story of this national team are deeply, existentially intertwined. But that connection has not always sat comfortably with his critics. As the Socceroos' fortunes began to turn on them during qualifying earlier this year, and with concerns growing around the team's tactics and player selections heading into the continental play-offs, Arnold increasingly drew upon this well-spring of emotion and history to try and resuscitate the public's (and perhaps also the players') fading optimism. ""It's an old Aussie trait,"" he said before the UAE match, when fan sentiment was at one of its lowest ebbs. ""The old 'Aussie DNA' was backs-to-the-wall. We like that; we liked being the underdog, we liked people saying that we have no chance or we cannot achieve anything. ""That was the way it used to be in Australia [...] and that's what I've been driving to these boys. Sometimes you don't play well but you can still win by fighting and running and chasing and being aggressive. That can also be a success."" Those appeals to 'how things used to be' were echoed by other former players, too, including John Aloisi, Mark Schwarzer, Mark Bosnich, and Robbie Slater; players who, like Arnold, developed their ideas of what it meant to play as Australians back when players had to ""fight and scratch and do whatever you have to do"" to get paid, let alone get points. Because on the other hand, Arnold is ushering in a new generation of young Australian footballers: players whose understanding of the game, of themselves, of the nation, and of what it means to play for it have changed in the two decades since the ""golden years"". They're a group who haven't reached the illustrious club heights of their big-name predecessors; a group who are no longer big-money-makers or household names. They're a group who have been asked to keep alive a century of something that they have not been part of for very long. History is, of course, a powerful motivator. But so too is the fear of not being able to live up to it. For some, Arnold's harking-back to the past in recent weeks was seen as a different kind of medieval shield: a defence, a deflection from the football-specific issues that arose as the performances of this new generation of cobbled-together Socceroos began to wane. Late goals deliver Japan a 2-0 victory, meaning the Socceroos will have to go down the intercontinental knock-out path to reach the World Cup in Qatar. Australia's final two group qualifying games against Japan and Saudi Arabia in March exposed the problems plainly: flat and conservative in possession, too reliant on outdated athleticism and physicality, too dependent on certain patterns of predictable play, lacking multi-dimensional goal-scoring options and technical attacking midfielders, unable to improvise or create something from nothing. Their performances, in other words, did not square with the kind of identity or character - the ""Aussie DNA"" - that the Socceroos, in Arnold's words, were supposed to represent. They seemed, more than anything else, afraid: to take risks, to experiment, to be brave. Afraid, ultimately, to fail. And who could blame them, with the weight of such history hanging like a millstone around their necks? But then Peru happened. And something changed. Fear transformed into fight. Uncertainty morphed into determination. Hopelessness became hunger. Doubt gave way to belief. The identity and character that Arnold had been appealing to was made manifest for 120 minutes in Doha. Perhaps it was by virtue of exactly all that had come before it: the mounting pressure, the lack of faith, the fading hopes, the fear of not living up to the past. The Socceroos were not just the underdogs against the people on the field: a spirited Peru side from a continent Australia hadn't defeated in over a decade, buoyed by 15,000 travelling fans in full, rapturous voice. They were also underdogs to the thousands of Australians who turned on their televisions expecting to watch the dull, exhausted whimper of a Socceroos team crushed by the weight of their own history. What they got, instead, was a group of players who refused to be so. After a tense, exhausting 120 minutes in Doha, Australia emerged victorious over their rivals and will play at the 2022 World Cup. From the opening minutes, Australia played beyond themselves; beyond the team we thought they were. But at the same time, they played exactly how we've always wanted them to. They fought, they scrapped, they chased, they harassed. They suffocated Peru with a kind of collective national willpower, resulting in the South Americans registering just a single shot on target all game. Granted, the Socceroos didn't manage much better in that sense (two shots on target), but there was something in the way this group of men worked for each other that made us believe in them again; made us believe that something special could happen. And so it did, thanks to perhaps the most decisive moment of the match; the moment that showed that this team has finally climbed out from the shadow of its own past. The substitution of captain Mat Ryan, the team's most experienced player, for Sydney FC goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne, who made just his third ever appearance for Australia today. It came from nowhere. Even the other players didn't know it was going to happen. Redmayne and Arnold and the goalkeeping staff were the only ones in on it. It shocked the fans, it shocked Peru, it shocked the Socceroos themselves. It was brave, it was a risk - it was something Australia under the conservative Arnold haven't been known for. And it worked. Redmayne's unexpected appearance - coupled with his untraditional, dancing preparation style that saved the final penalty and saw Australia win 5-4 - was the moment the Socceroos had been waiting for: a final reminder that they are not beholden to what has come before, but are capable of doing something different, something daring, something truer to who they are now, and still achieve greatness. As young penalty scorer Awer Mabil said afterwards: ""We want to create our own chapter. We obviously know the history that Australian football has [with] the Golden Generation; we'll always be compared to that. ""But that, for me, is impossible because all individuals have their own qualities and their own careers. Timmy, Harry, Viduka - they were all playing at a top level. We all, as young players, want to achieve that. So for me, I see it as motivation. ""Now, it's time for us to write our own future; our own script. The next goal for Australia is we're going to qualify directly. For me, as a player, it's been shit that we didn't qualify directly [this time], but we're going to do that next time. That's the motivation for the younger generation. ""We always do it the hard way as Aussies but now it's time to change that picture and make it easier. That comes with hard work."" This is a team no longer shackled to their past; no longer burdened by the crest emblazoned on their chests. Finally, they have been freed from it. And the future, for the first time in years, has never looked so green and gold and bright.

125,Rollercoaster of emotions: Paige Hadley makes Diamonds team after finals blow,sport," Sport Paige Hadley makes the Commonwealth Games Diamonds team after Swifts miss out on Super Netball finals Paige Hadley has experienced a rollercoaster of emotions over the past 24 hours – from managing her disappointment of missing out on this year's Super Netball finals, to celebrating selection in her first Commonwealth Games team. The NSW Swifts co-captain and defending premiership player declared at the start of this year that her team was aiming to lift back-to-back trophies. Unfortunately, yesterday afternoon, as Hadley and her teammates nervously sat together at a Sydney café, that dream was put to bed. ""Most of us were sat at a café and we couldn't decide whether to watch that final match or not,"" Hadley told the ABC. ""I ended up turning it off, and then Maddy Proud was watching it at the end … when we asked her the score she said: 'you don't want to know'."" Heading into the final round of the regular season, everyone was trying to do the maths, with four teams locked in a for-and-against battle for a semi-finals place. The Melbourne Vixens, West Coast Fever and Giants had already secured their top-four finishes, while the Swifts, Adelaide Thunderbirds, Queensland Firebirds and Collingwood Magpies were all jostling for the final spot. On Sunday, the Thunderbirds were ruled out of contention when they lost to the Fever (68-57), before the Swifts knocked the Firebirds out of the race with a narrow victory (63-61). At this point, just 0.26 per cent separated the Magpies in fourth and the Swifts in fifth, leaving it up to the Melbourne derby on the Queen's birthday public holiday to determine who scraped through. The Magpies needed to either beat the Vixens or lose by a margin of no more than three goals to retain fourth place. At the final break, they trailed by seven, but a big fourth quarter saw them turn things around to lose the match by two (56-54) and keep their season alive. The result was so close that it came down to the very last shot of the match, when Vixens goal shooter Mwai Kumwenda was unable to convert a two-point super shot in the dying seconds. ""That last shot from Kumwenda, if it had've dropped that would have been us in, so even though it shouldn't have come down to that, it was disappointing,"" Hadley said. ""There were lots of moments throughout this year where we played great netball, but we just didn't get the win and obviously every little win, and every goal, would have helped us in this circumstance. ""To know you're missing finals for the first time in three years, you do feel a bit numb, but given the context of the week we had in the lead up to our final match, the fact we even put ourselves in a position to contend is going to make us hungrier."" Hadley was referring to the COVID wave that swept through the Swifts' camp last week, ruling their coach, manager and two of their players out for the all-important clash. The impact of losing their starting goal shooter — Trinidad and Tobago star Samantha Wallace — to an ACL injury in the first game of the season also had a lasting effect. ""Once we lost Sammy, our whole attack end had to change … you've got to be proud of the way we had to adapt and still matched it with the best, I think that new style of play is only going to be an asset for us once Sammy is back next year,"" she said. Despite the Super Netball disappointment, Hadley said she feels grateful to have something to look forward to now she's been announced in the Australian netball team for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Hadley made her debut for the Diamonds in 2013 at 21-years-old and represented Australia at the last two World Cups. However, the Commonwealth Games has always been somewhat out of reach, after she suffered an ACL injury in 2014 and missed selection in 2018. Now, not long before her 30th birthday, she'll finally tick off that long-awaited goal. ""We got the calls last Monday and it was mind-blowing for me to hear I made it ... that day is always tough because you've already been told ahead of time when you'll get the phone call and you're hoping for the best, but also preparing for the worst,"" she said. ""When I heard the news I burst into tears. I desperately wanted the opportunity to fight back for that gold medal. ""Although it hasn't fully sunk in yet, now the team is out there and all the rumours are done, we can finally enjoy it."" The makeup of the Diamonds midcourt has been a hot topic amongst pundits and fans for months, with so many great Australian players putting their hand up for selection. Head coach Stacey Marinkovich has settled on the tried and tested Vixens duo of Liz Watson and Kate Moloney, cross-code Collingwood star Ash Brazill and super-driven utility Hadley. Yet there are other players like Hadley's co-captain Maddy Proud who've had outstanding years and can count themselves unlucky for being overlooked. Swifts defender Maddy Turner is another odd omission, considering her incredible form this season alongside selected goal keeper Sarah Klau. Hadley revealed Marinkovich's calls were grouped in club order this time around: ""I got the call I was in and minutes later I got a text from Maddy Turner saying 'unfortunately I haven't made it', so it was instantly like going from a moment of pure joy to a gut-wrenching feeling that's so hard to comprehend. ""You spend so much time with your teammates, and you try to work for these things together, so it's a tough situation because you go back to the club the next day and people want to enjoy that moment with you, but you feel commiseration for others. ""That's why I think it hasn't sunk in just yet, because you're focused on keeping the team together before you can turn your attention to the next thing."" The Diamonds lost their gold-medal status at the last Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in 2018. Now they're hoping to win it back, with England again looking like their biggest challenge. The team will prepare together in camps in Perth and Manchester before the campaign begins on July 29, running through to August 7.

126,From disbelief to exultation – how the internet reacted to Socceroos heroics,sport,"  You can dance if you want to: How the internet reacted to the Socceroos triumph and Andrew Redmayne's heroics As Socceroos manager Graham Arnold motioned for a sub, and it became clear it was his goalkeeper and captain, Mat Ryan, that would be trotting off to be replaced by Andrew Redmayne, it began. Nervous laughter at best, spittle-flecked rage at worst, the online response to the most audacious of technical substitutions suddenly burst forth. It bears remembering the context surrounding this substitution. Arnold has been under acute pressure this qualifying campaign, for good reason. After rolling through the initial stages unbeaten, his team has struggled to play fluently against quality opposition. Crunch defeats to Japan and Saudi Arabia seemingly had him on the verge of unemployment. Arnold has also been criticised for picking and fielding players perceived as 'his favourites', arguably to the detriment of the team's overall tactical coherence. The fact Redmayne was even selected in this Socceroos squad, after an unremarkable season with Sydney FC (Arnold's former employer) was used as further evidence to support this argument. Still, as the timeline reacted viscerally to the substitution, it was actually Arnold who was showing the most guts. And then the shoot-out started. Martin Boyle missed Australia's opening penalty, the worst possible start, and the heart sunk, the bile rose, and the teeth were bared and ready to gnash. Up walked Redmayne, whose trademark penalty-saving style involves dancing around on the line, in the hopes of putting off the taker; it worked for him and Sydney FC in the 2019 A-League grand final. But it wasn't working here, at least not to start, as Peru slotted home its first two penalties. There was an anxious streak to the reaction to Redmayne's introduction. It would be disappointing enough to lose a penalty shoot-out on the world stage, but to do so with your substitute goalkeeper dancing around like a long-lost Wiggle would add an unbearable layer of indignity. But then Luis Advíncula stepped up to take his penalty and after staring down Redmayne's latest improvised gyrations, struck his shot against the post. What had put him off? Redmayne's dancing? It's impossible to say for sure, but yes. Australia was back on level terms in the shoot-out. The next three Socceroos slotted home their spot kicks with aplomb, particularly Adjin Hrustic, whose droll roll oozed with the assuredness of a man who'd done this whole thing a few weeks earlier in the Europa League final with his club, Eintracht Frankfurt. We were plunged into a sudden death situation where, by virtue of Australia having gone first, any Peruvian miss would send us to Qatar - it was all set up for Redmayne to dance his way to national glory. And so he danced, and dove, and with a unyielding glove saved Alex Valera's penalty. And with that, having resigned themselves to the lure of the bitter abyss, Sokkah Twitter was yanked headfirst into the throes of meme-based ecstasy, as Redmayne posed with a huge, cheesy grin on his face, and his teammates sprinted over to mob him. Suddenly humble pies were being put out to cool on the sills of grand houses of condemnation. Redmayne's visage was plastered across the internet. And in Doha, Arnold had his hands on his head, his body coursing with pure relief, and no doubt some satisfaction too; his move had paid off. Of course, the coin-flip of a single penalty shoot-out doesn't invalidate the criticism of Arnold, won't catapult Redmayne into the first choice keeper's position, or indeed improve Australia's chances of doing well at the World Cup in Qatar. But we're there, we're going, we've got a ticket to the big tourney. Teetering on the knife edge between calamity and euphoria is often the natural resting place for football in this country. And this morning, euphoria – and Andrew Redmayne – won out.

127,"'Never give up on your dream, because it can come true': How this Dragons flyer made NRL history",sport,"  How Dragons winger Jonathon Reuben defied the odds to become the oldest debutant in NRL history It was roughly three or so hours before kick-off when the call came down for Jonathon Reuben. ""Hook (Anthony Griffin) called me in and he said 'be ready' and I was like 'shit, I better be' and I waited until 5 o'clock when it was definite,"" Reuben said. ""Then they said I was playing, and it was so good."" And that was it. The words had been spoken. It was going to happen, at last. Jonathon Reuben, after ten years of brilliance in reserve grade and a lifetime of dreaming, was going to do it. He was going to play in an NRL game. He would be a first grader. Be ready? He'd been ready all his life. That is how Reuben, a proud Indigenous and Torres Strait Island man whose family comes from Daly River and Darnley Island, and who scored 107 tries in 106 matches in the Queensland Cup and who lived 29 years, two months, three weeks and two days before this happened and who earned this chance a dozen times over, this is how he finally got there and became the oldest debutant in NRL history. Reuben felt good going into the match and he looked good once he got out there, notching 182 metres and a linebreak for St George Illawarra in their 31-12 loss to North Queensland last Friday night. ""I just wanted to do my job and do my best for the team. I loved every minute, it was fast, I was blowing a bit, I was always on my toes, but it was so good to be out there with some of the best players in the game,"" Reuben said. ""I was playing outside Ben Hunt, that's like playing on cloud nine."" The Dragons may have gone down to the Cowboys but Reuben's performance was a highlight in a tough day for the Red V, especially given the Townsville junior debuted in front of a home crowd at North Queensland Stadium. He may not have crossed the stripe, but he looked dangerous with several carries and took an intercept midway through the first half on his own goal-line which saved a try. In the lower leagues Reuben has known and dominated since he finished his prolific career in the Under 20s, that intercept would have been a four-pointer up the other end – but they run a bit faster in the top grade. The greatest try-scorer you never heard of is closing in on a belated shot at the NRL, and one team has the inside running. Watch Jonathon Reuben's highlights here. ""When I got the ball I thought I was gone, I was backing myself, but a heap of them were backing off and I knew if went for it there'd be a heap of them coming across,"" Reuben said. ""We were defending a lot in that half and for a second I thought I was gone, but then the play was to cut inside. But to make a break like that at home, I'll never forget that moment, running down the sideline, it was mad."" After such a long on the doorstep of first grade, where he played for Canberra and Newtown and Norths Devils and Sunshine Coast and a couple of other teams along the way, Reuben's belated NRL debut was worth the wait. He had a huge crew of family and friends with him last Friday, even if a few of them couldn't make it to the stadium on short notice – and he could feel the presence of his late father and brother with him when he took the field. ""My mum came, my nephew and his girlfriend, my other brother man and his family, a few of my other friends, there was enough there for support,"" Reuben said. ""My missus watched us from in Brisbane, my sister was out somewhere west of Mackay in the mines listening on the radio. Even though they couldn't all make it they were all emotional, and I was all emotional as well. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter ""I didn't sleep that night. I came back to the hotel after the game and I thought about my dad and my brother, and I wished they were here for this moment but I knew they were here in spirit. ""My brother and dad were big supporters of mine, and I knew they'd be looking down on me."" After spending 29 years waiting for his first NRL appearance, Reuben is ready for the second cap that could come in the next week or so. He understands that's the next step - he had a lifetime to get ready for his first NRL game, but maybe only week to get ready for his second, and that's a challenge he welcomes. And if you're in reserve grade in New South Wales or Queensland, he wants you to know you can do it as well, you can make it late in your career just like he did. If he can make history as the oldest man to ever make his NRL debut, anyone can do it, so long as they stay on the cause and never give up. ""It's a big relief, to play that one game. Whatever happens now, I'll do my best for the team. Knocking down that door and playing one game, I'm still buzzing,"" Reuben said. ""Nobody ever backed me, I just had my family and missus support me, nobody else backed me. So never give up, no matter how old you are. ""I might be 29 and everyone's talking about it, but 29 is the new 21. ""Never give up on your dream, because it can come true. ""To all the Queensland Cup players out there, it can happen. It can happen for you."" We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

128,'I'm no hero': How an A-League journeyman created history in ten intense minutes,sport,"  Socceroos goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne wins penalty shootout with dancing antics Andrew Redmayne is known as ""Redders"", or the ""Grey Wiggle"" — but, after a few frantic minutes in Doha this morning, he is now known as the unlikely hero of Australia's qualification for the World Cup in Qatar. Redmayne was on the pitch in Doha for a little over 10 minutes against Peru, but the substitute goalkeeper's save from Alex Valera sealed victory for the Socceroos and turned him into an instant internet star. Barring injuries, there is only one goalkeeper in any football side, unless you're about to go to penalties in a decisive World Cup play-off — in which case you swap in a second one if you're Socceroos coach Graham Arnold. Arnold pulled the same lever as Dutch national team coach Louis van Gaal, who chose a World Cup quarter-final in 2014 to sub out stopper Jasper Cillessen in favour of Tim Krul right before the end of extra time against Costa Rica. The Dutch went on to win the penalty shootout. It worked, again, for Arnold. Redmayne has been a goalkeeper in the A-League for 14 seasons, playing for five different clubs. After playing a handful of times for the Central Coast Mariners and the Brisbane Roar, he has had more productive stints at Melbourne City, Western Sydney Wanderers and most recently at Sydney FC, where he was part of two A-League title-winning teams in 2019 and 2020. Off the back of his form for the Sky Blues, he made his Socceroos debut as a starter in a friendly against South Korea in 2019, making several good saves in a 1-0 loss. The problem he faced was the presence of the Socceroos' first-choice between the sticks, Mat Ryan, who has been the last line of defence for Australia in two World Cups. Throughout Australia's lengthy World Cup qualification process, Ryan has remained the top pick, and so he was again for 117 of the 120 minutes against Peru in Doha. When coach Arnold opted to bring Redmayne off the bench with three minutes left before the end of extra time, it was the 33-year-old's third appearance in an Australian shirt. Cue the Grey Wiggle, as Redmayne is known for his antics when facing penalties. As the Peruvian players made their approach, Redmayne danced along the line, waving his arms furiously, wiggling his hips and moving from side to side at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. The key moment was the 12th penalty of the night, Peru's sixth. After Redmayne did his routine again, capering on one leg, crouching down and jumping up to put off Alex Valera, he planted his feet just long enough to get set, then dived correctly to his right and blocked the ball away. Elated, he got up and stood with his eyes wide, and mouth wide open as his teammates rushed in to mob him. ""I'm a bit lost for words,"" Redmayne said afterwards. ""It's a team game, it's a team effort, so I can't take any more credit than any of the other 27 [players] who are here. ""I'm no hero. I just played my role like everyone did tonight. ""This idea was floated pre-selection that this might eventuate in these kind of circumstances, and for the two or three weeks we've been here [in Qatar], I've kind of had that in my mind. ""I've been working on a few things in training but, at the end of the day, it's a flip of the coin — it's either right or left."" His teammates, coach and millions of Australian fans will disagree about his hero status, forever glad he chose right for that final penalty, ensuring that Redmayne goes down in Socceroos' history alongside the likes of 'keeper Mark Schwarzer against Uruguay in 2005.

129,"Yellowstone, eat your heart out: Riders mark 50 years of cutting excellence in Australia",sport,"  Hundreds of horse riders brave cold in Tamworth at national futurity event to celebrate 50 years of cutting In a blue sequined top, Lori Mackay rides into the show ring on Jack to mark the anniversary of a sport first seen in Australia 50 years ago. It was Ms Mackay's father, Greg Lougher, who introduced cutting horses to the nation from the United States. ""I was just 12 years old when I arrived in Australia … my father introduced western riding, western saddles, and all aspects of western riding,"" she said. Now the sport has grown to see hundreds of riders competing for hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and prizes. The National Cutting Horse Association (NCHA) runs its annual futurity event over two weeks in Tamworth, New South Wales. It involves a horse and rider cutting a cow away from a herd, stopping them from returning. This year's event was special though, not just because of a two-year hiatus due to COVID but riders also celebrated five decades of the United States sport in Australia. That was why Ms Mackay and a handful of retired trainers and riders got back in the saddle — some after two decades out of it — for a special ""legends"" cutting event. With more than 90 years of experience between them, Ms Mackay and 24-year-old Jack were the oldest pair. Ms Mackay was the only woman to compete in that particular event. ""My team is all women ... so girl power is damn sure going to be happening in this legends cutting,"" she said. A cutting legend in her own right and still riding, she has had plenty of girl power in the sport over the decades. ""I'm so proud of Australia … I think we are just as good as the United States and very, very proud of it."" The NCHA futurity is the largest event of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, with more than $700,000 in cash and prizes. Association president Troy Randell has seen significant growth during his time in the sport. ""We pay out almost three quarters of a million in the last week of the competition, so it has grown dramatically,"" he said. ""Like any sport, it [cutting] evolves, and these horses are becoming a lot more efficient in how they're handling their stock and the breeding is more and more critiqued. ""It's evolving in a number of aspects; it's great to see."" The growth is seen in the value of performance horses, with three-year-old filly Bad in Black breaking records to fetch $550,000 earlier this year at auction. Both Troy Randell and Lori Mackay believe the future of their industry is in safe hands with young up-and-comers like 14-year-old Olivia MacCallum. Her mum trains cutting horses and the youngster is hopeful of a long career in the industry. ""[I love this sport] so much; it's my whole world … this is all I do,"" she said. ""If my mum lets me, I want to drop out of school and be a trainer. ""I want to go to America and train for a bit. ""I want to win 10 futurities here and four in America and I want to have horses in the hall of fame.""

130,analysis: Bailey Smith's leaked photos spark renewed debate over AFL drugs policy,sport," Sport Bailey Smith's drug photos spark renewed debate over AFL's illicit drugs policy There are few issues able to tie the so-called ""AFL industry"" in knots as much as its illicit drugs policy. The Western Bulldogs' Bailey Smith's very public outing of drug use has once again thrown the policy into the spotlight and given rise to a renewed debate about its strengths and weaknesses. Smith's coach, Luke Beveridge, called for the policy to be scrapped, while Hawthorn president Jeff Kennett wants it strengthened, calling for zero-tolerance and a two-year ban without pay for players caught taking drugs. Former St Kilda star Nick Riewoldt recently said the policy allows ""wriggle room"" for players to take drugs – which he called a ""massive issue"" in the game. Smith has publicly spoken about his battles with anxiety in the past and since photos of him holding a bag of white powder were published, first on social media and subsequently across news outlets. He said he was taking drugs to help him cope with his mental health in the aftermath of last year's grand final loss to Melbourne. ""I do get waves of chronic anxiety,"" he told the Herald Sun. ""That period after losing the grand final, being away from home for a while, plus my own mental health issues that I've spoken publicly about, culminated in some poor decision making. ""It was more the aftermath of just lots of cameras in your face, lots of TikToks being made … just felt like I didn't get a breather and coming out of such a pressurised environment … and not knowing how to deal with the pressure afterwards. ""I reckon I went days without eating, even brushing my teeth, leaving my bedroom, couldn't talk to people. ""I couldn't even get out of bed to go to training. ""It's not an excuse to why I acted the way I did, but it certainly does provide context to why I made such a stupid decision that I did."" Smith will face the AFL's integrity unit on Tuesday and it's possible he'll be offered a two-match ban for ""conduct unbecoming"". It's the same penalty given to former Adelaide and now St Kilda player Brad Crouch in 2020 when he was caught in possession of drugs with his former teammate and now Geelong player Tyson Stengle, who was banned for four matches. Former GWS player Shane Mumford was also given a two-match ban after a video taken of him snorting a substance in 2015 emerged three years later. But any AFL sanction is quite separate to the process under the AFL's illicit drug policy, which allows players three ""strikes"" if they're found to have taken illegal drugs. A player with a first strike is given a $5,000 fine and counselled, but the information is kept strictly confidential. The player remains anonymous and only the club's doctor is told, so that they can help form a plan with the player including potential counselling and treatment. It's only when the player has a second strike that the player's name is publicly released, and they're given a four-match suspension and another $5,000 fine. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Three strikes warrants a 12-match suspension and a $10,000 fine. No player has been publicly outed for two strikes since the policy was updated in 2015 and only one player has received three strikes — Hawthorn's Travis Tuck in 2010. It leads to the accusation that the AFL has rubbery standards on illicit substances, as it appears the two-match ban for ""conduct unbecoming"" only comes into place when the player is publicly caught taking drugs. The approach seems to be allowing players to sniff, smoke or inject in the privacy of their own homes — or at the very least away from the prying mobile phones in Gold Coast nightclubs — then you'll remain unpunished, apart from a relatively small fine. Bailey Smith — the most popular player in the AFL if social media followers are anything to go by — was never going to snort drugs in a nightclub without a myriad of mobile phones recording his every move. Smith said the drugs were a means of coping – call it self-medicating — and it's why coach Beveridge said ""it's essentially a health issue for him"". Beveridge is no fan of the illicit drugs policy and takes issue with the AFL Players Association (AFLPA), which helped draw it up with the AFL and drug treatment professionals. ""None of us really feel it works,"" he said. ""Essentially any player with a clinically diagnosed mental health challenge will never be exposed to the policy anyway. Regardless of when you're tested you're always going to get a pass. ""So that's a real chink in the actual process. ""It needs to be reviewed all the time; I'm a big believer that it should disappear."" The ABC asked the AFL Players Association to respond to Beveridge's comments, but it declined. So, what is this ""chink"" in the process that Beveridge refers to? It's the same one that Riewoldt referred to as ""wriggle room"" when he spoke out about drugs in the game last month, after former teammate Sam Fisher appeared in court on serious drug trafficking charges. Under the illicit drugs policy, a player with a diagnosed mental health condition can enter a program, where they can receive counselling and medical care. They'll be target-tested while they're in the program but won't get a positive strike if they test positive. Obviously, the players in this group remain confidential and it's for that reason we don't know whether Smith was one of them and whether he will record a strike. But if he was, it will be interesting to see whether that remains confidential such is the interest in his case and the amount of information that seems to find its way into the public domain. It's here we see the wide divergence of views over the policy from those like Jeff Kennett, who favour zero-tolerance, to Beveridge, who wants it tossed out, to the AFLPA, which believes it does good work. The very fact that it operates behind closed doors – as it should to protect privacy – means the public doesn't know how effective the policy is. The AFL doesn't publish figures on how many players record a strike and we don't know how many people are participating in the program for those who have a mental health condition. But there are those on the inside who say the policy has helped many players. Most agree the fundamental aim of the drug policy should be to protect players' health. 'Just say no' doesn't work, so there's no point pretending drugs aren't an entrenched part of society, particularly among young people – the very demographic that makes up the AFL's playing list. As Beveridge said: ""As a father of two young boys who are 23 and 21, I've got a fair understanding that no-one's immune to it."" The question at the heart of the debate over the policy is: what is the best way to help players who may be struggling with drugs or mental health issues? Is it zero tolerance or open slather – or might the answer lie somewhere in the middle?

131,Driver safety in the spotlight after Lewis Hamilton in pain through Baku grand prix,sport," Sport Formula 1 regulations under discussion after Lewis Hamilton in pain from porpoising at Azerbaijan Grand Prix Mercedes driver George Russell says the future of the current Formula 1 regulations is being discussed after his teammate Lewis Hamilton looked visibly in pain after the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Porpoising, when aerodynamic forces make a car bounce along the track, has been a season-long issue that has been brought back into the spotlight after Sunday's race in Baku. Mercedes, as well as other teams including Ferrari and McLaren, have battled with the issue, which has been a by-product of new car regulations that came into effect this season. It has affected Mercedes the worst, with the issue being exacerbated on street circuits where the track is bumpier than standard racing circuits. After Sunday's race, Hamilton, who finished fourth, struggled to get out of his car while Mercedes boss Toto Wolff apologised to his star driver for the ""s***box"" he was in. Hamilton said during the race to his team, ""my back is killing me"", before saying it was only adrenaline that got him through. ""I can't express the pain you'd experience, particularly on the straight here,"" he told Sky Sports F1. ""At the end, you are just praying for it to end. ""Once we fix this bouncing, we are going to be right there in the race."" Russell, who is also director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, said there were ongoing discussions about whether there needed to be changes to fix the issue. ""It's just what we've got to deal with and live with at the moment, and we as drivers have to accept there's not going to be any short-term changes,"" he said. ""There are conversations ongoing about what the long-term future of these regulations holds. ""We've got a lot of brilliant engineers and intelligent people in this sport and I'm sure we'll find the right solution."" However, any suggestion that the sport's governing body (the FIA) should make changes is not universally supported. Sky Sports F1 presenter and former F1 driver Paul di Resta said teams like Red Bull have managed the issue well, while Ferrari remains quick despite noticeable bouncing. Di Resta said it was up to the teams to fix their issues, rather than asking for changes to the regulations. ""You can fix it. You can lift the car 10mm and the ride quality will be there,"" he said. ""But everybody knows it's all about speed. ""It's all about getting your team to work around the issues in developing a car. ""I think it's unfair to say it's up to the FIA."" Porpoising is anticipated to be an issue again for drivers when F1 returns to Montreal next weekend for the Canadian Grand Prix.

132,"analysis: AFL Round-Up: Mason's masterclass makes Melbourne's malaise real, but Pies are here to stay",sport," Sport AFL Round-Up: Mason Cox's masterclass makes Melbourne's malaise real, but Collingwood are here to stay A Mason Cox masterclass puts Melbourne's fears in sharper focus, while a returning Fremantle champion raises the Dockers' ceiling yet again. Welcome to the AFL Round-Up, where we digest the week that was. Where do you start with Monday's game? One of the best of the season, those three hours at the MCG offered up more storylines and questions than almost other this year. It's easiest to start with Melbourne, who are now officially on a losing streak. The Dees dropping three games all year felt almost impossible a month ago, so for the reigning champs to have lost three straight into the bye is quite an alarming turn of events. Coupled with what can only be considered off-field turmoil, the Demons find themselves at a crossroads. This moment right now is either the death of a dynasty or a recalibration point. It's suddenly very difficult to pick which path they will take. As for Collingwood, their whole season has been building to a day like this. Strong performances didn't always lead to positive results in the opening month or two, but they are now getting reward for what is clearly top-eight-worthy play. They are one of, if not the best pressure and tackling team in the league. Their half-back line is an electric attacking force, supported by the steady presence of Jeremy Howe, Darcy Moore and co. The combination of heat at the coalface and willingness to counter-attack at all costs is a tough one to beat. Only their own inaccuracy threatened to thwart them against Melbourne. The narrative around Collingwood is no longer if they are good enough to play finals, but how high in the eight they can finish. There's a top three in the league right now, and then at least six teams in a group below that, of which the Pies are justifiably one. And finally, a word for Mason Cox. There's something transcendent about a Mason Cox Game, and he's produced probably three or four of them in his unique career thus far. The lift he gives his teammates and supporters when it's all going his way is palpable, and worth much more than marks or goals. Against Melbourne on Monday, Cox played the best game of his career. Better than the 2018 prelim against Richmond. Better than the 2020 final in Perth. When Cox is on like that, it's a shared experience for everyone who loves footy. He's a confounding player, but he alone has produced more joy for football fans than most. Saturday proved both a success and a failure for the ""Throw Nat Fyfe Forward"" movement, which despite the recent groundswell has actually been developing for a number of years. The thought that this version of Fyfe might best serve Freo in the forward line came well before his back injury, from the recognition that the Dockers' young midfield group was on the precipice of taking ownership, but their forward line lacked a focal point. It wasn't an idea Fyfe himself was keen to entertain in preseason, but things have shifted quickly and dramatically for our wharfie friends in Freo. Those young mids have taken charge and not looked back, and a willing batch of small forwards surrounding Rory Lobb have proved a capable mix. Which left many wondering before this weekend just where Fyfe would fit. We shouldn't have been surprised by the answer. Nat Fyfe fits anywhere he wants to. When he played forward, he had a gravitational pull that freed space for teammates. And despite spending only half his time in the guts, no Docker managed more clearances than the two-time Brownlow man. All this with the rust of a long absence still conspicuously clinging on. Fyfe doesn't have to be the final piece or the cherry on top, he can just be himself, capable of playing multiple roles and excelling in any of them. Fyfe may one day settle down as a more permanent forward, but that day hasn't arrived yet. Having been built on such solid foundations, that sort of flexibility will be invaluable to a Freo side now waiting to find out if they are ready for that next step in September. The Bombers' pre-game celebrations on Friday night were quite something. Essendon's players responded to the emotion of the evening, but Carlton successfully doused the flames and won with solid structure and class. Like good teams should. The Jason Horne-Francis situation is getting a bit concerning for North now. He is clearly frustrated with his and the team's state of affairs, and the contract situation is alarming, but he's not playing well either. A bye and a suspension might offer a good chance to sit down with the club and sort things out. Port Adelaide weren't horrible at all against Richmond, but their 0-5 start meant they had no margin of error for the rest of the season and a few upsets would be required on the run home. They're too far back now. The Lions are limping their way to the bye a bit, and simply had to find a way to beat St Kilda on Saturday night. It was pretty rough, but it was good enough. They're now wonderfully poised atop the ladder at the turn. Here we take stock of who is leading the race for the season's individual awards. Two brilliant weeks on the trot have seen Nick Daicos nudge ahead in the race for the Rising Star, in front of the likes of Nic Martin, Jai Newcombe and Sam De Koning. And yet Daicos is still capable of more in a creative and attacking sense, and may well need to show it by the end of the season to hold off the tough competition behind him. Connor Rozee's fresh feet and tidy finish earn him the goal of the week, but for now Ed Langdon remains the leader in the GOTY race. And in another pretty meagre week for big marks, Curtis Taylor can have mark of the week — his teammate Cam Zurhaar's grab in Perth is still the one to beat.

133,'Complete ecstasy': Socceroos heading to 2022 World Cup after nail-biting qualifier goes to penalty shootout,sport,"  Socceroos heading to 2022 World Cup after victory in nail-biting qualifier against Peru The Socceroos have qualified for a fifth-straight World Cup after penalty shootout win over Peru in their intercontinental play-off in Qatar. Substitute goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne was the humble hero, making the winning save as Australia won the shootout 5-4 after the match finished 0-0 after extra-time. ""I'm no hero. I just played my role like everyone else did tonight,"" the A-League veteran said after the match. ""Not even the 11 on the pitch, it was much more than that, it is a team effort. ""I can't thank the team enough, the staff enough. You know, I'm not going to take credit. The boys ran out 120 minutes, and it not only takes 11 on the field but the boys on the bench, the boys in the stands."" Mathew Ryan was the man to make way for Redmayne after putting in a stellar performance to keep Peru off the board after 120 minutes. ""I'm sure Matty would have been disappointed, but everyone played their part,"" Mitchell Duke said. ""I can't explain this feeling, it is just complete ecstasy, and I can't wait to celebrate with the boys. Thank you for believing in us. We are going to a World Cup, five in a row!"" Coach Graham Arnold had been under pressure heading into the match after some underwhelming performances in the lead-up, and paid tribute to the players for their efforts under trying conditions. ""So proud of the players, you know?"" Arnold said. ""No one knows what those boys have been through to get to here. It was so hard, the whole campaign, and the way they've stuck at it and committed themselves to it, incredible."" After 120 goalless minutes, Aaron Mooy, Craig Goodwin, Ajdin Hrustic, Jamie Maclaren and Awer Mabil all scored from the spot to make up for Martin Boyle's miss, before Redmayne denied Peru's Alex Valera to spark joyous celebrations at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. The victory is also a triumph for Arnold, who will now lead the country to a World Cup finals after fighting to save his job when he missed out on automatic qualification in March. His decision to bring on Redmayne in place of Ryan just before fulltime will go down as a master-stroke with the Sydney FC goalkeeper joining Mark Schwarzer and John Aloisi as a World Cup penalty shootout hero. ""Look, Andrew Redmayne is a very good penalty saver,"" Arnold said. ""And to try to get into the mind … to add that little bit of uncertainty in their brains. That's the reason why."" The dramatic finish came after a goalless 120 minutes, with Peru going closest to breaking the deadlock when substitute Edison Flores hit the post with a header in the second period of extra-time. Earlier, Australia made the early running in a stadium dominated by Peruvian fans, with Duke flashing a couple of early efforts past the goal while Scottish-born winger Boyle was dangerous out on the right. The first shot on target for either team came via Hrustic in the 81st minute but his long-range free kick was easily claimed by Peru captain Pedro Gallese. Four minutes later, Aziz Behich just failed to bend a skidding effort on target after the left-back picked up a loose ball and beat two Peruvians before having a shot from outside the box. Hrustic nearly stole the win for Australia in the 88th minute when he was found by substitute Mabil's cutback but Gallese just managed to keep the midfielder's shot from squirming in. Flores had Peru's first shot on target in the game in the first period of extra-time before his header hit the post. Arnold then turned to Redmayne moments before the final whistle, in a decision which will now go down in Australian sporting folklore. ""The doubters don't bother me. It's these boys that I care for,"" Arnold said. ""I called out Anthony Albanese the other day, to give everyone, give the fans a day off to celebrate this because I believe this is one of the greatest achievements ever, to qualify for this World Cup the way we've had to go through things. ""Twenty World Cup qualifiers and we've played 16 away from home. It's been tough but we did it."" Australia has secured its spot Group D, and while it's arguably not a group of death, it won't be an easy run. Australia will now face Denmark, France and Tunisia at November's World Cup in Qatar. France is ranked 3rd in the world, Denmark is ranked 11th, and Tunisia is 35th. Australia is ranked 42nd. Group A: Qatar, Ecuador, Senegal, Netherlands Group B: England, Iran, USA, Wales Group C: Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Poland Group D: France, Australia, Denmark, Tunisia Group E: Spain, Germany, Japan, Costa Rica/New Zealand (4am Wednesday kick-off) Group F: Belgium, Canada, Morocco, Croatia Group G: Brazil, Serbia, Switzerland, Cameroon Group H: Portugal, Ghana, Uruguay, South Korea Look back at how the match unfolded in our live blog. By Samantha L This November, Australia will face two of the same opponents they played at the 2018 World Cup in Russia: reigning world champions France and Denmark, with the third nation in their group being Tunisia. Graham Arnold and his coaching staff have five months to try and bottle what the Socceroos demonstrated in this game and fine-tune it (ideally with the addition of a few fresh players, particularly in the attacking line, who can add some extra spark) so that we can take the game to these big nations in the same way we brought the game to Peru today. The South Americans were undoubtedly the favourites heading into this play-off. They were ranked 21 in the world and on a dream run. But the Socceroos stood firm for most of the match and frustrated the Peruvians, who struggled to create many major chances. The final 15 minutes of regular-time, and the entire 30-minute period of extra-time, was all about simply not giving up. You feel like it wasn't just Peru that Australia needed to prove a point to, but also their own fans, many of whom had already written them off before the opening whistle had blown. This is a truly galvanising moment for this Socceroos group, who have shown not just the country but also themselves what they're capable of when there is no other option. What a match. What a moment. What a team. Thank you so much for following along with ABC's live coverage of Australia's intercontinental play-off match. I've been your shaking, squealing host, Samantha Lewis. WE'RE GOING TO THE WORLD CUP, BABY! SEE YOU IN NOVEMBER!!! By Samantha L By Samantha L ""Bit lost for words. I can't thank the team, the staff enough. ""I'm not going to take credit because the boys ran out for 120 minutes. It not only takes the 11 on the field, but the boys on the bench, the boys in the stands, the boys who missed out on this squad as well. It's a team effort; it's a team game."" And on the whole penalty substitution: ""This idea was floated pre-selection, that this might eventuate in these circumstances. For the two or three weeks we've been here, I've had that in my mind and have been working on a few things in training. At the end of the day, it's a flip of a coin. It's either right or left. ""I'm no hero. I just played my role like everyone else did tonight."" The Sydney FC man is modest. But he's already a cult hero, especially for the long-suffering Socceroos fans on Twitter. By Samantha L Mark Milligan and Luke Wilkshere, two veterans of the Socceroos, have gathered themselves on the Channel 10 couch. ""We kept our best performance til last,"" Milligan says. ""We were brave. We were on the front foot."" ""Full credit to Arnie,"" Wilkshere says. ""It's a massive call to take your captain, Maty Ryan, off. That's a massive call.""

Because I believe this is one of the greatest achievements ever - to qualify for this World Cup. 20 qualifiers, 16 away from home. It's been tough, but we did it."" He then dedicates this moment to his brother, Colin, who's been alongside Graham since the start of his football career. What a moment for the former Socceroo, who's now led his nation to a fifth consecutive tournament. By Samantha L Arnold can barely speak in the interview. He's shaking his head in disbelief. ""I'm so proud of the players. Really, no one knows what these boys have been through to get to here. It was so hard. The whole campaign. The way they've stuck at it - the way they've committed themselves to it. Incredible."" By Samantha L The past year has been an absolute rollercoaster for this group. Mark Milligan is on the broadcast trying to hold back tears. Mitch Duke has his hands on his head as he readies himself for the post-match interview. ""I've never been involved in this situation before,"" he says. ""So many people wrote us off. I was going to have a f***ing panic attack. I'm speechless."" By Samantha L By Samantha L Andrew Redmayne, the substitute goalkeeper on just his third appearance from his country, is the saviour. Graham Arnold bursts into tears. The fans in the stands in Doha erupt. Peru's players are heartbroken. Australia are through to a fifth consecutive men's World Cup.

134,Magpies sneak into Super Netball finals by finest margin after thrilling finish,sport," Sport Collingwood Magpies sneak into Super Netball finals by finest margin after thrilling finish against Melbourne Vixens The Collingwood Magpies have qualified for the Super Netball semi-finals in dramatic fashion after holding on to their top-four place despite a 56-54 defeat to the Melbourne Vixens. Needing a victory or narrow loss to finish fourth ahead of defending champions NSW Swifts, the Magpies trailed by two goals in the dying seconds of Monday's derby clash at John Cain Arena with Vixens shooter Mwai Kumwenda lining up a two-point shot that would have eliminated them from the finals. But Kumwenda's long shot missed the mark as the siren sounded, with Collingwood players and staff desperately waiting for confirmation that they would be making their first finals appearance since the 2019 season. ""I looked at the results and I thought it was two [goals] and we were done, then I saw Kelsey [Browne's] face as she was like 'no, we've done it' and then that was it. Emotions? Gone,"" Geva Mentor told Fox Netball. Collingwood will head to Sydney to take on the Giants in next Sunday's minor semi-final while Melbourne will host West Coast Fever in Saturday night's major semi-final. The Magpies were rocked on the eve of their season-defining clash with co-captain Ash Brazill and defender Jodi-Ann Ward forced to join Maggie Lind and head coach Nicole Richardson on the sidelines due to health and safety protocols. The loss of Ward prompted the Magpies to hand retired Australian Diamonds defender Renae Ingles a shock return to competitive netball, the 35-year-old joining the squad to face her former Vixens teammates after three years out of the game. Melbourne held a narrow 16-15 lead after one quarter with Magpies debutant Casey Adamson making an impressive start to her national league career in her match-up with current Diamonds captain Liz Watson. With the Vixens starting to gain the ascendancy, Magpies caretaker coach Kate Upton introduced Ingles midway through the second quarter but the minor premiers remained poised to extend their advantage 32-27 at half-time. Collingwood's finals hopes appeared to be slipping away when they fell behind by 10 goals in the third quarter but the Magpies levelled the score with an 11-4 start to the fourth quarter, thanks to the tireless work of mid-courter Browne and smooth finishing from shooter Shimona Nelson. While pleased to survive an intense finish to record a seventh win on the trot, Vixens co-captain Watson knows her squad cannot afford another fade-out against the Fever in the grand final qualifier. ""It's a really quick turnaround, so we're really focused for that match and we want to go into those finals really strong, and be here at home hopefully we can get the win,"" Watson said.

135,Canterbury score shock upset over Parramatta after Josh Addo-Carr hattrick,sport," Sport Canterbury score shock upset over Parramatta after scorching Josh Addo-Carr hattrick Josh Addo-Carr has staked his claim for a NSW State of Origin return, scoring a hat-trick of tries as Canterbury stunned Parramatta 34-4 in the biggest boilover of the 2022 NRL season. Two weeks out from Origin II, Addo-Carr produced a near-faultless display on the wing while Matt Burton also starred in a Bulldogs domination at Accor Stadium. It was easily Canterbury's best performance since the end of 2018, piling on the points against a genuine NRL heavyweight. Parramatta were poor, off their game in attack as they squandered early chances while struggling in defence. But the story of the day was Addo-Carr and his first hat-trick in Bulldogs colours, which could not have come at a better time. Controversially dropped for the Origin series opener, Addo-Carr has now scored five tries in the two matches since his NSW axing became official. His replacement Daniel Tupou's status for Game II remains up in the air. Doubts surround Tupou playing for NSW because he could make himself available for Tonga in the Pacific Test to be held 24 hours before the Origin game. Tupou had initially been picked in the series opener for his height, but his high-leaping opposite number Xavier Coates was injured in Queensland's win and won't play in Perth. All of that could lead to Addo-Carr's recall, with the former Melbourne flyer doing everything to help his cause on Sunday. He had Canterbury's first try when Burton hit him on the chest with a perfect cross-field kick early in the set in the eighth minute, allowing him to score untouched. Addo-Carr's speed and acceleration was also crucial in his next try, charging down a Burton grubberkick early in the second half. And his third try put the icing on the cake for the Bulldogs, collecting a Clint Gutherson pass and intercepting it to go 50 metres to score. Burton was in everything and the five-eighth is starting to flourish after a quiet start to his Bulldogs career. His afternoon was best summed up by a one-minute passage of play late in the game when he knocked the ball out of Mitch Moses' hands as the Eels halfback was about to score under the posts. From the ensuing set, Burton produced a perfect on-the-run grubberkick for Jake Averillo to score. The try was Averillo's second, after he also pulled off an 80-metre intercept in the first half just before Jacob Kiraz also went 50 metres after running on to a Kyle Flanagan pass. For all of Canterbury's brilliance, this was easily the worst performance of Parramatta's season. They failed to put any kick pressure on Burton and were sloppy across the 80 minutes. Brad Arthur's men made a mess of their last-tackle play at the end of their first set of six tackles and were denied a try soon after for an obstruction. It took 60 minutes for Parramatta to cross again through Will Penisini, but by then the game was over and questions were being asked about their lack of consistency in 2022.

136,Pies arrive on big stage with stirring win to knock Demons off the top of the ladder,sport," Sport Collingwood stun Melbourne by 26 points in Queen's Birthday blockbuster as Pies knock Dees off the top Collingwood have stamped themselves as serious AFL finals contenders by inflicting a third-straight defeat on reigning premiers Melbourne in a Queen's Birthday classic. After finishing 17th last season, the Magpies will go into the bye at 8-5 and in the top-eight after posting a memorable 26-point victory in front of 76,059 fans at the MCG. Collingwood reeled in a 20-point deficit to edge the out-of-form Demons, who were without suspended superstar Steven May following his infamous fight with teammate Jake Melksham. Only inaccurate kicking prevented the Magpies from taking the lead earlier as Melbourne steeled themselves to rebound from a horror fortnight, on and off the field. The Demons led from early in the first quarter until ace Collingwood forward Brody Mihoceck nailed his third goal seven minutes into the final term. Craig McRae's team would never give up their advantage from there, winning 12.10 (82) to 8.8 (56) in one of the games of the season, booting six final-quarter goals to one. Fans started chanting ""Collingwood"" in unison as Jamie Elliott put the finishing touches on their fourth-straight victory by slotting a goal with a minute remaining. The Magpies were goal-less at quarter-time after easy missed opportunities by Jordan De Goey, Beau McCreery and Jack Ginnivan. American Mason Cox came alive with a third-quarter for the ages to help turn the game in Collingwood's favour. In scenes reminiscent of his famous 2018 preliminary final performance, Cox kicked a goal on the run to earn a monster roar from the heaving pro-Magpies crowd. Cox then grabbed two contested marks in defence to thwart damaging forward-50 entries from the Demons. Mihoceck was the constant for Collingwood up forward, finishing with four goals in a best-on-ground display Melbourne's Brownlow Medal contender Clayton Oliver ran hot early, collecting 27 first-half possessions, 16 of them in the opening term, and finished with 43 to earn the Neale Daniher Trophy. The Demons have major injury issues as captain Max Gawn spent long periods on the bench, key defender Harrison Petty was assessed following a head knock, while debutant Daniel Turner was subbed out of the match with concussion. Gawn played out the game but was clearly sore as young gun Luke Jackson did the majority of the ruck work in the last quarter as the All-Australian was used up forward. Melbourne are next back in action against the Brisbane Lions on a Thursday night to open round 15 while Collingwood will host GWS at the MCG on June 26.

One game, winner takes all, against Peru for the chance to fill one of the last two spots available at the finals in Qatar. Graham Arnold's men eliminated the United Arab Emirates last week in the Asian (AFC) qualifying playoff with a 2-1 victory in Qatar to give themselves a shot at the finals after missing out on automatic qualification. Peru finished fifth in the South American (CONMEBOL) qualification, missing out on an automatic spot in the finals. Australia has qualified for the last four World Cups — in 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018. Can they make it five in a row? Read on for all the details about this match that will decide the Socceroos' World Cup fate. The venue for the vital playoff is the Ahmed Bin Ali Stadium, otherwise known as the Al-Rayyan Stadium, outside the Qatari capital, Doha. The multi-purpose stadium seats 50,000 and has been redeveloped as one of the eight venues for this year's World Cup. While previous World Cup playoffs have been played on a two-leg, home-and-away basis — such as the Socceroos vs Honduras in 2017 — the playoffs for the 2022 World Cup are being held as standalone matches at neutral venues. The game begins at 9pm on Monday local time in Doha, which is 4am AEST on Tuesday (in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane, Hobart). If you are in Adelaide, Alice Springs or Darwin, the game starts at 3:30am ACST. If you are in Perth, the game starts at 2am AWST.

138,Sam Kerr to miss Spain and Portugal friendlies as Matildas look to emerging talent,sport,"  Matildas to rest senior players, including captain Sam Kerr, for friendlies against Spain and Portugal The Matildas will be without almost their entire senior starting squad when they face European Championship favourites Spain and emerging nation Portugal in a pair of friendlies later this month. Head coach Tony Gustavsson announced his 25-player squad on Monday with captain Sam Kerr, who was recently named the PFA's players' Player of the Year following her Golden Boot-winning season with Chelsea, the biggest name missing from the roster. Vice-captain Steph Catley, forwards Kyah Simon, Caitlin Foord, Mary Fowler, and Hayley Raso, centre-back Alanna Kennedy, and midfielders Kyra Cooney-Cross and Aivi Luik will also miss the international window, with defender Ellie Carpenter indefinitely sidelined with an ACL tear. The changes come as a surprise given Gustavsson said in April that 2022 would be a year spent ""narrowing the focus"" and honing in on the players most likely to represent Australia at next year's Women's World Cup. Spain, which is captained by Ballon D'Or winner Alexia Putellas and filled with almost a dozen record-breaking Barcelona players, is one of the favourites to take out the title, which would have made this upcoming friendly series perfect preparation. However, ABC understands Football Australia's sports science, medical, and technical teams recommended several senior players take extended breaks to manage ongoing injuries, fatigue, and fitness following their club seasons abroad. Captain Sam Kerr arrived in Perth on Friday, telling local reporters she was here for a month to spend time with family and friends. She's joined by most of her senior teammates who have also returned to Australia during their European off-seasons, including Tottenham striker Kyah Simon. ""You don't really appreciate it until you actually get this time [to rest],"" Simon, who is dealing with an Achilles niggle, told ABC in Sydney last week. ""We've never really had it in our careers because we did back-to-back seasons for so long between Australia and America. So we under-estimated the importance of having an off-season. ""But I think mentally, more than anything, these breaks are important. We're on 24/7 as athletes so sometimes doing nothing is all you need: to have a good six or seven weeks at home with family. ""And it freshens you up going into the next season and the next cycle, which is super important as athletes, whereas we've just stayed at this one level for the past 10 years without a rest. ""It's definitely been a long time coming, so we're enjoying it for what it is."" In their place, Gustavsson has called up a host of fresh faces for the Spain and Portugal games. Mackenzie Hawkesby, Taylor Ray, Princess Ibini-Isei, Remy Siemsen, Cortnee Vine, and Rachel Lowe have been rewarded for their stellar seasons with premiership-winning side Sydney FC, while fellow A-League Women players Matilda McNamara (Adelaide United), Larissa Crummer (Brisbane Roar), and Winonah Heatley (Melbourne City) have also been named. They'll be joined by a handful of young and emerging Aussies currently plying their trade overseas including Celtic's Jacynta Galabadaarachchi, who recently won Scotland's Young Player of the Year award, Fortuna Hjørring duo Angela Beard and Clare Wheeler, Alex Chidiac (Racing Louisville), Courtney Nevin (Hammersby), and Remy Siemsen (AIK). Just over half the squad will now have 10 caps or fewer, with the average age dropping from 26.9 to 25. The youth-heavy squad will be steadied by more senior players including Emily Van Egmond (San Diego Wave), Vittsjö pair Katrina Gorry and Clare Polkinghorne, Emily Gielnik (Aston Villa), and Lydia Williams (Arsenal), the latter of whom is set to become the first goalkeeper to notch 100 appearances for the Matildas if she takes to the field. ""Selection for this June squad has been based on a combination of factors, but ultimately it has been about individualising player programs with a long-term view,"" Gustavsson said of the rotated roster. ""In preparing the specialised plans, we have evaluated where the players currently are and where they will need to be and determined the best course of action for each player. ""For some players, this has meant being a part of these invaluable matches with Spain and Portugal, providing a chance to demonstrate how they can make our team stronger. ""For another cohort, it results in being proactive around recurring ailments and re-establishing a fitness baseline without the need to focus on peaking for matches."" The Matildas will face the two Euros-bound nations on Sunday, June 26 and Wednesday, June 29, with coverage live and free on Network Ten and Paramount+.

139,Sarah Crowley looms as Australia's top Hawaiian Ironman hope after Cairns win,sport," Sport Sarah Crowley wins Cairns Ironman as she builds towards Hawaii triathlon world championships Sarah Crowley's Hawaiian Ironman triathlon campaign continues to gather momentum, with a second Asia Pacific title in Cairns. Fellow Australian Max Neumann also won the Cairns Ironman for the third-straight year on Sunday, duelling with New Zealander Braden Currie all day before passing him for good in the run. Crowley looms as Australia's top hope at the Hawaiian Ironman world championships in October after two third-place finishes there, most recently in 2019. The Hawaii event will return in October after a succession of COVID-19 cancellations. Crowley won in Cairns only seven weeks after claiming the Ironman Australia title at Port Macquarie over the same distances — a 3.8km swim, 180km cycle and 42.2km marathon run. She also won the Cairns race five years ago. ""I had to hang in there and my legs are pretty sore from Port Mac a few weeks ago but I did the job,"" Crowley said. ""That hurt a lot more than the last one. ""Usually, I actually go a bit better on the second one, so we just went after another one. It's a good opportunity in Australia at the moment, there's so much racing and it's good to see good competition."" She paid tribute to second-placed Radka Kahlefeldt, while last year's winner, Kylie Simpson, charged through the field to claim third. ""I was pretty impressed with Radka today, she hung in there for a lot of it. I was really putting it down on the bike and I couldn't shake her, so an amazing first-time effort,"" Crowley said. Crowley led the field out of the water and built on her advantage to win in eight hours 59 minutes 40 seconds, with Kahlefeldt next in 9:05.16 and Simpson's 9:19.21 rounding out the podium. Currie claimed the men's title in 7:52.53 and Currie (7:55.10) also went under eight hours for second place. Australian Sam Appleton claimed third in 8:05.33.

140,McIlroy takes veiled swipe at Greg Norman after Canadian Open win,sport," Sport Rory McIlroy takes veiled swipe at Greg Norman after Canadian Open PGA Tour victory Rory McIlroy won the Canadian Open on Sunday and gave the PGA Tour a strong response to the start of the Saudi-funded LIV Golf Invitational, closing with an 8-under (62) to win a wild race to the finish with Justin Thomas and Tony Finau. McIlroy had his first title defence on the PGA Tour, even if he had to wait for it. He won golf's fourth-oldest national open in 2019 at the Hamilton Golf and Country Club, only for the the COVID-19 pandemic to cancel the next two annual competitions. Thomas pushed him to the end at St George's Golf and Country Club, with the tournament effectively ending on the 17th hole. McIlroy and Thomas were tied and in the rough before McIlroy hit a wedge that rolled out to tap-in range, while Thomas missed a 10-foot par putt, a two-shot swing. Thomas closed with a pair of bogeys and still shot 64, while McIlroy finished at 19-under (261) for a two-stroke victory. Finau holed a 40-foot birdie putt on the 18th for a 64 to finish second alone, with Thomas third, at 14 under. Justin Rose matched the tournament and course-record with a 60 — including three eagles and three bogeys — to tie for fourth with Sam Burns (65), at 14 under. The Canadian crowd was enormous, having been kept away since 2019, and thousands surrounded the 18th green as the threesome of McIlroy, Thomas and Finau finished. McIlroy as been one of the strongest opponents of the LIV Golf series and spoke out against the money being paid to players such as Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson. Greg Norman, who runs the LIV Golf, told The Washington Post that McIlroy had been ""brainwashed"" by the PGA Tour. The victory was the second for McIlroy this season, adding to his victory in Las Vegas last October in the CJ Cup. He won for the 21st time on the PGA Tour. Sweden's Linn Grant demolishes a field of male and female golfers to win the Scandinavian Mixed tournament, earning 10 times what she received for winning the Belgian Ladies Open. ""This is a day I'll remember for a long, long time,"" McIlroy said, ""21 PGA Tour wins, one more than somebody else."" It was a dig at Norman, who had 20 career tour wins. Rose was 11 under with three holes to play. He bogeyed the 16th, hit to 2 feet on 17 for birdie, then went over the green on 18 and missed an 18-foot par putt. Carl Pettersson also shot 60 at St George's in his 2010 victory. Corey Conners was the top Canadian, shooting a 62 to finish sixth at 12 under.

141,Australia's Ben O'Connor finishes on podium at Criterium du Dauphine,sport," Sport Australia's Ben O'Connor finishes Criterium du Dauphine third behind winner Primoz Roglic Australian Ben O'Connor has demonstrated his readiness for another big Tour de France by earning the first overall World Tour podium spot of his burgeoning career at the Criterium du Dauphine. General classification The Perth racer, who finished fourth at last year's Tour, earned third place overall in the south-east France stage race that acts as a key dress rehearsal for the world's biggest race. Yet while O'Connor's performance in the week-long race was highly encouraging with the grand tour less than three weeks away, he was still no match for race winner Primoz Roglic and the Slovenian's Jumbo-Visma teammate, runner-up Jonas Vingegaard. O'Connor, lying third overnight, was again the only rider to get near the Jumbo-Visma pair, finishing third on Sunday's eighth and final stage, a mountainous 138.8km route from Saint-Alban-Leysse to Plateau de Salaison. But he again could not quite match Roglic, one of the Tour favourites, and his powerful Danish right-hand man Vingegaard, who powered away from the rest of the field on the final climb. Once they had broken their opponents, with their nearest challenger, O'Connor, 15 seconds adrift, the teammates had the luxury of being able to hold hands as they crossed the line. Roglic was happy to push Vingegaard forward, allowing him to take the stage and finish second in the overall standings, while he claimed the overall victory by 40 seconds from the Dane and 1:41 ahead of AG2R Citroen's O'Connor. ""I thought maybe I'd get back to them,"" O'Connor said. ""I still had legs. I never exploded. It's just that I couldn't go with the first accelerations, but I can be super proud. ""I think we're really not that far away from fighting with the very best in the world. And that's something we can be proud of all together."" Jai Hindley's conquering of the Giro d'Italia is a story of redemption after last year's abandonment, but it's also a mark of Australia's increasing assertiveness in Grand Tour cycling, writes Simon Smale. Apart from Paris-Nice, which O'Connor had to abandon due to illness, the 26-year-old has been superbly consistent this year, not having finished lower than seventh in any one-day race or stage-race overall classification. Roglic, who famously just missed out at the 2020 Tour de France, losing to his compatriot Tadej Pogačar in the climax, and had to abandon last year's race after a crash, had something to smile about, saying: ""I finally won some races in France so it's super nice."" ""Jonas (who finished second in last year's Tour) was super strong on the last climb and it's crazy, an incredible day for our team,"" he said. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""As you can see, things are going in the right direction, so we can be confident. We have some more time, some more work to do and [we] should be ready for the Tour."" Another Australian Jack Haig, of Bahrain-Victorious, also completed an excellent race, finishing fifth overall at 3:13 down on Roglic. But he was quick to accept that both Roglic and Vingegaard had laid down a marker as the major threats to Pogacar's bid for a third-straight Tour title. Roglic has won the past three Spanish Vuelta titles, but the Tour remains his major focus after also winning Paris-Nice in March.

142,Sweden's Linn Grant becomes first female golfer to win on men's European tour,sport," Sport Linn Grant becomes first female golfer to win on men's European tour, taking Scandinavian Mixed title by nine shots A female player has won an event on the men's European tour for the first time — and Linn Grant made her piece of sporting history in amazing style, too. The 22-year-old Swede obliterated a field of male and female golfers at the Scandinavian Mixed event on Sunday, winning by nine strokes after an eight-under 64 in the final round at Halmstad Golf Club. Remarkably, she finished 14 strokes clear of the next best woman, Gabriella Cowley, who tied for 15th. Jason Scrivener, the Australian who had been lying just two shots off the lead going into the final round, ended up 10 shots behind as he finished joint-fourth after a level-par 72. ""I just hope people recognise women's golf more now that more sponsors go to the LET (Ladies European Tour) than to the men's tour, and hopefully this pumps up the women's game a little bit more,"" Grant said. She started the day with the two-stroke lead over Scrivener and steadily built up her advantage with birdies at five of her first six holes, demonstrating the brilliant ball-striking and calm temperament she has displayed all week in southern Sweden. She first took a nine-stroke lead after tapping in for a birdie at the par-five 11th hole and regained it with her eighth and final birdie of the round at another par five, the 14th. She then completed a bogey-free weekend for the week of her golfing life. It was the second staging of a tournament that started with 78 men and 78 women in the field, playing the same course — albeit off different tees — for one prize fund and one trophy. Grant said her main aim this week was to beat the men. ""That was the most important thing. The whole week, I just felt it was girls against the guys,"" she said. Grant's grandfather, James, was a Scottish golf professional who emigrated from Inverness in northern Scotland to Helsingborg in Sweden. Her father, John, played on the Swedish Tour, too. He has seven wins on the Swedish Senior Tour. Grant turned professional last year and won events on the Ladies European Tour in March and May, marking her out as a star in the making. In an on-course interview on the front nine, Grant said having those two wins under her belt made her feel calm going into the biggest round of her life. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Her boyfriend was her caddie this week and her mother was at the course and among those cheering Grant onto each green on a day of changing weather. Swedish great Henrik Stenson, who hosted the event with compatriot Annika Sorenstam, shot 70 and was tied for second place with Marc Warren (65). Sorenstam, one of the greatest female golfers ever, embraced Grant beside the 18th green after she sealed her victory Grant won 30,000 euros ($45,000) when winning in Belgium last month, but received more than 10 times that on Sunday.

143,Chris Ross was 31 when he was diagnosed with MND — now he's trying to inspire others by sharing his journey,sport," Sport How Chris Ross is taking up the fight against MND and giving hope to others through sharing his journey An athlete's supreme ruler is time: first time, last time, best time, worst time, time of your life, plenty of time, not much time left. Chris Ross — ""Rossy"" to his mates — used to be a footballer with an eye on the clock. A born captain with a lovely left foot and big smile, he raced around Europe and America before returning to Australia to hold a stopwatch for others with a fire inside. His promising coaching career ended last year when Rossy was told he had motor neurone disease (MND), the same illness as Melbourne legend Neale Daniher. Almost certain he would be given no overtime, that clock started ticking louder than before, and the voice that whispers to us all from time to time asked him the question of the meaning of life. ""Young man, what will you do with the time you have left?"" He was still only 31. Rossy's speech was the first MND casualty, therefore his interviews with ABC Sport over the past year have been by email. ""It's always funny thinking back to your childhood,"" he writes. ""I have these vivid memories from early years and so many of them involve sport."" Born in Melbourne to Scottish parents, Rossy loved his dad Crawford, mum Karen, brother Ben, and football. He supported his father's beloved Glasgow Rangers, but in the AFL it was the mighty Blues. The Ross clan became members whose greatest enjoyment were trips to Princes Park. ""We would make a full day of it, pub before the game, a kick on the ground after the game, then into the old members bar with my dad, his mates and all the Blues players for a few beverages. One time we were lucky enough to even have a kick with Adrian Hickmott on the ground. ""Even now, in the most challenging time of my life, I look forward to going to the footy each week."" Soccer was just as special to him, and he was very good at it. At five, he started playing with his cousin, coached by his uncle, on a sliver of turf in Mt Waverley, home of the Eastern Lions. Rossy was so keen he competed at least two years above his age. Talent gives you a head start in sport, but raw competitiveness is needed to rise through the ranks. ""I had to win at everything and at all costs,"" Rossy writes. ""In my youth, I played everything from soccer to footy, cricket, swimming, basketball, cross country, BMX, to name a few."" He could be a cocky so and so. In the Under 12s, Rossy was spotted by former Welsh international Terry Hennessy, who was in Australia doing some coaching with the Derby County Academy. ""I was such a mouthy know it all and would always answer back to adults and get myself in trouble,"" Rossy concedes. ""One day Terry had just had enough of me and lost it, told me not to come back again. I turned up to training the following week and either Terry had forgotten about it or just turned a blind eye. Either way it was lucky for me because in the coming weeks I would get scouted to play for a top junior team, Box Hill Inter."" Then came championships, state representation, and a scholarship to the Victorian Institute of Sport at Collingwood Football Club's training facilities in the heart of Melbourne. ""My dream was to become a professional soccer player because of my love for the sport and the way it made me feel when I played it,"" he writes. ""I was happy, smiling, overjoyed when I played the game as a kid and I wanted that to be my life."" He was hanging out in the gym with Melbourne Victory (Kevin Muscat), Collingwood (Nathan Buckley), Melbourne Storm (Cameron Smith), and the Oarsome Foursome. ""Nathan Buckley was benching 200kg,"" Rossy recalls. ""I sat in the hot tub with Harry O'Brien (now Heretier Lumumba). One time after training, I had Eddie McGuire tell me to make sure I wasn't pissing in 'his' pool. (I'd be) watching an Anthony Rocca boxing session, watching James Tomkins on a rowing machine when we turned up for training, continued rowing while we trained, then still be rowing when we were leaving two to three hours later. ""This is where I truly fell in love with the performance side of sport. My dedication to preparing my body for the rigours of sport really ignited at the VIS."" The VIS head football coach was former Middlesbrough player Ian Greener, who set up the program with Ernie Merrick in the 1990s. Greener remembers Rossy's class and determination. ""Left sided players always look a bit special,"" he says. ""He had good basic technique, and a willingness not to give up. Whether we went 1-0 down or 2-0 down, he was a fighter. ""What impressed me at the time was his determination and character. Each year we had to nominate athletes to do a leadership program with the police. One year I recommended Chris because he showed great leadership skills. Strong character, never gave up."" Rossy first went to Scotland and England for trials with Glasgow Rangers and English Premier League club Portsmouth. During this whirlwind trip he spent time with his grandparents (Gran and Grampa Ross) and stayed with his other grandparents in a flat at Govanhill, enjoying bus rides to meet his Gran Susie for coffee or going up to grandfather Frank's bowling club and the wee bar. He even loved hanging around in their living room, watching telly, have a feed and laughing. He landed his first professional contract with Scottish first division club Livingston, but the big time would have to wait until he finished high school back home. During his last years as a schoolboy, Rossy made his senior Victorian Premier League debut for Coburg City. He was still only 16. After Year 12, it was no more homework, no more books — Rossy headed back to Scotland. Sadly, the Livingston manager had since got the chop. The Aussie kid's contract was shafted, and he ended up playing for a year at Patrick Thistle FC's youth academy. ""It was tough, gruelling,"" he recalls. ""If you know British football it's just a different ball game and environment. By the end of my first year, I wasn't going too well, I was homesick so I went back to Melbourne for the off-season. The idea was to always go back to continue but an opportunity came up to go play and study in America on a scholarship, so that's what I did."" For the next four years sweet home was Alabama, playing and studying at Auburn University at Montgomery. ""Hindsight's always 20-20,"" he writes. ""Looking back I wished I'd had stayed in Scotland and the UK but no regrets. I loved my time in America."" Most of his teammates were international students. Rossy was so respected at Auburn, the college made him captain for his final two years. Gran Susie and Frank came from Scotland to be at his graduation; he won top honours in sport science. ""This is where, in my little dorm room, I really started to drive the idea that one day I could work in sport if my own aspirations to play professionally didn't work out,"" he writes. Rossy's memories of Auburn are vivid as any man looking back at his late teens. He remembers his coach, Wulf Koch, picking him up from Birmingham airport, stopping at a gas station and convincing the attendant he used to ride kangaroos to school. And he recalls being demoted by Wulf for a big game. ""The wakeup call I needed,"" he writes. His response was scintillating form in subsequent matches. ""I remember one summer I stayed in Alabama to take a few classes to graduate quicker. Wulf and I used to work out everyday, chat about life and football. I used to have dinner with him and (his wife) Jane every now and then. ""I even crashed on their couch one night and woke up to their dogs licking my face off."" There is a framed photo in the hallways of Auburn University. It is a picture of victory. Coach Koch is in it, celebrating with his winning, grinning team. Rossy thought about it a month ago, after Wulf died of leukaemia. ""A few days ago my old coach lost his devastating battle,"" Rossy wrote on Instagram. ""It hits home pretty hard when in a few years I think that'll be me. R.I.P mate. Keep on livin'."" That's how he signs off all his posts. After Rossy finished playing at Auburn for Wulf, he got an offer to play and coach in America, but he didn't take it. The boy, who was now a man, went to Iceland; Rossy's resume and reputation had reached Vikingur FC, one of the oldest clubs in the country. Rossy's career at Vikingur FC was another wonderful sporting challenge of making new friends and learning, although he struggled to find his best on the pitches of the amazing country. ""We had a very old school coach called Oli and for the longest while he didn't seem to like me much,"" he recalls. Old Oli was eventually won over and the Australian was offered a new contract, but Scotland kept calling. Rossy went back to the motherland, had some offers to play in division two, but knocked them all back. ""I was 24 and coming to the realisation that I needed to start planning for the future and my career outside of soccer,"" he writes. University of Edinburgh accepted him into its strength and conditioning course but it was going to be too expensive, so he moved back to Australia and did the same course at Edith Cowan University in Perth. Here he met a Hawthorn Football Club coach, who led Rossy to his first full-time strength and conditioning job at Box Hill, Hawthorn's reserve team in the Victorian Football League (VFL). ""I think looking back on my career and journey in sport there is obviously a love there for the sports I was involved in,"" he writes. ""But when you think about it on a deeper level it's the connections and friendships you make with people that really make it an enjoyable journey. I have been lucky enough to travel the world, play with some unbelievable players, coach some elite athletes but it's the long-lasting community and friendships you create with people and a club that has made my life meaningful."" Still hungry for knowledge, Rossy went back to school one more time to study physiotherapy at the University of Melbourne. He then picked up another position in the VFL as high performance manager at Frankston Dolphins, and anything looked possible; a long career in sport seemed the least he would achieve. ""I have taken a lot of my experiences from sport into my career in the private sector and I have always got great satisfaction from helping people and enjoyed every minute of it,"" he writes. ""But there is something special about playing and working within the walls of a sporting organisation that creates a sense of brotherhood and connectedness towards striving to achieve a common goal."" That brotherhood was there for Rossy last year when he was diagnosed with MND. Players at Frankston arranged a 'Run for Rossy' event that raised more than $100,000 and was talked about on television and in Melbourne's daily newspapers. Carlton stars like Patrick Cripps and Eddie Betts recorded best wishes videos. ""I'm sending my love your way,"" Betts said. ""Stay strong and I want you to know that we're thinking of you."" No reaction to a diagnosis that shortens a life is the same, but grief is always waiting on the other side. Up until March last year, Chris Ross, successful physiotherapist and coach, had seemed a beacon of health posting Instagram strength tips under his business name CR Strength. But something was wrong. He had spent the previous year in and out of hospital trying to figure out the cause of his slurred speech (""my tongue just felt strange""), trouble swallowing, and twitching muscles. His MND diagnosis was confirmed in late April. ""I had found my truth,"" he writes. Initially, he withdrew to mourn his uncertain future away from his workmates and friends. His charges at the football club did not hear from him. It was as if he had vanished. Frankston Football Club captain Josh Newman heard the awful news and wanted to comfort his friend. ""Your natural instinct is to reach out,"" he says. ""Obviously it took him a bit of time to process and we were worried because no one had heard too much from him. I couldn't imagine what he was going through."" Rossy's absence from the club that had adopted him was felt every day. ""He was a huge part of the footy club and lot of us were close to him,"" Newman says. ""He was popular because he cared and was passionate about us getting better. There were a few key people in the club who had that drive for us to succeed and he held everyone to high standards. I personally leaned on him a lot. We had the same outlook."" Eventually, Rossy accepted support and began to mix publicly again. After the fun run was held in partial COVID lockdown, he did what he has always done: kept fighting. Another Instagram was born in the name of 'Beat the Beast', a nod to Neale Daniher's name for MND. ""My name is Chris Ross and on April 27th of this year I was diagnosed with MND,"" he wrote on his first post. ""I was 31 years old at the time and given 27 months to live. ""I can't quite explain what it felt like when I heard those words 'you have MND' but I do remember everything just stops and literally your world just crashes. Everything I have ever done, seen, worked for, planned for, experienced in life, just flashed before my eyes and continues to do so to this day. ""I'm not sure I'll ever be comfortable talking about what's happening to me, but there comes a time when you just have to let people love you and for me that time is now. ""The amount of love and support I have felt from all over the world has just been heartbreaking to me but it's giving me a reason to get up each day. ""If my experience can somehow help just one person become more aware, help someone who might have MND live an extra day, or educate someone about this terrible disease, then hopefully I will leave this place a little better than when I found it."" For the past nine months, Rossy has chronicled what it is like to live with MND, including his 'Friday Freeze' (dips in Port Phillip Bay), gym workouts, medical updates and explanations, and loving photos with his friends and dog Fergus ('my best bud'). His honesty was at first astounding, each update a warm and careful reflection of an otherwise unthinkable ordeal. He wants us all to read what it is really like so we can help find a cure. Along the way, he has offered his thoughts on life and death. ""Go spend some more time with your loved ones,"" he advised. ""Give them a hug and tell them you love them because nothing is forever in this life. Your life can change in an instant for no apparent reason and at the end of the day family and friends are all that matter."" On the first anniversary of his diagnosis, he wrote about gratitude. ""I watch travel videos of all the places I won't get to, watch all my loved ones get married, have kids, buy houses — all things I will never get to do. It honestly breaks my heart, but there is always a silver lining,"" he wrote. ""For all the things I have lost, the relationships, the potential, the things I will not get the opportunity to do, I have gained the one most important thing in life — myself. I know myself better now than ever before and I'm enjoying life more than I ever have. Not because I've been able to achieve my life goals, but because I now know life's value. ""That's the thing about life, it's fragile, precious and unpredictable and each day is a gift, not a given right. People go through their entire life through a cloud of pressure and judgement on what their life should be and miss out on enjoying the daily treasures life brings. ""Through every failure, disappointment, obstacle, set back — there is always an opportunity. I've been given a period of time to enjoy life, create more memories with my loved ones and find myself again. For that I will forever be grateful.""

144,Can one of the great chess personalities set up a dream match with the world champion?,sport,"  Hikaru Nakamura has second attempt at Candidates tournament to face chess champion Magnus Carlsen The attention of the chess world is fixed on one of its greatest tournaments, starting this week, with one man drawing plenty of attention for all the right reasons. The Candidates tournament is an eight-player double-round-robin event to decide who will be the next challenger for world champion. Reigning world champion Magnus Carlsen has dominated chess for a decade. Since claiming the title in 2013, the Norwegian has revolutionised how chess is played and become the game's most recognisable star. But while Carlsen has reigned supreme there has been another man who, through brilliance and personality, has developed a brand arguably as big as the champion — his name is Hikaru Nakamura. Nakamura, a 34-year-old American, is possibly the most recognisable and popular player among this year's Candidates. The grandmaster has an impressive online presence and has thousands of fans tune in to his live stream to watch him beat the best in the world. Chess personality and International Master Levy Rozman, who has forged a successful online career under the name GothamChess, says Nakamura is an ideal challenger for Carlsen as the sport fights for mainstream attention. ""I think of all the matches that could happen, Magnus-Hikaru could be the biggest,"" he told ABC Sport. ""I think it would attract the most sponsors, I think it would attract the most marketing and I think it would be amazing for the world of chess. ""For the chess world, it is best-case scenario."" Chess has experienced a popularity boom in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic and the popularity of Netflix show The Queen's Gambit had many taking up the game for the first time. Nakamura was at the forefront of the popularity surge, with his online content becoming a hit with new converts. His ability to play chess with ease and grace that defies its difficulty, while being a likeable and engaging character online, is what has many excited about his appearance in the Candidates. ""Of all the top-50 players in the world, he is maybe one of three that possesses this ability,"" Rozman said. ""[He is] able to play fast time controls, win 90 per cent of the games he plays online, and just be a normal guy and talk about whatever with a live audience and keep them interested and keep them captivated."" Standing in Nakamura's way are seven of the world's best in the most difficult tournament to win. Nakamura is a legend when it comes to short, time-controlled games of chess. When players are given as little as three minutes to play all of their moves, Nakamura has consistently proven to be one of the greats. But to be world champion and win the Candidates you must master classical chess; each player has two hours to complete 40 moves before more time is added if required. Classical chess requires expert preparation and the ability to calculate multiple moves ahead. Nakamura was not expected to qualify for the Candidates, with the American seemingly focused on his other chess ventures. But a wildcard into this year's Grand Prix, a qualifying tournament for the Candidates, changed everything. ""Going into the Grand Prix nobody had any idea what to expect, and some people complained he was even given a wildcard,"" Rozman said. ""And he just straight-up won the Grand Prix. You can't make more of a statement than that."" Nakamura played in the Candidates tournament in 2016 but struggled. After losing games early in the tournament, the American never gave himself a chance of winning. With experience now on his side, he says he feels relaxed and is not putting himself under any pressure. In an interview with chess.com in April, Nakamura said he wanted to relish the opportunity to play in chess's toughest tournament, something he did not think he would do a second time. ""Even if I don't win the tournament this time, I think just having that chance to play good chess and perform better than I did, just on that level, is probably for me the most important thing,"" he said. ""I really didn't think I would ever have the chance after 2016."" It is this carefree attitude that makes Nakamura even more dangerous to play and has many dreaming of a blockbuster world championship match.

145,Ricciardo rises to eighth as Ferrari nightmare gifts Red Bull victory in Azerbaijan,sport," Sport Daniel Ricciardo secures brilliant eighth at Azerbaijan Grand Prix as Max Verstappen takes glory for Red Bull Australia's Daniel Ricciardo has scored points for just the second time this season, finishing eighth at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The Australian started 12th in Baku but was able to execute an alternative strategy to his rivals which helped him impressively move up the order. Max Verstappen won the race ahead of Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez, after both Ferrari drivers retired early in the race. Mercedes driver George Russell came home third. It is Verstappen's first win in Azerbaijan and extends his lead in the drivers' championship to 21 points. Ricciardo was one of the only drivers who started the hardest compound tyre, opting to pit later in the race to be on a faster tyre at the end. As other drivers came into the pits, Ricciardo pushed on and climbed up the order. The Australian had his race compromised at about half-distance when he was told to stay behind his teammate Lando Norris who was in a strategy battle with Alpine's Fernando Alonso. But Ricciardo was gifted a great opportunity when a virtual safety car was called with fewer than 20 laps to go, allowing him to change tyres without losing too much time. He took advantage to stay in eighth place, finishing ahead of teammate Norris in ninth. Ricciardo said he hoped he was finally syncing with the car after a tough start to the season. ""I think we made a step in the right direction,"" he said. ""I'd like to say I unlocked a bit of knowledge about the car."" Norris was urging the McLaren team to allow him to pass Ricciardo late, who was struggling with degrading tyres. However, the Briton's calls fell on deaf ears with his team reminding him of Ricciardo's efforts to help him earlier on. Max Verstappen produced a perfect race around the streets of Baku, securing his fifth win of the season. Starting third, the reigning world champion had life made easier when both Ferraris retired. Verstappen, who had never finished on the podium in Baku in five previous attempts, said his car had the perfect balance and grip around the street circuit. ""Today, we had incredible pace in the car,"" he said. ""Maybe a tiny bit lucky with the retirements but nevertheless our car was really good today."" After taking an early pitstop on lap nine following the retirement of his teammate Carlos Sainz, Leclerc was showing the kind of pace that threatened to win on Sunday. But as the Monegasque driver was hunting down his Red Bull rivals his car failed. It is his second retirement in three races with Leclerc saying Ferrari needed to resolve its issues quickly. ""It's very very disappointing,"" he told Sky Sports F1. ""It hurts. We really need to look into that for it to not happen again. ""It's difficult to understand for now but we will have to analyse."" Leclerc, who led the drivers' championship by more than 40 points after three rounds, is now in third behind Verstappen and Perez.

146,Ricciardo sees promising signs after qualifying ruined by rival's crash,sport," Sport Daniel Ricciardo starts 12th in F1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix Daniel Ricciardo will need to produce one of his best performances this season to score points at Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix after a tough qualifying session. The Australian qualified 12th around the streets circuit in Baku with his McLaren teammate Lando Norris also failing to make the top-10, qualifying 11th. Ricciardo looked more competitive during Saturday's final practice session before qualifying. He also looked set to sneak into the top-10 before his flying lap had to be aborted after Aston Martin driver Lance Stroll crashed, stopping the session. Ricciardo has struggled this season with one points finish and is coming off a forgettable race in Monaco last time out. The Australian said the notion of feeling more competitive before misfortune ended his qualifying session prematurely was a confidence boost he hoped would help in Sunday's race. ""After such a tough weekend in Monaco, I have to take the positives that we look more competitive here so far, and I feel a little bit more like I'm getting the feeling back that I'm after with the car,"" he said. ""I found some things with the car that are suiting me, and I've felt like I've been able to lean on it and be a bit more comfortable."" Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc will start on pole in Baku for the second consecutive year after a blistering final lap in Saturday's qualifying session. Leclerc was almost three-tenths quicker than Red Bull's Sergio Perez, who joins him on the front row. Drivers' championship leader Max Verstappen qualified third, while the other Ferrari of Carlos Sainz will start fourth.

147,Tears of joy as Sikh Games return with tonnes of onions after two-year hiatus,sport,"  Griffith Sikh Games attract thousands to regional NSW for celebration of sport, food and culture About 15,000 people are converging on a regional Australian town for one of the country's most popular Sikh sporting events, but with food a central ingredient to the cultural event, a mammoth effort is underway to feed everybody … for free. The Griffith Sikh Games draws people from all over Australia and overseas to the southern New South Wales town to watch athletes compete on the Queen's Birthday long weekend. But while sport is the main drawcard, people also attend to celebrate culture and food, with event organisers this year trucking in two tonnes of onions, three tonnes of flour and 700 litres of milk for the two-day event. Griffith City councillor and event organiser Manjit Lally said that was made possible due to the support and donations from Sikh communities across the country. ""Three or four years ago, we can't keep up with the demand, so now we get help from the cities as well,"" he said. Gurdarshan Singh is from the Sikh community in Melbourne and first went to the games — also known as the Griffith Shaheedi Tournament — 10 years ago to help out. He said the event was created to honour martyrs who have sacrificed their lives for the Sikh faith and values. It is the 24th time the games have been held, after they were cancelled the past two years due to COVID-19. ""They started it 26 years ago and the community started getting here in remembrance of all the martyrdom, which we call Shaheeds,"" Mr Singh said. ""We were advised to bring tea, coffee, hot milk for everyone. ""We got more than 700 litres [of milk] for today [and] we cook around 700 bread packets."" He said one of the principles of the Sikh community was to support ""everyone"". ""All the human beings, we are one family, the Australian family,"" Mr Singh said. Kamal Maan travelled from Melbourne to attend the Sikh Games but originally came from Punjab, northern India. She migrated to Australia to offer her children a better future and believed the games gave them a chance to learn about their culture. ""These kind of events, going to the temple, teaching them the traditions and everything, they'll get to learn the culture,"" Ms Maan said. ""We feel like home if we have these kinds of events and traditions."" Maninder Singh Rakhra is from Canberra and brought his mother, Manjeet Kaur, who travelled all the way from India to attend the Sikh Games. ""We love to see our community here in Griffith every year,"" Mr Rakhra said. He also translated on behalf of Ms Kaur, who spoke little English. ""I love it,"" Ms Kaur said. ""Thank you very much for bringing us here."" Mr Lally said Griffith had developed a very large Sikh community because the weather and agriculture was similar to northern India. ""The farming country is like Griffith, Leeton and surrounding areas,"" he said. ""The Sikh communities love farming; that's why we settle in the farming communities. ""The hot is hot here [and] the cold is cold here, like exactly back at home as well."" He said while it may be called the Sikh Games, the event was open for the entire community to enjoy. ""It's not just for the Sikhs,"" Mr Lally said. ""I encourage all the other communities to come along for the long weekend."" The Sikh Games feature a range of different sports, such as soccer and volleyball, and unique sports like musical chairs. The most popular attraction, however, is the Punjabi sport, kabaddi, a physically demanding contest best described as a mix of wrestling and rugby. It sees a raider go into the opposition's half of the field and try to touch one or more members of the other team, then return to their own half before being wrestled. Kabaddi player Bhola Singh is originally from northern India and now lives in Adelaide. He said most kabaddi players in Adelaide are truck drivers and it is hard to balance training with family, work and social life. ""We're working like 50 to 60 hours a week but we train every Wednesday and every Sunday,"" he said. ""We do weight training once a week, or twice whenever time allows, but mostly like running, pulling, push-ups.""

148,Horne-Francis to face MRO heat as North are thumped again by Giants,sport," Sport GWS Giants beat North Melbourne by 49 points as Jason Horne-Francis to face heat for hit on Josh Kelly North Melbourne are facing more scrutiny after a meek 49-point surrender to GWS left them floundering near the foot of the AFL ladder. Stephen Coniglio and Harry Himmelberg starred for the Giants in their 15.12 (102) to 7.11 (53) win on Sunday, which extended the Kangaroos' losing streak to 11 matches. It was the ninth straight week David Noble's side has conceded a triple-figure score. And there could yet be more pain, with number one draft pick Jason Horne-Francis likely to be suspended for a high hit on GWS star Josh Kelly. Second-year coach Noble had pleaded with Kangaroos fans to attend the standalone match but just 13,742 turned up to witness the visitors dominate from the outset. GWS celebrated Callan Ward becoming the first player to reach 200 games for the club with a convincing display. Coniglio (34 disposals, five clearances), Jake Peatling and Jake Riccardi kicked three goals each as Tom Green (30 disposals), Ward (30) and Kelly (27) had an influence around the ball. Remodelled defender Himmelberg was allowed to do as he pleased in defence, racking up 37 disposals, 16 marks and 11 intercepts as he repelled a string of opposition raids. The versatile tall is still the Giants' leading goal-kicker this season, having taken his tally to 19 in 12 games with a long bomb via a hand-off from Toby Greene (two goals). Some of the gloss was removed from the Giants' victory when Harry Perryman was taken to hospital with suspected rib and lung damage after a collision with an opponent. Perryman was substituted out of the game before half-time but his teammates finished the job. The Kangaroos entered the contest having lived through four goalless quarters in their previous nine and produced another in the opening term. The Giants controlled territory and made it count by building a commanding 30-point lead by the first change. North conceded seven goals before kicking their first when Curtis Taylor nailed his set shot more than nine minutes into the second quarter. Some of the Kangaroos' better ball-winners went missing, with Horne-Francis and Hugh Greenwood managing four first-half disposals between them. Himmelberg had 20 in the same period, while Jaidyn Stephenson, recalled by North after two games in the reserves, had just one. Stephenson finished with five disposals in a disappointing return but was just one of many Kangaroos players who lowered their colours. Luke Davies-Uniacke (33 disposals) and Jy Simpkin (22) battled hard in a losing cause and Taylor provided a highlight with a big mark on Lachie Keeffe's back. Todd Goldstein and Nick Larkey kicked two goals each for North, who have their mid-season bye in round 14. GWS host the Western Bulldogs on Saturday night. The Giants have now had two wins and a draw since Mark McVeigh took the coaching reins from Leon Cameron, who stood down last month. But those victories have been against the two bottom sides, the Kangaroos and West Coast.

149,Penrith's NSW stars bounce back from Origin loss to dominate Newcastle Knights,sport," Sport Penrith Panthers welcome back Origin stars in win over Newcastle, as Warriors and Tigers' new coaches lose first games in charge Penrith's returning Origin stars have orchestrated a 42-6 demolition of the Knights, while the Warriors and Tigers lost their first games under new management. Stacey Jones's first game in charge of the Warriors was the sort of inconsistent performance we have come to expect from the Redcliffe-based side, losing 38-16 to the Sharks; while Brett Kimmorley's first outing as Tigers coach was not made easier by Brent Naden being sent off for a lifting tackle on the Sea Eagles' Jake Trbojevic. The Tigers lost 30-4 to Manly. But as those sides' struggles continued, Penrith showed them what an elite top-flight NRL side looks like. State of Origin coaches Brad Fittler and Billy Slater will be in very different moods after their 36-point win over Newcastle. Four days after the disappointment of losing State of Origin I, Penrith's Blues stars — particularly halves Nathan Cleary and Jarome Luai — made a triumphant return to the club scene, while Newcastle and Queensland fullback Kalyn Ponga left the game in the first half after a nasty head knock. Cleary and Luai controlled the game in a way they could not on Wednesday night, while fellow Blues Stephen Crichton, Brian To'o and Liam Martin also backed up from the 16-10 loss to Queensland to help the Panthers notch their fifth straight win. Despite not coming off the field after his head knock early in Origin I, Isaah Yeo did not play at Hunter Stadium. One man who could not stay on the park after his first-half collision on Sunday was Knights and Maroons fullback Ponga, who got steamrolled by Viliame Kikau on his way to Penrith's second try in the 14th minute. Ponga did not return to the game after failing his head injury assessment and will be monitored closely with two weeks until Origin II. Sunday's game was the sort of rout one would expect from a game between two teams that are 11 spots apart on the ladder, with Penrith crossing for the first of their seven tries in just the fifth minute. It came on the back of some electric interplay between Luai and Cleary for the halfback to cross, before Kikau produced his powerful effort to crash over. From there the Panthers utilised their slick outside backs, with all four of their centre-wing unit scoring — To'o doing so twice. Newcastle's only points came from a 74th-minute consolation try for Edrick Lee and the ensuing conversion. In their first game since the departure of coach Nathan Brown, the Warriors put on a very similar performance to the rest of their season, flashing some impressive skills but not matching it with their opponent for the full 80 minutes. They actually jumped out to a 12-0 lead in the opening exchanges thanks to tries to Reece Walsh and Wayde Egan, but it was all Cronulla from there. The Sharks ran in five straight tries in the final 25 minutes of the first half to take 24-12 lead to the break. Warriors winger Dallin Watene-Zelezniak produced a spectacular flying finish to kickstart the second-half scoring in the 53rd minute, but it was to be the final highlight for the side, as handling errors and poor defence cost them yet again. Sharks winger Ronald Mulitalo completed his double, fullback Will Kennedy dotted down, and Sione Katoa finished off a hat-trick as Cronulla bounced back from a 36-16 loss to the Roosters in their last start two weeks ago. Things get much harder for the Warriors next week as they go up against the Panthers for their final game at Redcliffe, before their homecoming against the Tigers at Auckland's Mt Smart Stadium in round 16. Interim Wests Tigers coach Brett Kimmorley has endured a rough introduction to NRL coaching, losing 30-4 against Manly and finishing the game with 12 men on the field. Stepping in after the departure of Michael Maguire, Kimmorley will likely be forced into a backline reshuffles, as the Tigers will almost definitely be without Brent Naden for a few weeks after he was sent off for an ugly lifting tackle at Campbelltown. The centre could lay the blame for his dangerous effort at the feet of a first-half head knock, which floored him for quite some time, but he eventually passed a head injury assessment and was allowed to return. Playing his third game for the Tigers since arriving from the Bulldogs late last month, Naden looked below his best in the second half, missing assignments that led directly to game-changing tries by Reuben Garrick and Haumole Olakau'atu. They gave the Sea Eagles a 12-point second-half lead, which was pushed out beyond two converted tries when Garrick potted the penalty goal after Naden's spear tackle with 15 minutes left. The story was better for Manly, playing without captain Daly Cherry-Evans after his Origin win with Queensland on Wednesday. The first half against the Tigers was a relatively close contest — the Sea Eagles up 6-4 at the break — before the late onslaught. Olakau'atu was particularly impressive for Manly, and may have a difficult decision to make with the representative round looming. The back rower is committed to Tonga and eligible to play for the Blues, but cannot do both as Tonga plays a Test match on June 25, one day before Origin II in Perth. While he was the shining light for the Manly forward pack, it was prop Josh Aloiai who jagged a rare double, scoring Manly's first and last tries of the match. Speedster Tolutau Koula also crossed for the first time in his short NRL career as the Sea Eagles took advantage of the diminished Tigers late.

150,analysis: 'Treat me like a first gamer': Nat Fyfe makes a successful return to AFL as Fremantle fires on all cylinders,sport," Sport Fremantle Dockers captain Nat Fyfe makes a successful return to AFL against Hawthorn Fremantle captain Nat Fyfe's eagerly anticipated return to AFL has been one of the most scrutinised stories in Western Australian football this season. Much of the discussion was around where he would play on the field and whether he could fit into a team that was firing on all cylinders without disrupting its balance. ""He is a big-bodied player, he's had a lot of seasons through the middle,"" former West Coast premiership coach Mick Malthouse said on ABC Perth's Sports Talk program on Saturday morning. ""Fremantle has been troubled in the wet against bigger bodies. ""That's where you have him in the middle, but outside of that you probably have to play him forward, you could even play him off half-back. ""There's a lot of juggling."" Those questions were answered several hours later as the dual Brownlow Medallist took on Hawthorn in his first AFL game in almost a year, after shoulder surgery and a back injury derailed his pre-season. Over the past five years, Fyfe has played predominantly in the midfield, with 16 per cent of his game time spent as a forward. He was named in the forward pocket on the Dockers team sheet, but started the game in the centre against Hawks gun Tom Mitchell, and had an impact at the opening bounce. His first stint in attack came with eight minutes remaining in the first quarter, and he provided the final handball in Lachie Schultz's first goal. It was a solid return from Fyfe, as he collected 22 disposal and six clearances, and kicked a goal. His comments after the game highlighted how the team had evolved while he was injured. ""It's not the same as when I finished playing last time,"" Fyfe said on Fox Footy. ""I said to Caleb (Serong) and Andy (Brayshaw) 'treat me like a first gamer, tell me where to go, set me up.' ""And they did that. They told me where to set up at stoppages and that was a nice feeling."" His setpiece goal kicking left something to be desired, but his size, strength and marking prowess still made him a threat in attack. Fyfe's return had raised the suggestion either Brayshaw, Serong or Will Brodie would be squeezed out of the midfield, but Brayshaw and Serong in particular seemed unaffected by his presence. Brayshaw finished with 37 disposals and a goal, while Serong collected 33 touches, including a career high 20 contested possessions. Brodie was solid with 22 disposals, while veteran David Mundy spent some time on the wing, and finished with 23 touches. Fremantle have a bye next weekend, and indicated during the week that Fyfe wouldn't go back to Peel Thunder despite having only played two games on his return from injury. How much impact he has on the premiership ambitions of the Dockers will become clearer as he builds his fitness, and the side adjusts to his presence.

151,Australian cyclist Grace Brown misses out on Women's Tour win by one second,sport," Sport Australian cyclist Grace Brown misses out on Women's Tour win by one second Australia's top road cyclist Grace Brown has been pipped for victory in the prestigious Women's Tour, losing by just one second after a week-long, 720-kilometre slog on British roads. General classification (final) Brown, the top-rated Aussie rider — man or woman — in the UCI world rankings, missed out to Italian star Elisa Longo Borghini after Saturday's dramatic sixth and final 143km stage from Chipping Norton to Oxford. Camperdown's 29-year-old Brown, leading overnight but locked on the same time as Longo Borghini in the general classification, looked as if she could be heading for her first major stage-race victory when she picked up three bonus seconds for winning an intermediate sprint. But Longo Borghini was rewarded for her attacking intent over the final kilometre, battling to take third place behind stage winner Lorena Wiebes, which earned her the four-second bonus to snatch the one-second win after more than 19-and-a-quarter hours of riding over six days. It was so close that even Brown's FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine Futuroscope teammates thought she'd won after they crossed the line, only for the frustrating news to gradually make its way through the peloton. It was an anti-climactic finale for Brown, who could only finish 12th on the stage as Trek Segafredo's Longo Borghini added to her considerable list of triumphs. But the Victorian was magnanimous in defeat, hailing the Italian for her ""amazing"" effort. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""I took the first intermediate sprint that put me three seconds ahead. We thought that we were pretty safe for the final as long as there were no gaps but it was really messy and Trek did an amazing lead-out to put Elisa in a really good position ahead of the corners,"" said Brown. ""That had her there to sprint for third, which we really didn't expect. Chapeau to her for an amazing sprint finish."" Flying Dutchwoman Wiebes (Team DSM) completed a hat-trick of victories in Oxford's historic centre to beat Brown's teammate Clara Copponi to the line. Brown's Australian compatriot, Team BikeExchange-Jayco's Alexandra Manly, also completed a fine week's work, finishing fourth overall, just 24 seconds behind Longo Borghini.

152,Nick Kyrgios nearly refused to continue his Stuttgart Open semi-final against Andy Murray after altercation with fan,sport," Sport Nick Kyrgios loses to Andy Murray in Stuttgart semi-finals, says he was racially abused by fan Nick Kyrgios has claimed he was racially abused by a fan in Stuttgart during another umpire-berating and racquet-smashing defeat, this time at the hands of Andy Murray. The Australian, who argued with the German crowd and the chair umpire had to be persuaded to continue his semi-final match at the grass-court event before eventually succumbing 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 to rejuvenated former world number one Murray. But after the match, Kyrgios revealed that he had retaliated after hearing a racial slur. ""When is this going to stop? Dealing with racial slurs from the crowd?"" he wrote on Instagram. ""I understand that my behaviour isn't the best all the time — but 'you little black sheep', 'shut up and play' — little comments like this are not acceptable. ""When I retaliate to the crowd, I get penalised. This is messed up."" Britain's two-time Wimbledon champion Murray was left admitting the match ""wasn't fun in the end"" as he reflected on the latest controversy involving Kyrgios, a friend he still believes has the talent to be one of the world's best players. The match reflected a couple in the US earlier this year when Kyrgios ended up copping a total of $US 60,000 ($84,710) in fines for his behaviour at both Indian Wells and the Miami Open. The Australian receives a fine of $47,000 for his behaviour during the fourth-round loss to Jannik Sinner at the Miami Open. His latest meltdown may incur further wrath from the ATP as he argued with the crowd and ended up being jeered off court. In what had been an entertaining and hard-fought clash in the first set, a frustrated Kyrgios got a code violation early in the tie-break and then copped a point penalty after losing the set on what seemed a bad bounce on the final point. Still raging as the second set kicked off, he was broken straight away after throwing in a couple of double faults and, amid arguments with the umpire and the crowd, was then docked a one-game penalty. Evidently stung by the comment from the crowd, Kyrgios wouldn't continue playing, sitting in his chair until the tournament supervisor emerged to convince him to play on. Having lost his focus completely, the Australian then delivered numerous errors as Murray comfortably sealed his spot in the final. ""You're always kind of battling yourself as well as the opponent, it's one of the difficult things about individual sports,"" said Murray, after reaching the 70th final of his distinguished career. ""Nick has the potential to be one of the best players in the world, there's absolutely no question about that. But, yeah, he obviously got very frustrated in the second set and made it a lot easier for me. ""It wasn't fun in the end. The second set wasn't a proper match. The end of the first set was deciding."" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. In the final, Murray, whose revival at the age of 35 after career-saving hip surgery is quite inspirational, will face second seed Matteo Berrettini, who, playing his first Tour-level final of the season, beat Germany's Oscar Otte 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-5) in the other semi-final. Kyrgios had earlier been involved in a series of entertaining rallies, also enchanting the crowd with his underarm serve and 'tweeners'. Two-time Wimbledon champion Murray — who had beaten top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas the previous day — is in his first grass-court final in six years, since he beat Milos Raonic for his second Wimbledon title in 2016. ""It has been a long time since the last final [on grass]. A lot of ups and downs, but I kept going and kept working and finally managed to get to another one. I am proud of the effort I have put in,"" he said.

153,'You've got to be a bit loopy': Veteran miner all set for English Channel swim,sport,"  Ocean swimmer Craig Clarke sets sights on English Channel, after training in waters off Newcastle How does a 7-kilometre ocean swim at dawn sound? Oh, followed by a 30-minute ice bath at 10 degrees. This is the life of someone who's dedicated the past seven years of their life to the Mount Everest of swimming: the English Channel. Craig Clarke is a 57-year-old Hunter Valley mineworker. He also has salt water running through his veins. ""Plenty of people I swim with shake their head and think I'm crazy,"" he said. The ocean, despite its obvious threats, is his happy place. ""I've always had a massive love for the ocean, it's always been my preferred place to swim,"" he said. Mr Clarke swam on the edge of the English Channel in 2015, just to experience it. From there he was hooked. ""It was quite cold at 11 degrees. I just wanted to understand the channel, the whole aura of the place,"" he said. From there, a five-year plan was set in motion. That plan has included thousands of early morning ocean swims beyond the breakers off Newcastle, where the water is deep and danger lurks. ""I'm totally convinced sharks are not looking at us as something to eat or attack. I've always had the theory that if you are moving, they're not going to come near you,"" he said. ""If you're straightaway thinking everything could be a shark, I'd never be able to swim out there on my own."" Get local stories told by the people who are living them with the Newcastle Hunter Catch Up podcast. Sharks aren't a problem in the English Channel because it's too cold. Jellyfish are a different story. That's where Mr Clarke's home made channel grease comes into play. Equal parts lanolin — which is wool fat — paraffin and sunscreen, it helps ease the jellyfish stings and chafing during the 12-hour crossing. Mr Clarke had planned to attempt the channel in 2020, but the pandemic got in the way. Instead he became the first person to swim from Catherine Hill Bay to Newcastle. He did that in winter and completed the 30km distance in less than 12 hours. If Mr Clarke is successful in crossing the Strait of Dover in July, he'll be in elite company. Since 1875, when Captain Matthew Webb made the first crossing, just 1,749 people have successfully swum the channel. One of them was Australian Des Renford, who crossed 19 times and lit the fire for Mr Clarke's ambition. ""In my eyes he'll always be the king of the channel,"" Mr Clarke said. ""I was fascinated by the image of Des with the channel grease and the size and shape of him; he stood out as a real character as well. ""You've got to be a bit loopy to swim the English Channel."" Australian Trent Grimsey holds the record for the fastest crossing ever. In 2012, he swam the channel in 6 hours 55 minutes, when he was 24 years old. He is also Mr Clarke's coach. ""Craig's done really well. I'm really confident in everything Craig has done, that he will have a very good swim on the day,"" Mr Grimsey said. When asked how he'd feel if a man pushing 60 broke his record, Mr Grimsey broke into laughter. ""I'd like to hold on to the record for a little bit longer, but if he does, I'll be very, very happy for him,"" he said. Mr Clarke's swim will take place on July 8 and will raise money for mental health support service Beyond Blue.

154,Stunning Dasun Shanaka finale thwarts Australian T20I sweep,sport," Sport Sri Lanka beats Australia by four wickets in third T20I, smashing 59 runs off the last three overs Australian captain Aaron Finch insists he is happy with his team's depth a few months out from their T20 World Cup defence, despite an amazing innings from Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka denying them a sweep of their three-match series. A fine all-round performance from Marcus Stoinis (38 off 23 balls and 2-8 off two overs) had Australia well placed for victory, but the home team produced a sensational finish to secure a dramatic four-wicket win. Chasing 177 at the Pallekele Stadium in Kandy on Saturday, Sri Lanka, who failed to reach 130 in the first two games, slumped to 6-108 In the 16th over. But an unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 69 between Shanaka (54 off 25 balls) and Chamika Karunaratne (14 off 10) then swept them to an improbable win as they thrashed 59 off the last three overs. The Australian quicks lost their discipline as Shanaka blasted five fours and four sixes, with Josh Hazlewood conceding 22 runs in the 18th over after giving away just three off his first three. Jhye Richardson (1-46 off four) leaked 18 off the 19th over, leaving the home team needing 19 off the last. Kane Richardson (0-44 off 2.5 overs) started the 20th with two wides as he looked to bowl yorkers outside off stump. Shanaka sent the sell-out crowd into a frenzy later in the over by blasting 14 off three deliveries, before Richardson sent down another wide to gift Sri Lanka the winning run. Australia went into the game without three of their specialist bowlers in pacemen Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc and spinner Adam Zampa plus a fourth member of last year's World Cup winning side, all-rounder Mitch Marsh, who missed the game with a minor calf strain. Finch, named player of the series after scoring 114 runs at an average of 57, was happy with the depth of the team a few months out from their home defence of the World Cup. ""We've seen over the last 12 months that we haven't had a full quota of players to pick from at certain times so we've had to mix and match and we've had some really good results as well, so we're really comfortable with the depth of the team,"" he said. Australia made 5-176 after Finch won the toss for the third time in as many matches. Finch (29 off 20) and David Warner (39 off 33) got Australia off to a swift start with an opening stand of 43 off 5.4 overs. Stoinis helped his side recover from losing wickets off three straight balls in mid-innings after they were well placed at 1-85 after 9.5 overs. Steve Smith (37 not out off 27) made his highest score in his last nine T20I games. Stoinis was called upon to bowl his first overs of the series and he dismissed Pathum Nissanka (27 off 25) and Charith Asalanka (26 off 19) after the home team reached 1-67 in the ninth over. But even after taking three more wickets and looking certain winners, Australia couldn't close out the game. ""Maybe we got a little bit ahead of the game and ahead of ourselves there for a second,"" Stoinis said. The five-match ODI series between the two teams starts at the same venue on Tuesday.

155,Bikes and cars take to the track for the annual Finke Desert Race,sport,"  Finke Desert Race bikes and cars take to the track under sweeping new safety standards Hundreds of competitors on dirt bikes and in cars will attempt to take on the challenging Central Australian landscape in the annual Finke Desert Race, widely billed as the toughest off-road motorsport event in the country. The iconic race sees competitors tear along the ancient Finke riverbed from Alice Springs to the remote community of Apatula, and then back the following day. International star of the sport Toby Price has returned to defend his title in a trophy truck, but the seven-time Finke champion has nothing left to prove. With his record-breaking win last year, Price became the first person to have won in both the car and bike races of the famous event. ""The pressure's off a bit now. I just like the atmosphere here,"" Price said. Alice Springs local and two-time Finke winner David Walsh will enter the bike rice for the 15th time, hoping to hold on to his King of the Desert title. At 22 years of age, Danielle Foot already has five Finke races under her belt and was the fastest woman on a bike in the 2021 event. This year she is upping the ante and attempting both the car and bike races back-to-back. Foot will race to Finke in a Turbo Can-Am alongside her father as his navigator, and then be flown by helicopter back to the start line to run again on a bike, doing the same in reverse on Monday. ""We hope to win the Class 3 [bikes] again … and the fastest female award, and also just make it back in the Can-Am and create some history,"" Foot said. ""You don't have anything else like this in Australia. It's one of a kind."" While some competitors race to win, many others have entered simply for the thrill of the ride and the aim of crossing the finish line. For Alice Springs local Ben Fitzgerald the race has been a major part of his life. When he travelled to the central desert to compete in what he thought would be his third and final Finke race in 2008, Fitzgerald was set up on a blind date. Three years later, moments after riding across the line at Finke, he proposed. ""I ran across with me helmet still on and jumped out on the knee,"" he said. ""Lucky she said 'yes'."" This year he will compete alongside his 16-year-old daughter Sharnee Muller. ""Since I got my first decent bike, that's when it was really like, 'I'll do this the moment I turn 16'. It's definitely on my bucket list and now it's actually here,"" she said. Fitzgerald said the main aim was for both of them to finish the race safely. ""It's like being in a three-hour plane crash,"" he said. ""Once you leave the line on race day one, so much goes on. There's so many bikes and so much dust, holes that weren't there when you were pre-running, crowds. It's like the world stops for that time."" Race organisers pledged this year's event would look quite different with sweeping new safety standards introduced in response to a crash last year that left one man dead and two others injured. Sixty-year-old Nigel Harris died when he was struck by a vehicle that veered off the track and into a group of spectators. ""We're really at the crossroads,"" race director Antony Yoffa said. ""If there's another serious spectator accident this year we won't be coming back here next year."" The race typically attracts about 10,000 spectators, many of whom set up campsites along the length of the remote track. Marshalls will be enforcing the new rule that all spectators must stand at least 20 metres back from the track. There is also a ban on camping, cars, or fixed structures within 30 metres of the track. The new minimum standard for competitors is that they must have participated in a Finke race or similar off-road event to be eligible to enter. Mr Yoffa said there would be a ""world-class"" team of about 60 paramedics working at the race, including St John's Ambulance staff at every checkpoint and aboard three helicopters. The car race will start at 7:30am on Sunday morning, followed by the bikes from 11:45am.

156,Pressure mounts as 'football queens of the Pacific' vie for World Cup qualification,sport," Sport Papua New Guinea women's football team dig deep as they aim for World Cup qualification The Papua New Guinea Women's National Football team is out to make their nation's dreams come true — and they might just do it. Dubbed the ""football queens of the Pacific"", they are on a campaign to compete for World Cup qualification and, as five-time gold medallists of the Pacific Games, the pressure is mounting. The first step in reaching their goal is winning the OFC Women's Nations Cup in Fiji, which will run from July 13 to July 30. From there, the OFC Cup winner will advance to the inter-confederation play-off against nine other nations vying for the remaining three spots at the 2023 World Cup, which will be played in Australia and New Zealand. ""It would mean the world to us if we qualify for the World Cup,"" team captain Yvonne Gabong said. ""The whole reason we are playing is to qualify."" The PNG women — led by English coach Nicola Demaine — may just have the OFC Cup in their grasp with New Zealand, their biggest competitor, out of the picture having automatically qualified as a host nation. PNG have been placed in Group B with Vanuatu and Tahiti. Demaine says it's hard to tell how their playing styles have changed, but PNG will have to perform. ""All games will be must-wins for us, as our aim will be to win the group,"" Demaine said. ""The last nations cup (in 2018), PNG came third, so we're definitely going to do better than that. Our goal is to be number one."" Demaine is counting on the speed of her players to make inroads. ""Their speed is an advantage. So, if we can make them quicker throughout the game, it would be harder for people to keep up."" PNG are also banking on their depth as a team that's made up of experienced players and debutantes. Under the guidance of a proficient coach, it may just be what they need to make history for the country and qualify. Demaine says the team is set on working together to achieve their ultimate goal. ""Right now we are focused on bonding as a team, which [has] proved to be a factor in the team's success in the past,"" Demaine said. ""At the end of the day, there's going to be an element of luck there. It's a tough goal to achieve. ""But the pathway's there … so, if we can win the Nations Cup, then we prepare as best we can for stage two. ""It will be tough, but that's what we've been preparing for this whole time."" The team's current training programs include gym and field sessions, psychology sessions and drawing on the expertise of a nutritionist. Following the 2019 Pacific Games, there has been little to no premiere domestic competition for the women in PNG and zero international fixtures until the team's recent appearance in the Tri-Nations series in April against hosts Singapore and Seychelles, where PNG won both matches. Over the years, much of the focus of the PNG Football Association has been on the men's national team, and their premiere league, as opposed to the women's. However, it was the PNG women who thrived and proved to be successful in the Pacific, with an improved FIFA ranking (49th) while the PNG men are ranked 162. ""It would just be amazing to see them achieve that kind of thing. It's different to other countries in how they are trying to qualify [for the World Cup],"" Demaine said. ""We're trying to prepare them best with not as much available to us but it's the work and sacrifices they've made. I'd just be happy to see them qualify."" The women's team is currently having friendly matches with some local under-18 men's teams, but they're hopeful of having a few international friendlies in Asia or Australia before the OFC Cup. ""We're hoping to travel and play in the FIFA windows in June 20 to 28,"" Demaine said. ""My plan was always to play an international fixture in all the FIFA windows but that's subject to approval and budgeting available to the team."" Meanwhile, former national captain Deslyn Siniu has been managing the team's welfare as well as boosting their preparations with her experience. ""Ideally, having more friendlies similar to Tri-Nations Series in Singapore, gives a better understanding of the team's capabilities and more game time. ""We want to build on the success and lessons of previous friendlies to ensure that we enter the tournament at the top of our game. ""The aim is building around the team philosophy of teamwork, motivation, communication and focusing on the team objectives and end goal."" Team captain Gabong says playing for PNG comes with huge responsibility and expectations. She says that, sometimes, the hardest thing about representing your country is when you don't succeed. ""People's expectation for us to win when we're abroad competing are way too high, but there's only little that we can do,"" Gabong said. ""But the feeling we get when we're about to take the field in another country, with the jersey displaying the PNG colours, while singing the national anthem as our flag is being raised, it's the best thing that we could have in our life. ""We just want to stay focused and take each day at a time, to get ourselves prepared to go out there and compete in the OFC Cup,"" Gabong said. Before their campaign to excel at the international arena kicks-off in Fiji, the PNG women have three more domestic friendlies and a couple of international fixtures scheduled for June, in a journey with a true purpose. ""I'm pretty sure qualifying for the World Cup is everyone's dream and, individually, as players, it's our dream,"" Gabong said. ""So, if we qualify, that will be a dream come true.""

157,analysis: AFLW expansion promising to be a boost for new and previously overlooked talent,sport," Sport AFLW expansion teams will be a boost for new and previously overlooked talent A common argument against the rapid expansion of the AFLW is that it spreads talent too thinly. After the league's maiden season in 2017, the key factors in the AFL Commission's decision to delay its expansion by 12 months included wanting to grow the talent pool, as well as easing concerns about its elite players being spread too sparsely across the league. With four new clubs entering the competition this season, which begins in August, there are 120 new spots in the incoming Essendon, Hawthorn, Sydney and Port Adelaide sides. This has already seen some stars of the league swap guernsey colours, including league best and fairest Maddy Prespakis, who has moved from Carlton to Essendon, and three-time premiership player Erin Phillips, who has headed across town from Adelaide to Port Adelaide. What should you expect from your club's newest recruit? Kate O'Halloran, Cody Atkinson and Sean Lawson crunch the stats on five of the biggest names to move clubs. However, the other side of the coin is that more opportunities for new talent to be unearthed will emerge, including players who have previously been overlooked in drafts or those rising up through the ranks. While that new talent will include many fresh faces from the draft, it should also give mature age former AFLW or VFLW players — who haven't been able to break into a side — a chance, an endeavour that has proven beneficial for clubs and players in the past. For example, Tilly Lucas-Rodd was delisted by Carlton in 2019 then picked up by St Kilda for their inaugural side, in 2020. Last season, Lucas-Rodd polled 11 votes in the league's best and fairest, despite the Saints winning just two games. Another success story who rose from draft snubbing to stardom is North Melbourne's Ash Riddell. The midfielder was overlooked in the 2016 and 2017 drafts. Then, when North Melbourne entered the competition in 2018, she joined the club as a free agent during the expansion club-signing period. In her second season, she was named in the All-Australian Team and in the 2022 season, she was selected as an All-Australian midfielder, polled fourth in the league's best and fairest, was her club's best and fairest and set a league-high game disposal count of 42. ""It was fantastic back then that someone like Ash, who was overlooked in two drafts, was able to find her way into the system,"" Darren Crocker — senior coach for North Melbourne AFLW — told the ABC. ""Then, [Riddell] has been so driven to continue to improve to the point where she's one of the premier midfielders in the comp now."" Gold Coast Suns' Tara Bohanna — who had a similar success arc as Riddell — said expansion would also give a lot of players from the VFLW and local leagues more opportunities to develop their craft at AFLW level. Bohanna was overlooked in six AFLW drafts while playing for the Southern Saints VFLW side before Gold Coast picked her up as an injury top-up player last year. In her first season playing at the highest level, Bohanna was named in the 40-player All-Australian squad after booting 13 goals across nine games, making her one of the top-five goal kickers in the competition. ""It was such a surreal season and I couldn't have asked for it to be more, I think, except if we made finals,"" she said. The 27-year-old credits her success in her first season to the support of the Suns and the experience of playing at AFLW level with elite physiotherapists and facilities. ""You're given every opportunity to kind of flourish and do good things,"" she said. ""It gives you the avenue to be able to push yourself a bit harder. ""There is so much untapped talent out there. I think it's just getting to opportunity, really. ""Which is why it's so exciting to see all these girls that I've been playing against, from your Essendons and your Hawthorns [VFLW sides], get a go — and I'm excited to see how they go."" Essendon has signed a flock of players from its VFLW side, including Georgia Nanscawen, Joanne Doonan, Federica Frew, Danielle Marshall and Jordan Zanchetta. Similarly, Hawthorn has signed players from current VFLW lists, including Sophie Locke, Bridget Deed, Eliza Shannon, Tahlia Fellows, Dominique Carbone and Jenna Richardson. Expansion also means that players who have been on the cusp of starting each week may see more game time as talent spreads out, helping them to develop their skill set. Women's chief executive at the Brisbane Lions Breeanna Brock said clubs such as Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Fremantle had such maturity and depth on their active playing lists that, each week, their line-ups were full of mainstays. That means that players on the cusp — such as under-18s or emergency picks — ""can't quite break into the side"". ""Maria Moloney is a great example,"" said Brock, referring to the former Brisbane midfielder who signed with expansion club Port Adelaide. ""She's 28 years old … in and out of the side, [been] emergency more times than she can think of. So, for her to be able to play properly for the next two to three years of her career, the reality is she would need to go somewhere else to do that. ""For someone like her, expansion is so great because she's getting another opportunity to play her main role, which is as an inside mid. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""Now, she'll get more game time, so she probably improves and ends up being a better player."" With the final stage of expansion underway in the AFLW, the upcoming season will give myriad new players the chance to try to cut their teeth on the big stage, including those such as Moloney. Some former AFLW stars will be able to have another go in the league, just like Lucas-Rodd did, and VFLW players will have the opportunity to shine at the highest level, as Bohanna and Riddell have done.

158,"There are plenty of pathways for women to become leaders in sport, but are they working?",sport," Sport There are plenty of pathways for women to become leaders in sport, but are they working? Lou Broadfoot has not taken the conventional path into senior sports leadership. She started out on the usual track, with a successful career as a state and international cricketer, including featuring in Australia's 2005 Women's World Cup victory. However, her day job was worlds away. She spent 20 years as a police officer and was even deployed to Afghanistan as an army reservist in 2018, where she helped train women leaders in the Afghan army. Sport eventually came calling again last year, when she was given the opportunity to join the board of Mackay Cricket. Soon after, she became senior integrity officer for Tennis Australia. ""I'm an example of an athlete who played sport at a high level and then stepped away for a long time,"" she said. ""And I literally just fell into the board position with Mackay Cricket. If it hadn't been for that, I don't think I would have ever necessarily worked in a sporting role, either as a volunteer, or as paid employment."" But as Broadfoot discovered, the skills she picked up in her non-sporting life have been incredibly transferable. And it's hoped her journey could provide a template for more women to follow. As girls and women's participation in sport steadily grows, we've all heard the call to action for women in senior leadership positions to follow. So, while sporting fields fill with many more girls and women, is the same happening in senior executive roles and in boardrooms? The Australian Sports Commission provides funding to 64 National Sporting Organisations and National Sporting Organisations for People with Disability (NSOs/NSODs), and member organisations are encouraged to have women make up at least 40 per cent of their boards. More than half of funded NSOs/NSODs are hitting or exceeding this benchmark, and there's been an overall improvement in this area over the past 11 years. However, the same results have not been seen in the number of women chief executives and chairs. In fact, the number of women in these roles has declined in recent years. Across Australia's major professional sports — including the AFL, NRL, football, rugby union, netball and cricket — it's a mixed bag. There are just two women chief executives: Christina Matthews from the Western Australia Cricket Association, and Melbourne Victory's managing director Caroline Carnegie, who is the first woman to lead the administration of a men's club in the Australian Professional Leagues. Football has four women chairs, there are four women presidents in the AFL, and recently Kylie Rogers was acting chief executive of the AFL. Unsurprisingly, netball bucks all trends here: There's an even gender split of chairs, and six out of eight, chief executives are women. When you dig deeper into the board breakdowns, the NRL is the worst performer. Only one club, the Canberra Raiders, is close to the 40 per cent benchmark, and five of the 16 clubs do not have a single woman on their board. Netball and football are the leaders in this space, with a much more even gender split. Cricket Australia board member Vanessa Guthrie says things are changing for the better. ""I think the most important thing is not so much equity in numbers, but an ability to bring a diversity of thought and women's voices to the room,"" she said. ""We've had a 32 per cent increase in female directors across state and territories as well as Cricket Australia in the last few years. And, in fact, a doubling of women in boardrooms in the last five years."" Sport Australia and the Australian Institute of Sport have been trying to drive change in this area for decades. The ""Women Leaders in Sport"" program has been running for 21 years and has seen around 26,000 women participate in that time. It offers different strands of the program, including leadership workshops, grants for people to do courses and training, grants to help organisations build more inclusive workplaces, and talent programs to develop female sport executives and high-performance coaches. Australian Sports Commission chief executive Kieren Perkins says it is crucial to have these programs in place, to accelerate the change needed in the industry. ""All of our sports, generally, do have equity in participation and, as you move through the ranks, we should see that reflected in all of the roles that go into administration, coaching and the delivery of sport,"" Perkins said. ""Sport, as a whole, has got a lot of work to do in really understanding where our biases sit, how we step around them, or put them aside and make sure that all of the people [who] are involved in our sports are actually representative of the people who we are there to deliver for."" Sport Australia's general manager of sport, Brooke De Landre, says it is also important to look outside of former athletes when developing women leaders. ""Yes, there's a lot of amazing former athletes [who] we want, that we support through our programs, but we're also really interested in bringing in expertise and experience from outside sport to help grow the skills and diversity within the sector,"" she said. This resonates with Broadfoot after she participated in one of the leadership workshops. ""A lot of the material that we covered was around things like conflict management, having a bit of confidence to be assertive, and leading small teams,"" she said. ""And a lot of that was already quite familiar to me from having spent the best part of 20 years as a police officer, and also from working in the ADF."" Soon after completing the program, Broadfoot applied for the role at Tennis Australia, and now oversees child safeguarding, anti-corruption, anti-doping, member protection and the code of behaviour. She's been heralded as one of the success stories from the workshops. ""We've had some great wins,"" Ms De Landre said. ""The last round of women that went through our program, 10 per cent of them got promoted within three months of finishing."" Last year, former Australian Sports Commission chief executive Kate Palmer told The Age and Sydney Morning Herald a wider cultural shift was needed in Australian sport to achieve change. ""For a long time, we have focused on fixing the women, the idea that they need mentoring, courses, a program,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, the system is broken."" Ms De Landre says Sport Australia is trying to address this, by providing grants to help organisations embed gender equity at their core. ""We can work with the individuals. We can network and bring together, a great group of women to support each other,"" she said. ""But, if an organisation doesn't have great practices and policies in place — is not prioritising diversity in all its forms — then our work to help the individual won't be successful if we don't support the organisations to make these changes."" Dr Guthrie's had a 30-year corporate career in mining, and says lessons can be learned from there. ""Mining has changed dramatically, in the last five to 10 years, in terms of how they have included women, not just in the business, but actually in leadership roles and changing that blokey characteristic,"" she said. ""Cricket has been doing the same, and making great strides, albeit with perhaps a delayed start on what other industries have seen. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""It's breaking the traditional mould, changing our language and promoting some women into those roles where others can see them being hugely successful, contributing to cricket, growing the game. ""And the more we do that, the more that blokey characteristic from the past fades and it becomes a truly inclusive game for all Australians."" Broadfoot hopes to see more organisations embrace that ethic. ""[We need] all those little signs that we, as an organisation, value the input that you can have, and how you can improve our company and how you can add to the thought disparity and diversity within the company.""

159,Brumbies fall agonisingly short in thrilling Super Rugby semi-final against Blues,sport," Sport Brumbies fall agonisingly short against Blues in thrilling Super Rugby Pacific semi-final New Zealand's stranglehold on the Super Rugby Pacific will continue for another year after the Blues snuffed out the hopes of the remaining Australian side, beating the Brumbies 20-19 at Eden Park. The Brumbies took a 7-0 lead after three minutes only to concede the next 20 points before staging a brave second-half fightback. Two rolling-maul tries for Brumbies' substitute hooker Lachie Longergan created a grandstand finish, with fly half Noah Lolesio having a drop goal charged down in the game's dying seconds. It clears the path for the Blues to host the Crusaders in the final next weekend, while it was a 13th unsuccessful attempt by an Australian side to win a play-off game in New Zealand. Flyhalf Beauden Barrett was in impeccable touch, constantly creating opportunities for the Blues while flawless in defence and running for 99 metres. The Brumbies made a flying start with centre Irae Simone bursting through the Blues' line off the back of a scrum and running 40m to score easily for 7-0 lead. The Blues found their feet with two penalties and dragged the score back to 7-6, their backs catching fire and combining brilliantly to find a try for Hoskins Sotutu on 24 minutes. Barrett looked unstoppable and jinked his way around multiple Brumbies defenders before creating an opportunity for Mark Telea to score for 20-7, and only the crossbar denied the flyhalf a long-bomb drop goal on half-time. Blues' hooker Kurt Eklund was sin-binned for a dumping tackle on Andy Muirhead and the Brumbies tried to make immediate use of the man advantage through Tom Banks, but Barrett was once again on hand to deliver a try-saving tackle in the corner. The Brumbies patient, powerful rolling maul finally broke the line with Lachie Lonergan diving over on the hour, while only some elite desperation from Tom Wright denied Barrett a Blues' try immediately after. Searching to reduce the deficit, Brumbies' substitute Sosefo Kautai forced a penalty at the breakdown and they repeatedly threatened the line off the back of their maul, although staunch Blues' defence somehow kept the margin at more than a converted try. In a thrilling finish, Lonergan barged over for his second try on 77 minutes, with Noah Lolesio's conversion cutting the Blues' lead to a point. But he couldn't seal the deal with the subsequent drop goal attempt. While the Blues were dominant in most areas, they were absolutely brutal at the scrum and their pack forced four penalties. They struggled with discipline in the second half, conceding eight penalties to four and they were perhaps lucky not to receive a yellow card for the repeated fouling.

160,analysis: Former greats call for ICC to hand back control of women's cricket,sport,"  Former cricket greats call for ICC to hand back control of women's game after comments over Test format's future Last week, Greg Barclay, the independent chair of the International Cricket Council (ICC), disappointed the cricket community when he cast doubt over the future of women's Test cricket. Momentum has been building over the past couple of years for a revival of the women's traditional format, with a chorus of players expressing their desire to play it on a more regular basis. Barclay told the BBC he couldn't see it being ""part of the women's landscape moving forward"", and in the same breath spoke about the legacy of men's Tests, leading to calls from former cricketing greats for the ICC to hand back control of the women's game to those who are passionate about its history. Former Australian Test captain Raelee Thompson was angered by the bleak future Barclay portrayed for women's Test cricket, and said she could no longer keep quiet. ""To think that Mr Barclay just flatly refused to even consider women's Tests and that he didn't even acknowledge there was any history … I mean, we introduced overarm bowling … you have to know the backstory to do it justice and I'm afraid most of the men in charge don't have any idea,"" Thompson told the ABC. ""I see a need for a separate women's council to look after women's cricket … I think we'd still have to be part of the ICC, but that would be a much better fit, because the women understand the needs of the female players and actually value the history of what our forebears have done."" The summer of 1934/5 saw the official birth of women's Test cricket, as England headed Down Under to play Australia in the inaugural women's Ashes series before crossing the ditch to play a standalone Test against New Zealand. Under the governance of women — whether it be their individual committees or the International Women's Cricket Council — Test cricket thrived. There were 123 total women's Test matches played up to the amalgamation of the ICC in April 2005, and 115 of these were played by these three leading countries. But in the 17 years following the merger of the international men's and women's sides of the game, women's Tests have become a rarer occurrence. New Zealand hasn't played a single Test since the merge, while Australia and England have played 18 between them, keeping the count ticking over with their largely biennial Ashes contest. Even those were reduced from a series to a standalone Test match by 2008, later incorporating three ODIs and three T20Is in 2013 to become the multi-format, points-based system used today. Women's cricket didn't arrive in India until 40 years later, when they formed their first association (1973) and made their Test debut against the West Indies (1976). India were quick to catch up, though, staging 31 matches in the 29 years before the ICC merged and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) followed. Since then, India has had a fractured relationship with Test cricket, playing just eight Tests and facing two extended absences (2006-2014, 2014-2021) from the format altogether. It's important to mention that part of the blame for this halt in progress lies within each country's governing body. Many, like the ICC, didn't see the traditional format as a priority once they merged their men's and women's committees. Instead, they placed their focus on the shorter formats in an effort to monetise the game. And there's no doubt this has helped to accelerate the development of women's cricket, forging a new professional era with more sponsorship, better pay and increased media coverage. Still, the women were the ones who had to perform, and their success with the white ball has given them greater influence over the standards and opportunities afforded to them as key stakeholders in the game. Now, the players say their wish is simply to play more Test cricket — something they've repeated over the past few years ad nauseam. Australia, England, and India have listened to these demands and managed to stage three Tests between them over the past 12 months. South Africa have also put their hand up to join the charge and will face England in their 13th women's Test in June — their first in eight years. Now, the only country within the world's top-five ranked teams that is unwilling to budge on its stance is New Zealand, where Barclay previously worked eight years as the New Zealand Cricket (NZC) director. ""I did note that the comments were coming from a Kiwi, and I remember when their committees merged in 1992 that it halted the momentum of their women's Tests … I believe he's pushing that same agenda,"" Thompson said. In the 13 years between NZC's and the ICC's amalgamation, the White Ferns went from being leaders in women's cricket to playing a mere eight Tests. The move was thought to be groundbreaking, encouraging England (1998) and Australia (2003) to follow, before the ICC did the same and made it mandatory for all of its members. However, some of the women involved with NZC at the time insist it felt more like a takeover and they were given little choice on the matter, as governments wanted to streamline their flow of funding. Former White Ferns captain, coach and manager Trish McKelvey recalled the way the New Zealand's Women's Cricket Council was reluctant to go through with it, realising it was likely to be a trade-off for better resources but less power. ""It was in no way a unanimous decision, the women weren't happy about it,"" McKelvey told the ABC. ""Obviously the girls are much better off with the funding they've got now, but one of the strongest recommendations from the women was that NZC continue to grow and develop the women's game … I can't hand on heart say that has happened."" An independent report conducted in 2016 forced the NZC to admit it had neglected the women's game, and change was implemented to see women appointed in more administration roles within the domestic pathways and at the head of the sport. This has at least resulted in more female voices onto the NZC board, with former White Ferns players Debbie Hockley (president) and Lesley Murdoch (vice-president) in charge, and a 50/50 gender split amongst the other board members. What it hasn't done, though, is create opportunities for women's Test cricket. ""As far as I'm concerned, there are more women on the board, but you wouldn't describe all of them as cricketers. Most of them are businesspeople … it's one thing to be business driven, and another to be sport driven,"" McKelvey said. ""Our White Ferns should be playing Test matches but I believe while the present people are in charge that, unfortunately, this is unlikely to change."" Other passionate advocates have called for women to be given back control in the wake of Barclay's comments. During the process of writing his book, Captain's File, from Peden to Haynes: Australian Women Test Cricket Captains, author Rob Harvey developed a deep understanding of the history of the game. He argues that even though the separate women's committees didn't have an abundance of money to play with back in the day, they were still able to make significant progress. ""The majority of the funding they received was self-generated with a little help from the government, and although their takings weren't that great, even on the scraps they had, these women were well ahead of the curve,"" Harvey said. ""They organised World Cups — including the very first Cricket World Cup, it wasn't until 1975 that the men had one — and they ran proper Test series with multiple matches on a shoestring … Surely if these women were running it today, they'd make a better fist of it."" Women's cricket historian and writer Raf Nicholson of Bournemouth University is currently working on a project that examines a range of mergers between men's and women's sports in the UK. Nicholson says that although women's cricket has benefited from the funding side of these amalgamations, it is now in a position where it can start to think about what it might look like to reverse the approach. ""I think we've moved beyond the situation where women's cricket is desperate for resources and media attention, and now it's a more powerful position,"" she said. ""I don't think it's a matter of being ungrateful. To some extent, shouldn't the ICC be grateful for what women's cricket has done for it as an organisation? ""We know it's the biggest growth area of the game and, really, if you suggest they should be grateful to the men, aren't you suggesting that women didn't always deserve to be paid? Of course they did."" Nicholson also points out that there is already a Women's Cricket Committee in place at the ICC, but she believes it has been unable to influence significant change because it has been set up to act as an advisory body to the Chief Executive's Committee with no autonomous decision-making powers. That Chief Executive's Committee is currently made up of 19 men and one woman, Clare Connor, by way of her position as the chair of the women's committee. Above that, at the ICC board of directors, the ratio is much the same, with Indra Nooyi the only woman seated at the table alongside 25 men. ""Say the women's committee wanted to mandate that more women's Tests be played. The people in decision-making positions would have probably turned around and said, 'No we don't support that,' so I would like to see that committee given more power,"" Nicholson said. When contacted for comment, the ICC told the ABC it was proud of the work it had done over the past decade to grow the women's game, primarily through other formats as a strategic priority. However, by ignoring the Test format and the role in which the governing body could play in this area, it runs the risk of turning a blind eye to the wants of the current playing group and denying them of a legitimate chance to connect with the game's origins and legacy. On the matter of women's Test cricket, a spokesperson from the ICC said: ""The growth of women's cricket is one of the strategic priorities of the ICC strategy and the game has grown significantly in the 17 years since its integration with the ICC. During that period, the ICC, supported and guided by its Women's Cricket Committee, which has remit to assist and advise the ICC on all aspects of strategy and cricketing issues related to the women's game, has invested in women's cricket, driving professionalism and enabling more nations and more fans to enjoy the game. Test cricket can be played by Members, but the ICC has chosen to focus its investment on the white ball game to accelerate the growth and engage broadcasters and commercial partners so we can achieve a long-term sustainable future for the game. This decision, which supports Members to play Test cricket if they wish, is fully endorsed by both Members and the ICC Women's Cricket Committee, which is made up of current and former greats of the game. In 2009, the ICC staged its first men's and women's joint T20 World Cup, and after several joint events, these events are now stand-alone giving men and women equal global platforms. Additionally, T20 pathways have been introduced which ensure more of the ICC's 106 Members can play international cricket. Since 2017, every game of every ICC men's and women's events have been broadcast in more than 200 territories to the same high standard of coverage, which when combined with global marketing campaigns to promote the women's game has resulted than more fans than ever before following it. The recent ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2022, is the third most watched ICC event ever (men's or women's). It is disingenuous to suggest a failure of growth in the last 17 years. This investment has been fantastic for the women's game, who can forget 86,174 people packed into the MCG for the final of the T20 World Cup 2020, or a full house at both Lord's and the Hagley Oval for the Cricket World Cup finals in 2017 and 2022 respectively. We are incredibly proud of what we have achieved in the women's game and will continue our commitment to focus on it over the long-term as we ensure it has a global platform that inspires future generations of fans and players. To focus on the lack of growth in Test cricket is to ignore a huge section of the sport and the hundreds of millions of fans who engage in that.""

161,"Lions, Dockers force logjam at the top of AFL ladder with pivotal wins ",sport," Sport Brisbane Lions, Fremantle Dockers force logjam at top of AFL ladder with wins over St Kilda, Hawthorn Brisbane have burst away from a gutsy St Kilda to claim a 21-point victory in an injury-marred game and enter their bye in the AFL top two. The Lions needed to bounce back after losing to Fremantle and their clash with the Saints teetered on the brink before Brisbane kicked three of the final four goals to prevail 10.17 (78) to 8.9 (57) at the Gabba. The victory came at a cost though, with skipper Dayne Zorko substituted out for Darcy Fort with a third-term hamstring injury while Darcy Gardiner had treatment on his back and failed to finish the contest. St Kilda did brilliantly to fight out the game, with just two players on the bench in the final quarter. They lost Mitchito Owens and Daniel McKenzie to concussion either side of half-time, with substitute Jarrod Lienert replacing Owens at the main break, while Zak Jones suffered a third-quarter hamstring injury. Lions stars Lachie Neale (37 disposals, seven clearances, 460 metres gained) and Hugh McCluggage (33 disposals, seven clearances) were typically prolific. Joe Daniher kicked three goals on his return and classy Keidean Coleman impressed, while Harris Andrews fought back after Max King kicked two early goals to quieten the Saints young gun. Jack Sinclair (30 disposals, 642 metres gained), Brad Crouch (26 disposals, 10 tackles) and Jade Gresham (two goals, 21 disposals), were busy for St Kilda. King booted the first two goals of the match, both from free kicks, while Daniher sprayed two early set shots. Then, Brisbane received an unlikely gift late in the first term. Daniher slammed through a goal from open play and in the aftermath, amid a scuffle, Brad Crouch slung Charlie Cameron to the ground by the neck. Cameron was given a free kick straight in front of goal and he handed the Lions a quarter-time lead. St Kilda brushed off the disappointment and led by 12 at the main break. But they lost Owens when the youngster ran towards a contest and clashed heads front-on with Lincoln McCarthy, with the contact sending the young Saint flying, and he was substituted at half-time. Early in the third quarter, Daniel McKenzie took a brilliant aerial mark but landed on his head and went to the bench for assessment. The AFL score review system proved contentious, with McCluggage and Cam Rayner having goals chalked off in the third and fourth terms respectively. But neither affected the outcome, as Brisbane kicked on from their three-point lead at the final change to overrun the depleted Saints. Nat Fyfe was the drawcard but it was Andrew Brayshaw who ended up being the hero as Fremantle overcame a brave Hawthorn to post a 13-point AFL win at Perth Stadium. Brayshaw tallied 37 disposals, seven tackles, and he kicked the match-sealing goal with five minutes remaining to help the Dockers secure the 14.11 (95) to 12.10 (82) victory on Saturday. Fyfe started in the middle of the ground in his first AFL match for more than 10 months, but he also spent significant stints up forward. The two-time Brownlow medallist finished with 21 disposals, five clearances, and 1.2 in a promising display. Brennan Cox, Hayden Young, and Luke Ryan combined for 32 marks in defence as the Dockers improved their record to 10-3 to move to equal top of the table with Melbourne. Jaeger O'Meara finished with a team-high 30 disposals and nine clearances for the Hawks, while James Sicily (nine marks) was a rock in defence. Dockers defender Blake Acres was in tears on the bench after appearing to tear his right hamstring in the final quarter. Hawthorn's Sam Frost, who was playing as a forward, was also subbed off in the last term with a knee injury. The Dockers booted the opening two goals of the match, but Hawthorn worked their way into the contest and made the most of their chances in attack. The Hawks nailed four long-range set shots to go with Chad Wingard's late major from point-blank range to take a three-point lead into quarter time. Fyfe had the chance to produce a memorable highlight late in the second quarter when he collected the ball in the pocket, but his dribble kick was never on track and went through for a behind. Hawthorn's 10-point half-time lead was set up by their 32-21 advantage in inside 50s, with their forward-half pressure proving crucial. Griffin Logue's efforts in making a contest up forward set up two goals to Dockers goalsneak Michael Walters early in the third quarter. Fyfe bobbed up later in the term, sending the 39,428 crowd wild when he took a strong contested mark on the lead. Although his shot sailed just wide, he got his first goal of the match a minute later with a volley from the goal line. Fremantle turned for home with a handy 14-point edge, but the margin was just six when Luke Breust booted his second goal of the match with six minutes remaining. Brayshaw stood tall when his team needed him most, soccering a ball through from five metres out while holding off his opponent. The match was expected to test whether Fremantle could overcome their wet weather demons, but the rain stayed away and the contest was played in relatively dry conditions.

162,"Broncos win seventh straight, but lose three starters, including Reynolds, to injury",sport," Sport Brisbane Broncos overcome injuries to beat Raiders; Storm debutant Grant Anderson scores twice in win over Roosters; Alex Johnston hat-trick leads Souths past Titans The Brisbane Broncos have held on to beat Canberra 24-18 at Lang Park for their seventh straight NRL victory, but will be counting the cost after a hefty injury toll. Already without Kotoni Staggs, Kurt Capewell and Selwyn Cobbo, who did not back up after Wednesday's State of Origin opener, the Broncos lost halfback and captain Adam Reynolds to a rib injury, Blues prop Payne Haas to a shoulder issue, and centre Herbie Farnworth left the game let with a nasty looking bicep complaint. They also ended the game with nobody left on the bench after a last-minute head knock tofive-eighth Ezra Mam. The injuries meant Pat Carrigan played 68 minutes backing up from a gargantuan effort on Origin debut on Wednesday, when he played 64 straight minutes after coming off the bench early. Mam scored the first try of the game, flashing some fancy footwork to make his way past the Raiders defence in ninth minute, but the teams went back and forth trading tries. Nick Cotric crossed for the Raiders before Jordan Pereira, playing in place of Cobbo, scored in his Broncos debut, receiving the final pass from Brenko Lee, who was playing just his second game for the club. Corey Horsburgh kept the Raiders in touch with a try of his own not long after, before Farnworth touched down on the back of a Te Maire Martin line break in the 34th minute, only for Adam Elliott to almost immediately cancel it out with one of his own. Farnworth completed his double just after the half-time break, off a handy final pass from Mam, although the lead-up play from Reynolds, Carrigan and Billy Walters played a big part in getting them within striking distance. That was the final try of the game, with only other points of the game coming from a 55th-minute Reynolds penalty goal, kicked just after he received the heavy tackle from Jamal Fogarty that caused his injury, although he tried to play on for a few minutes before succumbing. From there it was a matter of white-knuckling the final quarter of the game with an almost empty bench, and while coach Kevin Walters was pleased with his team's resilience, both he and NSW coach Brad Fittler will be concerned by the toll it took. Haas was already dealing with a shoulder complaint on his left side, but Saturday's injury was to the AC joint on his right, and while the severity is not yet known, he only has 15 days to recover in time for Origin II in Perth. Reynolds's injury came as he appeared to have found his long-term halves partner in Mam, with the complementary playmakers finding their groove in Brisbane's seventh straight win to remain in fourth spot on the ladder. Plucked from Queensland Cup, first-game winger Grant Anderson has become an immediate folk hero for Melbourne with two tries in his first game. With Xavier Coates suffering a nasty ankle injury in State of Origin I, Anderson was called onto the wing in jersey number 24 for the Storm's blockbuster clash with the Roosters, crossing twice in a 26-18 win at the SCG. Anderson had a chance to score in the opening exchanges after a Dean Ieremia line break, but Ieremia's pass slipped out of his hands, over Anderson's head and over the sideline. The Roosters opened the scoring through Joseph Suaalii, but Anderson got his first not long after thanks to a stunning pass from Felise Kaufusi, bending low and popping a short ball off his shins to Anderson to touch down on 15 minutes. The teams went try for try in the first half, with Sam Walker adding one for the Roosters and Marion Seve joining the scoring after half an hour, but Nick Meaney's missed conversion meant the Roosters led 12-10 at half-time. Seve gave the Storm the lead straight after the break with his second, before Sitili Tupouniua, true to the nature of the game, hit back for the Roosters. Anderson completed his brace after an hour of play when he latched onto a looping pass from Jahrome Hughes and stepped back inside an on-rushing James Tedesco, giving the Storm a lead they would not relinquish. It seemed he would score a miraculous hat-trick with 15 minutes left when he chased a Hughes grubber and toed ahead, but was illegally taken out by Blues winger Daniel Tupou. In the end it was Origin rep Kaufusi who scored the game-sealing try, although Tupouniua squandered a golden chance to hit back for the Roosters when he could not hold a Walker chip. The bigger issue for the Roosters is the loss of Luke Keary to another concussion, the result of friendly fire from Joey Manu's knee. South Sydney winger Alex Johnston has scored a hat-trick for the second straight game as the Rabbitohs beat the Titans 30-16. Coming off three tries in their last-start 44-18 win over the Tigers, the leading try-scorer in Souths history added another treble on the Gold Coast to take his tally for the season to 14 to lead the league after 14 rounds. The win moved the Rabbitohs up to sixth on the NRL ladder, while the Titans slipped to their ninth defeat in 10 games. The Rabbitohs winger brought up his 150th NRL try, becoming just the 15th player ever to achieve that feat. South Sydney's win continues their dominance over Gold Coast with their last loss coming six years ago. Enjoying a 12-4 lead at the break, Johnston bagged his second just after half-time when an error in midfield gifted the Bunnies field position. Some soft hands to the left edge put him into space, and with enough momentum, got to the line through contact. Titans skipper Tino Fa'asuamaleaui crossed to get them back into the contest, but Souths wrangled back momentum in the 60th minute after a stellar run by Campbell Graham was finished off by a surging Taane Milne who crashed over. Fa'asuamaleaui bagged a late consolation minutes from full-time but milestone man Tom Burgess still celebrated a win in his 200th NRL game.

163,"Ariana didn't have horses growing up, but she's fallen for the sport of breakaway roping",sport," ABC Rural International rodeo career beckons for breakaway roper Ariana Varischetti Ariana Varischetti was raised in the country and the world of rodeo is her life. She is joining an increasing number of Aussies from the bush who are pursuing a professional career on the international rodeo circuit. ""It's getting so big in the [United] States. There are plenty of avenues to go over there and make a living roping calves,"" said Ariana from Mackay in north Queensland. Breakaway roping is Ariana's chosen event. ""There's definitely a lot of girls in breakaway roping, it's quite obvious how big it's gotten,"" she said. The aim of the event is simple. It requires a horseback rider to throw a lasso around a calf. The calf is released into the rodeo area, the horse and rider follow shortly after, and the rider attempts to throw the rope around the calf's neck as quickly as they can. With her country roots, the decision for Ariana to get involved in the Australian rodeo circuit was an easy one to make. ""I grew up on a cattle station riding horses, campdrafting,"" she said. ""I got into it myself, my family doesn't have any [horses]."" Her breakaway roping has already taken her to the other side of the globe. ""I spent probably a year over there in 2015 and I was fortunate enough to live with some of the best breakaway ropers in the world and I travelled around and rode with them,"" she said. ""It was amazing."" But Ariana said it was a hefty commitment for those involved in the sport. ""Most people spend a lot of time during the week, probably five out of the seven days, practising at home,"" she said. ""Practice sessions can go for up to two hours."" But Ariana said it was all worthwhile. Her ultimate goal is to go back to the US and pursue the sport professionally. ""[I want] to go back to the states mid-next year and try to spend a bit of time just to see what happens, and go and compete,"" she said. ""Now that breakaway roping is so big, there's a lot of money [in it] and you can definitely make a living."" Aside from the potential career path it offered, Ariana said there was another simple reason many young women like herself were getting into the sport. ""Probably just the adrenaline behind it."" Brooke Frame is just 12 years old, and at the beginning of her bull-riding career. At this year's Nebo rodeo in central Queensland, it was her first time riding a mini bull. Brooke said that while it might not seem like much, she took pride in how long she could remain on a bull. ""I think four or five seconds, since I've only done it like a couple of times,"" she said. For Brooke, the rodeo lifestyle runs in the family. ""My dad's been rodeoing ever since he was tiny so I just wanted to take on the legacy as well and see if I could be as good as him,"" she said. And she has some advice for other young girls looking at getting into bull riding. ""Stay forwards and keep your hand up,"" Brooke said. ""Just have fun.""

164,AFLW star Deni Varnhagen to remain on Adelaide Crows 'inactive' list,sport,"  AFLW star Deni Varnhagen will spend another season on the Adelaide Crows ""inactive"" list, this time due to pregnancy. The two-time premiership player spent the most recent season on the sidelines after failing to meet the league's COVID-19 vaccination policy. Crows women's head of football Phil Harper said the club was ""thrilled for Deni"" and her partner Jarrad. ""It's obviously a very exciting time for them,” he said. ""Deni was a member of our inaugural squad, a two-time premiership player and she's contributed greatly to our women’s football journey. ""We look forward to seeing her enter this new phase in her life."" Harper said the 29-year-old remained optimistic about returning to the game. ""She is hopeful of circumstances allowing her to one day return to play at the elite level and Deni remains part of the Crows family."" The AFLW season starts again in late August. Varnhagen is also a nurse, another job she lost due to vaccine mandates imposed on health workers under SA's Emergency Management Act. She was among four workers who launched legal action in South Australia's Supreme Court in an effort to overturn the mandate. The case is in limbo after the state's emergency declaration officially ended last month, which rescinded the Police Commissioner's powers to impose vaccine mandates. Despite that, Varnhagen still cannot return to her nursing role permanently, with vaccine requirements for people in high-risk settings now enshrined in the state's Public Health Act. Varnhagen revealed on Instagram she returned to work last week with a medical exemption. ""It's been 7 months since I’ve had the privilege of working with these beautiful nurses,"" she wrote. ""I am so grateful to be back, albeit only for a short time (medical exemption). ""Honestly can't thank them enough for being there for me during these times."" Her case returns to the Supreme Court later this month.

165,Overhauled Hockeyroos squad announced for Commonwealth Games,sport,"  Hockeyroos announce squad for Commonwealth Games as national team embarks on new chapter The world number three Hockeyroos have named an inexperienced squad featuring 12 Commonwealth Games debutants as they attempt to return to their golden ways at Birmingham 2022. Jane Claxton and Brooke Peris are the only members of the 18-player squad to have notched up 100 games or more for Australia. Claxton is set to pass the milestone of 200 caps for Australia at Birmingham, where the 29-year-old will be seeking her second Commonwealth Games gold after success in Glasgow in 2014. Peris, who was the Northern Territory's Sportsperson of the Year in 2014, is the cousin of dual Commonwealth Games gold medallist Nova Peris, who was a sprint and hockey star. The Hockeyroos have claimed gold in four of the six Commonwealth Games where hockey has been played. However, they were denied a hat-trick of gold medals in the final on the Gold Coast four years ago and are desperate to get back to their golden ways. Madison Fitzpatrick, who has been a member of the Australian team since 2015, is confident the Hockeyroos will shine in Birmingham. ""The Commonwealth Games is very special to me, another opportunity to play for my country and promote the sport I love,"" the 25-year-old said. ""Our new players are slotting in very well. The Commonwealth Games will be a big test for them but they have the full support of the team and the coaches, so I know they will shine."" Claire Colwill, 18, is the sole teenager in the squad. ""I am thrilled to be selected for the Commonwealth Games and feel excited, albeit slightly daunted, to play with and against some of the greatest hockey players in the world,"" Colwill said. ""Having the opportunity to represent my country with pride is an unparalleled experience, so I cannot wait to pull on the green and gold."" Joining Claxton and Peris in the squad from the silver-medal-winning team at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games are Kaitlin Nobbs, Greta Hayes, Penny Squib and Stephanie Kershaw. Making their Commonwealth Games debut are Jocelyn Bartram, Claire Colwill, Madison Fitzpatrick, Amy Lawton, Rosie Malone, Aleisha Power, Courtney Schonell, Karri Somerville, Renee Taylor, Shanea Tonkin, Mariah Williams and Georgia Wilson. The Hockeyroos will come up against New Zealand, South Africa, Scotland and Kenya in their group stage. Just last month the Hockeyroos secured a 2-0 series victory over NZ in Auckland. That series was their first taste of international action since bowing out of the Olympics with a shock quarter-final loss to India. Coach Katrina Powell had just months to prepare the team for the Olympics following the messy exit of former coach Paul Gaudoin amid a toxic team culture. Powell has now enjoyed an extended stint in the role and she is aiming to guide the Hockeyroos to gold at July's World Cup and then the Commonwealth Games.

166,EFL to allow clubs to wear away kits at home to help colour-blind people,sport,"  English Football League to allow clubs to wear away kits at home to help colour-blind players and fans English Football League clubs will be allowed to wear 'away' and alternative kits at home next season to help colour-blind players, staff, officials, and fans distinguish between teams. The EFL passed the amendment at their annual general meeting on Friday. The change means that teams have more flexibility when choosing match-day kits to avoid clashes that may be problematic. Previously, clubs were required to wear designated 'home' and 'away' kits for particular fixtures, regardless of whether they were similar to an opponent's kit, with the exception of one per season to accommodate commemorative or charity strips. The most recent example of the clash was in both legs of Sheffield Wednesday's promotion play-off against Sunderland in League One, where both clubs wore black shorts, dark socks, and a vertical-striped jersey, with the only major difference being that one jersey had red stripes while the other had blue. The EFL said they will ""play a more active role in helping clubs identify where a potential colour-blind kit clash may occur"" and give the respective teams enough notice to arrange an alternative, which could include choosing different jersey, short, and sock combinations to ensure those with colour-blindness can adequately differentiate teams. Colour-blindness affects around one in 12 men and one in 200 women, with the most commonly-affected colours being red and green. Colour Blind Awareness CEO Kathryn Albany-Ward welcomed the news, telling The Guardian: ""We know that statistically at least one player in every male squad is colour blind, and these regulation changes will make some ties easier for these players too, thereby improving overall performance of the teams"". The move comes as more clubs and leagues around the world adjust their kit rules to make the sport more accessible for those with colour-blindness. Italy's Serie A will ban teams from wearing all-green kits from next season, while World Rugby announced plans last year to prevent Wales and Ireland from wearing predominantly red and green kits when playing each other at the 2027 World Cup. It's not known whether the Premier League will follow suit, but its regulations recommend that clubs should wear kits that provide an appropriate contrast. Other rule changes at the EFL AGM included an increase of the number of substitutes allowed per match from three to five players, while the league added extra conditions in its owners' and directors' test, disqualifying those convicted of a hate crime.

167,"How a parkrun helped locals find love, get through chemo and bond with their kids",sport,"  Newcastle parkrun creates 'region of runners' through fitness and community spirit It doesn't matter where you finish or if you run or walk, it's about getting active and meeting new people. That's the attitude at parkrun in Newcastle, an event which organisers say has created a ""region of runners"". While living abroad, Newcastle local Dave Robertson took part in a parkrun in the United Kingdom and instantly knew he needed one in his home town. ""I was convinced it would go well and be supported by the local community,"" he said. And he was right. The first Newy parkrun on June 8, in 2012, had 77 participants. Ten years on the five-kilometre weekly event attracts on average more than 400 people, making it one of the most popular in Australia. Mr Robertson said elite runners or established runners would always find a way to run, so parkrun was about getting everyone else to have a go. ""The nature of the event is that there's so few barriers to participation,"" he said. ""Anyone can do it, any age, you can bring your dog, you can bring your kids, you can bring your grandparents."" The parkrun movement has spread across the Hunter Valley, earning the area the nickname the ""region of runners"". Get local stories told by the people who are living them with the Newcastle Hunter Catch Up podcast. Mr Robertson said there were almost 30 McDonalds fast-food outlets across the region — he is keeping tally and hopes one day the parkruns will outnumber them. ""We've launched a total of 17 different parkruns in the Hunter region ... we're still a little bit behind but there's still scope for growth,"" he said. ""We're seeing new events popping up and it's great to see communities around the Hunter embracing parkrun."" Alex O'Loughlin and Courtney Barnes met at parkrun five years ago. ""We were both volunteering as time keepers. That's where we met and it kind of just went from there,"" Ms Barnes said. Mr O'Loughlin said parkrun was the reason he got into running, but meeting his partner was a bonus. ""Courtney was more into running than I was so I guess I had to get into it after that,"" he said. ""I think 5 kilometres was the furthest I'd ever run when I came to parkrun, and Courtney had already done a few marathons, so I had to start upping the distance and I've done my first marathon now."" The couple got married in January. When Suzie McGregor started doing parkrun each Saturday it helped motivate her to get out and run at least 5 kilometres each week. But after being diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing six months of treatment, the friendship and support from other parkrun attendees has been just as important. ""The support has been amazing ... messages and even a dear friend who does parkrun made a beautiful blanket for me full of parkrun photos that I can take to chemo,"" she said. ""She knew that it would be cold at chemo, so I used that blanket every time."" When COVID-19 restrictions eased and parkrun could start up again it was still too dangerous for Ms McGregor to join her friends on the weekly course. Instead she walked on a stretch of grass nearby. ""People could see me and people would wave, and say 'Hey Suzie, how are you?'"" she said. ""And that just gave me that boost I needed and made me feel good again and made me know I can do this and keep going. It was just invaluable, just amazing."" While she's not running the course again just yet, she's happy to be back walking it alongside friends. ""I've finished chemo, I've finished radiation, I'm back at work full-time, besides feeling tired I'm quite well and very pleased that I've got so much in front of me."" Alan McCloskey, 70, has been running for 50 years and has completed 340 parkruns. He said very few people were running when he started, but parkrun has given many a platform to get active. ""It's not an elitist event by any means. People run for the sheer enjoyment and pleasure and connection to community,"" he said ""From the tail walker to the very first person across the line — we've all got a sense of unity."" Jordi Bates has been taking part in Newy parkrun for almost 10 years and likes the regular routine every Saturday morning. ""If I'm not here I'll be at one of the other parkruns around Newcastle,"" he said. ""It's just really nice if you have a hard week or an easy week to just rock up and do your thing."" A friendly face is also easy to find. ""You can run with a friend that you haven't seen for a while and at the end you can mill around, have a chat or go off and have a coffee, which is nice,"" Mr Bates said. Jason Daniel and his daughter Priscilla Colman like to do the course together. ""It was a good excuse to do a little bit of father-daughter bonding,"" he said. He also wants to ""live a bit longer"" so likes the weekly exercise and has now completed 350 parkruns. Running with others also provides that extra motivation. ""You find you run yourself and you just plod along and here it gives you that bit of extra push,"" Ms Colman said. ""You see a kid chasing you and overtaking you and you say 'I can't have that', so you just push yourself a little bit more which is nice.""

168,Grace Brown clings to Women's Tour lead entering into dramatic final day,sport,"  Grace Brown maintains overall lead at Women's Tour to set up dramatic three-way finish on final day Grace Brown is one stage away from a maiden Women's Tour victory after maintaining the slimmest of overall leads in the race's penultimate, hill-top finish at Black Mountain on Saturday in the United Kingdom. The Aussie finished third on stage five in Carmarthenshire, just behind winner Elisa Longo Borghini and second-placed Kasia Niewiadoma — all three of whom have been exchanging the overall race lead this past week. Brown picked up valuable bonus seconds in the final climb, ensuring that her and the Italian Borghini will enter the final day in equal-first position on the leaderboard, while Poland's Niewiadoma is just two seconds behind. The 106.6km stage began at Pembrey Country Park and wound into the Welsh hillside, with Joss Lowden opening an early lead on the chasing group and larger peloton. But Lowden was caught 43km into the stage as the leading group — which contained the race's top three — extended the gap over the pack by over a minute. However, the peloton eventually caught the breakaways with 23km remaining as the riders reached the foot of Black Mountain. Dutch rider Ellen van Dijk set the pace as the climb began  — it reaches a 21 per cent gradient in some places — with no clear front-runner emerging in the final 5km. But the reigning Italian road race champion Borghini timed her final push perfectly, breaking off from the pack and out-sprinting both Brown and Niewiadoma at the end of the 7.2km climb. ""It was quite a race into the bottom of it, all the [general classification] riders had the lead-outs from their teams,"" Brown said afterwards. ""My team had done a lot of work all day, so we were down to one rider in the end, but I managed to stay at the front. Then the wind neutralised the climb a little bit from too many attacks, but it was still hard, really hard in the last kilometre. ""There was a bit of doubt because I knew that if I wanted to stay ahead in time then I needed to come second on Elisa's wheel with no gap, but then it worked out that if I came third we were equal. I didn't know how it worked in terms of countback, but I retained the jersey."" Sunday's final 142.9km stage will begin in Chipping Norton and finish in Oxford's city centre with 16 bonus seconds on offer. ""It will be really cool,"" the 29-year-old Victorian said of the dramatic final stage. ""The Cotswolds are almost a second home, because my husband's family are from the area, so I'm going to have a lot of support out on the road and it will be special to be in the leader's jersey for tomorrow's race.""

169,Blues spoil Bombers' 150th anniversary celebrations with comfortable MCG win,sport," Sport Carlton beat Essendon by 26 points on Bombers' big night as Blues move back into top four Carlton have spoiled arch-rival Essendon's 150th anniversary celebrations, recording a 26-point AFL victory to continue the Bombers' horror season. In front of 65,440 fans, Essendon put on a memorable pre-game show at the MCG as captain Dyson Heppell delivered a stirring address to players in a circle full of Bombers legends of the past 50 years. But not even the emotion of a historic occasion could help Essendon pull of a giant upset as the 16th-placed Bombers stumbled to 2-10 this season. Essendon lifted after Carlton slammed through the first three goals of the game but the Blues powered ahead by kicking 5.3 to 2.2 in the second quarter. In an uninspiring final quarter, both teams went goalless after the Blues led by 28 points at three-quarter-time. Carlton had too much class in the midfield, and up forward with twin towers Harry McKay (three goals) and Charlie Curnow (two), and ran out winners 12.8 (80) to 7.12 (54). At 9-3, the Blues are surging towards their first finals appearance since 2013 but their injury list continues to grow. Already without star fullback Jacob Weitering, midfielder Adam Cerra (hamstring) was subbed out in the first quarter against the Bombers and replaced by Matthew Cottrell. Utility Jack Silvangi and midfielder Matt Kennedy looked sore at the end of the third quarter but were both able to return to the field in the final term. Essendon were hit by the late withdrawal of key midfielder Andrew McGrath (groin) and were further impacted as fellow on-baller Darcy Parish was subbed out in the third quarter with a suspected calf injury. Comeback kid Sam Docherty was again one of Carlton's best as he pushes his claims for All-Australian selection in his first season back after recovering from testicular cancer. Adam Saad haunted his former club, with the dashing defender earning boos from Essendon supporters for every one of his 19 possessions. The struggling Bombers will be back on the Friday night stage next week when they face red-hot St Kilda at Docklands Stadium, while the Blues will tackle Richmond at the MCG for the second time this season.

170,Dreadful Dragons slump to listless loss to undermanned Cowboys,sport," Sport Undermanned North Queensland make easy work of listless St George Illawarra in 31-12 victory North Queensland have seen off a spirited challenge by St George Illawarra 31-12 at home to win their 10th game of the season and cement themselves in the competition's top four. The Cowboys have a knack of turning up their defensive intensity in second halves and held their opposition to just the one try in the second stanza. Their 46 points conceded in second halves through 14 rounds this season is the NRL's best. Cowboys tries to Connelly Lemuelu and Murray Taulagi at the beginning and end of the second half capped off an error-strewn evening, the home side still well in control however after they'd added three tries to one in the first stanza. It was the visitors who enjoyed the lions share of territory in the second half, only capitalising on it late through a try to Jaydn Su'a in the 74th minute. Their play-the-balls deep in the final third were shutdown with punishing defence by the Cowboys. North Queensland hooker Reece Robson paved the way with 43 tackles, none better than on former teammate Francis Molo on his tryline to force an error late. Co-skipper Jason Taumalolo was back to his barnstorming best through the middle, leading all players with 191 metres off 18 carries while Jordan McLean was damaging through the middle to finish with 124. In the first half, a try in the final minutes would be one of the Dragons' two after a frantic beginning at Queensland Country Bank Stadium Cowboys coach Todd Payten said he was looking for ball control from his side but they coughed it up on their opening two sets before the Dragons gifted them field position with back-to-back restarts. Tom Dearden capitalised on the deep territory, putting Coen Hess through a hole before he offloaded to a surging Scott Drinkwater to plunge over. The Cowboys were then back on the offensive as Dearden forced a goal-line dropout, with Drinkwater turning provider on the resulting set, grubbering to the in-goal for Peta Hiku to bag their second. A penalty goal by Valentine Holmes made it 14-0 after 22 minutes before the Dragons had their first real crack at the line but Cody Ramsey's try was overturned due to obstruction. Moments later the home side had their third after a deft pass by Taumalolo in midfield put Griffin Neame through a hole, he in turn finding a supporting Robson to score against his former club. Moses Suli's try before halftime gave the Dragons some hope but the Cowboys kept them at arm's length to secure the win. In a blemish for the Cowboys, they lost young-gun backrower Heilum Luki to a suspected ACL injury in the first half.

171,Madison de Rozario and Ben Tudhope named Paralympians of the Year,sport," Sport Wheelchair racer Madison de Rozario and para-snowboarder Ben Tudhope named Paralympians of the Year Madison de Rozario and Ben Tudhope both started their Paralympic careers as children, carrying big expectations, and even bigger dreams. They've transformed from youngsters with potential into Paralympic medallists, World Champions, respected role models — and now the 2020 and 2022 Paralympians of the Year. Wheelchair racer de Rozario was recognised for her two gold medals (T54 marathon and T53 800m) and her bronze medal (T54 1500m) at last year's delayed Tokyo Olympic Games. ""When you think about what the award actually means, it's outside of just performance,"" de Rozario told ABC Sport. ""And I think of the individuals that make up this Paralympic team. It is the absolute highest privilege."" Tudhope won the 2022 Award for his bronze-medal-winning performance at this year's Beijing Winter Paralympics in the snowboard cross SB-LL2. ""To bring a medal home, it just shows the hard work and dedication,"" he told ABC Sport. ""It just shows that everything can be possible, and you just need to put your mind and body to it, and nothing can stop you. ""I can't wait to keep on going now, and I'm only hungry for more."" De Rozario made her Paralympic debut as a 14-year-old in Beijing 2008, and by the time Tokyo 2020 finally came around in 2021, she was ready to peak. She won her first Paralympic gold medal in the 800m, but the marathon was the ultimate prize where produced a breathtaking finish to become the first Australian woman to win over the distance. ""The last moments of a race, you almost hand the reins over to your body, you're like, 'You know what you're doing',"" she said. ""And, so, when you cross that line, it's a bit of a bizarre out-of-body experience. ""So this is unreal. I look at this team and I genuinely love them so much. This is a family to me and I've grown up in this world."" De Rozario is one of the most well-known athletes in the Australian Paralympic team, and is embracing her status as a role model. ""Being recognised is one thing, but to understand the responsibility that comes with the platform that you have with an acknowledgement like this is unreal. And, I think, that's something that I definitely take incredibly seriously."" It was the bronze medal that felt every bit like gold for Tudhope in Beijing. Like de Rozario, he started his Paralympic journey as a 14-year-old, at the 2014 Sochi Games, where he even earned the honour of carrying the Australian flag at the closing ceremony after an incredible top-10 finish. He went to Beijing as the co-captain of the Australian team, still only 22-years-old, and the brightest medal prospect. He trailed the four-man field for most of the snowboard cross big final, but surged home at the finish to pinch the bronze. One of the enduring images of the Games came when he embraced Finland's gold medallist Matti Suur-Hamari and Canada's Alex Massie. The trio is known as ""team unicorn"", and have a special bond as the only snowboarders from their respective countries. ""And I'm so glad I had those boys with me because I truly could not get this done and go to Beijing without the support from my team,"" Tudhope said. ""We went through some really hard times together with one of our coaches passing away and that was a very sad, gruelling moment. ""But we knew from his passing, we had a job to keep on going because he will be the first person, Mikko [Wendelin], to tell us not to stop. ""And, so, it was really special to be at Beijing because it was the first Games I actually wasn't just snowboarding for me. I was snowboarding for everyone who got me to there and I really got motivation and encouragement from everyone around me."" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. One of the biggest cheers of the night was for seven-time Paralympian, and Australia's Summer co-captain, Danni Di Toro, who won the President's Award for respect, honour, fairness, modesty and integrity. Curtis McGrath was named 2020 male athlete of the year for his two gold medals in the para-canoe in Tokyo, while de Rozario's mentor, Louise Sauvage, was coach of the year. Five athletes were inducted into the hall of fame: Priya Cooper (swimming), Kurt Fearnley (athletics), Libby Kosmala (shooting), Michael Milton (alpine skiing) and Matt Cowdrey (swimming).

173,Australia spun out in Colombo as Sri Lanka clinches ODI series,sport," Sport Sri Lanka beats Australia by four runs in Colombo to clinch ODI series 3-1 with a game to play Australia's looming challenge of ""extreme"" turning Sri Lankan Test wickets has been laid bare, after being spun out of the one-day series with a four-run defeat in Colombo. Chasing 259, David Warner played a lone hand with 99 as Australia capitulated from 4-189 in the 36th over to be all out for 254 and down 3-1 in the five-match series. The margin could also have been far worse, if not for Pat Cummins's 35 and Matthew Kuhnemann scoring 14 from the final over off Dasun Shanaka before being caught in the ring on the final ball. But it couldn't paper over Australia's uphill battle against spin. Seven wickets fell to the slower bowlers, as Sri Lanka played five turners and sent down 43 overs from them on a used wicket that spun well into the night. Just over a week out from the first Test in Galle, the hosts' win will likely confirm the blueprint on how they plan to beat Australia in the red-ball format. Legspinner Jeffrey Vandersay took 2-40, offspinner Dhananjaya de Silva 2-39 and mystery spinner Maheesh Theekshana 1-40. Warner meanwhile had looked in control after Aaron Finch (0), Mitch Marsh (26), Marnus Labuschagne (14) and Alex Carey (19) all came and went. The opener was cagey in the early overs, before taking on Theekshana. He hit 12 boundaries in his knock, going hard through the covers and driving superbly. And when he reached 99 Warner looked almost certain to end the longest century drought of his international career, which now sits at 48 innings across all formats. But the match then swung violently in Sri Lanka's favour, handing them their first bilateral one-day series win over Australia at home since 1992. With Warner at the non-striker's end, Travis Head (27) was bowled by Dhananjaya, before Glenn Maxwell was trapped lbw by Theekshana next over. And when Warner finally got back on strike, Dhananjaya drew him off balance and beat his outside edge to have him stumped. Cameron Green followed shortly after, before Cummins (35) and Kuhnemann's late efforts. The collapse will no doubt have evoked memories of the 2016 Test tour for the locals, when Australia struggled to combat the spin in the 3-0 series loss. ""This is extreme spin; you don't usually see these type of wickets,"" Warner said. ""You only see them here. India is completely different. They don't turn like that. They're actually good wickets. And they turn later on day three or four (of Tests). ""So everyone has to prepare as well as they can. It's about being busy. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""It's about committing. ""It's about batting long periods of time. And unfortunately, in the subcontinent, one little mistake will cost you."" The good news for Australia on Tuesday was that their two best players from 2016 are returning to fitness, with Mitchell Starc and Steve Smith both sighted in the nets with a red ball after finger and quad injuries. Cummins also bowled nicely on field, taking 2-37 and unlucky not to have another wicket early when he hit Charith Asalanka's leg stump with the left-hander on one. However the bail did not fall off, allowing Asalanka to lead Sri Lanka from 3-34 to 258 with his maiden international century of 110 from 106 balls.

174,Sri Lanka produces record chase as Australians beaten in third ODI match,sport," Sport Sri Lanka beats Australia by six wickets in Colombo to take a 2-1 lead in the ODI series The Australian team insist they didn't err by going without a frontline leg-spinner after weathering a six-wicket defeat by a record-breaking Sri Lanka stand in Colombo. Australia looked in the box seat after Travis Head helped them to 6-291 on a slow wicket, before the hosts (4-292) were barely troubled completing their pursuit, with nine balls to spare, on Sunday. Pathum Nissanka hit his maiden ODI century, with 137 in the chase, while Kusal Mendis managed 87 in a 170-run second-wicket stand between the pair before retiring, hurt, with cramp. That helped Sri Lanka to their biggest-ever chase against Australia, as they went 2-1 up in the five-match series with back-to-back wins over the tourists for the first time in 20 years. However, beyond this bilateral series, bigger questions continue to remain around Australia's bowling structure ahead of next year's World Cup in India. With Adam Zampa back home on paternity leave, Australia decided not to play Mitchell Swepson. They were also not helped by a dewy surface, at night, after initially winning the toss and batting, as the pitch sped up and turned less in the second innings. Matthew Kuhnemann (0-61 from 10 overs) and Glenn Maxwell (1-44) were left as Australia's chief spinners, with Cameron Green (0-31 off five overs) preferred as a pace-bowling all-rounder ahead of Swepson. Where the Sri Lankans were able to get great purchase out of their wrist-spinner, Jeffrey Vanderlay, and his return of 3-49, the tourists were forced to turn to Marnus Labuschagne (0-49) for seven overs of leg breaks. ""You can always look back at a lot of decisions and wonder what was the right one,"" captain Aaron Finch said. ""We still felt that was the right combination to go for on this wicket with how slow it looked. ""You saw in the first half of the game it was very stoppy and turned quite a bit. We thought it would continue to do that but it played a bit better under lights."" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Swepson's absence also calls into question whether Australian officials will persist with him in the Test team as a second spinner to Nathan Lyon on turning wickets. Albeit in a different format, Swepson has now played just one of the first three ODIs, with Tanveer Sangha the only other real fit red-ball option on the tour. Pat Cummins was also rested in Sunday's loss, as Josh Hazlewood and Jhye Richardson bowled tightly but struggled to have pressure built around them. After Maxwell got the only early wicket of Niroshan Dickwella for 25, Hazlewood (1-57) and Richardson (2-39) caused the only other minor damage late. However, by then, the game was gone thanks to Nissanka. The right-hander was brilliant though, producing the shot of the innings when he advanced at Hazlewood and hit him over mid-wicket for six. He also slog-swept Maxwell for another big six and finished with 11 other boundaries before falling to Richardson with seven needed. Head had earlier continued his fine form with the bat, hitting an unbeaten 70 from 65 balls just a week after whacking a century for Australia A. With Steve Smith out and nursing a minor quad strain, Aaron Finch scored 62 and Alex Carey 49 as Australia had to grit and fight their way to a decent total.

175,WACA employed paedophile junior coaching co-ordinator for 29 years,sport," Sport WACA employed paedophile junior coaching co-ordinator Roy Wenlock for 29 years The Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA) created a job for a now-notorious paedophile who subsequently worked for the organisation for 29 years between 1979 and 2007, the WACA has confirmed. WARNING: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse. Roy Wenlock, for whom the WACA created the full-time role of 'development officer' in 1979, was one of three sex offenders investigated in WA Supreme Court Justice Peter Blaxell's 452-page parliamentary inquiry into historical child sexual abuse at Anglican hostels, published in 2012. WACA chief executive Christina Matthews confirmed to ABC Sport that the organisation became aware of Wenlock's offending during the 2012-13 summer and has since taken a range of measures to address the issue, which is the subject of ongoing civil litigation against the WACA. In Justice Blaxell's report, Wenlock, who died in 2007, was revealed to have been a prolific abuser who gained sexual gratification from ""wrestling"" sessions — simulated sex in which Wenlock would ejaculate — with boys placed in his care between 1963 and 1977. In some cases, Wenlock's offending escalated to masturbation and oral sex with the boys. Blaxell's report was also unequivocal in its conclusion that Wenlock's grooming and abuse of boys continued at the WACA. One of those boys, now a man in his mid-40s, confirmed to ABC Sport that while performing WACA ""drinks boy"" duties under Wenlock's direction in the late 1980s, he was taken back to Wenlock's house with other boys and witnessed abuse. Between 1979 and 2007, Wenlock fulfilled a range of roles at the WACA, most of which gave him unsupervised access to children. For decades, he was the organisation's full-time development officer, conducting junior coaching clinics around the state, and also served as WACA ground announcer, museum curator, and as a WACA pennant umpire. He also umpired in junior competitions and was secretary of the Western Australian Youth Cricket Council. In 2000, Wenlock received the Australian Sports Medal for services to cricket. In 2012, Justice Blaxell concluded there was ""ample evidence to show that Wenlock would engage in grooming behaviour"" with boys he encountered across his four decades at the WACA. ""In this position he was required to engage in various cricketing activities with young teenagers, and he would sometimes invite individual boys back to his home,"" Blaxell wrote. There, Wenlock would ""encourage them to engage in 'wrestling'. The reputation that Wenlock acquired as a result of these activities was such that young cricketers would warn their friends: 'whatever you do, don't go to his house'."" 'Darren' (not his real name) was not aware of Justice Blaxell's findings when he spoke to ABC Sport, but he was among the boys who were taken from the WACA to Wenlock's house and says what he saw there mirrored the experiences of witnesses in the inquiry. In 1989, when Darren was in his early teens, Wenlock selected Darren and a male school friend to perform ""drinks boy"" duties for a Sheffield Shield game at the WACA ground. Darren said he was excited because the fixture in question — Western Australia vs New South Wales — featured Darren's idols, the Waugh brothers. ""My mate had done it previously,"" Darren told ABC Sport. ""I thought, 'This will be awesome'. I was excited because it meant we got to take food into the change rooms for the players and take turns to take the drinks out. It was really cool."" Darren said his discomfort started after play. Wenlock had arranged with parents that Darren, his friend and a few other boys would not be picked up from the WACA, but from Wenlock's house after a swim and some icy poles. At the house, Darren said, Wenlock encouraged the boys to wrestle him, something that struck Darren as ""so unusual and weird"" that he declined Wenlock's invitation. Darren said other boys did wrestle Wenlock. ""I found it quite confronting,"" he said. ""And it went on for quite a while."" Darren said that in his eagerness to meet more of his heroes, he volunteered for another day as a drinks boy, but he declined a second invite to Wenlock's house and resolved not to do the job again. ""I was uncomfortable with what was happening,"" he said. ""I can visualise it, and the feeling I associate with what I saw was that it was very uncomfortable."" Roy Hamilton Wenlock was once a ubiquitous and sometimes divisive figure in Western Australian cricket. As an umpire in the elite WACA competition, Wenlock was unpopular with players, who thought he was out of his depth and reliant on WACA support for ongoing selection. Regardless, in 1995 Wenlock was made a life member of the Western Australian Cricket Umpires' Association and remains so. Among colleagues in the WACA administration, Wenlock was considered gruff and strange, but the organisation valued his enthusiasm to take on duties others wouldn't, particularly the creation and administration of junior cricket programs and Wenlock's curation of the memorabilia collection that became the WACA museum. Following Wenlock's death at 75 in 2007, tributes in the WACA annual report described him as the ""spiritual father"" and ""inspiration"" of the museum and, and on account of his ground announcing duties, one of the WACA's ""most recognisable voices, if not faces"". A former bank clerk whose rise to prominence in elite cricket belied his self-confessed inability to play the game, Wenlock's parallel life as an abuser of boys is most extensively documented between 1963 and late 1977, when he served as a warden at St Christopher's House, the residential hostel at Northam High School. It is likely that Wenlock came to the attention of his eventual bosses at the WACA during his years as president of the Northam Cricket Association, for whom he administered a junior competition too, becoming a life member. ""The WACA created a new position of Development Officer in 1979 and encouraged Roy to apply,"" read his WACA obituary. ""He was successful and became an integral part of the administration."" Initially, Wenlock's wages were partly subsidised by the Western Australian government. ""He arranged coaching trips to the North West, pre-season cricket camps for umpires, and was unofficial collector and guardian of cricket trophies and photos that were often given to him. In 1983 he was appointed as the ground announcer at the WACA on match days. This caused him to curtail his umpiring ambitions."" But Wenlock, who had not faced police charges at the time of his death, gained greater notoriety posthumously, admonished by his former employers at the Anglican Church for the ""depravity"" of his offending against boys placed in his care. Wenlock's activities were described by an Archbishop as ""abhorrent – exploitative and abusive – and a gross breach of trust."" In the Anglican hostels inquiry, one former St Christopher's House pupil described Roy Wenlock as ""a powerful man with an intimidating presence … calculated and cunning… someone that you could never say 'no' to."" ""Whatever he said you had to do, or you knew there would be consequences."" The consequences were a range of sadistic punishment rituals, including violent canings that left at least one boy with a disfigured finger. But it was a practice of Wenlock's that became known among boys as ""bruting"" that caused the greatest damage. For 'bruting' sessions, Wenlock would invite boys to his private flat on the hostel's grounds for what Justice Blaxwell called ""the same bizarre and ritualistic form of physical contact which the boys had to perform for Wenlock's sexual pleasure."" The boys were forced to strip to their underpants and Wenlock usually did too, with one or the other often wearing leopard skin underpants or bathers provided by Wenlock. The pretence of 'wrestling' ended with Wenlock on his back on the floor, forcing the boy to straddle his pelvic area so the boy's buttocks were resting on his groin. Blaxwell explained: ""Wenlock would bounce around and pretend to try to buck the boy off while at the same time continuously moaning and repeating the words: 'you brute', 'you brute'."" ""The effect of this was that the boy's anal area would bump and grind against Wenlock's groin. Some former students distinctly recall Wenlock's erect penis rubbing against their bodies and of him ejaculating as a result."" The inquiry heard that boys endured these ordeals for up to two hours at a time. Some of the 18 men who gave evidence said they experienced the abuse only once, but one witness suffered the assaults on a weekly basis for his entire five years at the hostel. Others detailed feelings of disgust and shame in the aftermath. Evidence was also heard of graver assaults than the 'bruting' sessions. Wenlock plied one boy with alcohol and groped his genitals. Another boy was forced to masturbate Wenlock, abuse that escalated to oral sex and being forced into 'wrestling' sessions as an unidentified priest watched. Multiple students made complaints about Wenlock between 1975 and 1977, with one boy's story briefly attracting the attention of police, but their investigations amounted to nothing. In the inquiry, Justice Blaxell's harshest assessment was of then-St Christopher's board chairman and Archdeacon (later Bishop) Michael Challen who, in 1977, politely asked Wenlock to resign and offered the abuser ""effectively a glowing reference"", rather than sacking him and making it clear to prospective employers that Wenlock should not be given a job that put him in contact with children. Blaxell concluded that Challen's decision ""revealed a questionable sense of moral priorities for a clergyman."" ""By allowing him to leave 'quietly' they gave a higher priority to the reputation of the Hostel than to any concern for the future wellbeing of teenage boys with whom Wenlock might come into contact,"" Blaxell wrote. ""By these actions Bishop Challen increased the prospects that Wenlock would be able to sexually misconduct himself with young males in a similar fashion again."" WACA chief executive Christina Matthews told ABC Sport that the organisation has taken several measures to address its historical child sexual abuse problems and assured survivors they would be supported if they reported their abuse. ""I encourage anyone that has experienced any form of abuse when they have been involved in WACA programs to come forward and we will deal with it openly and honestly,"" Matthews said. The WACA is the only one of Australian cricket's powerful state associations to have signed up to the National Redress Scheme in response to the Royal Commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. Matthews said the WACA joined the scheme willingly and immediately, and that one survivor of Wenlock's abuse has already had his claim processed and approved. Matthews said the WACA first became aware of Wenlock's history during the 2012-13 summer, when a survivor approached the organisation to raise awareness and ensure child protection measures that had been lacking in the past were now in place.

""We reviewed our practices and became what you would probably call more aware of some of the dubious things these people do and how to prevent them,"" Matthews said. ""At the same time, child protection regulations were changing, so it all blended into that."" In recent months, former WACA staff who were colleagues of Wenlock told ABC Sport they'd been interviewed by lawyers acting for the WACA and asked for their recollections of Wenlock. Matthews confirmed that the WACA appointed external legal counsel in June 2021, in response to civil litigation being launched by a survivor of abuse by Wenlock. That case has not yet been resolved. ""Our position has always been to not hide from these things, and to try and make the process as less painful as possible for the victim,"" Matthews said. ""You've got to deal with the truth.""

176,Injury scare for Steve Smith as Sri Lanka defeats Australia second ODI,sport," Sport Injury scare for Steve Smith as Sri Lanka defeats Australia in second ODI in Pallekele Australia will be sweating on the fitness of Steve Smith after the star batsman appeared to tweak a leg muscle during the tourists' 26-run ODI loss to Sri Lanka. Chasing 216 for victory off 43 overs under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method on Thursday (local time), Australia was on track at 5-170, with Glenn Maxwell in hot form at Pallekele. But Maxwell's departure for 30 off 25 balls and the run-out of Alex Carey (15) sparked a collapse of 5-19 as Australia was bowled out for 189 in 37.1 overs. Sri Lanka had posted 9-220 in 47.4 overs before a rain delay of more than two hours halted proceedings. The home side's fighting victory levelled the five-match series at 1-1. Sri Lanka paceman Chamika Karunaratne was the hero with 3-47, snaring the key scalps of Smith and Maxwell to go with his run-out of Carey. Smith called for medical attention after pulling up lame while pushing hard for a second run during Australia's run chase. The 33-year-old received strapping to his left thigh area, and was able to bat on. Smith was dismissed a few overs later for 28. A two-Test series against Sri Lanka starts on June 29. Australia has endured a horror run with injuries during the tour, with Ashton Agar (side), Marcus Stoinis (side), Sean Abbott (finger), Kane Richardson (hamstring), Mitchell Starc (finger) and Mitch Marsh (hamstring) all injured. Stoinis, Abbott and Richardson have already been sent home, while Agar is no guarantee to play again on tour. ""I'm definitely not playing any more of the one-dayers,"" Agar said. ""I've got a bit of a tear in my side, which isn't great. ""Hopefully, maybe around the second Test match (I can return), being optimistic."" Agar's injury had a silver lining, with debutant spinner Matthew Kuhnemann proving he will be more than a handy back-up ahead of next year's ODI World Cup in India. Kuhnemann snared 2-48 off 10 overs in an impressive ODI debut, with the left-armer adapting to the conditions expertly. Mitchell Swepson struggled at times in just his third ODI appearance, finishing with 1-58 off his 10 overs. Maxwell was full of smiles on the way to 2-35 off 10 overs, while pace aces Pat Cummins (4-35 off 8.4 overs) and Josh Hazlewood (0-26 off seven) were at their impressive best. But it was the performance of Kuhnemann that would have given the national selectors the biggest satisfaction given the need for spinning depth at the 2023 ODI World Cup. ""We were on our way to get on the team bus for the Aussie A squad,"" Kuhnemann explained of his call-up. ""I got a tap on the shoulder from the selector on tour, and he told myself and [Travis] Head to pack our bags and get to Kandy as soon as possible. ""It's been pretty crazy. Pretty overwhelmed at the moment. ""I was so nervous. When Finchy told me I was going to open the bowling alongside Josh, I didn't know what to expect.""

177,"Melbourne vs Brisbane was supposed to be a battle of contenders, but only one team looked like premiership material",sport," Sport Melbourne reaffirm their status as premiership favourites with 64-point belting of Brisbane Melbourne have rediscovered their mojo in a 64-point hammering of Brisbane that has re-established the reigning premiers as this year's AFL flag favourites. The Demons triumphed 16.21 (117) to 7.11 (53) at the MCG on Thursday night, snapping a three-game losing streak and displacing the Lions at the top of the ladder in the process. Steven May had mixed results on return from his club-imposed suspension when he blunted Brisbane spearhead Joe Daniher but made a few costly errors, especially with ball in hand. Just about everything else went the Demons' way as they laid the victory platform with a destructive six-goals-to-one second term, having trailed at quarter-time for just the second time this season. Melbourne won contested possession in a landslide (170-133) — a repeat of last year's qualifying final dominance over the Lions — and got on top of their opponents at stoppages (35-21). Clayton Oliver (35 disposals, 12 clearances), Christian Petracca (31, eight) and Jack Viney (34, eight) gave the Demons control in the midfield, where young ruckman Luke Jackson stepped up in place of injured skipper Max Gawn. James Harmes put the clamps on Lachie Neale, restricting the Brisbane ball-magnet to eight disposals during the middle two quarters, and Jake Lever starred in defence with 15 intercepts. Bayley Fritsch kicked three goals and four Demons — Toby Bedford, James Jordon, Kysaiah Pickett and Harmes — booted two each. The Lions had no clear individual winners in their heaviest loss of the season after three previous defeats by a combined 29 points. Hugh McCluggage, Daniel Rich, Harris Andrews and ruckman Oscar McInerney fought against the tide, while Mitch Robinson and Eric Hipwood finished with two goals each. Andrews (shoulder) and Rich (shin) required treatment on injuries but played out the match, while Jarryd Lyons (ribs) was eventually substituted out after being crunched in a second-quarter marking contest with Fritsch. The result extended the Lions' barren run at the MCG, where they last won in 2014 and have now lost 10 consecutive matches. May was back for his first appearance since round 11, when he suffered concussion, and looked shaky early but worked his way into the game. He put teammate Angus Brayshaw under pressure with a handpass that led to Brisbane's first goal and gave up another when he infringed on Daniher in a marking contest. It was the only major Daniher (1.3) kicked from his nine disposals. May's turnover by foot in the second term led to a Robinson goal, which ended a run of five straight for Melbourne. It was only a slight blip for the home side, who were firmly in control by half-time.

178,"analysis: How going without a ruck is helping Port move the ball, and why it might impact the rest of the league",sport," Sport Inside the game: How Port Adelaide's could change the game with their no-ruck approach Heading into Round 12 Port Adelaide was at a crossroads. A top four fancy at the start of the year, and minor premiers just two years ago, the Power were stuck in the lower ranges of the ladder and struggled to both effectively win the ball, and move it when they had it in hand. They had also been caught out by Essendon in the wet the week before. Before the team selections were made, coach Ken Hinkley hinted to the media that they would play smaller rather than taller, with a wry grin on his face. By that stage, Hinkley had decided to go into the game without a true ruck. Instead, forwards Jeremy Finlayson, Charlie Dixon and midfielder Sam Powell-Pepper shouldered the load against Richmond. While they lost the game, they did win the clearance battle in the middle. Port's ruckless experiment is far from the first foray into this space. Sydney legend Adam Goodes won a Brownlow Medal in the ruck, but in practice operated more like a supersized midfielder, beating lumbering bigs on the ground. At 191cm he tended to lose the hitout battle, but outworked his direct opponent around the ground. But using an undersized second ruck option is different to being completely undersized. So how can teams get away without picking a true ruck? Going small when others go tall isn't unique to footy. In fact, the world just got a reminder of the most prominent current version when the Golden State Warriors took their fourth NBA title in eight years, thanks in part to their ""death lineup"". The death lineup features the 6'6"" defensive maestro Draymond Green at centre, running his far taller opponents off the floor while protecting the paint. In the AFL the theory is similar. Going small gives you a speed advantage, at the expense of potency in the air. It's what Hinkley hinted at when he suggested playing without a ruck against Richmond. ""We're really pleased with the end result. To be fair, we ended up winning clearances so it's a pretty good performance by our midfield group collectively to be able to,"" Hinkley told reporters after the game. ""Because we got beat in hitouts — which we knew that was going to be on the cards with us. So we managed that really well I thought."" Port managed just 18 hitouts to 41 from the Toby Nankervis led Richmond across the game. Crucially, Port was able to win the clearance battle, reading the hitouts more effectively than their counterparts. Port's makeshift rucks fought hard to limit where Richmond could effectively direct hitouts. Port's rucks used their body positioning to effectively deny easy access to the ball. Around the ground, Port looked more attacking than they had in weeks, speeding the game up. While they narrowly lost, they looked re-energised. Last week against Sydney, Port shifted up a step further. After an injury to first game ruck Brynn Teakle early in the game, the Power were forced to go ruckless again. The move helped take the game away from the Swans. The ability for the Power rucks to contest and compete around the ground frustrated Sydney ruck Peter Ladhams, with the Swans' big lashing out during the game. The extra mobility of the Power presented open taller targets around the ground, critical against a Swans side that can be left exposed on the counter attacks. Despite giving up raw height to Sydney, they gained in being able to use what height they had. For most of the year, Port has been the worst team in the league in terms of centre clearance scoring differential. However, when they went ruckless the Power were able to largely nullify their opponents from the middle, and broke even in the contests. Hinkley's decision to shift to a ruckless strategy wasn't without precedent. In 2018, an early injury crisis at the club left it without any fit and mature rucks. That spell of ruckless play saw them win three of five games, likely helping Port's ability to adapt and Hinkley's willingness to experiment. The Power aren't the only side who have had to resort to going ruck free this year, and aren't the only side to succeed while doing so. When both Rowan Marshall and Jack Hayes were injured late in the game against GWS on the big stage of Friday night footy in Canberra, the Saints' narrow 15 point lead looked vulnerable against the two headed ruck hydra of Matt Flynn and Braydon Pruess. For a side looking to prove itself worthy of the top four, holding the ground in the middle would be key to winning the game. In the last quarter the Giants were able to win 31 of 32 hitouts largely through Pruess. Normally, this would indicate that GWS would be able to dominate first possession, and the rest of the contest. Instead, St Kilda won first disposal 17 times of those 32, effectively limiting their biggest advantage. ""It's interesting around the ball sometimes. Sometimes when you actually lose the hitouts by that much you're not worrying about your bloke,"" St Kilda coach Brett Ratten told the ABC after the game. ""You're not watching what your bloke's doing. You're just watching the opposition. So we have then three onballers and other players around who are just scanning him and what he does so they're not getting caught up in this 'we win one, they win one'. So it's all the focus on just watching their ruckman."" With Pruess playing just his third game at the Giants, that important ruck-midfield combination was absent when it was needed most. Late in the game Pruess and Flynn were relying on taps to the feet of the contest or big punches forward, often with little variation. Some clubs utilise calls to specific players in stoppages, others to zones. Whatever method GWS used on that Friday night, St Kilda decoded it easily. The Saints set up well on the defensive side of the stoppage, limiting the damage that the Giants could do even if they got a touch on the ball first. The mobile St Kilda bigs were also able to outwork the taller Pruess around the ground, and at the foot of the contest. Ratten commended Josh Battle and his ability to outwork the Giants' bigs at ground level after the game. Despite losing the battle in the air, Battle won the war on the ground — and more importantly the Saints won the game. Generally speaking, winning the hitouts does not particularly suggest winning the match. Since the introduction of ruck nominations in 2017, winning a lot of hitouts has often been as useful as winning very few of them. Teams have become better at knowing how to compete despite losing the aerial battle. Winning clearances, however, has a more considerable impact. The first touch in the ruck is far less useful than the first real use of the ball, which often dictates the pace and direction of play. It may be widely understood that raw hitouts don't represent the midfield battle, but even an edge in hitouts to advantage in a match has only a loose relationship with clearance effectiveness. Winning hitouts and clearances don't always go hand in hand, but a good ruck and midfield group have some small edge in turning the former into the latter. Some sides base significant parts of their game around winning the contest. Last year the Suns were without captain Jarrod Witts for most of the season, robbing the team of a big part of their identity. While the Suns had some strong weeks, they largely struggled without their talisman. Melbourne, absent Max Gawn in the coming weeks, faces a similar challenge. Going ruckless seems to work best in a few situations. It seems to work well as a surprise tactic, especially in wetter conditions. This surprise factor can also help a makeshift ruck after an in-game injury. Ruckless sides seem to have a real mobility advantage against slower primary rucks, and where they have ample other tall targets around the ground. The best tap rucks present the biggest challenge to the strategy, as do the most mobile traditional rucks. If Port continues to experiment in the ruck, and keeps rising up the ladder, a new approach to rucking in the AFL could be on the horizon.

Footage emerged on social media last week of De Goey, who was given permission by the club to travel to Bali on his mid-season break, making crude gestures while at a nightclub. The fine is suspended through to the end of the season and dependent on good behaviour. De Goey will also ""undertake further behavioural education"" in addition to an existing counselling program, but has avoided any suspension from playing duties. Collingwood have also put contract talks with the 26-year-old, who is entering free agency, on hold until season's end. ""The actions shown in the video footage are disrespectful and I accept that I have betrayed the trust the club showed in me by allowing me to take my mid-season break overseas,"" De Goey said in a statement on Wednesday. ""My actions have fallen short of the standards expected of me as a person, as an AFL footballer and as a representative of Collingwood. ""I had worked hard this year to establish trust and confidence in me to make better decisions and through no-one's fault but my own, I have undone that trust. ""Again, I apologise for my disrespectful conduct. I understand that I have let many people down and that I have much work to do to again rebuild trust."" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. The 26-year-old's statement was in stark contrast to his initial response via Instagram, where he had lamented ""persecution"" of athletes by the media. Collingwood chief executive Mark Anderson condemned De Goey's actions as demonstrating disrespect towards women. He was particularly dismayed by vision of De Goey pulling at a woman's top, almost exposing her breast. The Bali incident comes after De Goey was stood down by Collingwood last October when he was arrested for a drunken incident at a New York nightclub. Anderson also said on Wednesday that De Goey would speak in the next couple of days, but it is unclear whether this will now happen given the player is on leave. The AFL said Collingwood had ""handled the matter appropriately"" and the league wouldn't take further action against De Goey, while condemning his behaviour as setting a bad example.

181,Best of five on the line when New South Wales meet Queensland in the women's State of Origin,sport," Sport History is on the line when New South Wales meet Queensland in the women's State of Origin clash In the final year of one-off women's Origin matches, and at two wins each for New South Wales and Queensland after four meetings, there's even more on the line than usual when the rivals meet in Canberra on Friday night. With the series expanding to two matches next year, a new era will begin for women's rugby league – but before that, old scores must be settled. Both sides have two wins each since 2018, and each win has come on home soil, so on the frozen tundra of Canberra Stadium, the closest thing to neutral ground in rugby league, they will fight for the right to say they're the best of this era. The game is a decider of sorts, five years in the making. For their part, the Blues are also hell-bent on snapping their two-game losing streak. ""It annoys me (when I think about it). I hate losing, so it hasn't been great. But we played in Queensland the last two years, I'm happy this is a bit closer to home soil,"" said New South Wales prop Millie Boyle. ""Everyone gets hungrier through each year you don't have that success. We know what it's like to win, but now we know what it's like to lose as well."" The Blues enter the match as favourites, due in part to the presence of Boyle and fellow NRLW Dally M winner Emma Tonegato at fullback. While Queensland boast quality in the backline, especially with custodian Tamika Upton and dangerous five-eighth Tarry Aiken, the arctic Canberra conditions should play into the Blues' power and yardage game with Boyle, Tonegato and star prop Simaima Taufa leading the charge. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter In such conditions, the kicking game will be crucial – the Maroons will once again look to Ali Brigginshaw, as fine a playmaker as the women's game has ever seen, to lead the charge while New South Wales will trust debutant halfback Rachael Pearson to run the show. Pearson, who enjoyed a brilliant debut NRLW season with the Dragons, has the biggest boot in the game and the Hay local will be looking to showcase it early and often at Canberra Stadium. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. She'll need to overcome any debutant jitters, but after appearing in St George Illawarra's run to the NRLW grand final Pearson believes she has the big game experience to get the job done. ""It was an emotional moment, when I found out I was debuting. I was excited and proud, getting the call from Kylie and hearing her say 'I want you to be my New South Wales halfback', what else can you say but 'I'd love to',"" Pearson said. ""Coming off the back of that NRLW season, it's been hectic and crazy but in a good way. I thought I was a good chance off the season I had, but getting the call was still so exciting. ""Just coming into the sheds and seeing 'Pearson' on the back of the jersey, I had tears in my eyes. It probably won't hit me all the way until I run out in Canberra. ""Sowie (Dragons coach Jamie Soward) said to me he can't wait for the switch to flick in my mind when I realise I'm the player who's supposed to be here. But I'm not a boastful person, I just want to take this opportunity and run with it.""

182,"analysis: Why it's time for Samoa, rugby league's sleeping giant, to awaken from its slumber",sport," Sport As Samoa looks to begin again, it's time for rugby league's sleeping giant to awaken The return of international rugby league after almost three years lost to COVID-19 has given everybody a fresh start, and nobody needs one more than the proud men from Samoa. On a weekend where their Pacific rivals Tonga will take on New Zealand in Auckland in what is a true clash of two Test footy titans, Samoa will once again be trying to start something up when they face the Cook Islands on Saturday in Campbelltown. There is a path where Samoa end up joining Tonga alongside Australia, New Zealand and England as one of the sport's top level sides – but for it to happen, rugby league's sleeping giant will need to awaken. And with Samoa playing host nation England in the World Cup opener at season's end, there is no better time than right now for the tide to turn. ""You just have to see what the Tongans have done for their team to see what footy means in the Pacific. We want to do the jersey proud, Samoa is a proud nation and we want to play well for them,"" said halfback Anthony Milford. ""It's a special week. I'm always honoured to put the jersey on and I'm always grateful for the opportunity given to me by (coach) Matty Parish and the coaching staff. I can't wait to represent my people and my family."" Tonga is blessed with an extraordinary crop of talent, headed by Jason Taumalolo. But how does international rugby league's newest powerhouse turn that into a sustainable future? The pandemic years have not been easy for Samoan rugby league, and nor were the seasons that came beforehand. As Tonga shot ahead in the pecking order, the Samoans stagnated. They've won just one of their last nine matches, the last time they troubled one of the big three was back in the 2014 Four Nations, and their last showing was a disaster, a 44-18 belting at the hands of Fiji in November 2019. Over the past few years there's also been bitter backroom infighting with long-time coach Parish coming under fire from players past and present. But Parish, who has coached the side since 2013, survived and has been blessed with a strong crop of up-and-coming talent, even though Samoa is yet to enjoy a Jason Taumalolo-style wave of defections. For Milford, Samoa's longest-serving player after he debuted as an 18-year old nine years ago, this is the biggest change he's seen during his time with the island nation. ""When I first came through I was the youngest, now I'm the last one left from that 2013 World Cup,"" said Milford. ""There's good times ahead, a lot of youth who are putting guys on their toes. It's a luxury, to have that competition and Matty can pick so many top players. ""It makes our nation stronger and harder to play against."" A host of debutants, led by a Penrith contingent of Charlie Staines, Taylan May, Izack Tago and Spencer Leniu, as well as Manly backrower Josh Schuster, can bring about a new dawn for Samoa, who are heavily favoured to dispatch the Cook Islands in quick time. A thumping, feel-good win could be just what the side needs for a reboot, which could make the call of home and history, of family and heritage almost impossible to ignore for some of the game's biggest names. Because it will be away from Campbelltown, across the desert in Perth and over the sea in Auckland, where the best Samoan players in the world will be plying their trade this weekend. Brian To'o, Jarome Luai, Tino Fa'asuamaleaui, Josh Papalii and Junior Paulo, who have all worn Samoan blue before, will play Origin on Sunday night. So will Stephen Crichton and Payne Haas, who are eligible, as is rising star Joseph Suaalii who forms part of the extended New South Wales squad. In Auckland, Samoan graduates Isaiah Papali'i, Ronaldo Mulitalo and Moses Leota will wear the black and white of New Zealand, and so will man mountain Nelson Asofa-Solomona, another player of Samoan descent. It's asking a lot, for them to give up Origin jerseys and Kangaroo and Kiwis spots - landing all of them for the World Cup is unrealistic in the extreme, and Milford says that's not what Samoa are expecting. They'll back their people no matter what they choose. ""It can be hard, but a lot of those boys have been in camp before and know what it's like. I know they enjoyed being here,"" Milford said. ""It's up to them, whatever they choose, we'll support them, If they pick Australia, good on them, if they pick Samoa we'll always have a place for them."" But just imagine, for a moment, what it could be like if Samoa just landed a couple of them. They just need a few, because once they get one then more will follow. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Imagine if Suaalii, who is living up to his reputation as the game's best young player, plays for the land of his fathers, or if Luai and To'o join their Penrith brothers and ramp the Panthers vibe up another notch, or if Haas and Paulo trade one blue jersey for another and give Samoa a pack that can match anybody in the world. It's a lot to give up, and Samoa can be competitive regardless of landing those players or not. But they can aim higher than just competitive. There can be greatness in this team and in this jersey. There is a future where everybody comes home and Samoa like their chances against anybody, any time, anywhere. They just need something they can come back to. Something that Tonga has found but Samoa is still looking for. It won't happen overnight, but it can happen – and if it does, it can start against the Cook Islands on Saturday.

183,Will Brad Fittler's shock positional switch pay off in State of Origin II?,sport," Sport Will Api Koroisau's shock State of Origin start be the spark New South Wales need to save the series? As the newly minted New South Wales starting hooker, Api Koroisau admits he has big shoes to fill, replacing incumbent number nine Damien Cook. ""'Cookie' has done an amazing job and nobody is going to replace what he has done,"" Apisai Koroisau told ABC Sport. The Rabbitohs star has started as hooker for 13 consecutive State of Origin matches but will start from the bench for Game II after the Blues' shock loss in Sydney earlier this month. Koroisau doesn't want to get overwhelmed by the pressure, knowing he has to step up in Perth for New South Wales to keep their series hopes alive. ""To be honest I am trying not to think about it like that — at the end of the day it's just a job that needs to be done, it's not like we are doing anything too different or too crazy out there, it's the same thing we do every week,"" Koroisau said. Starting the Panthers rake in just his second Origin appearance is just one of seven big changes to coach Brad Fittler's side going into the must-win clash. Koroisau wants to prove he's worth the gamble, not by emulating Cook's style but by instead playing his own game to his own strengths. ""What I'll bring is maybe just a bit of a steady head, try and move us around the ruck a bit, a bit more energy there in that middle, I'll do my best and see what happens,"" Koroisau said. While the series opener was by no means a thumping defeat, Koroisau feels the Blues performance was far from good enough, saying there's plenty for the side to work on after the 16-10 defeat. ""Our ruck speed playing the ball, how slow it was for us and how quick it was for Queensland, so defensively we have to be a bit better and quicken up our attack,"" Koroisau said. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter ""Our supports were down as well so there's plenty of room for improvement."" In an effort to find that improvement, Fittler has taken a stern approach to his side's Perth preparations – calling his players into camp on Sunday night in Sydney and departing early on Monday morning for a full week of training. The Blues also won't break camp for a day, as they did before Game I, with the squad to stay together for the full seven days in the lead-up to the match on Sunday. It's a very different approach to Queensland's coach Billy Slater, who will arrive with his charges in Perth late on Thursday. Koroisau will be joined by his ex-panthers teammate Matt Burton, who will debut in the centres after Jack Wighton was ruled out due to contracting COVID-19. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""I'm over the moon, there's a lot of energy in the group, and I'm looking forward to the week,"" Burton told ABC Sport after his first session with the squad. ""The boys have been really good, they all got around me so it makes it a lot easier on me, looking forward to getting out there."" Burton is certain his experience with the Panthers, where he played a crucial role in the side's march to the 2021 premiership, will make all the difference for New South Wales as he attempts to brush off the pressure and keep the Blues on track for a fourth series win in five years. ""It obviously helps a lot, knowing those boys from last year, we have a few combinations there and I can't wait to use them,"" Burton said. ""You know the pressure is always there, but we are feeling confident going into the game.""

184,analysis: The NRLW is expanding at breakneck speed. Will women's rugby league be ready for the future?,sport," Sport The NRLW is set to radically expand in the next 12 months. But is women's rugby league ready for such rapid growth? The world of women's rugby league is changing faster and faster all the time. That's the thing about progress – it's a path that leads down a hill, so the further things go, the faster they get there. And women's rugby league is hurtling down the hill. Friday night will be the last time the State of Origin series is contested in a single match before it expands to two next year. After three new clubs joined the NRLW for 2022's first season the league, flush with success, fast-tracked expansion from two new teams for 2023 to four new sides, meaning the competition will have more than doubled in size in less than three years. Growing Origin is a no-brainer, but flooding the NRLW with new clubs is a more complex discussion, with some of the game's biggest names split on whether the league is ready for ten teams. ""It's nearly doubled with what we've got at the moment and we're already struggling to fill up those last few spots on the teams as is,"" Newcastle and New South Wales prop Millie Boyle said. ""I know the game is growing, I'm not sure if it's growing at the pace where they can put in those new teams."" Boyle, a member of the Rugby League Players Association women's advisory group, also takes issue with what she believes to be a lack of consultation from the NRL on the viability of such radical expansion. ""We're on there, but they're going to make their own decisions. I guess they'll say we're whinging whatever happens – 'they say we're not big enough, they say there's not enough teams, they say there's too many',"" Boyle said. ""We'll never be able to make everyone happy. They make the rules and you can't grow unless you grow. I thought it would be two teams, but it's not up to me. ""Four teams will be a big jump, I guess with the new marquee spots and the new CBA we'll spread girls out again and get them to new areas all over the country, especially down in Canberra and up in North Queensland."" When Sam Bremner announced she would take time away from rugby league to start a family, people treated it like a retirement. Now she's making her return to State of Origin after a four-year absence. The NRLW took four years to expand following it's launch in 2018, a slow-burn approach which ensured there was always enough elite-level talent to fill out the existing teams. It meant that when the league finally pulled the trigger on growing the game, they were able to spread out enough star players to ensure the new teams were competitive. Things didn't work out perfectly – Newcastle were winless in their first campaign – but every other team won at least two games and for the most part, matches were closely fought and competitive. Providing new avenues and pathways and growing the sport is important, but so is producing a high-quality product on the field. If the quality of play rises, as it did this year, it means better ratings, stronger crowds and increased interest from fans both old and new. It's easier to sell, which means more people will buy it. If there is more teams than there is talent there's a danger of scores blowing out and the competition losing it's lustre as the snake starts to eat it's tail. Given Canberra, Cronulla, North Queensland and Wests Tigers must all find enough players to fill out a competitive roster and given there was a winless side in a six-team league it's a fair question to ask if that will be possible. What will help matters is that each of the four clubs has a strong grassroots program – Cronulla and the Tigers have fielded teams in the NSW Women's Premiership since 2019, the Raiders have a Tarsha Gale Cup (Under 18s) side and the North Queensland Gold Stars, who will presumably provide many of the Cowboys players, won the Queensland Women's Premiership grand final earlier this month. Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletter And, as Blues veteran Sam Bremner points out, if there are more spots available it creates more opportunities for players to fill those spots, which should help grow participation. Bremner, who has played at the top level of women's rugby league since 2012 and has witnessed the game's transformation over the past decade first-hand, knows the old ""you can't be what you can't see"" adage still rings true. ""It is a really big jump, but the best thing that ever happened to women's rugby league was that we exposed it,"" Bremner said. ""I remember going to a school after we won the World Cup and they asked the kids 'hands up if you've ever heard of the Jillaroos' and one boy stood up and said 'yeah, I know them, they play hockey'. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""From then, we started exposing women's rugby league and all these girls started playing and I think having more opportunities are going to make girls think it's possible for them, and then the depth continues to grow. ""It is a really big leap, but I have faith we can fill those spots. It's an exciting time for women's rugby league. ""Girls can see us on TV and we say it all the time but it's true, you can't be what you can't see."" Regardless of how this new round of expansion goes, it's unlikely the NRLW will be slowing down. The NRL already wants to expand again - South Sydney want in for the 2024 season and Penrith are keen to field a team as soon as possible. Unless the four new sides are an unmitigated disaster, the game will keep flying down the hill until it either levels out or topples over. The careful, slow approach is over. Sometimes, if you wait until you're ready you never get ready at all, and the NRL has decided the future is coming and it's coming fast.

185,"World Rugby changes concussion protocols, with 12-day break to become the norm",sport," Sport World Rugby agrees to changes to concussion protocols, with 12-day break to become the norm The vast majority of elite-level rugby union players diagnosed with a concussion will not be able to return to play for 12 days as a result of changes being introduced by the sport's world governing body from July 1. World Rugby is following recommendations by an independent concussion working group after a review of the latest scientific evidence. The current regulations allow players who fail a head-injury assessment during a game to be back on the field seven days later if they follow return-to-play protocols. While that could still be the case for some, provided they get the approval of an independent concussion consultant, the majority will be out of the game for five more days. The updated criteria being used to judge how quickly players can return after showing obvious concussion symptoms now includes their history of concussions. These new criteria will be in place for next month's men's Test series that will feature match-ups including England v the Wallabies in Australia and Ireland v the All Blacks in New Zealand. They will also affect upcoming Wallaroos fixtures, with Australia due to take on New Zealand in two tests in August. ""It is going to be a new mindset for coaches and players,"" said World Rugby's chief medical officer Dr Éanna Falvey. ""Our approach means it is now overwhelmingly likely a player diagnosed with a concussion won't play in their team's next match. ""World Rugby firmly believes that scientific evidence supports our protocols, but we are continually monitoring and testing them to ensure that they are fit for the modern game. ""We recognise that there are differences in concussion symptoms and concussion history, and this process enables us to further protect elite players by individualising their rehabilitation. Kim Klomp competed in one of the nation's top football leagues in the 1980s and 1990s but, after he retired, he began suffering from depression and suspected something was wrong with his brain. ""It also keeps in place all the benefits of the previous protocols, which have been so successful in beginning to tackle under-reporting of symptoms, which evidence shows that, while improving, remains an issue."" The changes were also lauded by World Rugby chief executive Alan Gilpin. ""There are always going to be head impacts and there are always going to be concussions in rugby, so we are never going to eradicate that with the nature of the sport we have,"" Mr Gilpin said. ""But we want people comfortable that we have got a game that is safe to play at all levels and the sport is doing its best to protect and look after players' safety and welfare. ""We are making progress. There are lots of areas where we have advanced. You can never do too much in this area.""

186,Crusaders claim 11th Super Rugby title with dominant win over the Blues,sport," Sport Record-breaking Crusaders beat Blues in pulsating Super Rugby Pacific final in Auckland The Crusaders have dominated the ladder-topping Blues to win the Super Rugby Pacific final 21-7 at a sold-out Eden Park in Auckland. The powerhouse Christchurch-based franchise claimed a record-extending 11th Super Rugby crown as they snapped the Blues' 15-match winning streak with a ruthless display in wet and slippery conditions. Scrum half Bryn Hall and winger Sevu Reece scored tries either side of half time, while Richie Mo'unga ran the game with a brilliant display at fly half and contributed 11 points from the boot. The Blues, roared on by a big home crowd, were simply unable to get on the front foot and unleash their talented backs until it was too late. Scrum half Finlay Christie gave them a sniff of hope with an opportunist try in the 59th minute, but a defensive mix-up gifted Reece a score four minutes from time to put the result beyond doubt. It was a sixth straight title for the Crusaders under coach Scott Robertson after they won the last three editions of trans-continental Super Rugby and the domestic Super Rugby Aotearoa competition in the last two years. ""We've always talked about effort on both sides of the ball,"" said All Blacks lock and Crusaders veteran Sam Whitelock. ""It's not always about scoring points, sometimes it's about stopping them from scoring."" Super Rugby relaunched this year as a Pacific-focused championship, but the final result was the same as 10 of the 24 editions of the pre-COVID competition. On display were the steely defence, dominant set-piece, forwards who battle for every breakdown and backs who looked to attack at every opportunity that are in the DNA of the Christchurch-based dynasty. The Blues, dominant in the early years of the competition, had looked to usurp the Crusaders on the back of a high-octane attack but initially looked shell-shocked at the intensity of the contest. For all their domination of territory and possession in the opening half, the Crusaders had only a drop goal and penalty from Mo'unga to show for their efforts until just before the break. Leicester Fainga'anuku had earlier been held up over the line and the hulking winger was stopped just short when he launched himself at it again. Argentine flanker Pablo Matera was pushed back from close range but Hall cleverly dabbed the ball down for a try through a jumble of legs after an excellent ruck clean out by Whitelock, who was dominant in the loose and at the lineout, which the Crusaders dominated. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. It was a turnover from another fluffed Blues lineout that led to a Crusaders penalty which Mo'unga converted for a 16-0 lead after 46 minutes. Christie finally got the Blues on the board when he pounced on a loose ball at the back of a Crusaders scrum for a converted try that cut the deficit to 16-7, but even that was too steep a mountain to climb against the visiting defence. ""Tonight wasn't our night, we really weren't good enough,"" said Blues fly half Beauden Barrett. ""Really disappointing, we had a good season, we wanted to come here and do a job here tonight.

187,'They made us pay': Wallaroos surrender 10-0 lead to fall to Canada defeat,sport," Sport Wallaroos beaten in Pacific Four finale by Canada An undisciplined Wallaroos side has squandered a double-digit lead to lose 22-10 to Canada and finish winless in the Pacific Four Series. Australia finished the four-nation round robin tournament with one point at the bottom of the table. Two Canada tries in six minutes either side of half-time on Saturday turned the game around in wet conditions in Whangarei, New Zealand. A third try three minutes from full time gave the scoreboard a more realistic look as world number four ranked Canada dominated possession and territory. They had twice as many carries and eighth-ranked Australia had to make 100 more tackles and gave away 10 more penalties. Australia were down a player for the last eight minutes when reserve prop Madison Schuck was sin-binned, as referee Lauren Jenner finally lost patience after warning them for committing numerous infringements. ""We obviously came out very strong and in that second half we gave away too many penalties,"" Wallaroos captain and flanker Shannon Parry told Stan Sport. ""Canada is a quality team and they made us pay."" For the second time in the series, Australia couldn't hold on after leading 10-0 and conceded more than 20 straight points. The Wallaroos executed well from a lineout with hooker Ashley Marsters crashing over in the fourth minute from a rolling maul. Winger Lori Cramer converted and added a penalty to give Australia a 10-0 lead inside 13 minutes. However, they spent most of the rest of the half on the back foot and only dogged defence and some Canadian handling errors preserved the lead. Cramer held up Canada prop DaLeaka Menin over the line, but the gold defensive wall was finally breached just before the break, when Canada hooker Emily Tuttosi scored in identical fashion to Marsters. Captain and number 8 Sophie de Goede converted to ensure Australia held just a three-point lead at half time. Canada halfback Justine Pelletier scampered over the line early in the second half after de Goede detached from the back of a scrum. De Goede missed the conversion from in front, but Canada took control and Australia rarely threatened to score. Australia withstood a 23-phase passage, but Canada were subsequently awarded a close range penalty which De Goede converted in the 64th minute and reserve forward Alex Ellis scored their third try just before the end. ""Massive credit to Australia, especially in this rain that was super physical and they came out swinging,"" player of the match de Goede said. In the second half Australia struggled to maintain possession, fumbling on a number of occasions, as Canada continued to dominate. Back rower Grace Kemp, who made her debut off the bench, provided a rare second half highlight for the Australians with one barnstorming run. ""I think there's a lot to take away for a young group, we've really come together over this tour, even though we haven't got the results,"" Parry said. ""We've learnt a lot about ourselves, I think it will put us in good stead come World Cup towards the end of the year.""

188,Brumbies fall agonisingly short in thrilling Super Rugby semi-final against Blues,sport," Sport Brumbies fall agonisingly short against Blues in thrilling Super Rugby Pacific semi-final New Zealand's stranglehold on the Super Rugby Pacific will continue for another year after the Blues snuffed out the hopes of the remaining Australian side, beating the Brumbies 20-19 at Eden Park. The Brumbies took a 7-0 lead after three minutes only to concede the next 20 points before staging a brave second-half fightback. Two rolling-maul tries for Brumbies' substitute hooker Lachie Longergan created a grandstand finish, with fly half Noah Lolesio having a drop goal charged down in the game's dying seconds. It clears the path for the Blues to host the Crusaders in the final next weekend, while it was a 13th unsuccessful attempt by an Australian side to win a play-off game in New Zealand. Flyhalf Beauden Barrett was in impeccable touch, constantly creating opportunities for the Blues while flawless in defence and running for 99 metres. The Brumbies made a flying start with centre Irae Simone bursting through the Blues' line off the back of a scrum and running 40m to score easily for 7-0 lead. The Blues found their feet with two penalties and dragged the score back to 7-6, their backs catching fire and combining brilliantly to find a try for Hoskins Sotutu on 24 minutes. Barrett looked unstoppable and jinked his way around multiple Brumbies defenders before creating an opportunity for Mark Telea to score for 20-7, and only the crossbar denied the flyhalf a long-bomb drop goal on half-time. Blues' hooker Kurt Eklund was sin-binned for a dumping tackle on Andy Muirhead and the Brumbies tried to make immediate use of the man advantage through Tom Banks, but Barrett was once again on hand to deliver a try-saving tackle in the corner. The Brumbies patient, powerful rolling maul finally broke the line with Lachie Lonergan diving over on the hour, while only some elite desperation from Tom Wright denied Barrett a Blues' try immediately after. Searching to reduce the deficit, Brumbies' substitute Sosefo Kautai forced a penalty at the breakdown and they repeatedly threatened the line off the back of their maul, although staunch Blues' defence somehow kept the margin at more than a converted try. In a thrilling finish, Lonergan barged over for his second try on 77 minutes, with Noah Lolesio's conversion cutting the Blues' lead to a point. But he couldn't seal the deal with the subsequent drop goal attempt. While the Blues were dominant in most areas, they were absolutely brutal at the scrum and their pack forced four penalties. They struggled with discipline in the second half, conceding eight penalties to four and they were perhaps lucky not to receive a yellow card for the repeated fouling.

189,analysis: The science of silliness: How psychology won the Socceroos a World Cup spot,sport,"  How Socceroos goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne used psychology to secure Australia's spot at the 2022 World Cup In last week's 2022 World Cup qualifying play-off between the Socceroos and Peru, there were two different games being played. The first began at the opening whistle and lasted for 119 minutes: a tense, physical battle between two uncertain sides that ultimately ended 0-0. The second game started a minute later. Because that's when Australia's head coach Graham Arnold made an unexpected (and risky) substitution, bringing off veteran goalkeeper and captain Mat Ryan for 33-year-old Andrew Redmayne. The initial reaction from Socceroos fans was one of disbelief. Ryan, who plays for Real Sociedad in Spain's La Liga, was a veteran of two World Cups and one of the team's most consistent and dependable players throughout Australia's 1,008-day-long qualifying campaign. Redmayne, on the other hand, had just two appearances for Australia to his name, and was even struggling to maintain his starting spot with Sydney FC in Australia's A-League Men. But Australian fans weren't the only ones who were baffled by the switch. Peru's players were, too. And that, according to Socceroos goalkeeper coach John Crawley — one of the only people 'in' on the plan — was the entire point. ""We always knew we had Redmayne up our sleeve,"" Crawley told the ABC. ""We planned for that. We did a couple of sessions throughout the window where we did some specific stuff on penalties. But we didn't need to tell anyone [in the team] as long as we knew the plan ourselves. ""I think you just have to do something different to disrupt the penalty-taker's routine. ""They'd played against Maty [Ryan] for the whole game and knew what he was about, so when they saw Redmayne coming on, they maybe thought, 'who's this guy?' ""Even just that bit of doubt can make a difference."" Redmayne's substitution was just the start of the psychological game that began to unfold after the final whistle of extra-time blew. As the nerve-biting penalty shoot-out got underway, there were other, subtler strategies the bearded shot-stopper performed to give his team the edge. The first was handing the ball to each of his team-mates; a tactic that was popularised by England at the 2018 World Cup and carried on by a number of goalkeepers at club level, including Liverpool's Alisson. According to Geir Jordet, a professor of sports psychology at the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences who wrote a tweet thread breaking down Redmayne's tactics, these gestures were important in fortifying the psychology of Australia's penalty-takers. However, it was what Redmayne did after each hand-off that was most interesting. ""In a penalty shoot-out, you want to make events as predictable and safe as possible for your team-mates,"" Jordet said. ""The way Redmayne helped his team-mates was spot-on: first, by handing them the ball between every shot, giving them a familiar way to start their pre-shot routine [and] a friendly word of support or encouragement. That beats getting the ball from the opponent or having to go get it yourself. ""But what I have not seen before is what he did after handing off the ball. ""He looks up at the opponent goalkeeper and saw that he was maybe trying to get into the penalty-taker's head, so [Redmayne] basically takes on the role as a bodyguard, where he lets [Gallese] know to back down and step away. He puts himself in the middle between the penalty-taker and the goalkeeper like a barrier. ""I've not seen this in a penalty shoot-out before, so this was maybe the biggest innovation for me: how he took that role of a bodyguard. That's quite unique."" Another piece of psychological warfare was barely captured on camera, but arguably had one of the biggest impacts. After Redmayne noticed one of Gallese's water-bottles had notes on Australia's penalty-takers wrapped around it — containing details on who they were and which way they would likely shoot — the Socceroos keeper picked it up and threw the bottle over the advertising boards. For Jorbet, this act didn't just deny Gallese crucial information; it also acted as an intimidation tactic, a violation of the Peruvian's property and his space. ""It's disruptive on a few levels,"" he said. ""Of course, it takes away information that he probably relied on. We don't know the extent to which he had memorised these things anyway, but it was on the bottle for a reason. ""But then there's the added aspect of it being a very hostile act. It's intimidating. It's not friendly in any way; it's leaving the goalkeeper feeling very unprotected, very attacked in this very indirect kind of way [with] someone stealing your stuff. ""You can imagine coming home and someone has been in your place and stolen things. People who've been robbed talk about how it's not just that they lost a computer or whatever, but that some stranger was in my home. So to instil that in this situation is quite extraordinary. Socceroos substitute goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne danced his way into national folklore this morning – and the internet went a wild emotional rollercoaster ride with him. ""This may be stepping over the line and taking it too far, though. I wouldn't be comfortable telling my team that [stealing] is something you should do. But if a player decides to do it on their own, that's a different thing. ""And there's the other intimidation tactic where [Redmayne] was invited to hand the ball over to one of the opponents, and then just let it go and kicked it away. It's a clear demonstration of gamesmanship: 'I don't respect you.' It's a clear, explicit mind-game."" Crawley admitted that he had prepared a similar water-bottle with notes on Peru's penalty-takers, but that Redmayne was confident enough that he wouldn't need them. ""We discussed it together probably two weeks out from the Peru game,"" Crawley said. ""And I said, 'mate, in the event that we lose our bottle — it gets thrown into the crowd or something — we've still got our signals. ""And, as it turned out, when I gave Andrew the bottle right before [the shoot-out], he said, 'mate, don't worry about the bottle. We've done the signals before with success. You hold the bottle.' ""So he's gone in there without the bottle and we just did our signals. But I actually didn't realise he took advantage of Gallese's notes being there and that he's then thrown his bottle [away]. ""But again, it's whatever it takes. We certainly had a Plan A and a Plan B, but I think Redders may have taken that to another level. And thank goodness he did."" And then, of course, there's the iconic ""Wiggles"" dance. While it looked silly and unorthodox, Jordet said there was a clear rationale behind Redmayne's flailing limbs and jittery style. ""A lot of goalkeepers do things on the line to try and distract; to try to disturb,"" he said. ""What Redmayne did was follow that principle that it needs to be unpredictable, it needs to be a little erratic, it needs to have some variation. ""Because if all you do on the line is go from left to right, from right to left, it doesn't have any impact; it's very easy for the taker to block out. So it needs to be different. ""I've watched thousands of penalty shoot-out shots over the years, and this definitely ranks in the top five with respect to unpredictability in his behaviour, which I love. ""It takes me back to football history: Liverpool in the Champions League with Dudek back in 2005 and Grobbelaar in 1984 and '85. This one fits nicely with them because it's so weird, it's so strange. And what could be more impactful than that?"" However, while it may have worked for Redmayne this time, such unusual goalkeeping tactics are still so rare in professional football that there is only a small amount of evidence to suggest it's more effective at stopping penalties than any other method. The key, Jorbet says, is the overall distraction — the psychology of the moment. ""There is research on when the goalkeepers are trying to do something to distract the shooter — no matter what it is — and that history directly reduces the chance of the shooter scoring by about 10 per cent. ""Research that I've done also looked at whether goalkeepers were able to take so much time that the penalty taker had to stand there and wait. I looked at every single penalty shot in the World Cup, the European Championships, and the Champions League and the difference there, with the shooter having to wait [for the goalkeeper] versus the shooter not waiting, was more than 20 per cent. ""So there are different ways a goalkeeper can be disruptive and there is some research to suggest it works. ""But it's always difficult to go from documenting what has happened to predicting what will happen. The point is that these are not absolute discoveries; these are trends based on history that might indicate something about probabilities going forward."" For Crawley, who Redmayne credits as introducing the idea to him when they worked together at Sydney FC, the same principle of unpredictability — as well as bravery to do something different — is what made the difference against Peru. ""Whether it's a Wiggles dance, or you turn your back on the player, or you say something to them, or you move to one side of the goal; whatever it takes, you're disrupting that routine,"" Crawley said. ""If you're a player and you're stepping up to practice a penalty, you put the ball down, you walk back, you turn around, you will always see a goalkeeper in the middle of the goal. That's routine for hundreds and hundreds of practice takes. ""So what would happen if you saw a dancing Wiggle there? Automatically, you start to win the psychological game. Andrew understands this and he's willing to make a fool of himself to get that edge. From A-League journeymen to first-generation migrants to young players moving abroad, the Socceroos' ""Aussie DNA"" is more than just mongrel and mateship. ""It's all about disrupting the routine. I don't think Redders really has a great save ratio with penalties, but we all know what he can do and what he can bring. It comes down to that intangible thing in the moment."" And that intangible thing, for Jordet, is why goalkeeping is the most 'human' position in football: so much of a goalkeeper's job happens off the ball and away from cameras. Their power lies largely within the invisible, but very real, dynamics they create between themselves and others on the field. ""This is such a personal type of strategy,"" he said. ""It's something where you have to use yourself more than other parts of the game where you can just do your job. ""There's something very human about this that transcends the game itself, in a way. You have to be able to put yourself out there in a moment like this, do something that others might not. ""These are the intangible human parts of football that are so fascinating. It's something that's very hard to measure; it's something that's hard to quantify. And that's exactly what is so wonderful about it.""

190,'Get a grip': Ballon D'Or winner Megan Rapinoe criticises exclusion of trans athletes,sport,"  'Get a grip': Ballon D'Or winner Megan Rapinoe criticises growing exclusion of trans people from sport Two-time Women's World Cup football champion and former Ballon D'Or winner Megan Rapinoe has defended the inclusion of transgender athletes in sport as more governing bodies, including FIFA and World Athletics, consider tighter restrictions on trans people's participation. Warning: This article contains discussion of suicide. Speaking to Time Magazine on Monday, Rapinoe said much of the decision-making from governing bodies that excluded trans people was misinformed, and that the rationale behind blanket bans was both unethical and not supported by evidence. Her comments come as FINA, world swimming's governing body, voted to further restrict trans women from competing in elite competitions. ""I'm 100 per cent supportive of trans inclusion,"" Rapinoe said. ""People do not know very much about it. We're missing almost everything. Frankly, I think what a lot of people know is versions of the [political] right's talking-points, because they're very loud, they're very consistent, and they're relentless. ""At the highest level, there is regulation. In collegiate sports, there is regulation, and at the Olympic and professional level. It's not like it's a free-for-all where everyone's just doing whatever. ""Show me the evidence that trans women are taking everyone's scholarships, are dominating in every sport, are winning every title. I'm sorry, it's just not happening. ""So we need to start from inclusion — period. And, as things arise, I have confidence that we can figure it out. But we can't start at the opposite. That is cruel. And, frankly, it's just disgusting. ""We really need to take a step back and get a grip on what we're really talking about here because people's lives are at risk. Kids' lives are at risk with the rates of suicide, the rates of depression and negative mental health and drug abuse. ""We're [framing] everything through 'God forbid a trans person be successful in sports'. Get a grip on reality and take a step back."" While those who believe trans women should be excluded from sport have defended their right to ""free speech"", little airtime has been given to examining the science behind the claims being made. Rapinoe, who plays alongside Canadian women's national team and non-binary, trans footballer Quinn at NWSL club OL Reign, has used her high-profile platform to advocate for social causes for several years. She was the first footballer in the world to kneel in solidarity with NFL player Colin Kaepernick, was a leader in the US women's national team's fight for equal pay, and regularly uses interviews and award acceptance speeches to shine a light on issues affecting the LGBTQIA+ community, of which she is part. ""I am not just speaking for me,"" she said. ""I'm speaking for a lot of people. ""For a long time, I was the only player that was 'out'. And, so, just being the only spokesperson and making sure I'm setting the right example, saying the right things, whether it comes to gay marriage or difficult and nuanced topics like trans inclusion in sports. ""Those are the challenges of just continuing to stay educated. ""Nothing goes unsaid. Speak it plainly. And I'm gonna speak it loudly, and I think that helps other people who maybe don't have the ability to do that, or who aren't in a place to do that quite yet."" The United States is facing its own reckoning when it comes to trans people's inclusion in sports, with several Republican-controlled states banning trans people from all sport, despite not being able to provide evidence to support it, while others have passed laws requiring school-aged girls ""suspected"" of being trans to receive physical genital examinations to ""prove"" their gender presentation matches their biological sex characteristics. For Rapinoe, these blanket sports laws not only disproportionately affect an already-marginalised community, but they also feed into a discourse where success in elite sport takes priority over the rights and freedoms of trans people. ""I think people also need to understand that sports is not the most important thing in life, right? Life is the most important thing in life,"" she said. During the election campaign, focus turned to the issue of transgender women in sport, leaving more significant issues unchallenged, writes Tracey Holmes. ""And so much of this trans inclusion argument has been put through the extremely tiny lens of elite sports. That is not the way to be framing this question. ""We're talking about kids. We're talking about people's lives. We're talking about the entire government coming down on one child in some states, three children in some states. ""They are committing suicide because they are being told that they're gross and different and evil and sinful and they can't play sports with their friends that they grew up with. It's monstrous. ""I would also encourage everyone out there who is afraid someone's going to have an unfair advantage over their kid to really take a step back and think, 'What are we actually talking about here?' ""We're talking about people's lives. I'm sorry, your kid's high school volleyball team just isn't that important. It's not more important than any one kid's life.""

191,"FIFA, World Athletics review transgender rules after swimming's change",sport," Sport World Athletics and FIFA reviewing transgender policies after FINA ruling World football's governing body and athletics administrators are reviewing their transgender eligibility policies after swimming passed new rules that restrict transgender participation in women's events. On Sunday, swimming's world governing body FINA voted to restrict the participation of transgender athletes in elite women's competitions and create a working group to establish an ""open"" category in some events as part of its new policy. The new policy states that transgender women are eligible to compete in women's competitions only if ""they can establish to FINA's comfortable satisfaction that they have not experienced any part of male puberty beyond Tanner Stage 2 [of puberty] or before age 12, whichever is later"". Sebastian Coe, president of World Athletics, told the BBC the organisation's council would discuss their regulations at the end of the year. Coe praised FINA for taking the decision, which has been criticised by trans rights advocates, who have regularly challenged claims that trans women dominate women's sport. For example, the swim that sparked much of this debate, Lia Thomas's win in the 500-yard freestyle at US college championships, was nine seconds slower than the NCAA record set by Katie Ledecky five years ago. Coe said it was important to protect the integrity of women's sport, saying ""if it's a judgement between inclusion and fairness, we will always fall down on the side of fairness"". ""We see an international federation asserting its primacy in setting rules, regulations and policies that are in the best interest of its sport,"" Coe told the BBC. Weightlifter Laurel Hubbard broke down barriers simply by competing in women's competitions, but the answers to many of the questions you might have heard about her inclusion are no, no, no, no and no. ""This is as it should be. We have always believed that biology trumps gender, and we will continue to review our regulations in line with this. We will follow the science. ""We continue to study, research and contribute to the growing body of evidence that testosterone is a key determinant in performance, and have scheduled a discussion on our regulations with our council at the end of the year."" Last year, the IOC issued a ""framework"" on the issue, leaving eligibility decisions up to individual sports bodies, but adding that ""until evidence determines otherwise, athletes should not be deemed to have an unfair or disproportionate competitive advantage due to their sex variations, physical appearance and/or transgender status"". World Athletics' current rules cap testosterone levels at five nanomoles per litre (5nmol/L) for transgender athletes and for competitors with differences in sex development (DSD) in some women's running events. The athletics governing body has attracted criticism in the past for its handling of gender-related issues, with the treatment of South African middle-distance star Caster Semenya garnering headlines around the world and ending up in front of numerous courts and tribunals. A spokesperson for FIFA said it was in a consultation process over a new policy. ""FIFA is currently reviewing its gender eligibility regulations in consultation with expert stakeholders,"" the spokesperson said. During the election campaign, focus turned to the issue of transgender women in sport, leaving more significant issues unchallenged, writes Tracey Holmes. The spokesperson said the process was ""ongoing"" so would not comment further ""on specifics of proposed amendments to the existing regulations"". FIFA said it was taking guidance from medical, legal, scientific, performance and human rights experts and also the position of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). ""Should FIFA be asked to verify the eligibility of a player before the new regulations will be in place, any such case will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, taking into account FIFA's clear commitment to respect human rights,"" the spokesperson said. Last week the International Cycling Union (UCI) tightened its rules on transgender participation by increasing the transition period on low testosterone to two years and reducing the maximum permitted testosterone level.

192,Big ticket events return but Perth's local industry remains battered and bruised by COVID,sport,"  After nearly two years of cancellations and strict COVID-19 restrictions, major events are starting to trickle back to WA, but Perth's event industry says not enough is being done to help local operators recover. When the pandemic first struck in 2020 and borders were slammed shut, events and entertainment businesses were among the first to be hit. Then the WA government decided to impose strict restrictions over the New Year's period, resulting in a loss of more than $26.5 million after 250 events had to be cancelled. Months on from WA's border reopening and weeks since the removal of most COVID restrictions, major events are starting to return to the once 'hermit state'. Later this month, the second State of Origin game will be heading to Perth Stadium for the first time since 2019 and is expected to bring around 11,000 interstate visitors. The stadium will also host Perth's Festival of International Football in July, with Premier League club Manchester United taking on Aston Villa in one of the fixtures. There was hope the border reopening in March and the easing of rules would also revive local businesses, but those in the events industry continue to struggle. ""It's great we're open for business, but the confidence is gone,"" Mega Vision managing director Jeff Georgiou said. Mega Vision is one of the state's leading audio-visual providers and production companies, and caters for events ranging from small parties to large festivals. Mr Georgiou said the ripple effect from cancellations around Christmas and the border backflip in February were still ongoing and he expected more recognition from the state government. ""We're not going to see some things until summer comes around but it's not going to be on the scale that it had been before,"" he said. Mr Georgiou said he was tired of the events industry being grouped with tourism and sports, and not being given the appreciation it deserves. A small but growing number of West Australians are getting reinfected with the virus, as experts try to figure out how it will impact the the state's recovery. ""What the government doesn't understand is that we are the festivals, we are the council shows, we are the concerts, we are the weekend markets, we are the community shows, we are all those things classed as events, and they're not giving us support,"" he said. ""If something is to happen, if there's a fire or flood or a catastrophe, who's the first industry they come to for help? They come to us and say 'please put on a free concert to assist everybody' or 'please put on something to raise money for these flood or fire victims', and we've done that. ""But now we're the ones that are screaming for help and have been for two years and we haven't been getting it. ""The industry is hurting … and they have to do more to help us survive."" Mr Georgiou said revenue had dropped 80 per cent on pre-pandemic levels, and those in the industry had been forced to sell off equipment and cut staff to get through. Since the start of the pandemic, the state government said it had injected close to $1.7 billion towards business assistance, including grants for those impacted by restrictions. Mr Georgiou said he had waited four months for his claim to be approved, and while he was grateful for some support, it was ""nowhere near enough"". ""The grants are one-off, and the cancellations happen weekly for months and months and months,"" he said. Mr Georgiou said he would prefer to see the government provide cost-cutting exemptions for businesses like his. ""We've all got vehicles, trucks, vans, carnival rides, food trucks that have been sitting in warehouses for a couple of years now, not doing a lot. But we're having to pay the registration, we're having to keep everything maintained, we're having to pay all the certificates and so forth,"" he said. The vice president of WA's Events Industry Association (EIA), Blake Williams, said some businesses had missed out on the grants due to the costly application process. ""So many event suppliers said to me, 'it's going to cost us more money in accounting fees to get these grants than the grants are going to pay us,'"" he said. ""We've explained that thresholds for grants are too hard, and the numbers are too low … we work in a gig-to-gig economy and that hasn't been taken into account when these grants had been administered."" Mr Williams, who runs his own entertainment agency, said he had to cancel around $30,000 worth of gigs during New Year's Eve and had only received $800 in compensation. ""As an industry, we're disappointed in the way that we've been treated a little bit,"" he said. ""It's not about getting endless handouts from the government. It's about putting things in place so that we don't get back to this situation again. ""We've continually asked for conversation, and we've said from the very start, give us a seat at the table and we'll talk through these issues, we'll make sure the industry is healthy, and we'll do it together."" But the EIA believes more focus has been placed on events coming from interstate or overseas, rather than local ones. ""It's great that we have these large events like State of Origin because it's a massive cash injection into the state, but it shouldn't be assumed that because we have a large flashy event that our local industry is not suffering,"" Mr Williams said. ""It's important that people understand that whilst those big events are happening, it's the local people that have been here through the pandemic that are still really doing it tough. ""We need to support the local industry, those local actors, musicians, dancers [and] technical people who have been here through it all, holding it down to feed their families … it's time to inject some money into the local industry as well."" Local businessman Jamie Mercanti who runs an entertainment agency, said the perception the industry was starting to bounce back because big shows were returning was not reality. ""I don't think there's any industry in the world that could be able to maintain itself and sustain itself through a break of two years,"" he said. ""The time when these shutdowns occurred, everybody in the entertainment industry understood the rules and went along with what was requested from them without question. ""But now the government needs to be doing a whole lot more because these businesses are active 52 weeks a year … it's not just a special event like the upcoming State of Origin game or the Manchester United game."" In a brief statement, the state government said it had done everything it could to ""help protect WA businesses, local jobs and the economy from the full brunt of COVID-19"".

193,Kyrgios plays it safe for Wimbledon but smashes ATP over off-court coaching,sport," Sport Nick Kyrgios withdraws from Mallorca event due to abdominal pain ahead of Wimbledon, opposes ATP trial of off-court coaching Nick Kyrgios has taken a ""no-risk"" approach towards his Wimbledon fitness, but the same cannot be said of his blast at the men's tour over off-court coaching trials. The in-form Australian has taken the cautious route to Wimbledon, deciding to pull out of his last-16 tie against Roberto Bautista Agut at the Mallorca Championship on Wednesday, local time, after suffering abdominal pain. Kyrgios — who has been a big hit with the local fans on the Spanish island — says he was sorry to have to disappoint them by withdrawing because of a painful abdomen muscle problem that he'd suffered during Tuesday's win over Laslo Djere. Taking doctor's advice, he played it safe, saying he wanted to take ""no risks"" with his best shot at Wimbledon in recent years just around the corner. However. the enigmatic Australian was not playing safe with his views about the ATP's plans to trial off-court coaching, saying he believes the unique nature of the sport was being removed by the experiment. The ATP will trial the system in the second half of the season, with players allowed to receive instructions during qualifying and main draw matches in tournaments, including the US Open and the ATP Finals. Patrick Mouratoglou — who helped guide Serena Williams to glory — congratulated the ATP for ""legalising a practice that has been going on at almost every match for decades"" but Kyrgios was adamant in his opposition. ""Completely disagree. Loses one of the only unique traits that no other sport had,"" Kyrgios responded on Twitter. ""The player had to figure out things on his own. That was the beauty of it. What happens if a high-profile player versus a low-ranked player who doesn't have or (cannot) afford a coach?"" Mouratoglou was involved in the most high-profile piece of off-court coaching at the 2018 US Open final when Williams was given a warning for his gesturing. The new trial is due to begin on July 11, the day after the end of Wimbledon, where Kyrgios has good reason to believe he could have his best run yet after reaching two grass-court semi-finals in the space of two weeks in Stuttgart and Halle. ""I'm really sorry I'm going to have to withdraw from tonight's match here in Mallorca. I have been playing a lot of great matches lately and, unfortunately, I woke up with a pain in my abs,"" Kyrgios said in a statement released by the organisers on Wednesday, local time. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""I went to see the tournament doctor right away and he advised that I don't play tonight. I really value the Mallorca Championships but I will follow his advice as I don't want to risk Wimbledon next week. ""I was really looking forward to tonight's match as I've been loving my time here. Mallorca is such a beautiful island with really nice people."" Javier Cerrato, the tournament doctor, reported: ""Nick Kyrgios suffers pain in the rectus abdominis, on the left side, due to the accumulation of matches in recent weeks and the effort of yesterday's first-round match. ""This will not allow him to return to the court tonight."" Organisers must have been left disappointed that his exit also prevented the prospect of a blockbuster quarter-final for the Australian against world number one Daniil Medvedev, who earned his place in the last eight on Wednesday, with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Aslan Karatsev.

194,Serena Williams makes winning return in Eastbourne doubles after a year out,sport," Sport Serena Williams partners Ons Jabeur for women's doubles win in Eastbourne in her first match in a year Serena Williams has made a winning return to action at the Eastbourne International, coming from a set down with partner Ons Jabeur to beat Sara Sorribes Tormo and Marie Bouzkova 2-6, 6-3 (13-11) in the women's doubles. Age: 40 WTA singles titles: 73 Grand slam singles titles: 23 Previous tournament: Wimbledon 2021 (rd 1) Weeks at number one: 319 Current singles ranking: 1204 The former world number one had not played competitive tennis since limping out of last year's first-round match at Wimbledon — where she has won seven of her 23 grand slam singles titles — in tears due to a leg injury. Back on court and on grass again, Williams stepped up preparations for Wimbledon, where the main draw starts next Monday, having been granted a wildcard to enter, alongside Tunisian Jabeur in the opening round at Eastbourne. Looking rusty with some loose early shots, 40-year-old Williams, who has slipped to 1,204th in the singles rankings, saw her serve broken in the fourth game and there was no way back as Spaniard Sorribes Tormo and her Czech partner took the opening set. Williams, who was sporting black tape on her face to help with a sinus problem, had no answer as Sorribes and Bouzkova made three successive breaks at the start of the second to help put them in a commanding position. However, a ferocious volley from Williams helped her and Jabeur hold serve to make it 4-3, before the American showed further signs she was starting to find her rhythm with a booming forehand down the line to break their opponents' serve. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Williams served out the next game to take the match to a final set tie-break, which swung this way and that, with both pairings having match points before Sorribes Tormo missed a volley at the net to gift her opponents victory. ""It was so fun to play with Ons,"" Williams said. ""We had fun. ""I caught some fire behind me! I needed that. It was good. We're just taking it one day at a time."" Earlier at Eastbourne, British number four Katie Boulter stormed to one of the biggest wins of her career with a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 win over 2021 Wimbledon runner-up Karolina Pliskova, while Jodie Burrage completed a day to remember for Britain by beating world number four Paula Badosa 6-4, 6-3.

195,Nick Kyrgios loses battle of the big servers to miss German grasscourt final,sport," Sport Nick Kyrgios's Wimbledon preparation continues, losing Halle grasscourt semi-final to Poland's Hubert Hurkacz Nick Kyrgios has found himself upstaged in a battle of the monster servers as Hubert Hurkacz ruined the Australian's hopes of reaching a first grass-court final in Halle. Kyrgios — in such brilliant form all week at the German event that he fancied his maiden final on the green stuff was firmly on the cards — met his match in an almost inevitable tie-break decider in Saturday's semi-final, losing 6-4, 6-7 (7/2), 6-7 (7/4) to Hurkacz. It was a grievous disappointment for the 27-year-old but there was definitely enough in Kyrgios's big week to encourage him, with Wimbledon a little more than a week away. The Australian was quite brilliant behind his own serve, unbroken and having given up just two break points the whole match. However, ultimately, he was beaten at his own game as Hurkacz pounded down 27 aces, the most he's ever delivered in any match. So Kyrgios, who was even more prolific, with 30 aces, couldn't capitalise on his first-set domination, when he was the more aggressive and ambitious of the pair. Neither player was troubled on their own delivery until the ninth game of the opener when two brilliant forehand winners helped Kyrgios land what was to be the only break of the match to go 5-4 ahead. He sealed the deal with two aces in the following game but, from then on, he never really threatened Hurkacz on serve as the Polish world number 12 began to grow in confidence. With some inevitability, it all came down to one final tie-break shoot-out, with Hurkacz earning the crucial mini-break as Kyrgios failed to deal with a floated deep service return. ""One or two shots was the difference,"" Hurkacz conceded. ""Definitely super close. Nick played a really, really great match. He's a great player, so it was definitely a super tough one."" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Kyrgios, on his debut at the German venue, was deprived of a chance of playing world number one Daniil Medvedev in Sunday's final, after the Russian survived a set point in the first stanza before beating German hope Oscar Otte 7-6 (7/3), 6-3. However, although there was one flashpoint with Kyrgios — he picked up a warning for ball abuse after he smashed one high, wide and out of the arena in a moment of frustration — this will be a week he can look back on with real satisfaction. For the man who reckons that he's a top-five player on grass courts really did indeed look like one for much of the week and he will go on to one final Wimbledon warm-up tournament in Mallorca next week, believing he's on course for perhaps his best week at SW19. One thing is for sure — nobody, as Hurkacz intimated, will want to meet this dangerous floater in the main draw of a grand slam event in which he's previously reached one quarter-final and the last 16 on two other occasions.

196,"Rafael Nadal aiming for Wimbledon, despite 'strange' nerve pain",sport,"  Rafael Nadal aiming for Wimbledon return, despite 'strange' nerve pain in his foot Rafael Nadal intends to compete at Wimbledon later this month as he attempts to win a record-extending 23rd grand slam title. After winning both the Australian and French Opens this year, the 36-year-old told media on Friday that the pain in his injured foot has eased thanks to radiofrequency ablation treatment and that he will travel to London on Monday to start his preparation for the tournament. ""I'm happy. I haven't been limping for a week,"" Nadal — who won Wimbledon in 2008 and 2010 — told a news conference in Mallorca. ""I have noticed changes with the treatment — [I] still have strange sensations — [so,] sometimes I can't feel my foot, but the pain that did not allow me to support my weight on my foot has subsided."" Nadal said that he would continue to assess how he is feeling after a week of training and exhibition matches after undergoing a procedure. ""My intention is to play Wimbledon, but it will all depend on what happens with my body this next week,"" Nadal said. ""I'm without pain for a week and have been practising, so it tells me there may be a chance to play in the tournament. ""With this treatment, sometimes one part of my foot goes numb, sometimes another [part], and sometimes I have cramps in my foot. But it seems to be normal. Apparently, after a few weeks, the nerve is reorganised — so let's hope that, when this is reorganised, everything will be fine."" Last month, Nadal said that he had arrived at Roland Garros after suffering a flare-up of Müller-Weiss syndrome, a degenerative ailment affecting his foot, and that he had competed while receiving pain-killing injections prior to each match, but does not want to repeat that at other tournaments. The issue — which forced him to take five months off in 2021 — returned in Rome, prior to the French Open, after he came back in May from a six-week injury break. Nadal has not played Wimbledon since 2019, when he reached the semi-finals. The tournament was not held the following year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and he missed the 2021 competition due to injury. He last reached the Wimbledon final 11 years ago, when he finished runner-up to Novak Djokovic. ""I haven't played on grass for three years and I have to adapt. Every day, I have been recovering sensations and feeling better. I have a week left before playing and I have to test myself, little by little,"" Nadal said. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""Advancing in the first rounds is crucial. If you advance, you pick up the pace to reach the end. You have to survive no matter what."" Nadal also confirmed that his childhood sweetheart and now-wife, Maria Francisca Perello, is pregnant with their first child. ""If everything goes well, I'm going to be a father,"" he beamed. ""I'm not used to talking about my private life. We live more peacefully with a lower profile. I don't expect that my life will change much with it. ""At the moment, all has worked well for me and I am not a friend of changing what works well. My intention is to play Wimbledon, rest, then Canada and then be ready for the US Open.""
