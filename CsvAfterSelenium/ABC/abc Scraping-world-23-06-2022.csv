0,"'It's a doomsday scenario': Afghan community grieving after earthquake claims 1,000 lives",world,"  Australia's Afghan community, devastated by deadly earthquake, mobilises to raise funds Afghans have described ""doomsday"" scenes in the aftermath of a deadly earthquake that claimed 1,000 lives in the war-ravaged country. Rescuers are digging through rubble with their hands, and the ripple effects of the magnitude-6.1 earthquake are being felt in the community in Australia. ""It's a doomsday scenario at the hospitals,"" Abdul Bari, head of community group Khaberial Welfare Foundation, told the ABC. ""Some people have lost parents, some have lost all children and siblings."" In Australia, Ezatullah Alam was going about his day in his office in Melbourne when he heard the news that the earthquake had struck near his hometown of Khost — one of the worst-affected areas. ""I got very upset and kept thinking about the people caught in the earthquake all day,"" he said. He said the entire Afghan diaspora in Australia has been in a state of grief due to grim scale of the losses. The south-eastern Paktika and Khost provinces are in rough mountainous terrain in the landlocked country. The area located is more than 200 kilometres from more well-equipped healthcare facilities in the capital Kabul. Rescue and relief operations have been hampered by untimely rain, rough terrain and poor communications. Sayid Mossavi is the vice-president of the Australian Afghan Hassanian Youth Association, an NGO that has a handful of volunteers in the country, who have made their way to Paktika in the wake of the disaster. ""There are no resources. They're physically digging with their hands,"" he said. ""The country was already suffering. And now it's even worse. There are a lot of people who are displaced — they have nowhere to go, they have no shelter."" He said the news was ""devastating"" for the Afghan community and asylum seekers in Australia, many of whom have been in limbo in Australia for a decade and who still have family in the region. ""Some people here, they don't even know if their family is OK there. They can't get in touch with them, they don't know if their children are alive,"" he said. Mr Bari said the earthquake has hit the poorest people in a community that relied heavily on remittances from the Gulf countries for survival. ""There are literally no jobs around, the men from these communities go and do labour-intensive jobs in different countries of the world to support families back home, and now their homes got uprooted,"" he said. Afghanistan's ambassador in Canberra said the Taliban's grip on power should not prevent the federal government or Australians from donating generously to help his country recover from the catastrophic earthquake. The Taliban, which overthrew Afghanistan's government last year, has urged the international community to help the country, which is already struggling with multiple humanitarian crises. Providing aid to Afghanistan might be complicated by the fact that Australia – along with several other countries — does not recognise the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of the country. Ambassador Wahidullah Waissi, was appointed before the Taliban seized power, and does not represent the militant group, saying he leads an ""embassy in exile"". But he said he was confident Australia could still send money to help Afghans struggling in the wake of the crisis without funnelling funds to the Taliban, largely by making sure donations were made to third parties, including the United Nations and international relief organisations. ""Australia has already sorted this problem out through channelling funds to the United Nations. The UN is doing its activities through reputable NGOs, so this channel is already existing,"" he told the ABC. ""The [challenge] is how to reach the area and make sure those who are affected are receiving relief."" He said it was partially because of help from the local Afghan community that the Afghanistan embassy had been able to stay financially afloat. Foreign Minister Penny Wong has called the earthquake ""heartbreaking"" and promised to ""work with partners to respond to this crisis"". Mr Waissi said the suffering from the earthquake had been compounded by other natural disasters supercharged by climate change, including floods and heavy rains last month. He said reputable sources in Afghanistan estimated that the death toll could now have reached more than 2,500 people, and there was a desperate need for more help. ""There is some relief and aid coming into these villages … [but] food and medicine is lacking. The terrain is very difficult and it's very difficult to reach,"" he told the ABC. ""There are [many people] stranded under the rubble of houses."" Diana B Sayed, head of the Australian Muslim Women's Centre for Human Rights, said it was great to see well-wishing diaspora groups creating crowdfunding relief pages, but it was important to amplify the voices of those organising support, and coordinating relief and rescue efforts on the ground. ""Turkey has pledged 50 million euros ($76 million) and we would love to see Australia pledge support and go through some of these aid agencies to circumvent the Taliban,"" she said. ""Very real sanctions need to be imposed on them given the fact they are an illegitimate terrorist organisation that are terrorising the people on day-to-day basis."" Mr Alam said the community had sprung into action to raise money for the victims of the disaster, which he said would be distributed via local community groups in Paktika and Khost. ""Our elders here in Australia immediately set up social media groups and started raising funds and spreading appeals around for help that is beyond our financial capacity,"" he said. ""We have close to 200 members joining our appeal group and we raised more than $5,000 in the first few hours for the earthquake [for the] affected people in Afghanistan,"" he said, adding they would collect funds for three days before sending the money to Afghanistan. He said special appeals would also be made in mosques during Friday prayers for the Afghanistan earthquake victims. At least $US15 million (more than $21 million) was urgently needed for the rescue efforts, according to the initial UN estimates. Sending funds to Afghanistan, which faces international sanctions in the wake of the Taliban's rise to power back in August 2021, is another major hassle. Leader of the Taliban, Haibatullah Akhundzadah, makes a rare public appearance, pleading with the international community and humanitarian aid organisations to ""spare no effort"" for Afghanistan. The country's fragile banking system is under strain and many locals said the only swift way to send money to the affected families in this remote corner of the country was the traditional hawala transfer, which is banned in many countries. Hawala is an informal money transfer system involving basic identity documents of the receiver and sender, but is banned in many parts of the world over suspicions of money laundering. Mr Mossavi said he would like to see Australians help the victims too. ""The Australian government has always played an active role in helping Afghanistan. It would be nice to see if they could help with the humanitarian aid, to provide aid directly to Afghanistan,"" he said. ""I'm absolutely heartbroken for those Afghans there.""

1,Myanmar moves Aung San Suu Kyi to solitary confinement at new prison facility,world,"  Myanmar moves Aung San Suu Kyi to solitary confinement at new prison facility Myanmar's military government has confirmed that ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been moved to a prison compound in quarters separate from other detainees. Ms Suu Kyi was arrested on February 1, 2021, when the army seized power from her elected government. She was initially held at her residence in Naypyitaw, the capital, but was later moved to at least one other location. For most of the past year, she has been held at an undisclosed location in Naypyitaw, generally believed to be on a military base. Major General Zaw Min Tun, spokesperson for the ruling military council, confirmed in a text message to journalists that Ms Suu Kyi was moved on Wednesday to the main prison in Naypyitaw, where she is being held separately in ""well-kept"" circumstances. News of her transfer had been reported Wednesday but not officially confirmed. He said Ms Suu Kyi, having already been convicted in several cases, was transferred to the prison in accordance with the law. A legal official familiar with Ms Suu Kyi's court proceedings said she is being held in a newly constructed building with three policewomen, whose duty is to assist her. Her ongoing trials will also be held at the prison, in another newly constructed facility. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to release any information about her cases. Myanmar's military-installed government will execute a former MP from ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party and a veteran pro-democracy activist. Ms Suu Kyi, who turned 77 on Sunday, spent about 15 years in detention under a previous military government, but virtually all of it was under house arrest at her family home in Yangon, the country's biggest city. The secret location where she had been held for most of the past year was a residence. She had nine people to help her there, and was allowed to keep a dog that was a gift arranged by one of her sons, said another legal official, who also asked not to be named for fear or repercussions from the government. The official said neither her assistants nor the dog accompanied Ms Suu Kyi to her new prison quarters. Ms Suu Kyi is being tried on multiple charges, including corruption. Her supporters say the charges are politically motivated to discredit her and legitimise the military's seizure of power. Ms Suu Kyi has already been sentenced to 11 years imprisonment on charges of illegally importing and possessing walkie-talkies, violating coronavirus restrictions, sedition and an initial count of corruption. Hundreds of academics are pressuring the federal government to explain what steps it has taken to secure the release of Sean Turnell from a Myanmar jail. One of the legal officials said Ms Suu Kyi's first hearing in the new prison courtroom was held Thursday in the case of violating the Official Secrets Act. Defence lawyers cross examined three prosecution witnesses but details of their testimony was not available. All of Ms Suu Kyi's cases have been held in closed hearings. Her lawyers are prohibited from discussing the proceedings. Ms Suu Kyi's co-defendants in the case are Australian economist Sean Turnell, who had been her advisor, and three former Cabinet members. Professor Turnell is also being held at the same prison with Ms Suu Kyi. Ms Suu Kyi is also being tried on 11 counts of corruption, each of which carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years, and an election fraud charge, which carries a maximum sentence of three years. The military's takeover last year triggered peaceful nationwide protests that security forces quashed with lethal force, triggering armed resistance that some UN experts now characterise as civil war. Myanmar's military ruler Min Aung Hlaing takes the role of Prime Minister, state media reports. The ruling military council said it plans to hold new elections around the middle of next year if circumstances permit. However, critics caution such polls are unlikely to be free and fair. Tom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said on Thursday the military has been working hard to ""create an impression of legitimacy"" after ousting Ms Suu Kyi's government. Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party won a landslide victory in a November 2020 general election. The army claimed it seized power because the polls were marred by widespread fraud — an allegation was not corroborated by independent election observers. ""Any suggestion that there could be any possibility of a free and fair election in Myanmar in 2023 is frankly preposterous,"" Mr Andrews said at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ""You can't have a free and fair election if you locked up your opponents.""

2,Taliban pleads for international aid after Afghanistan's worst earthquake in two decades,world,"  Afghanistan's Taliban rulers plead for aid after the country's deadliest earthquake in two decades Aid agencies have rushed assistance to eastern areas of Afghanistan after a powerful 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck the country early on Wednesday, killing more than 1,000 people. The disaster posed a new test for Afghanistan's Taliban rulers and relief agencies already struggling with the country's multiple humanitarian crises. Officials said the quake was Afghanistan's deadliest in two decades, and its death toll could rise. An estimated 1,500 other people were reported injured, the state-run news agency said. The disaster heaps more misery on a country where millions face increasing hunger and poverty and a health system that has been crumbling since the Taliban retook power nearly 10 months ago. That takeover led to a cutting-off of vital international financing, and most of the world has since shunned the Taliban government. The Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzadah — who almost never appears in public — pleaded with the international community and humanitarian organisations ""to help the Afghan people affected by this great tragedy and to spare no effort"". Residents in the remote area near the Pakistani border searched for victims, dead or alive, by digging with their bare hands through the rubble, according to footage shown by the Bakhtar news agency. At least 2,000 homes were destroyed in the region where, on average, every household has seven or eight people living in it, said the UN's deputy special representative to Afghanistan, Ramiz Alakbarov. The full extent of the destruction among the villages tucked in the mountains has been slow in coming to light. Its roads — which are rutted and difficult to travel in the best of circumstances — may have been further damaged, and landslides from recent rains had already made access more difficult. Rescuers rushed in by helicopter, but the relief effort may be hindered by the exodus of many international aid agencies from Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover last August. Moreover, most governments are wary of dealing directly with the Taliban. Mr Alakbarov said the Taliban had not formally requested that the UN mobilise international search-and-rescue teams nor asked to obtain equipment from neighbouring countries. Still, officials from multiple UN agencies said the Taliban were giving them full access to the area. The quake was centred in Paktika province, about 50 kilometres south-west of the city of Khost, according to neighbouring Pakistan's Meteorological Department. Experts put its depth at just 10 kilometres. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage. The European seismological agency said the quake was felt more than 500km away by 119 million people across Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Baktar news agency reports the death toll to date is equal to that of a quake in 2002 in northern Afghanistan. Those have been the deadliest since 1998, when an earthquake that was also magnitude-6.1 and subsequent tremors in the remote north-east killed at least 4,500 people. Wednesday's quake took place in a region prone to landslides, with many older, weaker buildings. ""The fear is that the victims will increase further, also because many people could be trapped under collapsed buildings,"" said Afghanistan country director for the Italian medical aid group Emergency, Stefano Sozza. That aid group sent seven ambulances and staff to areas near the quake zone. More than 60 per cent of Afghanistan's population of 38 million already relies on international aid to survive. Humanitarian agencies still operating in the country, including UNICEF, rushed supplies to the quake-stricken areas. And Pakistan said it would send food, tents, blankets and other essentials. Obtaining more direct international help may be more difficult because many countries, including the US, funnel humanitarian aid to Afghanistan through the UN and other such organisations to avoid putting money in the Taliban's hands. The federal government has indicated it is looking at what help it could, and would, offer Afghanistan. ""[Foreign Affairs] Minister [Penny] Wong will be very carefully looking at our response and, obviously, will be providing whatever assistance we can, and ensuring that that gets to those who are in need,"" Energy Minister Chris Bowen said. Aid workers say the number of ""dangerously malnourished"" children they are treating has more than doubled in the past five months, with some dying before they can reach a hospital. US President Joe Biden has directed USAID and other federal government entities to assess how it can respond to help those most affected. The UN spokesperson for World Food Program in Kabul Shelley Thakral said the quake would ""only add to the immense humanitarian needs in Afghanistan, and it really has to be 'all hands on deck' to make sure that we really limit the suffering that families, that women and children, are already going through"". Afghanistan's Prime Minister, Mohammad Hassan Akhund, convened an emergency meeting at the presidential palace. ""When such a big incident happens in any country, there is a need for help from other countries,"" the country's Deputy Minister of State for Disaster Management, Sharafuddin Muslim, said. ""It is very difficult for us to be able to respond to this huge incident."" Receiving international assistance may prove difficult, given the international isolation of Afghanistan under the Taliban, who were initially toppled from power by the US after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. However, the abrupt withdrawal of US and other nations' troops last year left a vacuum that the Taliban quickly filled. The newly restored government has issued a flurry of edicts curtailing the rights of women and girls and the news media in a turn back toward the Taliban's harsh rule from the late 1990s. ""This does add a lot to the daily burden of survival,"" the UN's Mr Alakbarov said of the quake. ""We are not optimistic today.""

3,"Four injured in NZ stabbing, police praise 'extreme bravery' of Auckland residents who stepped in",world,"  Four wounded in stabbing rampage in Auckland, bystanders bring attacker to the ground A man has wounded four people in a stabbing attack before being stopped by bystanders, who brought him to the ground in an Auckland neighbourhood, New Zealand police said. Police District Commander Naila Hassan said the attack in Auckland on Thursday was random and the suspect was in custody. She said there was no indication the attack was a hate crime, as the victims were of different genders, ethnicities and ages. ""This was an extremely fast-moving incident, where our police staff responded quickly, apprehended the offender and prevented further harm to our communities,"" Commander Hassan said. She said the victims all suffered moderate injuries. People in the neighbourhood began following and surrounding the man after he began his attack and one brought him down using a walking crutch, Commander Hassan said. ""Members of the public acted with extreme bravery,"" she said. She said the man had been carrying a large knife and suffered moderate injuries when he was apprehended, and had been hospitalised as a result. She said the attack, which began in the suburb of Murrays Bay, lasted less than 10 minutes. New Zealand was the site of two violent stabbing attacks at supermarkets last year. One was considered a terror attack while a judge found no motive for the other attack. Last September, a Muslim extremist inspired by the Islamic State group stabbed five people in an Auckland supermarket before police shot and killed him. Three of those he stabbed were critically injured and two other people were also injured in the melee, but all survived. And in May last year, shoppers and staff at a Dunedin supermarket managed to stop a frenzied man from hurting others after he stabbed four people in a random attack, severely wounding three of them. The Dunedin attacker, 43-year-old Luke Lambert, was convicted on four counts of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.

4,Team USA coach dives to save swimmer who passed out at world championships,world,"  Photographer captures dramatic underwater rescue of unconscious swimmer Anita Alvarez An underwater photographer has captured the dramatic rescue of Team USA swimmer Anita Alvarez, who fainted during her routine. Alvarez, 25, was performing in the artistic swimming solo free final at the 2022 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Budapest. At the end of her swim on Wednesday (local time) she became unconscious and sank to the bottom of the pool. Head coach Andrea Fuentes dived in, fully clothed, to rescue Alvarez. ""It was a good scare,"" Fuentes told Spanish sports newspaper Macra. ""I had to dive because the lifeguards didn't do it. I was scared because I could see she wasn't breathing."" The underwater rescue was captured by AFP photographer Oli Scarff. Fuentes brought Alvarez to the surface, where another swimmer helped her take Alvarez to the edge of the pool. Alvarez was lifted out of the water and onto a stretcher to receive medical attention. In a statement, Fuentes said Alvarez had a medical emergency but was OK. ""The doctors checked all vitals and everything is normal: heart rate, oxygen, sugar levels, blood pressure, etc … all is okay,"" Fuentes said. ""We sometimes forget that this happens in other high-endurance sports. ""We all have seen images where some athletes don't make it to the finish line and others help them to get there. ""Our sport is no different than others, just in a pool, we push through limits and sometimes we find them. ""Anita feels good now and the doctors also say she is okay. Tomorrow she will rest all day and will decide with the doctor if she can swim free team finals or not. Thank you for all of your well wishes for Anita."" This is not the first time Alvarez has had a medical emergency in the pool. She briefly lost consciousness at the end of a routine during an Olympic qualification event in Barcelona in June 2021. It was Fuentes again who dived in to rescue her. Alvarez came seventh on Wednesday with a score of 87.6333. The women's solo free was won by Japan's Yukiko Inui, who scored 95.3667.

5,'The whole place is underwater': South Asia's record-breaking floods could be a sign of a new catastrophic reality,world,"  South Asia's record-breaking weather set to worsen as climate change brings more dangerous monsoon seasons Shatadeepa is familiar with the heavy rain that heralds monsoon season in the Indian town of Silchar, but this year she has witnessed flooding like no other. Last month, as one side of India's north faced a heatwave with the hottest temperatures on record, Shatadeepa's hometown in the east was dealing with unseasonable and devastating flooding. Now Silchar has been inundated again, this time with what has been described as the worst flooding in a century. ""I live with my parents, we stay in a four-storey building on the first floor and now our apartment is totally underwater, up to our necks, and that water is rising,"" she says. South Asia, a region with millions of the most vulnerable people in the world, has this year become the embodiment of climate extremes and weather records. In Pakistan's Turbat, people faced temperatures of almost 50 degrees Celsius during a May heatwave, previously unseen at that time of year. A few weeks later, melting Himalayan glaciers caused flooding and a bridge to collapse. On Friday, the Indian town of Mawsynram, which is known as the wettest place on Earth and is near Shatadeepa's home, set a new June rainfall record of more than 990 millimetres. ""Record-breaking"" is a term that's lost all meaning in South Asia this year with constant, unprecedented weather events debilitating people living through them. Higher temperatures and heavy rainfall are common during the region's annual monsoon season from June until September. But research has shown they are getting more erratic and unpredictable because of climate change. In neighbouring Bangladesh, a quarter of people have now been displaced because of flooding. Swollen rivers have cut them off from essential supplies and communication lines. Tarek Rubbani is in one of the worst-affected towns in Sylhet, in northern Bangladesh. It has had no electricity for five days after the town was submerged. Mr Rubbani spoke to the ABC using the last of his phone battery. ""The whole place is underwater, many people are dying, and a police officer died a few hours ago,"" he says. ""With extreme levels of flooding, it's raining heavily, there's no electricity or wi-fi. People have no food."" In the first wave of floods, millions of people were displaced. But before they had time to rebuild their lives, record-breaking flooding caused further damage, triggering a humanitarian crisis. People can't access food or clean drinking water, so the military is handing out supplies to residents who have sought safety on the upper floors of buildings or in schools turned into shelters. This is how extreme weather affects day-to-day people and it's something Mr Rubbani says his parents and grandparents never experienced. ""The previous generations didn't face disasters like this,"" he says. ""This area often faces flooding but this time it's extreme, something the older generations didn't ever face in their lives."" The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found India will be one of the countries most vulnerable to weather events caused by warming temperatures. It has also said 17 per cent of people in Bangladesh will have to be relocated in the next decade because of rising temperatures. While South Asia has an annual monsoon season, which can often cause flooding, research shows these periods are getting wetter and more dangerous because of climate change. ""The flood intensity has been increasing year on year and that has been quite a big issue for communities who live along the river both in India and Bangladesh,"" Mirza Zulfiqur Rahman, a water researcher from India's Institute of Technology, told the ABC. ""The catastrophic nature of the floods is basically assessed by how communities are being able to adapt to it. ""So earlier, the floods used to happen in one cycle but now the floods are happening in five different cycles within a given year."" Mr Rahman says the millions of people affected by these worsening floods are struggling to adapt to them. ""Communities were being able to adapt to floods easily but now it is becoming increasingly difficult for them in the face of climate change events, as well as in combination with whatever infrastructure that we have laid on the ground,"" he says. ""That combination is actually creating quite a lot of disaster."" But it's not just climate change that's contributing to the chaos of these extreme weather events. Researchers say towns and cities haven't been built to withstand the changing environment. More than 160 million people live in Bangladesh, for example, in low-lying areas prone to floods and cyclones. Meanwhile, experts suggest many cities also likely to face sweltering temperatures in South Asia are full of tall buildings and flats that absorb and retain heat. ""It is the combination of climate change plus the infrastructural interventions that we have done without properly scientifically studying the flood plain,"" Mr Rahman says. ""That is actually creating the problem in [these] popular population-dense areas of north-east India and Bangladesh."" It has also made it difficult for emergency services to get aid to people in these flood zones. ""Is there a way to get drinking water to our area? Each and every one of us must have water for drinking, but I think everyone is very helpless,"" Shatadeepa says. ""The government is trying to help their cars and fix the damage, everyone's cars are getting submerged underwater. ""People will have big financial losses after the flood winds up."" South Asian researchers are now calling for developed countries like Australia to help with climate forecasting. ""Australia, which has advancements in flood forecasting and other integrated water resource management, ideas and knowledge, can definitely help South Asia,"" Mr Rahman says. ""That can actually help communities to better plan their water infrastructures so that these do not lead to catastrophic events."" As politicians continue to argue about how to deal with what they say are the future effects of climate change, people in South Asia are facing it in the here and now. It's not just leading to deaths and humanitarian problems, but also economic damage in some of the poorest parts of the world. Researchers say global unity is the only way to fix this global problem. ""Include India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and China together and have a kind of a multilateral understanding on the ecology of this region,"" Mr Rahman says. ""Because interventions on a national scale will only accelerate these kinds of disasters in the future. ""We have to get this conversation going on a regional basis."" In the meantime, people like Shatadeepa say all they can do is hope things will get better. ""I wish to God almighty this situation will clear soon. So I am praying,"" she says.

6,Here's what would happen if Ukraine joined the European Union,world,"  Ukraine is set to become an official candidate for European Union membership, according to ministers and diplomats, in a symbolic but morale-boosting decision after Russia's invasion. EU leaders in Brussels are expected to sign off on last week's recommendation by the European Commission, the EU executive. Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz and Mario Draghi arrive in Kyiv to show their support for Ukraine during the Russian assault. After several days of internal EU discussions, no opposition among the 27 member states has surfaced, three diplomats said. ""We are working towards the point where we tell Russian President Vladimir that Ukraine belongs to Europe, that we will also defend the values that Ukraine defends,"" Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told reporters before a meeting with other EU ministers. But what would actually happen if Ukraine joined the European Union? Here's a rundown of what a possible membership would look like. The candidacy is the beginning of a process that requires extensive reforms to conform with a host of standards, ranging from judicial policy to financial services and food safety. Still, the EU decision puts Kyiv on course to realise an aspiration that would have been out of reach just months ago. The process consists of several steps, including adopting all of the European Union's laws and regulations. This normally takes a number of years. Lastly, the candidate signs an accession treaty, which all of the other EU countries have to approve. The European Union is a mostly economic and political organisation, not a military alliance like NATO is. This means membership would not necessarily see EU member states directly take up arms in the war with Russia. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies must be prepared for a long conflict and ""must not let up"" in their economic and material support. Still, the membership can make a big economic difference, like it did with Bulgaria and Romania, whose GDP respectively doubled and almost tripled since becoming a part of the EU. On top of that, there are military benefits. The EU has a mutual defence clause, which states that if an EU country is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, other EU countries have an obligation to aid and assist it by all means in their power. Although the candidate status is mainly symbolic, the move will help lift national morale at a very difficult time in a four-month conflict that has killed thousands, displaced millions and flattened towns and cities. If admitted, Ukraine would be the EU's largest country by area and its fifth-most populous. Aside from the 27 European member states that agreed on Ukraine's candidacy, US President Joe Biden has also spoken out about possible membership of the war-torn country, saying it is ""very likely to happen"". ""Ukrainians are ready to die for the European perspective,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. ""We want them to live with us the European dream."" The Dutch government announced it would back Ukraine's EU candidate status, calling the European Commission's advice ""a smart compromise"". ""[Candidate status] is a correct solution from a moral, economic and security perspective,"" Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said alongside French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he believed all European Union members would back granting Ukraine EU candidate status, adding: ""This is like going into the light from the darkness."" In a grievance-filled speech in St Petersburg, Russian President Vladimir Putin railed at the West and the United States in particular, but sought to play down the EU issue. ""We have nothing against it,"" he said. ""It is not a military bloc. It's the right of any country to join economic union."" He also questioned whether it was ""advisable"" for the EU to permit Ukraine to join, saying Kyiv would need huge economic subsidies that other EU members may not be willing to give. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was closely following Ukraine's EU bid, especially in the light of increased defence cooperation among the 27-member bloc. While the recommendation marks a strategic eastward shift by the EU in the face of Russia's war in Ukraine, Kyiv would likely take years to become a member of the 27-nation union, if at all. Many assumed large-scale, brutal conflict lay in the past, but the 116 days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine have proven massed attrition-style wars may occur in our near future, writes Mick Ryan. EU membership after candidacy is not guaranteed — talks have been stalled for years with Turkey, a candidate since 1999. ""Ukraine has already implemented roughly 70 per cent of EU rules, norms and standards. Yet important work remains to be done, on the rule of law, oligarchs, anti-corruption and fundamental rights,"" Mrs Von der Leyen said. On top of that, Ukraine and Moldova, another candidate, are far poorer than existing EU members, with per capita output around half that of the current poorest, Bulgaria. They also have recent histories of volatile politics, corruption, organised crime and conflicts with Russian-backed separatists. In order to become a member, Ukraine would be required to carry out economic and political reforms and it is unlikely the bloc would take in a country in a state of war. At times of peace, it took Poland, Ukraine's neighbour with similar population size and communist history, 10 years from applying for membership in 1994 to actually joining in 2004. Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania, some of the more recent members, took around 10 years to leave their candidate status, so it might be a while until Ukraine can officially join the union.

7,How is the Taliban handling Afghanistan's earthquake response?,world,"  What do we know about the Afghanistan earthquake and why is the region so vulnerable? More than 1,000 people have been killed after a powerful 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck a town in Afghanistan on Wednesday. It was the deadliest quake in the country since 2002. The Taliban's supreme leader has appealed for international aid, but what help is on the way? The earthquake struck in the Paktika province, about 44 kilometres from the south-eastern city of Khost, near the border with Pakistan, the US Geological Survey said. Experts put its depth at just 10 kilometres. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage. Here's what else we know about the disaster that's struck the rural, mountainous region: Resident Shamira is in hospital with her one-year-old grandson, who is being treated after being struck on the head by a piece of debris. She is among the thousands of people who have lost their homes and need help. ""Three of our relatives were trapped under the rubble. There's nothing left of our house. If someone buys a tent, we will find a place to put it and live there — we have no choice."" Resident Gul Faraz received treatment for injuries with his wife and children at a hospital in Paktika. He said some family members had been killed. ""We were all sleeping at home... and the room fell over us. ""All the houses in our area were destroyed, not one, but the entire region has been destroyed."" Resident Firdaus Khan told the ABC that the only public hospital in the province had been overwhelmed by earthquake victims. ""Most of the victims are women and children because they were caught asleep by the calamity … there is absolute shortage of resources, doctors and all other things needed. ""People don't know what to do."" Resident Dalil Khan said thousands of homes had been ruined. ""Around 2,000 to 2,500 houses have been fully destroyed and many people were wounded. All the houses are destroyed and now we need tents and all other necessary items,"" Mr Khan said. A hospital worker in Paktika province said rescue efforts were ongoing. ""Many people are still buried under the soil. The rescue teams of the Islamic Emirate have arrived and with the help of local people are trying to take out the dead and injured. Kabul-based tailor Ruh Ullah said he was traumatised and worried about family members in the region. ""Ever since I have heard of the devastation back home, I am crying, the mobile phone connections are not properly working and no-one is telling me if my extended family members are alive or not."" Medical aid director Stefano Sozza, Afghanistan country director for the Italian medical aid group Emergency, said the group has sent seven ambulances and staff to areas near the quake zone. ""The fear is that the victims will increase further, also because many people could be trapped under collapsed buildings."" This will be the seventh earthquake that has killed more than 100 people since 1991, and it's the deadliest in two decades. The country has a long history of earthquakes, many in the mountainous Hindu Kush region bordering Pakistan. Afghanistan is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes because it’s where the Eurasoan, Arabian and Indian tectonic plates meet. It’s also on the Alpide belt, which is an expanse of mountain ranges that is prone to earthquake activity. Death tolls have been worsened by the remote locations of many quakes and decades of war that have left infrastructure in dangerous conditions. Here are the most recent deadly earthquakes that have happened in Afghanistan: The disaster has posed a new test for Afghanistan's Taliban rulers and relief agencies already struggling with the country’s multiple humanitarian crises. The Taliban’s supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzadah, who almost never appears in public, has pleaded with the international community and humanitarian organisations “to help the Afghan people affected by this great tragedy and to spare no effort"". Ramiz Alakbarov, the UN's deputy special representative to Afghanistan, said the Taliban hadn't formally requested that the UN mobilise international search-and-rescue teams or obtain equipment from neighbouring countries to supplement the few dozen ambulances and several helicopters sent in by Afghan authorities. Still, officials from multiple UN agencies said the Taliban were giving them full access to the area. Humanitarian agencies still operating in the country, including UNICEF, rushed supplies to the quake-stricken areas. Pakistan said it would send food, tents, blankets and other essentials and India has also come forward and said that it will help. Meanwhile, the US State Department said it wasn't aware of any request for American assistance from Afghanistan's Taliban government after the quake. The US expects the humanitarian response to the disaster to be a topic of conversation between Taliban and US officials in the coming days, State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters. Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong has described the disaster as ""heartbreaking"", acknowledging the local Afghan community has lost many relatives and loved ones. Senator Wong says Australia will work with partner nations to respond to the humanitarian emergency. The Norwegian Refugee Council's country director in Afghanistan, Neil Turner, said the group was already assessing the damage in the Khost province, close to the epicentre. ""We need to make sure that the aid gets through effectively to the places that are needed,"" he said.

8,"Xi Jinping warns of 'alarm for humanity' in Ukraine during virtual summit with Putin, world leaders",world,"  Chinese leader Xi Jinping has said the conflict in Ukraine has ""sounded an alarm for humanity"", and at the same time condemned US-led sanctions against Russia, accusing the West of provoking Moscow. Mr Xi was speaking on Wednesday at the opening of a virtual meeting of the world's leading emerging market economies, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, or ""BRICS"". His keynote speech reinforced China's ongoing support for Russia in the European conflict, and would have come as welcome news to President Vladimir Putin, who was also in attendance. ""The Ukraine crisis has again sounded the alarm for humanity,"" the official Xinhua News Agency quoted Mr Xi as saying. ""Countries will surely end up in security hardships if they place blind faith in their positions of strength, expand military alliances, and seek their own safety at the expense of others,"" he added. In other comments, Mr Xi said imposing sanctions could act as a ""boomerang"" and a ""double-edged sword,"" and that the global community would suffer from ""politicising, mechanising and weaponising"" global economic trends and financial flows. Mr Xi also said China would seek to reduce the damage to international supply chains caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which it has confronted with a hard-line policy of lockdowns and quarantines, despite a diminishing number of cases and the increasing economic cost. Chinese President Xi Jinping reasserted his country's support for Russia on issues of sovereignty and security during a phone call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. China's increasingly assertive foreign policy and drive to dominate global markets have prompted a backlash in the US, Europe and elsewhere, including calls to replace Chinese suppliers and reduce reliance on the Chinese economy. Mr Xi called for nations to work together on such issues, saying efforts to ""build a small courtyard with high walls"" was in no one's interest. ""Economic globalisation is an objective requirement for the development of productive forces and an irresistible historical trend,"" Mr Xi said. ""Going backwards in history and trying to block other people's road will only block your own road in the end.""

9,Trumpet the first bloodhound to win Westminster Dog Show,world,"  Trumpet the bloodhound crowned overall winner of Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show A bloodhound named Trumpet has won the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Trumpet beat a French bulldog, a German shepherd, a Maltese, an English setter, a Samoyed and a Lakeland terrier to take the Best in Show trophy. ""I am so excited for Trumpet,"" said handler Heather Helmer, who co-owns and bred the four-year-old. Trumpet became the first bloodhound to win the Westminster show. Winston, a French bulldog co-owned by NFL defensive lineman Morgan Fox, took second in the nation's most prestigious dog show. The competition drew more than 3,000 purebred dogs, ranging from affenpinschers to Yorkshire terriers. The goal is to crown the dog that most represents the ideal for its breed. Usually held in winter at New York City's Madison Square Garden, the show moved to the suburban Lyndhurst estate last year and this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Westminster is often described as the Super Bowl of US dog shows, and Winston aimed to make it so for Fox, a defensive lineman who was just signed by the Los Angeles Chargers and has played for the Los Angeles Rams and the Carolina Panthers. Before the finals, Fox said he was ""ecstatic"" when Winston made it there. ""He's basically a superstar,"" Fox said. The dog came his way from his grandmother, Sandy Fox, who has bred and shown Frenchies for years. Morgan Fox grew up with one and said as he watched Winston mature, he knew the dog was a winner in both appearance and character. ""He's a joy to be around,"" Fox said. ""He always walks around with as much of a smile on his face as a dog can have."" Winston faced Striker, a Samoyed that also made the finals last year; River, a big-winning German shepherd; and eventual champion Trumpet, descended from the 2014 winner of another major show, the Thanksgiving-season National Dog Show.

10,Police chief put on leave over 'abject failure' in Robb Elementary School shooting response,world,"  Uvalde police chief Pete Arredondo put on leave following Robb Elementary School shooting response Uvalde school district's police chief has been put on administrative leave following allegations he erred in his response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School, in Texas, which left 19 students and two teachers dead. Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Superintendent Hal Harrell said he put police chief Pete Arredondo on leave and another officer would assume the embattled chief's duties. In a statement, Mr Harrell did not give a reason for removing Chief Arredondo but said it remains unclear when district officials will know the outcome of the investigation into the shooting. Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Colonel Steven McCraw, told a state senate hearing on Tuesday that Chief Arredondo — the on-site commander — made ""terrible decisions"" as the massacre unfolded on May 24. He said the police response was an ""abject failure."" Three minutes after 18-year-old Salvador Ramos entered the school, sufficient armed law enforcement were on scene to stop the gunman, Colonel McCraw testified. Yet, police officers armed with rifles waited in a school hallway for more than an hour while the gunman carried out the massacre. Colonel McCraw said the classroom door could not be locked from the inside, but there is no indication officers tried to open the door while the gunman was inside. According to Colonel McCraw, parents begged police outside the school to move in and students inside the classroom repeatedly pleaded with 911 operators for help while more than a dozen officers waited in a hallway. Officers from other agencies urged Chief Arredondo to let them move in because children were in danger. ""The only thing stopping a hallway of dedicated officers from entering Room 111 and 112 was the on-scene commander who decided to place the lives of officers before the lives of children,"" he said.

11,Rescue efforts underway as floods inundate southern China,world,"  South China floods force tens of thousands to evacuate, rescue efforts underway Major flooding has forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people in southern China, with more rain expected. Much of the flooding has affected Guangdong, China's most populous province, where the flood alert rose to Level I, the highest, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Around half a million people have been displaced, largely in the cities of Shaoguan, Heyuan and Meizhou. Authorities asked residents of communities along river banks and in low-lying neighbourhoods to move to higher ground, after floodwaters hit a 50-year high. The heavy rainfall has collapsed roads in some parts of cities and swept away houses, cars and crops, and more rain is forecast for coming days. Rescuers were seen assisting people into speedboats and transporting them over floodwater. Military personnel were deployed to place sandbags along the banks of the Beijiang River. In nearby Jiangxi province, the floodwaters inundated the homes of an additional 485,000 people. In Zhejiang province north of Guangdong, rescue crews in inflatable boats brought out residents trapped in their homes in inundated villages. Further north, storm warnings were issued for much of the eastern provinces, including the capital Beijing, while reservoirs in the central province of Henan were at flood level and releasing torrents of water downstream. China regularly experiences flooding during the summer months, most frequently in central and southern areas that tend to receive the most rainfall. This year's flooding is the worst in decades in some areas and comes on top of strict COVID-19 regulations that have strangled travel, employment and ordinary life in much of the country. China's worst floods in recent years were in 1998, when more than 2,000 people died and almost 3 million homes were destroyed. The government has invested heavily in flood control and hydro power projects. Globally, more intense tropical storms are on the rise as a result of climate change, leading to increased flooding that threatens lives, crops and groundwater.

12,Senior Chinese police official sacked following violent attack on women that sparked national outrage,world,"  Senior police official sacked in China after attack on group of women in a restaurant A deputy police director in China has been sacked after a violent attack on a group of women at a restaurant in northern China that sparked nationwide outrage. Warning: The following story contains descriptions and vision of a graphic nature. The Hebei province Public Security Department said in-depth investigations were being carried out into the slow response to incidents and ""serious violations of laws and discipline"" by police in the city of Tangshan, which is about 150 kilometres east of Beijing. Two of the four victims remain hospitalised 11 days after the assault, which has raised concern about public safety and the mistreatment of women in society. Hundreds of thousands of people commented after videos of the attack were posted online, many calling for justice. Police arrived at the scene 28 minutes after they received the report, and the injured had been sent to the hospital by the time they arrived, provincial authorities said in a statement. The deputy chief of the Tangshan police Lubei branch, which was responsible for the initial handling of the case, has been removed from office. A report from district police described the authorities' response as ""slow and improper"". Four women eating at a late-night barbecue restaurant were attacked by a group of men in the early hours of June 10, after one of the women appeared to reject the advances of one of the men and fought back after she was slapped, surveillance video from the restaurant showed. The attackers could be seen shoving the women to the ground, kicking them, throwing a chair at them, and later dragging one of the women out of the restaurant to continue beating her on the footpath. One had a bloodied and swollen face as she was taken away on a stretcher. Nine suspects were arrested the next day. In recent days, rumours have spread online that at least one of the women had died, but the Hebei public security statement appeared to contradict that. It said that the conditions of the two hospitalised women were improving and that they had sustained ""second-degree light injuries"". Xiaoxuan has taken one of China's biggest media stars to court over sexual harassment allegations in what is a landmark MeToo case for the country. The other two women were slightly injured and not hospitalised, the statement said. While some online comments applauded the statement for refuting the rumours, more raised questions about the severity of the women's injuries and the slow initial response of the police. Reports of a series of gang crimes in Tangshan surfaced after the attack, along with public questioning of alleged ties between the police and gang members. The investigation into the case has been transferred to police in another jurisdiction, the city of Langfang, which is also in Hebei province. The Hebei province anti-corruption body said on Tuesday that five police officers were under investigation, including the chief of the Lubei branch in Tangshan and at least two others from a police station under the Lubei branch.

13,Hong Kong's Jumbo Floating Restaurant capsizes at sea,world,"  Hong Kong's Jumbo Floating Restaurant capsizes at sea four days after leaving harbour Hong Kong's iconic Jumbo Floating Restaurant has capsized in the South China Sea less than a week after being towed away from the city, its parent company says. The restaurant encountered ""adverse conditions"" on Saturday as it was passing the Xisha Islands, also known as the Paracel Islands, in the South China Sea, and water entered the vessel and it began to tip, according to Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises. The company said no-one was injured, but efforts to save the vessel failed and it capsized on Sunday. ""As the water depth at the scene is over 1,000 meters, [it makes it] extremely difficult to carry out salvage works,"" it said in a statement. It said the company was ""very saddened by this accident"". The Jumbo Floating Restaurant, almost 80 metres in length, was a Hong Kong landmark for over four decades, serving Cantonese cuisine to more than 3 million guests, including Queen Elizabeth II and actor Tom Cruise. It closed in 2020 due to the pandemic, laying off all its staff. Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises said the restaurant became a financial burden to its shareholders, with millions of Hong Kong dollars spent on its inspection and maintenance even though it was not in operation. The restaurant was towed away last Tuesday, with the company saying it planned to move it to a lower-cost site where maintenance could be carried out. It said that prior to its departure, the vessel had been thoroughly inspected by marine engineers, hoardings were installed, and all relevant approvals were obtained. ""The company is now getting further details of the accident from the towing company,"" the statement said.

14,Imran Khan is rallying support for a return to the Pakistani prime ministership,world,"  Imran Khan wants rule of law and an Islamic welfare state in Pakistan Pakistan's ousted prime minister, Imran Khan says the people of Pakistan believe even a poor democracy would be better than a military government. He spoke with ABC's India Now! Host Marc Fennell as he continues to rally grassroots support to demand new elections. Protests have continued in Pakistan among supporters of the deposed prime minister, as the country also faces the serious challenges of rising inflation as well as soaring fuel and food prices. Mr Khan was ousted as prime minister on April 10 following a no-confidence vote. He's since alleged this was part of a conspiracy, pushed by the United States administration because it was unhappy with his foreign policy decisions. Yet there were claims that he'd lost crucial military support. Since then, he's campaigned publicly to be returned to the Prime Minister's Office in Pakistan. ""I think there's consensus in the country that even a poor democratic government is better than a military government,"" Mr Khan told India Now! ""Because, when the military intervention takes place, we go back to square one."" ""So that's why our democracy has not flourished as yet, our democratic institutions haven't got stronger, because we go back to square one when the military takes over."" Elected in July, 2018, Mr Khan promised to fight corruption and fix the economy. He maintains his government was balancing rising prices and economic sentiment. However, as the cost of living in Pakistan rose, the opposition parties blamed him and the no-confidence motion followed. His successors claim that the economic woes faced by Pakistan are his legacy. He insisted the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and commodity prices worldwide were being managed, but the regime change sent the markets into meltdown. No prime minister has completed a full term of office in Pakistan. Mr Khan says his departure was different because it didn't occur under the shroud of corruption. He argues that Pakistan has been ruled by the military for most of its history, its importance was enhanced by the threat posed by India, and two families — the Bhutto and Sharif families. ""These two families have been ruling Pakistan for 30 years — now, the parties that were fighting have joined hands and are in government."" Mr Khan was replaced in April by Shehbaz Sharif, the younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was convicted in 2018 of having owned assets beyond his income. ""My government was replaced by a government where 60 per cent of the cabinet is on bail,"" Mr Khan says. ""Rather than having a roadmap to fix the economy, all they're doing is trying to get rid of the corruption cases of billions of rupees."" Mr Khan claims he has evidence that the United States demanded change. He alleges that, on March 7, 2022, US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, Donald Lu, sent a message to him through Pakistan's ambassador to the US, Asad Majeed Khan: ""If I'm removed, then all will be forgiven."" ""Now there is this American official, threatening our ambassador,"" Mr Khan says. He's asked for an inquiry into his allegations that the US has participated in regime change. ""There is no truth to these allegations,"" a US State Department spokesman said in April after he first made the claim. Mr Khan does not want any foreign interference in Pakistan. ""I don't want any support from foreign governments to get into power,"" Mr Khan says. ""Let the people of Pakistan decide whoever they think is best to rule or govern the country."" When asked this question by the India Now! host, Mr Khan replied: ""Because, Marc, this is insulting for a country of 220 million people that an elected prime minister is removed by this conspiracy."" Mr Khan argued his policies on Afghanistan, Russian and China had upset Washington — he was in Moscow the day Putin's troops crossed the border. He says he was there to negotiate wheat and oil supplies and, while the timing was bad, he didn't know what was about to occur. He's also been dubbed ""Taliban Khan"" for his perceived support for the Taliban. He insists the Taliban are a religious fundamentalist group, not terrorists. ""You know, somehow, we were made to be sort of friendly with Taliban, or sympathetic with them,"" Mr Khan explains. ""People like us are sympathetic with the people of Afghanistan and, right now, you have Taliban as a reality. ""The world should work with them, because there is no other reality in Afghanistan now."" On an episode of India Now!, that country's High Commissioner to Australia, Manpreet Vohra, said relations between India and Pakistan were strained because of Pakistan's support for terror organisations in the region. Mr Khan rejects this and says Kashmir is the sticking point in the relationship — that is, he says, the denial of the Indian government for the Kashmiri people to determine their own future. ""India blames every incident that takes place in Kashmir on Pakistan,"" he explains. ""The answer is not blaming Pakistan. The answer is to give the people of Kashmir the right to decide their own future."" Imran Khan maintains the rule of law and an Islamic welfare state are the future of Pakistan he'd like to see. ""When I first went to England as a teenager, the two things that inspired me were the rule of law, and a welfare state,"" he says. ""When I studied my own history, the first welfare state in the history of mankind was made by The Prophet Muhammad … this is what I want.""

15,Worried about lettuce? Try living in one of the world's most expensive cities as inflation surges,world,"  Worried about the cost of living? This is the impact inflation is having in some of the world's most expensive cities Australia isn't the only country seeing everyday items like iceberg lettuce go from basic to bougie. Across the globe, people are feeling the pinch as surging inflation becomes a ""global phenomenon"". In some countries, people are already witnessing grocery prices doubling and experts say we're yet to see inflation peak. This is how life is being impacted in some of the most expensive cities in the world. In Hong Kong, Yifan Jin chooses to live in a long-stay hotel close to where she works as a tax consultant rather than rent an apartment. The 26-year-old pays around $HK12,000 ($2,177) per month — an amount she says would not guarantee her a ""good and decent"" flat. ""For $HK12,000, you can only rent rooms in old buildings, with broken toilets, thin glass windows, all kinds of problems,"" Ms Jin told the ABC. Ms Jin describes herself as a ""Hong Kong drifter"", referring to a group born in mainland China but living in Hong Kong. She said most ""Hong Kong drifters"" spend more than one-third of their salaries on rent, which makes life difficult as cost of living rises in the notoriously expensive city. After paying for rent, food and other daily necessities ""there's nothing left"", she said. Hong Kong was ranked at the top of ECA International's 2022 list of most expensive cities to live in. The global mobility company's annual report compares commonly purchased consumer goods, household staples, rents, public transport, and factors in the strength of local currency. The report considered 207 cities in 120 countries and territories, focusing on expats and foreign workers. Although Hong Kong has been less impacted by rising global inflation than other locations, price increases were higher than what is typically witnessed in the city, the report said. It found that a cup of coffee was around $7 and 1 kilogram of tomatoes had gone up to $16.39. Anna Michielsen, ECA's Australia, New Zealand and Pacific general manager, was shocked at the rate at which prices were increasing for everyday goods. ""We're surprised at how quickly and across how many locations inflation has escalated,"" Ms Michielsen said. ""We're not alone in this in any way, shape or form."" No Australian capital cities were among the 10 most expensive, but were all ranked in the top 100, except for Hobart which wasn't included in the report. Sydney was ranked as the most expensive Australian city, coming in at 39. Five of the top cities ranked in the ECA report were in Asia, including Shanghai, which came in at number eight. Jerry Jiang started experiencing skyrocketing food prices about two months ago when China imposed strict COVID lockdowns on the country's second-largest city. ""In April, Shanghai faced a supply shortage at the beginning of the lockdown for a while, so prices surged very fast,"" he said. ""Everything is getting more expensive, like dining out, getting a haircut, rents, petrol, et cetera."" Tomatoes cost almost double what they did a year ago. Mr Jiang is still under lockdown, meaning he is forced to shop online, which is more expensive than at the markets. Katrina Ell, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, said the pandemic was the initial trigger for the increases, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine created a scenario that ""no one expected"". Ukraine's war with Russia is exacerbating an already alarming global food crisis. ""Just as the pandemic was kind of easing off, Russia's invasion of Ukraine threw another spanner in the works and really pushed inflation beyond expectations,"" Ms Ell told the ABC. ""What we're seeing is that it's almost been a perfect storm of factors that have really driven this surge in acceleration that has been a global phenomenon."" The war has pushed up the price of food and energy because both Russia and Ukraine are important suppliers of those commodities. ""Ukraine is an important supplier of fertiliser, wheat, and other really critical non-specific food items. So that's an additional kind of push,"" Ms Ell said. Cities across Asia have been particularly impacted due to their reliance on food and energy imports. ""Within Asia, there are some interesting dynamics at play,"" Ms Ell said. ""Places like Singapore import all their food needs… they're really exposed to that spike in global prices."" Some countries are also restricting their exports to try and keep their own food prices down to the detriment of others, which is further adding to the stress within Asia, she added. Alexander Ponting, an English teacher who moved to Seoul last year, is thankful that things like public transport and coffee are so cheap. But he continues to be shocked by food prices in Seoul, which was ranked as the 10th most expensive city to live in. ""Fruit and vegetables are insanely expensive,"" Mr Ponting said. ""In the UK, a bag of spinach will be like 70 pence ($1.22) or something but here it will cost you three pounds ($5.26)."" Apples are around one pound for a bag in the UK and in Seoul he can pay up to six or seven pounds. In the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, fruit and vegetable prices are nearly doubling. ""The food in Israel is based on vegetables so it's pretty dramatic,"" Tel Aviv resident Ronnie Brodetzky told the ABC. Lettuce used to be four shekels ($1.6) and now it's seven shekels, she said. ""Tomatoes became between 10 to 12 shekels when normally they were four to six. Everything is much more expensive."" Tel Aviv was ranked as number six on ECA's list, while a recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit named Tel Aviv as the world's most expensive city. Ms Brodetzky said the increasing cost of living is becoming a daily topic of conversation. ""I'm feeling a lot of tension, everyone in Israel is,"" she said. ""No-one knows what is going to happen with so much chaos in the world."" Rents have increased 10-14 per cent since COVID, and even activities like going to the swimming pool costs up to 80 shekels when it used to be between 20 and 40. ""When I was a kid, everything was cheap and normal. You wouldn't need to be rich to be able to enjoy your life,"" the 38-year-old said. ""Nowadays, even if you are middle class and have a good salary like me it's not enough. You need to be really rich."" The US has been dominating headlines as it tries to control an inflation rate that has reached a 40-year high. It's not an exaggeration to say millions of Australian households are needing to foot hundreds of extra dollars a week to keep a roof over their head, the lights on and food on the table — and wages aren't keeping up. Last week, the Federal Reserve rolled out its biggest rate hike since 1994 and there are fears the world's largest economy will slip into a recession. But in New York, which was ranked number two on the ECA list, many locals have become desensitised to high costs of living. Beata Kanter said prices have been increasing by ""a dollar here and there"". ""It's more these little incremental increases that probably go unnoticed in day-to-day life,"" she told the ABC. ""New York is already so expensive, so I've been used to spending $US8 ($11.50) on an iced coffee for a long time now."" Mark Dessaix, a New York-based actor from Sydney, hadn't noticed any ""major leaps and bounds"" until recently. The 40-year-old went to buy apples and the cost had doubled. ""In this grocery shop it was $US9 for four apples when it's usually $US4,"" he said. While everyday price increases are not something he is too concerned about, surging rents may impact Mr Dessiax's plans to move into his own apartment next year. ""I pay per month to live with three other people what I was paying to live by myself in Potts Point [in Sydney],"" he said. ""The average to live alone in a studio or one bedroom apartment here is around $US1,600 to $US1,700 a month (around $2,300-$2,440)."" A number of factors will determine how long it will take for inflation to ease, but the conflict in Ukraine plays a major role. ""Because Russia's invasion has driven that change in energy and food costs quite substantially, if that situation deteriorates then inflation will get worse across the globe,"" Ms Ell said. ""Our expectation at the moment would be that inflation will peak around the second or third quarter of this year, and then will gradually come down."" She predicts inflation to be above a rate that central banks are comfortable with through 2023. ""Because of that, we will continue to see central banks lifting rates and borrowing costs remaining elevated.""

16,'He was willing to overthrow an election': Why Trump was worse than Nixon,world,"  Why Trump was more dangerous than Nixon Fifty years ago this week, five men were arrested trying to install listening devices after breaking into the Democratic National Committee offices in Washington DC's Watergate complex. More than two years later, Republican Richard Milhous Nixon became the only American president to resign in order to avoid impeachment and conviction by Congress and removal from office. But some of those who were there half a century ago don't think the same thing would happen today. Veterans of the Watergate era warn present-day Republicans have proved unwilling to do their constitutional duty and rein in a reckless, even criminal president in Donald Trump, creating grave concerns for the future. Democracy itself could be at stake, they say. Richard Nixon's crime was trying to cover up White House involvement in the Watergate break-in, and in doing so, likely obstructing justice. There was never definitive proof Nixon had any prior knowledge of the break-in itself. Which is not to say Richard Nixon was a saint, far from it. The same group of Nixon henchmen who orchestrated the Watergate operation also conducted a wide-ranging dirty tricks campaign to aid Nixon's re-election in 1972. They committed other break-ins and plotted to blow up progressive think tank The Brookings Institution and assassinate an anti-Nixon newspaper columnist. Those who knew and worked with Nixon describe him as a brooding, paranoid, peculiar man. Highly intelligent, even brilliant in some ways, he is remembered as an almost friendless loner with a chip on his shoulder as big as Mount Rushmore. ""Nixon was very unsure of himself,"" says journalist and author Elizabeth Drew. ""He was very secretive, very suspicious … he was a very hard man to get close to."" After eight years as vice-president to Dwight Eisenhower, Nixon lost his first shot at the presidency in 1960 to John F Kennedy in an election close enough and crooked enough that he could rightly feel somewhat aggrieved. Kennedy's side proved slightly better at ballot stuffing. Nixon won another tight contest in 1968 against Hubert Humphrey, inheriting a nation at war in Vietnam and seemingly at war with itself at home over civil rights, drugs and crime. But by 1972, Nixon was riding high, cantering to re-election after his historic visit to China and with an end in sight to the war in Vietnam. In the sight of greatness, Nixon's presidency and indeed his life was about to collapse into infamy. But not right away. Watergate wasn't a major issue in the 1972 election — the links between the White House and the organisers of the break-in were yet to be fully aired in court or the congress. William Weld, as legal counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, was one of the first people to hear what came to be known as ""the smoking gun"" tape, one of thousands recorded automatically in the president's Oval Office. It proved Nixon had engaged in a cover-up beginning just days after the break-in, while publicly denying any knowledge of it. ""You had the president of the United States lying through his teeth to the American people,"" Weld says. ""Mr Nixon had masterminded the conspiracy the whole time."" Not only that, but Nixon had pressured the FBI and the US Justice Department to halt their investigations into Watergate, and it was all on tape. It was a delegation of Nixon's fellow Republicans, led by 1964 presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, who went to Nixon the day after hearing the ""smoking gun tape"" to tell him he'd lost their support and should resign immediately. Nixon did. ""Do you think that would happen today?"" Weld now asks. ""I don't think so."" Weld later became Republican governor of Massachusetts and ran for the GOP's presidential nomination against incumbent Donald Trump in 2020. Weld says in his legal opinion, Trump committed a crime by inciting a riot on January 6, 2021 when he encouraged his supporters to march on the US Capitol Building to prevent the certification of Biden's election win. ""That was a laydown case for impeachment and removal, and it got just a handful of votes on the Republican side."" Unlike 1972, when senior Republicans told Nixon to resign to avoid impeachment, when Trump was impeached first in 2020, then a second time in 2021, almost all Republicans stood by him. The constitutional guardrails are now off. Elizabeth Drew says there's another key difference: ultimately, Nixon had limits on what he was willing to do and the laws he was prepared to break, while she believes Trump does not. ""He was willing to overthrow an election, that is astonishing and terrifying,"" Drew says. Trump can run for president again in 2024 or later, but Drew thinks that's unlikely. ""Unless he thinks he can't possibly lose, he's not going to run again because his ego couldn't handle it, it's so fragile."" But she also has this word of caution, ""when people say our democracy is up for grabs, it's true.""

17,"These students must return home after studying in Australia, but they say it's not safe",world,"  Academics call on government to let Myanmar students stay in Australia due to danger back home When Rose — not her real name — first came to Australia to study, she couldn't wait to take her new-found knowledge back to her home country in South-East Asia. ""I was really excited to go back home … I always wanted to work for Myanmar,"" she said. She had hoped to give back to her community through NGO human rights work. But those dreams evaporated when the military seized control of Myanmar in a coup in February last year. Rose said it was unsafe for her to return home, and her family's safety was also at risk. She said her parents had hidden in the forest to avoid the junta's attacks on her village, and they were now internally displaced. ""Some of my friends got arrested … I don't even know whether they are still alive or dead."" Rose is one of about 30 Australia Awards scholarship recipients from Myanmar currently stranded in Australia. A condition of the government scheme is that ""all awardees must return home on completion of their studies so they can contribute to development in their country."" Dozens of Myanmar nationals are enrolled at Australian universities, but are battling poor internet connection and financial strife. ""Awardees are required to leave Australia for a minimum of two years after completing their scholarship. Failure to do so will result in the awardee incurring a debt to the Commonwealth of Australia for the total accrued cost of their scholarship,"" the policy said. But in a letter set to be delivered to new Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil, academics have called on the government to grant humanitarian protection visas to the students and waive the obligation to repay the cost of the scholarship. Nick Cheesman, director of the Myanmar Research Centre at the Australian National University, said these were ""exceptionally gifted students who have a lot to contribute to Australia, and to a future democratic Myanmar"". ""Even if these students were able to go back to Myanmar safely, the money that Australian taxpayers have spent on their education would be squandered,"" he said. ""The jobs they would have had, and opportunities to contribute for the betterment of their society are mostly gone. Until the military is ousted, they won't come back."" That is the case for another student, Soe – also not his real name – who had hoped to contribute to the economic development of Myanmar on his return. But the projects he wanted to work on have collapsed under the military junta's rule. Being forced to return to conflict-riddled Myanmar would be a risk for students, he said, many of whom have been outspoken in Australia. ""We have been involved a lot of protests … we issued statements against the military coup, against the Myanmar embassy,"" he said. ""We do have connections with friends and family who have been imprisoned or who have been arrested or … questioned by the military."" Since the coup on February 1 last year, more than 1,900 people have been killed and more than 14,000 people have been arrested by the junta, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma). Homes have been razed, villages have been burned, and a paramilitary resistance has evolved to counter army rule. More than 1 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations. The letter to Ms O'Neil, signed by 24 academics from the ANU, the University of NSW and six other Australian universities, will also argue that if attempts are made to repatriate the students, it might violate international law. ANU's Associate Professor Cheesman said it could breach the UN's anti-torture convention, as a country cannot return someone to a nation where they are in danger of being tortured. ""Torture by Myanmar soldiers and special police is systemic and arbitrary. It is happening today,"" he said. ""We know that people repatriated to Myanmar in the past have been detained and tortured because they spoke against the army while abroad. So, the danger is real."" The Department of Home Affairs said in a statement: ""Australia does not return people to their country of origin where this would be inconsistent with its obligations under international human rights instruments to which Australia is a signatory."" Among those arrested are the country's former de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and her economic adviser, Australian economist Sean Turnell. Soe said through his work before the coup, he had met Professor Turnell, who has been imprisoned in Myanmar for the past 16 months and charged under the country's Official Secrets Act. Soe said he was disappointed more had not been done in Professor Turnell's case – last week, the courts ruled his trial would proceed, despite objections from Australia. ""I feel like he had a lack of support from the Australian government … rather than more concrete pressure,"" he said. While the government has given some reprieve to students from Myanmar by allowing them to remain in Australia on three-month visa extensions, Soe said that uncertainty made it hard to find stable work. ""We get very anxious and nervous every time we are getting close to the end of the visa — we are not sure if it will be extended, or if we'll be asked to go back,"" he said. ""That limits our chances to be part of a productive and better life here."" The letter also said the former government was ""hypocritical and inconsistent"" with visas, as it granted protection to military defectors but ""inexplicably it declined to do the same for talented graduate students"". A Home Affairs spokesperson said even before the coup, Myanmar nationals were among the top-five refugee groups settled in Australia, with more than 18,400 granted offshore humanitarian visas between July 1, 2011 and May 31, 2022. In light of the situation in the country, they said 2,000 places had been made available to Myanmar nationals under the 2021-22 humanitarian program, and they would have priority processing in the 2022-23 program as well. They added that Myanmar nationals currently in Australia on temporary visas could apply for a range of visas to extend their stay, including protection visas. Aid organisation Save the Children confirms that two of its staff were killed in a Christmas Eve massacre blamed on junta troops. Associate Professor Cheesman said he had been in touch with some students who had returned to Myanmar just before the coup. Some had joined protests against military rule, others had fled or gone into hiding. ""Some quit government jobs. Others have continued in those jobs because they are afraid for themselves and their loved ones, or because they are from military families, so they are not at risk,"" he said. ""Their stories are varied. But for all of them the conditions in Myanmar are volatile. Futures that they once hoped for by obtaining degrees in Australia are now uncertain."" For Rose, what has unfolded in Myanmar is all the more crushing because she had such high hopes for her country. ""Like other young people, I was pretty optimistic. My country [had undergone] a democratic transition … there are a lot of challenges there, but we were really hopeful,"" she said. But after the coup, ""everything changed"". She became emotional when she described the disconnect between her life in Australia and the reality facing her family in Myanmar. ""I would say I'm really grateful — in Myanmar if you say something, you are in danger. You might be arrested and who knows what could happen to you."" ""Here we are safe."" Rose wants the Australian government to give fair consideration to students in her situation. ""The point of the Australia Awards [is that] they are giving the education for us to do something for our country,"" she said. ""Whether we're in Australia or whether we are in Myanmar — wherever we are, we are doing something for our home country. We won't be forgetting about Myanmar.""

18,"As the country collapses, Sri Lankans are looking to escape. Some are setting sail for Australia",world,"  Sri Lanka is on the verge of 'humanitarian emergency', with hundreds boarding boats set for Australia More than 300 Sri Lankans have tried to get to Australia in the past few weeks as the country's economic crisis has worsened, with people smugglers claiming those on board will be allowed into the country under the new Labor government. Two of the eight boats were the subject of a controversial mass text message sent by the Liberal Party and a Coalition press conference on election day, urging people to back its tough border policies. Most of the boats were intercepted by the Sri Lankan navy, but two managed to make it to Australian waters. The country is facing economic collapse, and as its people struggle with dwindling supplies of medicine, food and fuel, it is expected more will attempt the journey. Footage obtained by the ABC shows fishing trawlers packed with asylum seekers in choppy waters being caught by the Sri Lankan navy. The ABC has spoken to several people on one of those boats who were told they would be allowed into Australia under the new government. Although Labor's policy on asylum seekers is on par with the Coalition's — that no-one who arrives by boat will be allowed to resettle in Australia — people smugglers are taking advantage of the change in government to sell places on these vessels. In a statement to the ABC, an Australian Border Force (ABF) spokesman said Australia's policy was ""steadfast"". ""People who travel illegally to Australia by boat will not settle permanently here,"" he said. ""People smugglers are criminals and will use any means to earn a profit at the expense of others. In the case of people smuggling – it is people's lives at risk.' It is a straight voyage from Batticaloa on Sri Lanka's east coast to Christmas Island, off Western Australia, and it takes up to 21 days. This was a popular route for asylum seeker boats after Sri Lanka's civil war ended in 2009. People on those boats looking to enter Australia were largely from poor backgrounds and Sri Lanka's Tamil minority who said they would be persecuted in their home country. This was the case for the Nadesalingam family, who last week arrived back in the central Queensland town of Biloela after a four-year immigration battle that brought the plight of Sri Lankan asylum seekers to the front of many Australians' minds. But the boats in the recent influx have been intercepted all over Sri Lanka and the people on board have been from both Tamil and Sinhalese communities, and a range of economic backgrounds. ""What we've found is that some people have paid thousands of dollars for these journeys, so they had some kind of economic background,"" Sri Lankan navy captain Indika De Silva said. ""Earlier it used to be the poor people."" Asylum seekers from several different boats told the ABC the journey to Australia cost 1 million Sri Lankan rupees, which equates to about $4,000. ""I am a government employee, I don't have lot of money. I get a very small salary so I had to borrow the money and we paid the full amount to the boat owner,"" Sujith, a school principal, told the ABC. ""As the Australian government knows, we are struggling, we have no food to eat. We don't even know what will happen in a few months' time."" After paying, passengers are called on the morning of their journey and driven to an area where they then get on their vessel. They are loaded onto multi-day fishing trawlers that frequent Sri Lankan waters in the hopes the vessel will blend in. But naval officers say the trawlers being used have so many people on board, sometimes nearly 100, they can pick them by their heavy load. ""Multi-day fishing trawlers of Sri Lankan origin … are not that big, but they carry a lot of people, which is very dangerous,"" Captain De Silva said. The boats don't have a toilet or access to fresh water and food rations are limited. Ketheeswaran was on a boat caught near Trincomalee on Sri Lanka's east coast. ""I was asleep inside the boat, some people vomited, and the water was coming inside the boat,"" he said. ""I prayed to God when the navy flashed their lights."" The people caught trying to go to Australia were detained and most of them were released on bail, waiting for their next court appearance. The ABC has previously revealed one of Scott Morrison's final acts as prime minister was instructing the Australian Border Force to issue a public statement about the interception of an asylum seeker boat on election day. Previously, Border Force maintained total secrecy about ""operational matters"". Former home affairs minister Karen Andrews also held a press conference on election day to announce that two boats had tried to get to Australia from Sri Lanka. The Coalition was roundly criticised for politicising national security with these decisions, as well as the controversial text message sent to voters in multiple electorates on polling day. Poopalapillai was on board one of the boats intercepted by the Sri Lankan navy in waters off Batticaloa two days before the Australian election. The vessel started to sink with 40 people on board. ""The people smuggling agent said, 'The Australian government will change, the future government is a good government, and they will let you inside the country,'"" Poopalapillai told the ABC. ""The journey is very difficult, but I had to manage any way I can, I have to leave the country. ""The navy rounded up our boat and ordered us to stop. The crew wouldn't stop and, because the navy vessel was a ship, our trawler wasn't balancing, and it sank."" The new Labor government and the Coalition both support boat turnbacks, offshore detention, and resettlement in third countries. Some asylum seekers said they had no knowledge about the change in government, but many said they were told it would help their chances of entering Australia. The Australian government is running an ""anti-people-smuggling"" campaign in Sri Lanka, as well as other countries, called Zero Chance. The campaign involves a competition for ""budding filmmakers to creatively express illegal migration to Australia"", as well as online games that simulate an asylum seeker boat journey. The Australian government asks Sri Lanka filmmakers to create works about 'illegal migration'. But it is clear that misinformation about Australia's border policies is spreading through the community. ""I heard the Australian government is doing propaganda not to go to Australia by boat but the boat people end up being sent to some islands and then the people are taken into Australia,"" Poopalapillai said. The Sri Lankan navy says people smugglers are using the change in government to sell places on their boats. ""We believe the smugglers have engaged in these activities and have made it another factor to convince poor people that this change of government may be in favour of their side,"" Captain De Silva said. ""Smugglers find this difficult situation in the country as a benefit for them, they're trying to exploit the situation and people are fooled and misled by these smugglers."" While the new Labor government has granted bridging visas to the Nadesalingam family, and it is understood permanent visas are being considered, the future for other Sri Lankan asylum seekers is not clear. Sri Lanka is currently grappling with its worst economic crisis in history. The United Nations has warned the country is on the verge of a humanitarian emergency, with costs rising for basic services and the government unable to import goods with almost non-existent foreign reserves. The next four months are set to get worse, with projections that food and fuel supplies will deteriorate and people from poor backgrounds will be the worst affected. Many of the asylum seekers boarding vessels bound for Australia are from previously middle-class families who can no longer afford basic supplies, while others are from poorer backgrounds who were already struggling to survive. All say living in Sri Lanka during the crisis is now impossible. Sujith says his children and niece were on one of the most recent boats to Australia. There were 91 people on board, including children, when it was intercepted by the Sri Lankan navy at Marawila on Sri Lanka's west coast last week. ""We don't have anything to eat. We know this is not the legal route but we are risking the lives of our children because we have no other choice,"" Sujith said. ""Most of the people on the boat are from our village, my brother's daughter is only 13 and she went on the boat even though I told her not to. ""But we are fighting to stay alive, we want to give them a better life than ours."" Sujith's son Dulmeen has several qualifications — he has finished high school and done courses in heavy machine operation — but cannot find a job in Sri Lanka. Many like him told the ABC they got on the boat to go to Australia so they could send back foreign currency to their families in Sri Lanka, given the value of the rupee has plummeted and foreign currency reserves are so low. ""I don't have a job in this country, there are fuel problems and electricity problems,"" Dulmeen said. ""Since the country needs foreign currency I decided to take a risk and go. Since I have no passport, the only way out was by boat, but I didn't know how wrong or right my decision was. ""If I get the opportunity to go to Australia I would like to earn money there and send dollars to the people of Sri Lanka."" There is now pressure for Australia to help with calls from desperate Sri Lankans for the Labor government to increase its refugee intake on economic grounds. Do you know more about this story? Please get in touch at dias.avani@abc.net.au ""My appeal to the government of Australia is to welcome the refugees who are coming in boats and give them jobs,"" Dulmeen said. ""Assist Sri Lanka in their time of need, Sri Lankans are struggling at the moment."" The Australian government has said people classified as at risk are given refugee status in the country. ""In relation to refugee resettlement in Australia, priority is given to the most vulnerable applicants who are assessed as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and formally referred to Australia for resettlement,"" the Australian Border Force spokesman said. ""[And] those proposed by an immediate family member (i.e. spouses and minor aged children) or relatives residing in a regional area. ""The only way to travel to Australia is legally, with an Australian visa."" The spokesman did not answer the ABC's questions on whether priority would be given to Sri Lankans seeking refugee status due to the economic crisis. Ketheeswaran says he just wants to get a job in Australia and send money back to his family to support them. ""It's difficult to earn money in Sri Lanka, if I go to Australia, I can earn money and send back to my family to make a happy life,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to live in this country after the economic crisis, there are a lot of Sri Lankans in Australia, I thought if we go there, we can finally live happily.""

19,"Mollie O'Callaghan wins another relay medal, set for more at world swim titles",world," Sport Australia's Mollie O'Callaghan could end world swimming titles with up to six medals after latest silver in 4x200m freestyle relay Mollie O'Callaghan has raced to her third medal of the world championships in Budapest by spearheading the Australia 4x200m freestyle relay quartet to silver. Australians in finals on day five Yet, though she couldn't bring home the main prize on the anchor leg in Wednesday's final, the 18-year-old star also demonstrated earlier with an amazing swim in the 100m freestyle that a second gold could soon be on its way. Thursday also offers the scent of another gold with Zac Stubblety-Cook ready to dominate the 200m breaststroke final to complete an Olympics/world championship double. Their efforts helped bring a smile back to the Dolphins after Shayna Jack had earlier been forced to quit the championships after slipping and breaking her hand in a warm-up area. For the 23-year-old, the abrupt end to her first global competition after completing a two-year doping ban left her ""broken-hearted"". Jack posted an Instagram message from hospital, speaking of her ""shock and disbelief"", confirming scans showed she had a spiral break in her fourth metacarpal. ""This was caused by a freak accident during my 100 freestyle warm up involving another swimmer,"" Jack said. ""To ensure the fastest possible recovery for my hand, I will be returning home to AUS for surgery. ""Post surgery the plan is to return to my teammates in Charters, in preparation for the Commonwealth Games."" Later, Queenslander O'Callaghan took the limelight as she attempted to top off the efforts of Madi Wilson, Leah Neale and Kiah Melverton on the previous three legs of the 4x200 by overhauling American anchor-leg swimmer Bella Sims. But having competed a breathtaking semi-final of the 100m only an hour and a half earlier, O'Callaghan — the individual 200m silver medallist — couldn't get near the flying Sims. After fine work from Claire Weinstein, Leah Smith and the great Katie Ledecky, who produced a decisive third leg, Sims brought the US home in a championship record 7 minutes 41.45 seconds, well clear of Australia (7:43.86). O'Callaghan, though, had earlier produced an astonishing performance in her individual semi, clocking the fastest-ever second half to a women's race, amazingly shooting from last to first place over a landmark final length timed at 26.43sec. Australian gold medallist Shayna Jack is forced to the pull out of the rest of the world championships after breaking her hand during a warm-up. That was just one-hundredth of a second slower than her first half of the race and her 52.85sec saw her qualify fastest for Thursday's final, ahead of Sweden's eight-time world champion Sarah Sjostrom, who won the other race. Having also won gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay, O'Callaghan could potentially end up with six medals as she also has chances in the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay and women's 4x100m medley relay. Stubblety-Cook looks to be untouchable in his Tokyo-winning event, after after setting a time of 2:06.72 in his 200m breaststroke semi which was over two seconds faster than his nearest challenger. His own world record of 2:05.95, set at the national championships in Adelaide last month, could well be in danger as he looked to have more in reserve. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. The Dolphins have now picked up eight medals in total — two golds, five silvers and one bronze — after five days of competition to put them fourth on the table behind the USA (11 golds), Italy (four golds) and China (three golds). Teenager Elizabeth Dekkers made a breakthrough in the 200m butterfly, finishing fifth in the final in 2:07.01 behind the remarkable young Canadian champion, Summer MacIntosh, who clocked a world junior record 2:05.20. The 15-year-old MacIntosh then clocked another world junior mark in the 4x200m freestyle final with her opening leg of 1:54.79, which helped propel Canada to the silver. Kaylee McKeown had to settle for sixth in a blanket finish to the 50m backstroke — not her strongest discipline — but her 27.47sec clocking was, agonisingly, just 0.07 outside the medals as 0.08sec separated second to sixth places. Canadian Kylie Masse won in 27.31. AAP We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

That was just one-hundredth of a second slower than her first half of the race and her 52.85sec saw her qualify fastest for Thursday's final, ahead of Sweden's eight-time world champion Sarah Sjostrom, who won the other race. Having also won gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay, O'Callaghan could potentially end up with six medals as she also has chances in the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay and women's 4x100m medley relay. Stubblety-Cook looks to be untouchable in his Tokyo-winning event, after after setting a time of 2:06.72 in his 200m breaststroke semi which was over two seconds faster than his nearest challenger. His own world record of 2:05.95, set at the national championships in Adelaide last month, could well be in danger as he looked to have more in reserve. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. The Dolphins have now picked up eight medals in total — two golds, five silvers and one bronze — after five days of competition to put them fourth on the table behind the USA (11 golds), Italy (four golds) and China (three golds). Teenager Elizabeth Dekkers made a breakthrough in the 200m butterfly, finishing fifth in the final in 2:07.01 behind the remarkable young Canadian champion, Summer MacIntosh, who clocked a world junior record 2:05.20. The 15-year-old MacIntosh then clocked another world junior mark in the 4x200m freestyle final with her opening leg of 1:54.79, which helped propel Canada to the silver. Kaylee McKeown had to settle for sixth in a blanket finish to the 50m backstroke — not her strongest discipline — but her 27.47sec clocking was, agonisingly, just 0.07 outside the medals as 0.08sec separated second to sixth places. Canadian Kylie Masse won in 27.31. AAP We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

21,Baltimore Ravens star dies as year of tragedy continues for the NFL,world," Sport Baltimore linebacker Jaylon Ferguson dies as horror year continues for the NFL Baltimore Ravens linebacker Jaylon Ferguson has died at age 26. Ferguson, nicknamed 'Sack Daddy', played three NFL seasons, all with Baltimore. He set the career sacks record in the college Football Bowl Subdivision (45) when he played at Louisiana Tech. Police said the cause of death is still to be determined. ""On June 21, 2022, at approximately 11:25pm, Northern District patrol officers responded to a home in the 400 block of Ilchester Avenue for a report of a questionable death,"" Baltimore police said. ""Once there, officers located 26-year-old Jaylon Ferguson, unresponsive, being treated by medics. Ferguson never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead on the scene by medics. No signs of trauma was found or foul play suspected at this time."" Ferguson was drafted by the Ravens in the third round in 2019, and played in 38 games as a pro with 4 1/2 sacks. ""We are profoundly saddened by the tragic passing of Jaylon Ferguson,"" the Ravens said in a statement. ""He was a kind, respectful young man with a big smile and infectious personality. We express our heartfelt condolences to Jaylon's family and friends as we mourn a life lost much too soon."" Born December 14, 1995, in St Francisville, Louisiana, Ferguson played high school football and basketball at West Feliciana. At Louisiana Tech, his 45 sacks were one better than another Ravens linebacker, Terrell Suggs, achieved at Arizona State. Ferguson was a third-team AP All-American in 2018. ""The LA Tech Family mourns this morning's tragic news of the sudden death of former Bulldog great, Jaylon Ferguson,"" the Louisiana Tech football program tweeted. ""We will remember his God-given talents on the field and his infectious personality off of it. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends."" Ferguson's death continues a year of tragedy for the NFL. Arizona Cardinals cornerback Jeff Gladney died in a car crash in June, while former running back Marion Barber died two days later aged 38. Steelers quarterback Dwayne Haskins was killed in April when he was struck by a truck having exited his vehicle after it ran out of petrol. In December last year, champion wide receiver Demaryius Thomas died after suffering a seizure. Ferguson's death came as news that Tony Siragusa, the charismatic defensive tackle who helped lead a stout Baltimore defence to a Super Bowl title, had also died. He was 55. Siragusa's broadcast agent, Jim Ornstein, confirmed the death Wednesday. The cause of death was not immediately available. ""This is a really sad day,"" he said. ""Tony was way more than my client, he was family. My heart goes out to Tony's loved ones."" Siragusa, known as 'Goose', played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and five with the Ravens. Baltimore's 2000 team won the Super Bowl behind a defence that included Siragusa, Ray Lewis and Sam Adams. Siragusa was popular with fans because of his fun-loving personality, which also helped him transition quickly to broadcasting after his playing career. ""There was no one like Goose — a warrior on the field and a team unifier with a giving, generous heart who helped teammates and the community more than most people know,"" said Brian Billick, the coach of that Super Bowl-winning team. ""We would not have won the Super Bowl without him. This is such stunning, sad news.""

22,Europe could be left in the cold as IEA warns of a complete cut-off from Russian gas,world,"  Russia may cut off gas to Europe entirely, planning to redirect trade and oil to BRICS countries instead Russia may cut off gas to Europe entirely as it seeks to bolster its political leverage amid the Ukraine crisis, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) says, adding that Europe needs to prepare now. ""I wouldn't rule out Russia continuing to find different issues here and there and continuing to find excuses to further reduce gas deliveries to Europe and maybe even cut it off completely,"" IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement. ""This is the reason Europe needs contingency plans,"" Mr Birol added, saying a recent reduction in flows may be an attempt to gain political leverage ahead of higher-demand winter months. However, the IEA did not see a full cut-off as the most likely scenario, he added. The European Union has sanctioned Russian oil and coal, but has held off from banning gas imports, due in part to its heavy reliance on supplies from Moscow. In terms of total energy investment for 2022, the IEA said in a report that $2.4 trillion was set to be invested in the sector this year, including record spending on renewables. However, it added that fell short of plugging a supply gap and tackling climate change. Rising 8 per cent from the previous year, when the pandemic was more severe, the investment includes big increases in the electricity sector and efforts to bolster energy efficiency, it said in its annual investment report. Investment in oil and gas, on top of setting back efforts to reach climate goals, could not meet rising demand if energy systems were not retooled towards cleaner technology, it said. ""Today's oil and gas spending is caught between two visions of the future: It is too high for a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C but not enough to satisfy rising demand in a scenario where governments stick with today's policy settings and fail to deliver on their climate pledges,"" the agency said. With Western countries cutting ties with Russian trade and oil, Russia is said to be in the process of rerouting its enegy exports towards countries from the BRICS group of emerging economies. The BRICS countries comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. In order to weather the sanctions, Russia is trying to forge closer ties with Asia, seeking to supplant the markets it lost in the row with the European Union and the United States. In a video address to BRICS Business Forum participants, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was discussing increasing the presence of Chinese cars in the Russian market as well as the opening of Indian supermarket chains. ""In its turn, Russia's presence in the BRICS countries is growing.­­ There has been a noticeable increase in exports of Russian oil to China and India,"" Mr Putin said. According to data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs, China's crude oil imports from Russia were up 55 per cent from a year earlier to a record level in May, displacing Saudi Arabia as China's top supplier, as refiners cashed-in on discounted supplies. Mr Putin also said Russia was developing alternative mechanisms for international financial settlements jointly with its BRICS partners. ""The Russian Financial Messaging System is open for connection with the banks of the BRICS countries. The Russian MIR payment system is expanding its presence. We are exploring the possibility of creating an international reserve currency based on the basket of BRICS currencies,"" he said.

23,"analysis: America is standing on the precipice of monumental change, and there are fears it could lead to violence",world,"  The US Supreme Court's monumental decisions loom over America this June. Will it lead to violence? As the weather warms up in the United States with the arrival of summer, the relentless grind of school and work slows down. The gentler pace of June also affects the business of government. Congress will soon take a month-long break, with even President Joe Biden expected to spend occasional long weekends at his beach house in Delaware. But as many Americans plan holidays and barbecues, some feel an impending sense of doom. The US Supreme Court, on deadline to get 13 decisions off its docket before breaking for the season, is poised to dramatically reshape American life, potentially for decades. Two decisions in particular — one on the future of abortion access and the other on gun rights — are being keenly watched. Meanwhile, a House committee investigating the January 6 riot is putting pressure on the Department of Justice to potentially charge Donald Trump with a crime. But even that may not stop the former US president from announcing another bid for the White House within weeks. Whether Trump runs again or not, he has already left an indelible mark on American society. His legacy in the Supreme Court could soon be felt. And, as temperatures rise in America's capital, so too do political tensions. This series of fraught decisions and announcements could be enough to unleash another summer of violence and dissent. The US Supreme Court has been sitting for more than two centuries, retaining its quaint traditions and its cloak of secrecy. When the justices meet at the bench to hear a case, they begin their day with what's called a ""judicial handshake"" — a symbol of their unity, even when they disagree on points of law. While that tradition might continue, the court itself has never seemed so divided and its standing with part of the American community so uneasy. During his time in the White House, Mr Trump was able to install three judges to the nine-person bench, dramatically shifting the ideological balance of the highest court in the land. Now that conservative super-majority will determine the fate of two of the most vexing issues in American life: abortion and guns. As soon as tomorrow, the court could strike down a century-old restriction on carrying concealed firearms in New York. Depending on the reasoning underpinning the decision, it could mean that states can only restrict gun ownership in the most limited of cases. At the same time, the Senate is making headway on negotiations to strengthen federal gun-safety laws. The bill could be knocked out even before it reaches a vote. Since an extraordinary leak of a Supreme Court draft decision in May, the most highly — or fearfully — anticipated ruling is on abortion access. Here's what we know about a leaked bombshell document about the US Supreme Court's plans for America's abortion law. Unless multiple justices have had a major change of heart, they are expected to overturn decades of precedent by arguing there is no constitutional right to an abortion. If that happens, the court will return to the states the power to determine whether — and under what circumstances — abortion should or should not be legal. For some Americans, such as those in the anti-abortion movement, the possibility of such colossal social change is cause for celebration. But for others, it represents a devastating backslide into an earlier, more dangerous era. Support for abortion in the US varies from state to state. But at a national level, a 61 per cent majority of American adults say it should be legal in all or most cases. The position that Americans take on gun regulation is far murkier: Polls show a majority of adults support some tighter measures, but the percentage has fallen since the early 1990s, despite an increasing number of mass shootings. It's clear that, after the recent massacre at a Texas primary school — which left 19 children and two teachers dead — Americans are currently ready for change. On face value, the two decisions appear contradictory. If, as expected, the court overturns the earlier Roe v Wade abortion ruling, it will effectively be saying abortion rights can be determined by individual states, passing more power back to state-level officials. But in the New York gun case — which comes soon after another recent mass shooting in the state's city of Buffalo — the court may well strip states of the power to limit gun ownership, finding that such laws run afoul of the Second Amendment. The consistency is ideological, however. Through a conservative lens, the right to bear arms is explicitly stated in the constitution, whereas the right to an abortion is based on an implied right to privacy, as interpreted by a progressive slate of justices in the 1970s. If the current justices claim their predecessors erred, thereby toppling nearly 50 years of abortion access, it may raise questions about the court's authority. The Supreme Court is not an elected body. It is meant to sit above the chaos of Congress and the White House, and act as a custodian of the Bill of Rights. But as late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg often said: ""The Court should never be influenced by the weather of the day, but inevitably they will be influenced by the climate of the era."" The US political system is meant to allow people to elect representatives who best represent their values when deciding laws. Supreme Court justices are then appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to set the framework in which those laws operate. But the system is imperfect, with the makeup of the electoral college often determining who becomes President, sometimes without a majority of the overall votes. Mr Trump was able to choose three members of the current nine-member court, despite receiving fewer votes than Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. His lifelong appointments were approved by senators who, at that time, represented less than half the country's population. As it currently stands, the Senate is split 50-50, with Democrats representing 41.5 million more people than their Republican colleagues. Mr Trump was not the first Republican president to understand the transformative power of selecting Supreme Court justices aligned with his worldview. Former president Richard Nixon nominated six justices during his time in office, four of whom were confirmed in the Senate. He arguably fulfilled his campaign promise to fill the bench with ""caretakers of the constitution and servants of the people, not super-legislators"". But the project he started, carried on by his party over decades, didn't reach fruition until Justice Ginsburg's death and the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett just weeks before a new president entered the Oval Office. The fourth of Trump's picks, rushed through in the upheaval of an election campaign, cemented the court's current ideological bent. It also led to accusations from Democrats and others that the court has been unfairly stacked with conservatives who don't represent the will of the people. Far from being an impartial caretaker, the Supreme Court is now more often seen as a powerful political tool to be won and wielded. It is also the battleground for many of America's most-heated debates. When the draft ruling overturning Roe v Wade was leaked, those for and against abortion rights quickly gathered outside the court, where barriers were erected within minutes. The protests were rowdy but, for the most part, peaceful. But elsewhere some have already taken their dismay in a more dangerous direction. The organisation Ruth Sent Us — which has been criticised for taking Justice Ginsburg's name — posted the addresses of the current justices online, making them open targets for harassment. Earlier this month, a 26-year-old Californian man was arrested close to the Maryland home of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. When arrested, he was carrying a Glock pistol, zip ties, pepper spray and a tactical knife. He has since been charged with attempted murder. The case is emblematic of the deep distrust and anger building towards the Supreme Court for decisions it has made or will likely make soon. High fences around the building provide a neat metaphor for the growing chasm between the institution and those whose rights it is meant to protect. All nine justices have received beefed-up security as they clear a backlog of cases in a final flurry before the summer break. And the decisions will not be handed down in a vacuum. The House committee investigating the January 6 riot at the Capitol is currently holding a series of public hearings, reminding Americans how close violence came to the heart of their democracy only slightly more than a year ago. It was the culmination of an attempt to overturn a legal election, fuelled by the falsehood of widespread election fraud. The fury of the mob was fomented by someone who told them power was being stolen from them. Right now, some Americans believe their rights are being taken from them. Swirling tensions could soon boil over. The Supreme Court is supposed to be a stabilising force. Instead, by undoing rulings many believed to be settled law, it risks providing the spark that lights the fuse on a national uprising.

24,Kyrgios plays it safe for Wimbledon but smashes ATP over off-court coaching,world," Sport Nick Kyrgios withdraws from Mallorca event due to abdominal pain ahead of Wimbledon, opposes ATP trial of off-court coaching Nick Kyrgios has taken a ""no-risk"" approach towards his Wimbledon fitness, but the same cannot be said of his blast at the men's tour over off-court coaching trials. The in-form Australian has taken the cautious route to Wimbledon, deciding to pull out of his last-16 tie against Roberto Bautista Agut at the Mallorca Championship on Wednesday, local time, after suffering abdominal pain. Kyrgios — who has been a big hit with the local fans on the Spanish island — says he was sorry to have to disappoint them by withdrawing because of a painful abdomen muscle problem that he'd suffered during Tuesday's win over Laslo Djere. Taking doctor's advice, he played it safe, saying he wanted to take ""no risks"" with his best shot at Wimbledon in recent years just around the corner. However. the enigmatic Australian was not playing safe with his views about the ATP's plans to trial off-court coaching, saying he believes the unique nature of the sport was being removed by the experiment. The ATP will trial the system in the second half of the season, with players allowed to receive instructions during qualifying and main draw matches in tournaments, including the US Open and the ATP Finals. Patrick Mouratoglou — who helped guide Serena Williams to glory — congratulated the ATP for ""legalising a practice that has been going on at almost every match for decades"" but Kyrgios was adamant in his opposition. ""Completely disagree. Loses one of the only unique traits that no other sport had,"" Kyrgios responded on Twitter. ""The player had to figure out things on his own. That was the beauty of it. What happens if a high-profile player versus a low-ranked player who doesn't have or (cannot) afford a coach?"" Mouratoglou was involved in the most high-profile piece of off-court coaching at the 2018 US Open final when Williams was given a warning for his gesturing. The new trial is due to begin on July 11, the day after the end of Wimbledon, where Kyrgios has good reason to believe he could have his best run yet after reaching two grass-court semi-finals in the space of two weeks in Stuttgart and Halle. ""I'm really sorry I'm going to have to withdraw from tonight's match here in Mallorca. I have been playing a lot of great matches lately and, unfortunately, I woke up with a pain in my abs,"" Kyrgios said in a statement released by the organisers on Wednesday, local time. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""I went to see the tournament doctor right away and he advised that I don't play tonight. I really value the Mallorca Championships but I will follow his advice as I don't want to risk Wimbledon next week. ""I was really looking forward to tonight's match as I've been loving my time here. Mallorca is such a beautiful island with really nice people."" Javier Cerrato, the tournament doctor, reported: ""Nick Kyrgios suffers pain in the rectus abdominis, on the left side, due to the accumulation of matches in recent weeks and the effort of yesterday's first-round match. ""This will not allow him to return to the court tonight."" Organisers must have been left disappointed that his exit also prevented the prospect of a blockbuster quarter-final for the Australian against world number one Daniil Medvedev, who earned his place in the last eight on Wednesday, with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Aslan Karatsev.

25,Why Prince Charles's big chance to shine overseas could become an awkward political nightmare ,world,"  Prince Charles is attending his first CHOGM as future Commonwealth head, but the UK's Rwanda deal could make it awkward Prince Charles ""remains politically neutral"" — that is the official line his office, Clarence House, wants to underscore as he presides over the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) meeting in Rwanda this week. However, the future king's views about his own government's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda risk overshadowing the summit. Prince Charles is reportedly ""more than disappointed"" by the idea, which was partially inspired by Australia's offshore processing policy. The Times newspaper said the prince had privately labelled the plan ""appalling"". While Clarence House refused to comment on his private conversations last week, it tried to play down any suggestion the Prince of Wales would use the summit to exert political influence. The 73-year-old does have a history of speaking out. In 2015, dozens of secret letters were released showing how he lobbied government ministers on environmental, health and defence issues, among others. Prime Minister Boris Johnson — who has noted criticism of the plan from ""slightly unexpected quarters"" — is vowing to push ahead with the policy, despite a court challenge halting the first flight last week. Mr Johnson is now planning to change the UK's human rights laws to bypass the court's decision. It sets up a potentially awkward encounter for the two men as they meet in the country at the centre of the controversy. The United Kingdom is facing a surge of asylum seekers arriving in small boats from France. More than 10,000 have arrived since the start the year. In December last year, 27 people drowned when their boat capsized while trying to reach Britain. The government says people smugglers are exploiting asylum seekers, so it wants to create a disincentive, by sending some new arrivals to Rwanda for processing and resettlement. ""We have to interrupt the business model of the gangs,"" Mr Johnson told cabinet last week. The policy has been partially inspired by Australia's immigration policies, including offshore processing and the denial of visas for any asylum seeker who arrives by boat. Former Australian foreign minister, Alexander Downer, said the UK and others were ""very interested"" in the Australian model. ""There's no doubt the British Government, the Home Office and the Home Secretary … have been very influenced by what Australia did and they've consulted very extensively with a number of Australians,"" he told the ABC. Mr Downer is among them. The Howard government, of which he was a senior member, implemented the ""Pacific Solution"", which included transferring asylum seekers to Manus Island and Nauru. ""The circumstances in Australia, of course, are not identical, but they're very similar and certainly the modus operandi of the people smugglers is very much the same,"" he said. Mr Downer — who is also a former high commissioner to the UK — is conducting a separate review into the UK's Border Force for the British government. For the Rwanda policy to be an effective deterrent, it needs to apply to more than just a handful of asylum seekers, Mr Downer said. ""It has to be comprehensive,"" he said. ""When the people are intercepted in the channel, they need to be taken to the airport as quickly as possible and flown straight to Rwanda."" Detention Action UK campaigns manager Graeme McGregor said Australia should not be proud of its offshore-processing policy. ""It is disturbing to see Australian-style policies … exported to the UK,"" he told the ABC. Mr McGregor said the policy damaged Australia's international reputation and should not be credited with ""stopping the boats"". In 2012, the Gillard government restarted offshore processing after a spike in boat arrivals and deaths at sea. A year later, the first full year of operation, 300 boats arrived — the highest number in history. However, once Tony Abbott's government started turning boats around in 2014, just one vessel arrived. ""What prevented people from reaching Australia, unsurprisingly, was intercepting them with Australian naval destroyers and turning them back to Indonesia,"" Mr McGregor said. ""[However,] when you turn people back … they are simply re-exposed to the danger of trafficking."" Boris Johnson's government has considered implementing Australia's turnback policy, but decided it would be unworkable in the English channel. ""Those waters are very dangerous,"" Mr Johnson said last week. Mr Downer said the inflatable boats used by asylum seekers in the channel made them more difficult to turn around than Indonesian or Sri Lankan fishing vessels. There's also a lack of international waters in the English Channel, making the move difficult from a legal standpoint, he said. ""It should be an option if it's safe,"" he said. ""But, typically, it's not going to be."" Mr McGregor said that, if the British government wanted to stop boats, it should provide more options for people to apply for protection visas from overseas, so they don't have to turn to people smugglers. The Rwanda plan was derailed last week by the European Court of Human Rights, which intervened to stop the first flight of asylum seekers taking off. Even before that judgement, dozens of asylum seekers had their tickets cancelled due to concerns about their mental and physical health. However, the government says it is already planning a new flight, shrugging off its own concerns about human rights protections in Rwanda. In 2021, the UK's ambassador for Human Rights, Rita French, criticised the east African nation for not performing ""transparent, credible and independent investigations into allegations of human rights violations, including deaths in custody and torture"". Senior leaders in the Church of England have described the policy as ""immoral"", saying it ""shames Britain"". ""Afran"", an Iranian asylum seeker who was due to be sent to Rwanda, told the ABC he didn't understand why he had been selected, when others were allowed to stay in the United Kingdom. ""I don't know anything about Rwanda, but I've heard it's not safe,"" the 24-year old told the ABC from immigration detention. And ,if it is a safe country, why don't they send refugees from Ukraine?"" The Rwandan government says the asylum seekers will be given hotel accommodation from which they'll be free to come and go. It says there's ""nothing immoral"" about offering homes to people in need. Rwanda will receive more than $200 million in development aid from the UK government as part of the deal. Alexander Downer said Rwanda was a ""beautiful country"" that had turned itself around since its 1994 genocide. And, he said, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was already hosting refugees in Rwanda, mostly from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi. ""If it's good enough for the UNHCR, it'll be good enough for the British government,"" Mr Downer said. The UNHCR opposes Britain's plan, accusing it of ""exporting"" its international obligations and trading asylum seekers like ""commodities"".

26,"Russian forces double down on their attacks in Kharkiv, as Ukrainian reinforcements arrive in Sievierodonetsk",world,"  Russian forces continue rocket attacks on Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, and its surrounding countryside, killing at least 20 people in what Kyiv called a bid to force it to pull resources from the main battlefield to protect civilians from attack. Inside Russia, a fire tore through an oil refinery just 8km from the Ukrainian border, after what the refinery described as a cross-border attack by two drones. In the main battlefield city of Sievierodonetsk, where Russia has claimed to have Ukrainian forces surrounded since last week, scenes filmed by a freelance journalist made clear the battle was not over, with Ukrainian troops able to resupply their garrison by crossing a river in inflatable rafts. The Russian strikes on Kharkiv — throughout Tuesday and continuing into Wednesday morning — were the worst for weeks in the area where normal life had been returning since Ukraine pushed Russian forces back in a major counter-offensive last month. ""It was shelling by Russian troops. It was probably multiple rocket launchers. And it's the missile impact, it's all the missile impact,"" Kharkiv prosecutor Mikhailo Martosh told Reuters amid the ruins of cottages struck on Tuesday in a rural area on the city's outskirts. Medical workers carried the body of an elderly woman out of the rubble of a burnt-out garage and into a nearby van. ""She was 85 years old. A child of [World War II]. She survived one war, but didn't make it through this one,"" said her grandson, Mykyta. ""There is nowhere to flee to. Especially grandmother herself, she didn't want to go anywhere from here."" Ukrainian authorities said 15 people were killed and 16 wounded on Tuesday in the Kharkiv region, and regional governor Oleh Sinegubov described shelling incidents on Wednesday morning that had killed at least another five people. ""Russian forces are now hitting the city of Kharkiv in the same way that they previously were hitting Mariupol — with the aim of terrorising the population,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video address. ""And, if they keep doing that, we will have to react — and that is one way to make us move our artillery,"" he said. A series of clandestine, high-speed helicopter missions to reach the Azovstal defenders have been celebrated for rescuing survivors, but some flights did not make it back. ""The idea is to create one big problem to distract us and force us to divert troops. I think there will be an escalation."" In an evening military update, Ukraine's General Staff catalogued continued heavy Russian shelling of Kharkiv and other towns and villages in its vicinity and air strikes on the devastated city of Sievierodonetsk, among others. Russian forces have made only slow progress using overwhelming artillery in some of the heaviest ground fighting in Europe since World War II. Moscow says Ukrainian forces in Sievierodonetsk are trapped and ordered them to surrender or die last week after the last bridge over the Siverskyi Donets river was destroyed. However, Oleksandr Ratushniak, a freelance photographer who reached Sievierodonetsk with Ukrainian forces in recent days, filmed reinforcements crossing in an inflatable raft. Inside the ruins of the frontline industrial zone, the Ukrainian troops fired from a tank's main gun. They smoked cigarettes as they hid from Russian artillery exploding outside. A regular day's work, said one soldier: ""For us, this like digging up potatoes."" There was no immediate Ukrainian comment about the apparent drone strike that suspended production at Russia's Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery, on the Russian side of the frontier with Donbas territory that is controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Video footage posted on social media appeared to show a drone flying towards the refinery, before a large ball of flame billowed up into the summer sky. The local emergency service, cited by Interfax, said no one was hurt and the blaze was put out. Ukraine generally does not comment on reports of attacks on Russian infrastructure near the border, which in the past it has called ""karma"" for Russian attacks on Ukraine. In a separate incident, Russian authorities said four people were killed after a shell exploded at an ammunition depot deep inside Russia. In southern Ukraine, officials said seven Russian missiles had struck the port of Mykolaiv, killing at least one person and causing several major fires. Global grain trader Viterra said its grain terminal in the southern Ukrainian port of Mykolaiv was hit and was ablaze. Wednesday was marked in both Russia and Ukraine as the ""Day of Remembrance and Sorrow"", the anniversary of the day Hitler's Germany attacked the Soviet Union. Russian President Vladimir Putin laid flowers at a memorial flame for the dead. World War II — which saw 27 million Soviet citizens killed — plays a prominent role in Russian commentary on the Ukraine invasion, which Mr Putin calls a ""special operation"" to root out ""Nazis"". Kyiv and the West call that a baseless justification for a war to wipe out Ukraine's identity as a separate nation. ""Psychiatrists of the future will examine how after building the World War II cult for years, Russia began to recreate bloody pages of the history and Nazis' each step,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted.

27,$4.6 million settlement reached in police killing of Daunte Wright,world,"  $4.6 million settlement reached in police killing of Daunte Wright A suburban Minneapolis city has agreed to pay $US3.2 million ($4.6 million) to the family of Daunte Wright, a black man who was fatally shot by a police officer who said she confused her gun for her Taser. The tentative settlement also includes changes in police policies and training involving traffic stops like the one that resulted in Wright's death, according to a statement on Tuesday night from lawyers representing Wright's family. Wright was shot once in the chest by Brooklyn Centre Officer Kim Potter, who is white, after the 20-year-old was stopped for expired registration tags in April 2021. The former officer was subsequently convicted of first- and second-degree manslaughter and was sentenced to two years in prison. Potter is heard on video yelling ""taser"" several times just before she fires her pistol. Co-counsel Antonio M. Romanucci said Wright's family members ""hope and believe the measures of change to policing, policies and training will create important improvements to the community in Daunte's name."" ""Nothing can bring him back, but the family hopes his legacy is a positive one and prevents any other family from enduring the type of grief they will live with for the rest of their lives,"" he said. The shooting happened at a time of high tension in the area, with former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, standing trial just miles away for the killing of George Floyd. Floyd's May 2020 death prompted a reckoning over police brutality and discrimination involving people of colour. Kim Potter, the former suburban Minneapolis police officer who said she confused her handgun for her taser when she fatally shot Daunte Wright, is sentenced to two years in prison. The fallout from Wright's death led the Brooklyn Centre City Council to pass a series of reforms, including the use of social workers and other trained professionals to respond to medical, mental health and social-needs calls that don't require police. The changes also prohibit police from making arrests for low-level offences and require the city to use unarmed civilians to handle minor traffic violations. The settlement is one of the largest involving police conduct. Last year, the city of Minneapolis agreed to pay $US27 million ($39 million) to Floyd's family. Minneapolis previously paid $US20 million ($28 million) to the family of Justine Damond, after she called 911 to report a suspected assault behind her home in July 2017 and was fatally shot by Mohamed Noor, one of the officers who responded to her call. Noor is Somali American and Damond was white.

28,Shayna Jack forced to sit out world championships after breaking her hand,world,"  Swimmer Shayna Jack breaks hand in world championship warm-up Gold-medal-winning swimmer Shayna Jack has broken her hand in training and will miss the rest of the world swimming championships. Jack broke her hand as she was warming up for Wednesday morning's 100-metres freestyle heats at the competition in Budapest. The 23-year-old, in her return from a doping ban, previously helped Australia to gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay on Saturday and silver in the mixed 4x100m medley relay on Tuesday. Australia still took victory in heat one, with teammate Mollie O'Callaghan swimming the fastest qualifying time, followed by Canada's Penny Oleksiak, the United States' Torri Huske, and world record holder Sarah Sjöström. Jack is just the latest high-profile swimmer to pull out of the competition. Hong Kong's Siobhán Haughey, the Olympic silver medallist in the 100m and 200m freestyle, withdrew on Monday due to an ankle injury. Four-time Olympic medallist Chad Le Clos withdrew from the men's competition on Monday due to health concerns. The South African said on social media he had been struggling with his breathing for the previous three weeks ""since having multiple stints of bronchitis"".

29,"Sri Lanka's economy has 'completely collapsed', Prime Minister says",world,"  Sri Lankan economy 'completely collapsed', Prime Minister says Sri Lanka's Prime Minister says its debt-laden economy has ""collapsed"" after months of shortages of food, fuel and electricity. Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament the South Asian country is ""facing a far more serious situation beyond the mere shortages of fuel, gas, electricity and food"". ""Our economy has completely collapsed,"" he said. Wickremesinghe is also the Finance Minister tasked with stabilising the economy. He said Sri Lanka is unable to purchase imported fuel, even for cash, due to heavy debts owed by its petroleum corporation. ""Currently, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is $700 million in debt,"" he said. ""As a result, no country or organisation in the world is willing to provide fuel to us. ""They are even reluctant to provide fuel for cash."" An economic collapse is forcing people all over Sri Lanka to find unconventional ways to survive. Wickremesinghe said the government missed out on the chance to turn the situation around. ""We are now seeing signs of a possible fall to rock bottom,"" he said. Mr Wickremesinghe said on Wednesday that Sri Lanka would call China, India and Japan to a donor conference to drum up more foreign assistance and present an interim budget in August. The budget seeks to put public finances on a more sustainable path and increase funds to the poor, who have been hardest hit, Mr Wickremesinghe told parliament. ""The interim budget will set the path forward,"" he said. It comes amid ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is in Sri Lanka for talks on a bailout program. ""[The budget], together with an IMF program and debt sustainability, will lay the foundation for Sri Lanka to return to economic stability,"" Mr Wickremesinghe said. The country already announced it is suspending repayment of $7 billion in foreign debt due for repayment this year, pending the outcome of negotiations with the IMF. It must pay $5 billion on average annually until 2026. The foreign currency crisis has resulted in massive shortages that have forced people to stand in long lines to buy essentials, including fuel, food and medicine.

30,Rescue efforts underway as floods inundate southern China,world,"  South China floods force tens of thousands to evacuate, rescue efforts underway Major flooding has forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people in southern China, with more rain expected. Much of the flooding has affected Guangdong, China's most populous province, where the flood alert rose to Level I, the highest, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Around half a million people have been displaced, largely in the cities of Shaoguan, Heyuan and Meizhou. Authorities asked residents of communities along river banks and in low-lying neighbourhoods to move to higher ground, after floodwaters hit a 50-year high. The heavy rainfall has collapsed roads in some parts of cities and swept away houses, cars and crops, and more rain is forecast for coming days. Rescuers were seen assisting people into speedboats and transporting them over floodwater. Military personnel were deployed to place sandbags along the banks of the Beijiang River. In nearby Jiangxi province, the floodwaters inundated the homes of an additional 485,000 people. In Zhejiang province north of Guangdong, rescue crews in inflatable boats brought out residents trapped in their homes in inundated villages. Further north, storm warnings were issued for much of the eastern provinces, including the capital Beijing, while reservoirs in the central province of Henan were at flood level and releasing torrents of water downstream. China regularly experiences flooding during the summer months, most frequently in central and southern areas that tend to receive the most rainfall. This year's flooding is the worst in decades in some areas and comes on top of strict COVID-19 regulations that have strangled travel, employment and ordinary life in much of the country. China's worst floods in recent years were in 1998, when more than 2,000 people died and almost 3 million homes were destroyed. The government has invested heavily in flood control and hydro power projects. Globally, more intense tropical storms are on the rise as a result of climate change, leading to increased flooding that threatens lives, crops and groundwater.

31,Soldiers describe Ukraine's 'impossible' secret rescue missions in the besieged city of Mariupol,world,"  As is his habit before each flight, the veteran Ukrainian army pilot runs a hand along the fuselage of his Mi-8 helicopter, caressing the heavy transporter's metal skin to bring luck to him and his crew. Their destination — a steel mill in the besieged city of Mariupol — was a death trap. Some other crews did not make it back alive. The 51-year-old pilot — identified only by his first name, Oleksandr — flew just the one mission to Mariupol, in early April, and he considered it the most difficult flight of his 30-year-career. He took the risk, he said, because he did not want the Azovstal fighters to feel forgotten. A series of clandestine, high-speed helicopter missions to reach the Azovstal defenders in March, April and May are being celebrated in Ukraine as among the most heroic feats during the war. The full story of the seven resupply-and-rescue missions has yet to be told, but The Associated Press has pieced together an account of one of the last flights, based on interviews with wounded soldiers, a military intelligence officer and pilot interviews provided by the Ukrainian army. In his cockpit, the wait seemed interminable to Oleksandr, the minutes feeling like hours. ""Very scary. You see explosions around and the next shell could reach your location,"" he said. Oleksandr recalled being fired upon by a ship as they swooped over waters out of Mariupol. A blast wave tossed the helicopter around ""like a toy"", but his escape manoeuvres got them out of trouble. Oleksandr gunned the helicopter to 220 kilometres per hour and flew as low as 3 metres above the ground — except when hopping over power lines. A second helicopter on his mission never made it back; on the return flight, its pilot radioed him that he was running short of fuel. It was their last communication. The military intelligence officer said one helicopter was shot down and two others never came back, and are considered missing. He said he dressed in civilian clothes for his flight, thinking that he could melt into the population if he survived a crash. ""We were aware it could be a one-way ticket,"" he said. The last-ditch stand at the Azovstal mill was a growing symbol of Ukraine's defiance in the war against Russia. The sprawling Azovstal steelworks has become the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the southern port city of Mariupol. The Azovstal fighters had frustrated Moscow's objective of quickly capturing Mariupol and prevented Russian troops there from being redeployed elsewhere. Russia has said the Azov battalion in Mariupol are neo-Nazis, and its founder holds far right views. The paramilitary group was formed in 2014 but was later absorbed into the Ukrainian army, which denies allegations of fascism. Only after more than 2,500 defenders who remained in the Azovstal ruins had started surrendering did Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy first give wind of the missions. Mr Zelenskyy told Ukrainian broadcaster ICTV that pilots braved Russian air defences to fly in food, water, medicine and weapons so the plant's defenders could fight on, as well as evacuating the injured. ""These are absolutely heroic people who knew what was difficult, who knew that it was almost impossible … We lost a lot of pilots,"" Mr Zelenskyy said. Among those told that he was on the list for evacuation was a junior sergeant who had been shredded by mortar rounds, butchering his left leg and forcing its amputation above the knee. ""Buffalo"" was his nom de guerre. The 20-year-old did not want to be identified by name and said he did not want it to seem like he was seeking publicity when thousands of Azovstal defenders were in captivity or dead. If Buffalo had had his way, he would not have lived to be evacuated. His life would have ended quickly, to spare him the agony he suffered after 120mm mortar rounds tore apart his left leg, bloodied his right foot, and peppered his back with shrapnel during street fighting in Mariupol on March 23. He had been on the trail of a Russian tank, aiming to destroy it with a shoulder-launch missile. Tossed next to the wreckage of a burning car, he dragged himself to cover in a nearby building and ""decided it would be better to crawl into the basement and quietly die there"". But his friends evacuated him to the Ilyich steel mill, which subsequently fell in mid-April as Russian forces were tightening their grip on Mariupol and its strategic port on the Sea of Azov. Three days passed before medics were able to amputate, in a basement bomb shelter. He considers himself lucky: doctors still had anaesthetic when his turn came to go under the knife. When he came around, a nurse told him how sorry she was that he had lost the limb. He cut through the awkwardness with a joke: ""Will they return the money for 10 tattoo sessions?"" ""I had a lot of tattoos on my leg,"" he said. One remains, a human figure, but its legs are gone now, too. After the surgery, he was transferred to the Azovstal plant, a stronghold with a 24-kilometre labyrinth of underground tunnels and bunkers. ""There was constant shelling,"" said Vladislav Zahorodnii, a 22-year-old corporal who had been shot through the pelvis, shredding a nerve, during street fighting in Mariupol. Evacuated to Azovstal, he met Buffalo there. They already knew each other: Both were from Chernihiv, a city in the north surrounded by Russian forces. Mr Zahorodnii was evacuated from Azovstal by helicopter on March 31, after three failed attempts. It was his first helicopter flight. The Mi-8 took fire on its way out, killing one of its engines. The other one kept them airborne for the remainder of the 80-minute flight to Dnipro city on the Dnieper River in central Ukraine. He would mark his deliverance with a mortar-round tattoo on his right forearm. ""I did it not to forget,"" he said. Buffalo's turn came the following week. On the one hand, he was relieved that his share of the dwindling food and water would now go to others still able to fight, but he was uneasy about leaving. ""There was a painful feeling. They stayed there, and I left them,"" he said. He almost missed his flight. Soldiers hauled him on a gurney out of his deep bunker and loaded him aboard a truck that rumbled to a pre-arranged landing zone. The soldiers wrapped him in a jacket. The helicopter's cargo of ammunition was unloaded first. Then, the wounded were lifted aboard. But Buffalo was left in the back corner of the truck. He could not raise the alarm because the mortar blasts had injured his throat, and he was still too hoarse to make himself heard over the sound of the helicopter rotors. ""I thought to myself, 'Well, not today then',"" he said. ""And suddenly someone shouted, 'You forgot the soldier in the truck!'."" A crew member took his hand and told him not to worry, they would make it home. ""We flew over the fields, below the trees. Very low,"" he said. They made it to Dnipro safely. Upon landing, Oleksandr heard the wounded calling out for the pilots. He expected them to yell at him for having tossed them around so violently during the flight. ""But when I opened the door, I heard guys saying thank you,"" he said. ""Everyone clapped,"" Buffalo said, now in rehab with Mr Zahorodnii at a Kyiv clinic. ""We told the pilots that they had done the impossible.""

32,Senior Chinese police official sacked following violent attack on women that sparked national outrage,world,"  Senior police official sacked in China after attack on group of women in a restaurant A deputy police director in China has been sacked after a violent attack on a group of women at a restaurant in northern China that sparked nationwide outrage. Warning: The following story contains descriptions and vision of a graphic nature. The Hebei province Public Security Department said in-depth investigations were being carried out into the slow response to incidents and ""serious violations of laws and discipline"" by police in the city of Tangshan, which is about 150 kilometres east of Beijing. Two of the four victims remain hospitalised 11 days after the assault, which has raised concern about public safety and the mistreatment of women in society. Hundreds of thousands of people commented after videos of the attack were posted online, many calling for justice. Police arrived at the scene 28 minutes after they received the report, and the injured had been sent to the hospital by the time they arrived, provincial authorities said in a statement. The deputy chief of the Tangshan police Lubei branch, which was responsible for the initial handling of the case, has been removed from office. A report from district police described the authorities' response as ""slow and improper"". Four women eating at a late-night barbecue restaurant were attacked by a group of men in the early hours of June 10, after one of the women appeared to reject the advances of one of the men and fought back after she was slapped, surveillance video from the restaurant showed. The attackers could be seen shoving the women to the ground, kicking them, throwing a chair at them, and later dragging one of the women out of the restaurant to continue beating her on the footpath. One had a bloodied and swollen face as she was taken away on a stretcher. Nine suspects were arrested the next day. In recent days, rumours have spread online that at least one of the women had died, but the Hebei public security statement appeared to contradict that. It said that the conditions of the two hospitalised women were improving and that they had sustained ""second-degree light injuries"". Xiaoxuan has taken one of China's biggest media stars to court over sexual harassment allegations in what is a landmark MeToo case for the country. The other two women were slightly injured and not hospitalised, the statement said. While some online comments applauded the statement for refuting the rumours, more raised questions about the severity of the women's injuries and the slow initial response of the police. Reports of a series of gang crimes in Tangshan surfaced after the attack, along with public questioning of alleged ties between the police and gang members. The investigation into the case has been transferred to police in another jurisdiction, the city of Langfang, which is also in Hebei province. The Hebei province anti-corruption body said on Tuesday that five police officers were under investigation, including the chief of the Lubei branch in Tangshan and at least two others from a police station under the Lubei branch.

33,"At least 1,000 killed by magnitude-6.1 earthquake in Afghanistan ",world,"  Afghanistan rocked by magnitude-6.1 earthquake, leaving 1,000 dead, according to Taliban officials At least 1,000 people have been killed by a magnitude-6.1 earthquake in Afghanistan's east, according to Taliban officials, and the death toll is expected to grow as information trickles in from remote villages. A further 1,500 people are reported to be injured by the quake. With teams being dispatched to quake-hit areas, Afghan officials have asked humanitarian agencies to help with the rescue effort. A Taliban spokesman of Afghanistan's foreign ministry said it would welcome international help. Neighbouring Pakistan and Iran said they were sending humanitarian aid, including food and medicine. Interior ministry official Salahuddin Ayubi said the death toll was likely to rise ""as some of the villages are in remote areas in the mountains and it will take some time to collect details"". Most of the confirmed deaths were in Paktika, where 255 people were killed and more than 200 injured, Mr Ayubi said. In the eastern province of Khost, 25 people were reported dead and 90 had been taken to hospital. Deaths were also reported in the Nangarhar province, he added. Authorities are searching for more casualties. The earthquake was felt over some 500 kilometres by about 119 million people in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India, the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said in a tweet. Eyewitnesses told the ABC the earthquake hit late at night when people were asleep in the war-ravaged country. Ruh Ullah, a Kabul-based tailor from Paktika province, said he was traumatised by the quake. ""Ever since I have heard of the devastation back home, I am crying, the mobile phone connections are not properly working and no-one is telling me if my extended family members are alive or not,"" he said. His native Barmal district was one of the worst-hit areas of south-east Afghanistan. Firdaus Khan, a resident of Sharana, the provincial capital of Paktika province, told the ABC the only public hospital in the province of nearly a million inhabitants, had been overwhelmed by earthquake victims. ""Most of the victims are women and children because they were caught asleep by the calamity … there is absolute shortage of resources, doctors and all other things needed,"" he said. ""People don't know what to do."" The state-owned Bakhtar news agency said rescue operations had been launched to minimise likely further deaths and loss of property. Taliban authorities, which have received no international recognition since taking power in Kabul in August 2021, reported losses in the entire south-eastern region, which comprises the Paktika, Paktia, Logar, Khost and Logar provinces. Haibatullah Akhundzada, the supreme leader of the ruling Taliban, offered his condolences in a statement. In response to the Taliban takeover, many governments have imposed sanctions on Afghanistan's banking sector and cut billions of dollars worth of development aid. Humanitarian aid has continued, however, and international agencies including the United Nations operate within the country. The United Nations said it was deploying medical health teams and providing medical supplies but that it did not have search and rescue capabilities in Afghanistan. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the United Nations was fully mobilised, assessing the needs and providing initial support. ""We count on the international community to help support the hundreds of families hit by this latest disaster. Now is the time for solidarity,"" he said in a statement. Large parts of south Asia are seismically active because a tectonic plate, known as the Indian plate, is pushing north into the Eurasian plate. In 2015, an earthquake struck the remote Afghan north-east, killing several hundred people in Afghanistan and nearby northern Pakistan.

34,'Yikes': Emails reveal US department's response to China-Solomon Islands security pact,world,"  US officials find China-Solomon Islands security deal 'very troubling', internal emails reveal United States officials described the signing of a security pact between China and Solomon Islands as ""very troubling"" in internal emails, a freedom of information (FOI) request has revealed. Emails obtained by international news outlet Al Jazeera show how officials at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) responded to news the deal had been signed in mid-April. ""Yikes. This is very troubling,"" Ryan Washburn, USAID's mission director to the Philippines, Pacific Islands and Mongolia, wrote in an email. ""This is very unfortunate,"" said Erin Nicholson, acting deputy assistant administrator for the USAID Bureau for Asia. In response to the ABC's coverage of the signed pact, the deputy mission director for the Pacific Islands and Mongolia, Sean Callahan, said it was ""deja vu all over again"", in reference to when Solomon Islands switched its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2019, ahead of a United Nations General Assembly. ""The press and academia in Canberra and Wellington are making those same comparisons from 2019 too referring that again we got 'played' by the PM,"" he wrote. In the emails, officials questioned the timing of the deal and discussed the best way to respond to the news, which came just days out from a planned trip to Honiara by US officials, including the Indo-Pacific coordinator of the National Security Council, Kurt Campbell. The US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan had raised concerns about the controversial security pact between Beijing and Honiara, after a draft copy of the deal was leaked earlier this year. The West expressed concern the pact could lay the groundwork for a Chinese military base or presence in the region. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi arrives in Solomon Islands, while Australia's Foreign Minister vows to listen to the Pacific on climate action in Fiji. Last week, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare sought to reassure Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong this would not be the case. ""I welcomed Prime Minister Sogavare's reassurances that there will not a military base or persistent foreign military presence here in Solomon Islands,"" Senator Wong said in Honiara. ""And I welcomed his assurance that Australia remains Solomon Islands' first security partner of choice and development partner of choice."" Solomon Islands and the wider Pacific have played host to several foreign delegations since news of the security pact came to light. Senator Wong's visit last week — her third trip to Pacific nations since being sworn in last month — came soon after Solomon Islands received a large Chinese delegation led by Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Mr Wang's trip to the region in late May saw him visit eight Pacific nations over 10 days, signing up the island states to a range of bilateral deals.

35,Pictures show impact of Ukraine's Snake Island bombing,world,"  Russia has threatened a ""serious negative impact"" following Lithuania's decision to ban transport to its isolated territory of Kaliningrad, the US Attorney-General Merrick Garland has paid a visit to a border town, and the infamous Snake Island is back on the radar. Here's the latest on the war in Ukraine. First up, where is it? Crucially, this Russian territory is sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania: It's connected to the rest of Russia by a rail link through Lithuania (which is both a member of the EU and NATO). The neighbouring nation has shut the route for transport of steel and other ferrous metals, which it says it is required to do under EU sanctions that took effect on the weekend. And Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia's security council, said (without elaborating) that ""appropriate measures"" were being worked out and: ""Their consequences will have a serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania."" These images capture the war in Sievierodonetsk, a frontline city in Ukraine's east. They were taken on Monday and filed on Wednesday: And war crimes prosecutors are investigating in Kharkiv, after overnight shelling. This is some of the damage: Russian shelling killed at least 15 civilians in the area, the regional Governor said. Remember Snake Island? Audio from February of a reported exchange between Ukrainian guards stationed on the island and Russian forces demanding their surrender ended with this infamous line: ""Russian warship, go f*** yourself."" Ukrainian forces had claimed their first successful use of Western-donated Harpoon anti-ship missiles to engage Russian forces on the island, according to British military intelligence. New satellite images show Russian positions on the island before and after the reported attacks: And the Institute for the Study of War has released its latest summary of the situation on the ground. The think tank said Russia could be ""radically reshuffling"" its command structure, indicating a possible purge of senior officers blamed for failures in Ukraine. In his nightly address, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was ""putting serious pressure in the Donetsk's direction"", as well as shelling Kharkiv: ""They are just destroying, just killing to show to their commanders that they are not standing in one place,"" Mr Zelenskyy said. He reiterated his plea for weapons from the West: ""The lives of thousands of people depend directly on the speed of our partners, on the speed of how they implement their decisions to help Ukraine."" Here's Mark Hertling, a former commander of US ground forces in Europe: ""It's a heavyweight boxing match. In two months of fighting, there has not yet been a knockout blow.

36,Mexico's President says his country would 'open its doors to Julian Assange',world,"  Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador says his country would 'open its doors to Julian Assange' Mexico's President says he will ask US President Joe Biden to address WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's case when the two men meet in July. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador raised Mr Assange's case at a regular news conference on Tuesday, saying his country would open its doors to the Australian if he was released. On Friday British Home Secretary Priti Patel approved the WikiLeaks founder's extradition to the United States to face criminal charges. Mr Assange's wife Stella Moris vowed to fight using every possible legal avenue. ""I'm going to ask President Biden to address this issue … humanism must prevail,"" Mr Lopez Obrador said. Mr Lopez Obrador is set to meet his US counterpart in July. He skipped the recent US-hosted Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles to protest against the White House's exclusion of the Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan governments from the event. A lawyer for the United States tells a London court Julian Assange is wanted for crimes that risked the lives of people who helped the West and journalism is no excuse for criminality. Mr Assange is wanted by US authorities on 18 counts, including a spying charge, relating to WikiLeaks' release of vast troves of confidential US military records and diplomatic cables, which Washington said had put lives in danger. His supporters say he is an anti-establishment hero who has been victimised because he has exposed US wrongdoing in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and that his prosecution is a politically motivated assault on journalism and free speech.

37,US begins banning imports from China's Xinjiang over forced labour and genocide allegations,world,"  US implements import ban on goods from China's Xinjiang over allegations of forced labour, genocide against Uyghurs Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the US is rallying its allies against forced labour as it begins implementing an import ban on goods from China's Xinjiang region, where Washington says Beijing is committing genocide. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has begun enforcing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in December. CBP has said it is ready to implement the law's ""rebuttable presumption"" that all goods from Xinjiang, where Chinese authorities established detention camps for Uyghurs and other Muslim groups, are made with forced labour and barred from import unless it can be proven otherwise. The agency has said a very high level of evidence would be required for importers to receive an exception to the law. ""We are rallying our allies and partners to make global supply chains free from the use of forced labour, to speak out against atrocities in Xinjiang, and to join us in calling on the government of the PRC [People's Republic of China] to immediately end atrocities and human rights abuses,"" Mr Blinken said in a statement. ""Together with our inter-agency partners, we will continue to engage companies to remind them of US legal obligations."" An Australian Senate committee last year called for the Customs Act to be amended ""to prohibit the import of any goods made wholly or in part with forced labour"". The ABC has contacted the federal government to ask whether Australia plans to support the US move and take its own action. China denies abuses in Xinjiang, a major cotton producer that also supplies much of the world's materials for solar panels. Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said earlier in Beijing that claims of forced labour in Xinjiang were a ""big lie concocted by anti-China forces"". ""With this so-called law, the United States is trying to create forced unemployment in Xinjiang and to push for the world to decouple with China,"" Mr Wang said. The source of the files claims to have hacked and downloaded the documents from several police computer servers in China's far-western region of Xinjiang, before decrypting and leaking them. Beijing initially denied the existence of any detention camps, but then later admitted it had set up ""vocational training centres"" necessary to curb what it said was terrorism, separatism and religious radicalism in Xinjiang. Last week, CBP issued a list of Xinjiang entities presumed to be using forced labour, which includes textile, solar-grade poly silicon, and electronics companies. It has said threatened to ban imports from other countries if related supply chains include products or materials from Xinjiang. The US, Britain and other countries have called for the United Nations' International Labour Organisation to set up a mission to probe alleged labour abuses in Xinjiang. Human rights groups and trade associations that support US domestic producers have warned that goods from Xinjiang could find their way into solar imports from other countries, given the difficulty of verifying supply chains in China. Earlier in June, Mr Biden waived tariffs on solar panels from four South-East Asian nations, leading to accusations his administration was not serious about cracking down on forced labour. CBP could need two years to ramp up enforcement, the breadth of the task making it potentially more difficult than the post-9/11 effort to track terror financing, said Alan Bersin, a former CBP commissioner who is now executive chairman of supply chain technology company Altana AI. ""It comes close to panic in C-suites [executive suites] all across the country where huge enterprises really don't have visibility into their supply chains aside from the direct supplier,"" Mr Bersin said.

38,Jury finds Bill Cosby liable for sexual abuse of 16-year-old girl at Playboy Mansion in 1975,world,"  Jury finds Bill Cosby liable for sexual abuse of 16-year-old girl at Playboy Mansion in 1975 Jurors at a civil trial in California have found that entertainer Bill Cosby sexually abused a 16-year-old girl at the Playboy Mansion in 1975. The Los Angeles County jury delivered the verdict on Tuesday in favour of Judy Huth, who is now 64, and awarded her $US500,000 (more than $717,000). Jurors found that Mr Cosby intentionally caused harmful sexual contact with Ms Huth, that he reasonably believed she was under 18, and that his conduct was driven by unnatural or abnormal sexual interest in a minor. The jurors' decision is a major legal defeat for the 84-year-old entertainer once hailed as America's dad. It comes nearly a year after his Pennsylvania criminal conviction for sexual assault was thrown out and he was freed from prison. Ms Huth's lawsuit was one of the last remaining legal claims against him after his insurer settled many others against his will. Bill Cosby to face sex abuse allegations again in a civil trial Mr Cosby did not attend the trial or testify in person, but short clips from 2015 video deposition were played for jurors, in which he denied any sexual contact with Ms Huth. He continues to deny the allegation through his attorney and publicist. Jurors had already reached conclusions on nearly every question on their verdict form, including whether Mr Cosby abused Ms Huth and whether she deserved damages, after two days of deliberations on Friday. But the jury foreperson could not serve further because of a personal commitment, and the panel had to start deliberating from scratch with an alternate juror on Monday. Mr Cosby's attorneys agreed that he met Ms Huth and her high school friend on a Southern California film set in April of 1975, then took them to the Playboy Mansion a few days later. Ms Huth's friend Donna Samuelson, a key witness, took photos at the mansion of Ms Huth and Mr Cosby, which loomed large at the trial. Ms Huth testified that in a bedroom adjacent to a game room where the three had been hanging out, Mr Cosby attempted to put his hand down her pants, then exposed himself and forced her to perform a sex act. Ms Huth filed her lawsuit in 2014, saying that her son turning 15 — the age she initially remembered being when she went to the mansion — and a wave of other women accusing Mr Cosby of similar acts brought fresh trauma over what she had been through as a teenager. Ms Huth's attorney Nathan Goldberg told the jury of nine women and three men during closing arguments that ""my client deserves to have Mr Cosby held accountable for what he did."" ""Each of you knows in your heart that Mr Cosby sexually assaulted Miss Huth,"" Mr Goldberg said. A majority of jurors apparently agreed, giving Ms Huth a victory in a suit that took eight years and overcame many hurdles just to get to trial. During their testimony, Mr Cosby attorney Jennifer Bonjean consistently challenged Ms Huth and Ms Samuelson over errors in detail in their stories, and a similarity in the accounts that the lawyer said represented coordination between the two women. The US Supreme Court says it will not review Bill Cosby's sexual assault case, leaving him a free man and ending a two-decade legal drama that sent him to prison for several years. This included the women saying in pre-trial depositions and police interviews that Ms Samuelson had played Donkey Kong that day, a game not released until six years later. Ms Bonjean made much of this, in what both sides came to call the ""Donkey Kong defence."" Mr Goldberg asked jurors to look past the small errors in detail that he said were inevitable in stories that were 45 years old, and focus on the major issues behind the allegations. He pointed out to jurors that Ms Samuelson said ""games like Donkey Kong"" when she first mentioned it in her deposition. The Cosby lawyer began her closing arguments by saying, ""It's on like Donkey Kong,"" and finished by declaring, ""game over."" Ms Huth's attorney reacted with outrage during his rebuttal. ""This is about justice!"" he shouted, pounding on the podium. ""We don't need game over! We need justice!"" Editor’s note 23 June 2022: The headline of this story was amended to reflect that this was a civil case and there was no criminal finding of guilt.

39,US senators reach agreement on bipartisan gun violence bill,world,"  US Senate negotiators reach agreement on bipartisan gun violence bill in wake of Uvalde, Buffalo mass shootings US Senate negotiators have reached an agreement on a bipartisan gun violence bill. The deal tees up votes this week on a package that would stand as Congress's response to recent mass shootings in Texas and New York. Nine days after Senate negotiators agreed to a framework proposal — and 29 years after Congress last enacted major firearms curbs — Democratic senator Chris Murphy told reporters a final accord on the proposal's details had been reached and was ""in good shape"". Moments later, Texas Republican senator John Cornyn, the chief Republican bargainer, said he, Mr Murphy and the other two top Senate negotiators had reached agreement. The legislation would toughen background checks for the youngest firearms buyers, require more sellers to conduct background checks, and beef up penalties for gun traffickers. It also would give states and communities money for improving school safety and mental health initiatives. It lacks the far more potent proposals that President Joe Biden supports and Democrats have pushed for years without success, which have been derailed by Republican opposition. These include banning assault-type weapons or raising the minimum age for buying them, prohibiting high-capacity magazines and requiring background checks for virtually all gun sales. Yet if enacted, the election-year agreement would spotlight a modest but telling shift in the politics of an issue that has defied compromise since Bill Clinton was president. Ten black shoppers were killed by a gunman last month in Buffalo, New York, and 19 children and two teachers were shot dead by another assailant days later in Uvalde, Texas. ""Some think it goes too far, others think it doesn't go far enough. And I get it. It's the nature of compromise,"" Mr Cornyn said of the proposed laws. ""I believe that the same people who are telling us to do something are sending us a clear message, to do what we can to keep our children and communities safe. US politicians hear from survivors and victims' families amid a stalemate over US gun control. ""I'm confident this legislation moves us in a positive direction."" A majority of Republicans are expected to oppose the legislation. Delegates booed Mr Cornyn at his state's Republican convention on Saturday as he described the measure. It will need at least 10 Republican votes to reach the 60-vote threshold major bills often need in the 50-50 Senate. The last time Congress took major action on gun control was in 1993, when a decade-long ban on assault-type firearms was introduced. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he wants his chamber to debate and vote on the legislation this week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also said she backed the effort.

40,Shayna Jack wins another medal at world titles in international swimming comeback,world,"  Australia wins two silver medals at world swimming titles, for Mollie O'Callaghan and Shayna Jack's 4x100m mixed medley relay team Australia's rising swim star Mollie O'Callaghan is in shock at her breakthrough silver medal, while Shayna Jack's triumphant return from a doping ban continued at the world championships. Australians in finals on day four O'Callaghan, the 18-year-old rated the next big thing in Australian swimming, won a silver medal in the 200 metres freestyle in Budapest on Tuesday night — her first individual medal at a major meet. Jack collected a silver medal as part of Australia's mixed 4x100m medley relay team with Kaylee McKeown, Zac Stubblety-Cook and Matt Temple. Jack, who was suspended for two years after testing positive to a banned substance just before the 2019 world championships, also won 4x100m freestyle relay gold on the opening night in Budapest. ""We put it together and came home with a silver which I think we are all really, really proud of,"" Jack said after Australia's medley team finished some two and a half seconds behind runaway winners the United States. ""Everyone loves being a part of relays. It's a rare opportunity in an individual sport to enjoy that moment together."" O'Callaghan was also a member of Australia's 4x100m freestyle relay team that saluted on the opening night of competition. In the 200m freestyle final, O'Callaghan produced the second-fastest final 50m split in the field to push the victor, China's Junxuan Yang, to the wall. The calm and collected teen entered Budapest as arguably the only Australian in the swim community with low expectations. O'Callaghan last year won two gold and a bronze at the Tokyo Olympics for being a heat swimmer in relays but is now basking in an individual spotlight. ""I wasn't expecting too much coming into the meet,"" she said. ""I was nervous all day and definitely shocked to look up and see that result when I touched the wall. ""To medal in this race is quite cool."" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. O'Callaghan finished just 0.3 seconds behind Yang while her Australian teammate Madi Wilson finished fifth. McKeown's medley relay silver came after she placed third in 50m backstroke semi-final — she was sixth quickest into the final. Lizzy Dekkers, on debut at a senior international meet, was sixth-fastest qualifier for the 200m butterfly final but fellow Dolphin rookie Abbey Connor missed out on making the medal race. And Australia's Se-Bom Lee also missed a berth in the final of the 200m individual medley after being 14th through the semi-finals.

41,This Republican refused to 'break his oath'. Then Trump supporters threatened his home with his dying daughter inside,world,"  Latest Capitol riot hearings reveal Donald Trump's push to overturn election. Here are the key takeaways A scheme to use ""fake electors"" and personal threats to public officials revealed in chilling, tearful testimony: these are the fresh details from the latest January 6 Capitol riot hearings in the US. And these public testimonies have revealed more of Donald Trump's plan to overturn the 2020 US election. The committee's chairman Bennie Thompson said pressuring public servants into ""betraying their oaths"" was a crucial part of Mr Trump's ""playbook"". ""And a handful of election officials in several key states stood between Donald Trump and the up-ending of American democracy,"" he said. Here are the key takeaways from the latest hearing. Arizona's House speaker Rusty Bowers testified in person, saying he was pressured to overturn the key state's election results, fielding calls from the former president and his legal team. Mr Bowers said he repeatedly asked Mr Trump's lawyers to show evidence of widespread fraud, but they never provided any. He said he told them he wouldn't do anything illegal. ""You are asking me to do something against my oath, and I will not break my oath,"" he said in response to the requests. He recalled Trump team lawyer Rudy Giuliani at one point told him: ""'We've got lots of theories, we just don't have the evidence.'"" Mr Bowers said: ""I did not feel that the evidence, in its absence, merited a hearing and I didn't want to be used as a pawn."" In the days and weeks after the calls, he said he was subject to a smear campaign online and ""it was disturbing"". He told stories of people outside his house on loudspeakers and one man with a gun who verbally threatened his neighbour. He teared up as he spoke of his wife and his daughter, who he said was ""gravely ill,"" becoming upset as people swarmed outside. His daughter died in the weeks after the riots. Before Mr Bowers's testimony, Mr Trump released a statement about a November call between the pair, saying ""he told me the election was rigged and I won Arizona"". In response, Mr Bowers said: ""I did have a conversation with the president. That certainly isn't it."" The committee was shown texts sent from an aide to Republican senator Ron Johnson to another aide for then vice-president Mike Pence. They said the senator wanted to hand-deliver a fake elector certificate to Mr Pence. Electors are part of the US political system's electoral college — and 538 of them formally cast votes for the president. Those votes are then counted in a joint session of Congress in January, and Mr Pence was in charge of announcing the winner. Asked for a comment, Mr Johnson's spokesperson Alexa Henning referred to a tweet, in which she wrote: ""The senator had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office."" Much of the latest testimony has tied Donald Trump directly to the pressure campaign, including an effort to replace state electors with officials expected to support Mr Trump's efforts to reverse the election outcome. Mr Trump's pressure was most intense in Georgia, where Joe Biden had narrowly won after years of Republican presidential victories in the state. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his deputy, Gabe Sterling, testified about becoming two of the former president's top targets as he floated conspiracy theories, but they refused to back down to his pressure. The committee played audio of the call where Mr Trump asked the officials there to ""find"" 11,780 votes that could flip the state to prevent Mr Biden's election victory. ""They should find those votes. They should absolutely find that. Just over 11,000 votes, that's all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia, and we're not going to forget it,"" Mr Trump said on the call. He also alleged thousands of dead people voted — but Mr Raffensperger said they found just four. ""There were not votes to find,"" Mr Raffensperger said. The question now is whether the pressure Donald Trump exerted on Mike Pence constitutes a crime, write Joanna Robin and Carrington Clarke. He said he and his team went through ""every single allegation,"" and down every ""rabbit hole,"" that Mr Trump and his allies presented to state election officials. But Mr Trump wouldn't accept it, telling Mr Raffensperger that it could only be dishonesty or incompetence that they couldn't find the necessary amount of votes. Mr Sterling said competing against the false statements from the former president was like a ""shovel trying to empty the ocean"". Despite speaking out publicly in the weeks following the election, Mr Sterling said he couldn't convince even some of his own family members that the election outcome was valid. Wandrea ArShaye ""Shaye"" Moss was an election worker in Georgia, alongside her mother, Ruby Freeman. Mr Trump, Mr Giuliani and others used a video to claim that she and her mother were involved in a plot to bring in suitcases of false ballots for Joe Biden. None of it was true, she said, and she faced repeated (and racist) threats after she was accused of participating in a cover-up of the ""stolen"" election. ""A lot of threats wishing death upon me. Telling me that, you know, I'll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, be glad it's 2020 and not 1920,"" she said. She said Mr Trump used her name 18 times on a call with Mr Raffensperger. ""I have been threatened and harassed,"" Ms Moss said in prepared remarks released ahead of her testimony. ""They went after my child — my child. He heard horrible things about his mum, just because I did my job."" Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson talked about how her ""stomach sunk"" when she heard the sounds of protesters outside her home one night after the election when she was putting her child to bed. She wondered if they had guns or were going to attack her house. ""That was the scariest moment,"" Ms Benson said. Another Michigan official, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, told the committee about receiving 4,000 text messages after Mr Trump published his phone number online. This was the fourth of eight planned hearings. The panel is making its case that Mr Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election directly related to the riots in January 2021. One outstanding question is whether the select committee after the hearings will recommend criminal charges against Mr Trump for his role in the events leading up to the riot. While the committee itself cannot charge the former president with any crimes, the US Justice Department has been watching the testimony closely. In Georgia, a grand jury is investigating Mr Trump's actions and the findings are expected there later this year.

42,Twitter board 'unanimously' endorses Elon Musk's $63 billion takeover bid,world,"  Twitter board 'unanimously' endorses Elon Musk's $63 billion takeover bid to shareholders Twitter's board has recommended unanimously that shareholders approve the proposed $US44 billion (more than $63 billion) sale of the company to billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The announcement was made in a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. Mr Musk reiterated his desire to move forward with the acquisition last week during a virtual meeting with Twitter employees, though shares of Twitter remain far below his offering price, signalling considerable doubt that it will happen. On Tuesday at the Qatar Economic Forum in an interview with Bloomberg, Mr Musk listed the approval of the deal by shareholders as one of several ""unresolved matters"" related to the Twitter deal. Shares of Twitter were essentially flat just before the opening bell on Tuesday and far short of the $US54.20 per share that Mr Musk has offered to pay for each. The company's stock last reached that level on April 5 when it offered Mr Musk a seat on the board before he had offered to buy all of Twitter. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday detailing a letter to investors, Twitter's board of directors said it ""unanimously recommends that you vote [for] the adoption of the merger agreement"". If the deal was to close now, investors in the company would pocket a profit of $US15.22 for each share they own.

43,Serena Williams makes winning return in Eastbourne doubles after a year out,world," Sport Serena Williams partners Ons Jabeur for women's doubles win in Eastbourne in her first match in a year Serena Williams has made a winning return to action at the Eastbourne International, coming from a set down with partner Ons Jabeur to beat Sara Sorribes Tormo and Marie Bouzkova 2-6, 6-3 (13-11) in the women's doubles. Age: 40 WTA singles titles: 73 Grand slam singles titles: 23 Previous tournament: Wimbledon 2021 (rd 1) Weeks at number one: 319 Current singles ranking: 1204 The former world number one had not played competitive tennis since limping out of last year's first-round match at Wimbledon — where she has won seven of her 23 grand slam singles titles — in tears due to a leg injury. Back on court and on grass again, Williams stepped up preparations for Wimbledon, where the main draw starts next Monday, having been granted a wildcard to enter, alongside Tunisian Jabeur in the opening round at Eastbourne. Looking rusty with some loose early shots, 40-year-old Williams, who has slipped to 1,204th in the singles rankings, saw her serve broken in the fourth game and there was no way back as Spaniard Sorribes Tormo and her Czech partner took the opening set. Williams, who was sporting black tape on her face to help with a sinus problem, had no answer as Sorribes and Bouzkova made three successive breaks at the start of the second to help put them in a commanding position. However, a ferocious volley from Williams helped her and Jabeur hold serve to make it 4-3, before the American showed further signs she was starting to find her rhythm with a booming forehand down the line to break their opponents' serve. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. Williams served out the next game to take the match to a final set tie-break, which swung this way and that, with both pairings having match points before Sorribes Tormo missed a volley at the net to gift her opponents victory.

44,"Uvalde school shooter could have been neutralised after three minutes, Texas public safety chief says",world,"  Texas public safety chief blasts Uvalde police response to school mass shooting as a 'failure' The police response to the Uvalde school shooting that killed 19 children and two teachers was ""an abject failure"" in which a commander put the lives of officers over those of the children. During a Texas Senate hearing into the May 24 mass shooting, Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) director Steven McCraw told politicians that ""terrible decisions"" were made by the onsite commander and officers who responded to the scene. He said they did not have enough training, costing them valuable time that may have saved lives. ""There is compelling evidence that the law enforcement response to the attack at Robb Elementary was an abject failure and antithetical to everything we've learned,"" Mr McCraw said. Police actions after the gunman entered Robb Elementary School and began shooting have come under close scrutiny, with many parents and relatives expressing deep anger over the response. Among the delays Mr McCraw detailed was the search for a key to the classroom door where the shooting occurred. Mr McGraw said police waited to enter while they sought a key, despite the fact that the door was not locked and there is no evidence officers ever tried to see if it was secured. ""There's no way to lock the door from the inside and there's no way for the subject to lock the door from the inside,"" Mr McCraw said. Days after the shooting, the Texas DPS said that as many as 19 officers waited over an hour in a hallway outside classrooms 111 and 112 before a US Border Patrol-led tactical team finally made entry. Mr McCraw reiterated that in the hearing on Tuesday. ""The officers had weapons, the children had none. The officers had body armour, the children had none. The officers had training, the subject had none. One hour, 14 minutes, and eight seconds — that is how long the children waited, and the teachers waited, in Room 111 to be rescued,"" the DPS director said. ""Three minutes after the subject entered the west building, there was a sufficient number of armed officers wearing body armour to isolate, distract and neutralise the subject,"" Mr McCraw added. Police who responded minutes after a shooting at a Texas primary school are facing criticism and a formal investigation as questions are raised about delays. Here's what we know about how the killings of 21 people unfolded. ""The only thing stopping a hallway of dedicated officers from entering Room 111, and 112, was the on-scene commander, who decided to place the lives of officers before the lives of children,"" the director said in the hearing. Mr McCraw said the scene commander, Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo, ""waited for radio and rifles, and he waited for shields and he waited for SWAT. Lastly, he waited for a key that was never needed"". Mr Arredondo earlier this month said he never considered himself the incident commander of the scene of the shooting, and that he did not order police to hold back on breaching the building. Mr Arredondo told the Texas Tribune that he left his two radios outside the school because he wanted his hands free to hold his gun. He had said he called for tactical gear, a sniper and keys to get inside, holding back from the doors for 40 minutes to avoid provoking sprays of gunfire. Community members along with parents of the victims urged Mr Arredondo to resign during an impassioned school board meeting on Monday, ABC News America reported.

45,Australia spun out in Colombo as Sri Lanka clinches ODI series,world," Sport Sri Lanka beats Australia by four runs in Colombo to clinch ODI series 3-1 with a game to play Australia's looming challenge of ""extreme"" turning Sri Lankan Test wickets has been laid bare, after being spun out of the one-day series with a four-run defeat in Colombo. Chasing 259, David Warner played a lone hand with 99 as Australia capitulated from 4-189 in the 36th over to be all out for 254 and down 3-1 in the five-match series. The margin could also have been far worse, if not for Pat Cummins's 35 and Matthew Kuhnemann scoring 14 from the final over off Dasun Shanaka before being caught in the ring on the final ball. But it couldn't paper over Australia's uphill battle against spin. Seven wickets fell to the slower bowlers, as Sri Lanka played five turners and sent down 43 overs from them on a used wicket that spun well into the night. Just over a week out from the first Test in Galle, the hosts' win will likely confirm the blueprint on how they plan to beat Australia in the red-ball format. Legspinner Jeffrey Vandersay took 2-40, offspinner Dhananjaya de Silva 2-39 and mystery spinner Maheesh Theekshana 1-40. Warner meanwhile had looked in control after Aaron Finch (0), Mitch Marsh (26), Marnus Labuschagne (14) and Alex Carey (19) all came and went. The opener was cagey in the early overs, before taking on Theekshana. He hit 12 boundaries in his knock, going hard through the covers and driving superbly. And when he reached 99 Warner looked almost certain to end the longest century drought of his international career, which now sits at 48 innings across all formats. But the match then swung violently in Sri Lanka's favour, handing them their first bilateral one-day series win over Australia at home since 1992. With Warner at the non-striker's end, Travis Head (27) was bowled by Dhananjaya, before Glenn Maxwell was trapped lbw by Theekshana next over. And when Warner finally got back on strike, Dhananjaya drew him off balance and beat his outside edge to have him stumped. Cameron Green followed shortly after, before Cummins (35) and Kuhnemann's late efforts. The collapse will no doubt have evoked memories of the 2016 Test tour for the locals, when Australia struggled to combat the spin in the 3-0 series loss. ""This is extreme spin; you don't usually see these type of wickets,"" Warner said. ""You only see them here. India is completely different. They don't turn like that. They're actually good wickets. And they turn later on day three or four (of Tests). ""So everyone has to prepare as well as they can. It's about being busy. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. ""It's about committing. ""It's about batting long periods of time.

The good news for Australia on Tuesday was that their two best players from 2016 are returning to fitness, with Mitchell Starc and Steve Smith both sighted in the nets with a red ball after finger and quad injuries. Cummins also bowled nicely on field, taking 2-37 and unlucky not to have another wicket early when he hit Charith Asalanka's leg stump with the left-hander on one. However the bail did not fall off, allowing Asalanka to lead Sri Lanka from 3-34 to 258 with his maiden international century of 110 from 106 balls.

46,Taiwan scrambles jets to warn away 29 Chinese planes in its Air Defence Identification Zone,world,"  Taiwan scrambles jets to warn away 29 Chinese planes in its Air Defence Identification Zone Taiwan has scrambled jets to warn away 29 Chinese aircraft in its Air Defence Identification Zone, including bombers that flew to the south of the island and into the Pacific. The latest Chinese mission included 17 fighters and six H-6 bombers, as well as aircraft with electronic warfare, early warning and anti-submarine capabilities, and an aerial refuelling aircraft, Taiwan's defence ministry said. Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said the large-scale exercise by the Chinese military showed China's military threat was ""more serious than ever"". ""But there's no way #Taiwan will cave in & surrender its sovereignty & democracy to the big bully. Not a chance!,"" Mr Wu wrote on Twitter. Some of the aircraft flew in an area to the north-east of the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands, according to a map the ministry provided. However, the bombers, accompanied by an electronic warfare and an intelligence gathering aircraft, flew into the Bashi Channel that separates Taiwan from the Philippines and into the Pacific before turning back to China on the route they came in. Taiwan sent combat aircraft to warn away the Chinese aircraft, while missile systems were deployed to monitor them, the ministry said, using standard wording for its response. It was the largest incursion since Taiwan reported 30 Chinese aircraft in its Air Defence Identification Zone on May 30. The largest to date this year occurred on January 23, involving 39 aircraft. Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has complained for the past two years or so of repeated missions by the Chinese air force near the democratically governed island, often in the south-western part of its Air Defence Identification Zone. Taiwan calls China's repeated nearby military activities ""grey zone"" warfare, designed to both wear out Taiwanese forces by making them repeatedly scramble, and also to test Taiwanese responses. There was no immediate comment from China, which has in the past said that such moves were drills aimed at protecting the country's sovereignty. China launched its third aircraft carrier on Friday, the Fujian, named after the province opposite Taiwan. The People's Liberation Army Eastern Theatre Command says the combat ""readiness patrol"" had happened around Taiwan in recent days and was ""a necessary action"". China's military said last month it had conducted an exercise around Taiwan as a ""solemn warning"" against its ""collusion"" with the United States. That came after US President Joe Biden angered China by appearing to signal a change in a US policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" on Taiwan by saying the United States would get involved militarily if China were to attack the island. China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan to accept its sovereignty claims. The Taipei government said it wanted peace but would defend itself if attacked. No shots have been fired and the Chinese aircraft have not been flying in Taiwan's air space, but in its Air Defence Identification Zone, a broader area Taiwan monitors and patrols that acts to give it more time to respond to any threats.

47,Prince William's life in pictures as he celebrates his 40th birthday,world,"  Prince William's life in pictures as he celebrates his 40th birthday Prince William, second in line to the throne, is celebrating his 40th birthday. The father-of-three has been in the royal spotlight from the moment he was born. The public's first glimpse of Princess Diana and Prince Charles' eldest son was when he was just one day old. William was born on June 21, 1982, at St Mary's Hospital in London, the same hospital where his three children were also born. As the eldest son of Prince Charles, William overtook his uncle Prince Andrew in the line of succession. Just two years later, brother Harry was born, making them the so-called ""heir and the spare"". Diana appeared to be acutely aware of the difficult dynamic faced by royal siblings and sought to break the cycle by forging a strong bond between her two sons. She remained a dedicated mother after her separation from Charles in 1992 The pair divorced in in August 1996. William was just 15 years old when Diana died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. Harry was only 12. William told a BBC documentary in 2020 that his mother's death was ""pain like no other"". William studied at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, where he met his future wife Kate Middleton in 2001. They both studied art history and lived together in a share house. William and Kate broke up briefly in 2007 but got back together a few months later. Meanwhile, William started his military career. He graduated as an army officer from the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst in December 2006. William went on to serve in the military for seven-and-a-half years. He was on active duty in the Army, Navy and Royal Air Force before becoming a civilian air ambulance pilot. William proposed to Kate during a holiday at a wild game reserve in Kenya in October 2010. He gave her his mother's blue sapphire and diamond engagement ring. They tied the knot at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011. Their eldest child George was born on July 22, 2013. George overtook his uncle Harry to become the third in line to the throne. William and Kate's second child Charlotte was born on May 2, 2015. Charlotte made her Trooping the Colour debut in 2016, appearing on the Buckingham Palace balcony alongside her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II. William left his job as ambulance pilot in 2017 to take on royal duties full time. Two years after the birth of their daughter, William and Kate welcomed their second son and third child, Louis. Louis was born on April 23, 2018. Like their father, the three children have grown up in the spotlight. William has said having children brought back painful emotions from his own childhood, but his wife had helped him through it. ""Me and Catherine, particularly, we support each other and we go through those moments together,"" he said in 2020. ""Emotionally, things come out of the blue that you don't really expect and that you've never really dealt with. ""It's one of the most amazing moments of life, but it's also one of the scariest."" In July 2021, William and Harry unveiled a memorial of their mother for what would have been her 60th birthday. It was the first time the pair had been together since the funeral of their grandfather, Prince Philip. Together, William and Kate, Harry and Meghan were seen as the ""Fab Four"" when Meghan first stepped out into royal life. But the couples' relationship deteriorated over time, culminating in Harry and Meghan's resignation as senior royals in early 2021. While his brother has stepped away, William has stepped up in recent years as the Queen gradually hands over more responsibilities to Charles and William. At 73, Charles faces the challenges of a post-Elizabethan world as much as his son. William has demonstrated he is willing to be critical of the House of Windsor and seek to keep the monarchy relevant in modem British society. During a recent royal tour of the Caribbean, he was receptive to Jamaica's intention on becoming a republic. ""Catherine and I are committed to service,"" he said. ""For us, that's not telling people what to do. It is about serving and supporting them in whatever way they think best."" This month, William took to the streets of London to sell copies of the Big Issue, a magazine that supports people experiencing homelessness. It is part of his and Catherine's ongoing role to position themselves as advocates for issues like homelessness and mental health. In an article for the magazine, William pledged to ""continue doing what I can to shine a spotlight on this solvable issue. ""And while I may seem like one of the most unlikely advocates for this cause, I have always believed in using my platform to help tell those stories and to bring attention and action to those who are struggling,"" he wrote. ""I plan to do that now I'm turning 40, even more than I have in the past."" with AP We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

48,"Druids, pagans and New Age revelers: Thousands flock to Stonehenge for summer solstice",world,"  Thousands of people from all walks of life have flocked to greet the summer solstice at Stonehenge to mark the longest day of the northern hemisphere year. Over 6,000 druids, pagans and New Age revellers gathered at the ancient stone circle on Tuesday to catch the sunrise phenomenon after two years of COVID-19 restrictions. Jennifer Davies of English Heritage, the organisation responsible for Stonehenge, said this year was ""particularly special"" after the pandemic. ""Everyone is doing their own celebrations … people take away from it different things,"" she said. ""For some people, they really believe it is a place of worship. ""Other people just marvel at its construction and everything and are interested in the archaeology."" ""It's a very happy, peaceful, almost euphoric occasion,"" she said. Stonehenge was built on a windswept plane in Wiltshire, south-west England, by a sun-worshipping Neolithic culture. Exactly how those people, with only the most rudimentary tools, came to construct the monument continues to fascinate the world thousands of years later. Experts still debate its purpose, but it is aligned so that on summer solstice the sun rises behind the Heel Stone and rays of sunlight are channelled into the centre of the circle, meaning that it is at this time of the year that its purpose can truly be appreciated. ""Stonehenge is designed and built to celebrate and acknowledge both the summer and the winter solstices,"" explains Ms Davies. ""The monument itself, the Stone Circle, is designed so perfectly that at midsummer, when the sun rises, the rays of the sun, they come across the horizon, and they strike precisely straight down the middle of the Stonehenge monument, as precisely as if we had designed it in the 2020s with the most space age instruments available, but this was designed 5,000 years ago."" Police said the atmosphere was ""convivial"" and there were only two arrests — one for assault and one for drug possession. The sunrise was streamed online in 2020 and 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic, although last year dozens of people ignored advice not to travel to attend the monument.

49,Russia warns of 'serious negative impact' for Lithuania over Kaliningrad ,world,"  One of President Vladimir Putin's top allies has warned Lithuania that Russia would respond to a halt in the transit of EU-sanctioned goods to the exclave of Kaliningrad. Nikolai Patrushev, a former KGB spy who is now the secretary of Russia's Security Council, added it would respond in such a way that the citizens of the NATO and European Union member would feel the pain. With East-West relations at a half-century low over Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania banned the transit of goods sanctioned by the EU through its territory to and from the exclave, citing EU sanction rules. Mr Patrushev said Lithuania's ""hostile"" actions showed that Russia could not trust the West. ""Russia will certainly respond to such hostile actions,"" Mr Patrushev was quoted as saying by state news agency RIA. ""Appropriate measures are being worked out in an interdepartmental format and will be taken in the near future. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says Ukraine has demonstrated its determination to live up to European values and standards. ""Their consequences will have a serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania."" Kaliningrad, formerly the port of Koenigsberg, capital of East Prussia, was captured from Nazi Germany by the Red Army in April 1945 and ceded to the Soviet Union after World War II. It is sandwiched between NATO members Poland and Lithuania. Lithuania said the ban on the transit of sanctioned goods across its territory was merely the implementation of EU sanctions, part of a swathe of measures intended to punish Mr Putin for the invasion of Ukraine. ""It's ironic to hear rhetoric about alleged violations of international treaties from a country which has violated possibly every single international treaty,"" Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said. ""There is no Kaliningrad blockade,"" Ms Simonyte said. Russia's foreign ministry summoned the EU's ambassador to Moscow, Markus Ederer, over the situation which the Kremlin said on Monday was beyond serious. ""Lithuania is not taking unilateral measures — it is implementing EU sanctions,"" Mr Ederer was quoted as saying by RIA. The EU's envoy to Moscow urged Russia on Tuesday to refrain from ""escalatory steps and rhetoric"" over what Moscow calls ""anti-Russian restrictions"" on goods transiting between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia, an EU spokesperson said. Ukraine's war with Russia is exacerbating an already alarming global food crisis. ""He conveyed our position on Russia's aggression against Ukraine and explained that Lithuania is implementing EU sanctions and there is no blockade, and asked them to refrain from escalatory steps and rhetoric,"" spokesperson Peter Stano said. Russia's foreign ministry, which earlier on Tuesday summoned the bloc's ambassador to Moscow, called for transit via the region to be restored ""immediately"" and vowed to retaliate if the situation did not improve. EU member Lithuania has shut a rail corridor from Russia to its exclave to certain basic goods, including construction materials, metals and coal in response to new EU sanctions that came into force on Saturday. Russian attacks laid down a curtain of fire across areas of eastern Ukraine where pockets of resistance are denying Moscow full military control of the region. ""Today everything that can burn is on fire,"" Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region, said. The Russian military currently controls about 95 per cent of the Luhansk region. But Moscow has struggled for weeks to overrun it completely, despite deploying additional troops and possessing a massive advantage in military assets. In the city of Sievierodonetsk, the hot spot of the fighting, Ukrainian defenders held on to the Azot chemical plant in the industrial outskirts. About 500 civilians are sheltering at the plant, and Mr Haidai said the Russian forces are turning the area ""into ruins"". ""It is a sheer catastrophe,"" Mr Haidai  said about the plant. ""Our positions are being fired at from howitzers, multiple rocket launchers, large-caliber artillery, missile strikes."" Neighbouring Lysychansk, the only city in the Luhansk region that is still fully under Ukrainian control, was targeted in multiple airstrikes. The Ukraine president's office said that at least six civilians had been killed over the previous 24 hours, and 16 others were wounded. According to its daily update, Russian forces over the day shelled the northern Chernihiv region, and intensified their shelling of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. Explosions also occurred on Tuesday morning (local time) in the southern city of Mykolaiv. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it did not know the location of two Americans captured while fighting in eastern Ukraine, but that they were mercenaries and could be sentenced to death in Russian-backed breakaway territories. Americans Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, went missing this month while fighting near Kharkiv. Russian state media later showed video interviews with the pair, saying they had been captured by Russian-backed forces. Citing an unidentified source, the Interfax news agency reported that the men were in the separatist self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) in eastern Ukraine. The UK says it will do whatever it takes to secure the release of two British prisoners sentenced to death in a breakaway state in eastern Ukraine. Britons Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin and Moroccan citizen Brahim Saadoun were sentenced to death by a DPR court this month after being captured fighting with the Ukrainian army. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow could not rule out that the two captured men, both from Alabama, would also be sentenced to death if put on trial in a separatist territory. Though Russia does not carry out the death penalty, the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, whose independence is recognised only by Moscow, have it on their statute books. Asked whether the Americans could be put on trial in the DPR and sentenced to death, Mr Peskov said: ""We cannot exclude anything because these are decisions for the court. We never comment on them and have no right to interfere in court decisions."" Reuters could not immediately verify the Interfax report on the location of the Americans. A spokesperson in the DPR declined immediate comment. The Kremlin said that as ""mercenaries"", the men are not protected by the Geneva Conventions, which outline how prisoners of war should be treated.

50,Hundreds locked inside Macau casino amid COVID-19 outbreak ,world,"  A hotel and casino resort in the world's biggest gambling hub of Macau has been locked down by authorities with 700 people inside, due to a coronavirus infection outbreak on the property. The lockdown comes as the Chinese special administrative region carries out a two-day mass testing of its more than 600,000 population after dozens of locally transmitted coronavirus cases were discovered over the weekend. Footage obtained by local broadcaster TDM and industry publications showed police officers in protective gear sealing the complex to prevent people from entering or leaving. Government officials were also preparing COVID-19 tests for the hundreds of people inside. Fortuna, an aged, gaudy property located on Macau's main peninsula, is a satellite casino under the umbrella of SJM Holdings, the entity created by former Macau kingpin Stanley Ho. Its casino was headed by local businessman Sio Tak Hong, who was arrested last year for alleged corruption and money laundering. For decades, Macau has pledged its loyalty to Beijing in exchange for a steady influx of cashed-up gamblers. But the dramatic arrest of a casino owner leaves many wondering what lies in this port city's future. The hotel and the government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Macau's previous coronavirus outbreak was in October last year and the city has not previously had any large-scale quarantine or lockdowns. Dozens of cases have emerged since the weekend but have been far below daily infections in places including neighbouring Hong Kong, where infections have jumped to over 1,000 in recent days. The Chinese-ruled former Portuguese colony adheres to China's ""zero COVID"" policy, which aims to eradicate all outbreaks at just about any cost, running counter to a global trend of trying to co-exist with the virus. Most residents have been asked to stay at home, restaurants are shut for dine-in and border restrictions have been tightened, meaning casino revenues are likely to be close to zero for at least a week and likely in the coming weeks, analysts said. Hong Kong's outbreak this year saw more than 1 million confirmed infections, and more than 9,000 deaths, swamping hospitals and public services. Officials there say they are unlikely to further tighten restrictions as the pressure on medical services has not increased. Macau only has one public hospital with its services already stretched on a daily basis. The territory's swift plan to test its entire population comes as it keeps open the border with mainland China, with many residents living and working in next-door Chinese city Zhuhai. Reuters.

51,Britain's biggest rail strike in 30 years over pay and jobs brings network to a standstill,world,"  Britain's biggest rail strike in 30 years has kicked off as tens of thousands of staff walked out in a dispute over pay and jobs that could pave the way for widespread industrial action across the economy in the coming months. Picket lines appeared at dawn and will be lined by some of the more than 40,000 rail workers who are due to strike on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, bringing the network to a standstill. The London Underground was also shut due to the strike. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, under pressure to do more to help British households who face the toughest economic hit in decades, said the industrial action would harm businesses as they continue to recover from the pandemic. Unions have said the rail strikes could mark the start of a ""summer of discontent"" with teachers, medics, waste disposal workers and even barristers moving towards industrial action as surging food and fuel prices pushes inflation towards 10 per cent. ""Our campaign will run for as long as it needs to run,"" Mick Lynch, secretary-general of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), told reporters on Monday. The prime minister said the unions were harming the people they claimed to be helping. ""By going ahead with these rail strikes, they are driving away commuters who ultimately support the jobs of rail workers, whilst also impacting businesses and communities across the country,"" Mr Johnson will tell his cabinet later on Tuesday, according to his office. Britain's economy initially rebounded strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic but a combination of labour shortages, supply chain disruption, inflation and post-Brexit trade problems has prompted warnings of a recession. The government says it is giving extra support to millions of the poorest households but says above-inflation pay rises would damage the fundamentals of the economy. ""Sustained higher levels of inflation would have a far bigger impact on people's pay packets in the long run, destroying savings and extending the difficulties we're facing for longer,"" Mr Johnson said. The outbreak of industrial action has drawn comparison with the 1970s, when Britain faced widespread labour strikes including the 1978-79 ""winter of discontent"". The strikes come as travellers at British airports experience chaotic delays and last-minute cancellations due to staff shortages while many Britons have to wait months for new passports to arrive due to processing delays. The rail strike means only about half of Britain's rail network will be open on strike days with a very limited service running on those lines and continued disruption on the days in between strike days.

52,"Elon Musk's teenager requests name change, says she no longer wants to be related to billionaire",world,"  Elon Musk's teenager requests name change, says she no longer wants to be related to billionaire Elon Musk's transgender daughter has filed a request in the Los Angeles County Superior Court to have her name legally changed. In documents shared online, the 18-year-old says she wants to change her name in accordance with her gender identity and because she no longer wants to be related to her biological father. Here's what we know about it. Musk's daughter, who has a twin brother, has only recently turned 18. If a name change application is filed by a minor, it must be signed by both parents. Legal documents published online show she has formally asked the court to change her gender from male to female and to register her new name (which was redacted in the version of the documents shared online). US media has reported that her new recognised surname will be Wilson, which is her mother's maiden name. Author Justine Wilson and Elon Musk were married but divorced in 2008. Not publicly. The court documents didn't go into any further detail about the relationship between Musk and his daughter. Reuters requested comments from both Tesla's media offices and a lawyer representing Musk, but neither immediately responded. Musk declared his support for the Republican Party, whose elected representatives support a raft of law changes that would limit transgender rights in states across the US, just a few weeks ago — after the name change petition was initially filed. At this stage, it's not entirely clear. The teenager says the reason for her name change is ""gender identity and the fact that I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form"". There are no details in the published documents about whether the decision to change her name and distance herself from her billionaire father means she will forego any kind of benefits or inheritance. The Tesla and SpaceX founder has an estimated net worth of about US$213.9 billion ($306.98 billion). A hearing for the name change petition is scheduled for later this week (but there's no indication Musk will attend it). Musk's twins, who just turned 18, are his oldest living children. There have been no public submissions from the other twin, Griffin, of intentions to distance himself from his father. Musk also has younger teenage triplets with Ms Wilson and shares two children with singer Grimes. X Æ A-Xii was born in 2020, and their youngest child Exa Dark Sideræl was born earlier this year.

53,Hong Kong's Jumbo Floating Restaurant capsizes at sea,world,"  Hong Kong's Jumbo Floating Restaurant capsizes at sea four days after leaving harbour Hong Kong's iconic Jumbo Floating Restaurant has capsized in the South China Sea less than a week after being towed away from the city, its parent company says. The restaurant encountered ""adverse conditions"" on Saturday as it was passing the Xisha Islands, also known as the Paracel Islands, in the South China Sea, and water entered the vessel and it began to tip, according to Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises. The company said no-one was injured, but efforts to save the vessel failed and it capsized on Sunday. ""As the water depth at the scene is over 1,000 meters, [it makes it] extremely difficult to carry out salvage works,"" it said in a statement. It said the company was ""very saddened by this accident"". The Jumbo Floating Restaurant, almost 80 metres in length, was a Hong Kong landmark for over four decades, serving Cantonese cuisine to more than 3 million guests, including Queen Elizabeth II and actor Tom Cruise. It closed in 2020 due to the pandemic, laying off all its staff. Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises said the restaurant became a financial burden to its shareholders, with millions of Hong Kong dollars spent on its inspection and maintenance even though it was not in operation. The restaurant was towed away last Tuesday, with the company saying it planned to move it to a lower-cost site where maintenance could be carried out. It said that prior to its departure, the vessel had been thoroughly inspected by marine engineers, hoardings were installed, and all relevant approvals were obtained. ""The company is now getting further details of the accident from the towing company,"" the statement said.

54,Russian journalist's Nobel Peace Prize medal auctioned for record $148.6 million to help Ukrainian children,world,"  The Nobel Peace Prize medal auctioned off by Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov to raise money for Ukrainian child refugees fetched $US103.5 million ($148.6 million) on Monday night (local time), shattering the old record for such a sale. A spokesperson for Heritage Auctions, which handled the sale, could not confirm the identity of the buyer but said the winning bid was made by proxy. The $US103.5 million sale translates to 100 million Swiss francs, hinting that the buyer is from overseas. ""I was hoping that there was going to be an enormous amount of solidarity, but I was not expecting this to be such a huge amount,"" Muratov said in an interview after bidding in the nearly three-week auction ended on World Refugee Day. Previously, the most ever paid for a Nobel Prize medal was $US4.76 million in 2014, when James Watson, whose co-discovery of the structure of DNA earned him a Nobel Prize in 1962, sold his. Three years later, the family of his co-recipient, Francis Crick, received $US2.27 million in bidding also run by Heritage Auctions. Muratov, who was awarded the gold medal in October 2021, helped found the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta and was the publication's editor-in-chief when it shut down in March amid the Kremlin's clampdown on journalists and public dissent in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It was Muratov's idea to auction off his prize, having already announced he was donating the accompanying $US500,000 cash award to charity. Each Nobel laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money which depends upon the income of the Nobel Foundation and is shared between recipients (Muratov shared his Peace Prize with Filipino American journalist Maria Ressa). Muratov has said the proceeds would go directly to UNICEF in its efforts to help children displaced by the war in Ukraine. Just minutes after bidding ended, UNICEF told the auction house it had already received the funds. Online bids had begun June 1 to coincide with the International Children's Day observance. Many bids came by telephone or online. The winning bid, tendered by telephone, catapulted the bidding from the low millions to astronomical levels. Muratov had left Russia on Thursday to begin his trip to New York City, where live bidding began on Monday evening. Early on Monday, the high bid was only $US550,000. The purchase price had been expected to spiral upward — but not over $US100 million. ""I can't believe it. I'm awestruck. Personally, I'm flabbergasted. I'm stunned. I don't really know what happened in there,"" said Joshua Benesh, the chief strategy officer for Heritage Auctions. Two journalists whose work has angered the authorities in Russia and the Philippines have been awarded the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize. ""We knew that there was a tremendous groundswell of interest in the last couple of days by people who were moved by Dimitry's story, by Dimitry's act of generosity, that the global audience was listening tonight."" Muratov and Heritage officials said even those out of the bidding could still help by donating directly to UNICEF. The two journalists, who each received their own medals, were honoured for their battles to preserve free speech in their respective countries, despite coming under attack by harassment, their governments and even death threats. Melted down, the 175 grams of 23-karat gold contained in Muratov's medal would be worth about $US10,000. Muratov has been highly critical of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and the war launched in February that has caused nearly 5 million Ukrainians to flee to other countries for safety, creating the largest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II. Independent journalists in Russia have come under scrutiny by the Kremlin, if not outright targets of the government. Since Vladimir Putin came into power more than two decades ago, nearly two dozen journalists have been killed, including at least four who had worked for Muratov's newspaper. In April, Muratov said he was attacked with red paint while aboard a Russian train. Since its inception in 1901, there have been nearly 1,000 recipients of the Nobel Prizes honouring achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and the advancement of peace.

Wajdi Al Nasi, who was born deaf and has never uttered a word, was able to hear for the first time after undergoing a delicate operation at King Khalid Hospital in Najran. Wajdi giggled with delight after hearing sounds through an earpiece, having undergone a four-hour cochlear implant procedure. It followed two years of checks and tests at the hospital's otolaryngology department to check on the reliability of his auditory nerve and cochlea. After resigning themselves to a life without sounds for Wajdi, his overjoyed father, Fadl Al-Hilali, said the family will now try to teach him how to speak. ""Joy filled our hearts due to the success of his operation ... there is a six-month treatment plan now for his speech,"" he told Arab News. The prep student was diagnosed with a profound hearing loss in both ears as a baby and received cochlear implants a month after her first birthday. ""We have actually started language rehabilitation at the hands of speech therapists at King Khalid Hospital in Najran. ""The efforts that were made ended the suffering of my child Wajdi from severe hearing loss in both ears."" External hearing aids were added last week, three weeks after the four-hour operation was successfully performed. ""We have passed the most difficult stage, and now comes the rehabilitation of the four-year-old child,"" said Ahmed Al-Araqbi, the doctor who supervised the procedure. ""The child has just started hearing words for the first time in his life, and he must continue to be rehabilitated by specialists to complete the necessary treatment."" Had the operation not been a success, Wajdi would have been transferred to Saudi Arabia's Institute of Deaf and Mutes where he would be given a certificate of his disability. Instead, his family hopes he will be able to talk to them and his friends by the end of the year.

56,Here's what we're expecting from tonight's January 6 committee hearing,world,"  Here's what we're expecting from the next January 6 Capitol riot committee hearing Revelations from the Capitol riot investigations have been explosive so far. Damning evidence about the January 6 attack on the Capitol building itself and the fallout from Donald Trump's debunked claims of electoral fraud in the 2020 presidential election have been broadcast live around the world, and there's still more to come. Here's what we're expecting from the next instalment and who will be giving evidence. The committee says we'll hear from two ""panels"" in this next hearing. The first includes: Republican Brad Raffensperger is shaping up to be a key witness at this stage of the investigation. The committee will review allegations that former president Donald Trump leaned on Mr Raffensperger to invalidate ballots that voters had cast for Joe Biden. Just a few days before the riots, the Washington Post obtained audio of an hour-long phone call between Mr Raffensperger and Mr Trump. It reported that Mr Trump alternately flattered, begged and threatened Mr Raffensperger with vague criminal consequences in an attempt to undo his election loss in Georgia. But it was reported at the time that Mr Raffensperger pushed back, saying Mr Trump was using debunked conspiracy theories about what was a fair and accurate election. Mr Raffensperger even shared this tweet at the time in response to Mr Trump's claims (back when the former president had access to a Twitter account): On the second panel is former Georgia election worker Wandrea ArShaye ""Shaye"" Moss. She and her mother, Ruby Freeman, were caught up in a Trump campaign-led conspiracy theory falsely accusing them of pulling fake ballots from suitcases hidden under tables at a ballot-counting centre. It resulted in a barrage of harassment, racism and death threats. The focus is shifting to how the former president and his allies pressured officials in multiple key battleground states with schemes to reject ballots or entire state tallies. Mr Raffensperger is expected to testify about the pressure he faced from Mr Trump to ""find"" more than 11,000 votes that could flip the state's results. Democratic committee member Adam Schiff told CNN that the committee will hear from ""courageous state officials who stood up and said they wouldn’t go along with this plan"" to reverse the results. Mr Schiff also told US media this week that the hearing will dig into the ""intimate role"" former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had in the plot to pressure Georgia state legislators and election officials. That's where Ms Moss's testimony is expected to come in. A Reuters investigation published last year describes their experience like this: ""The story of Moss and Freeman shows how some of the top members of the Trump camp – including the incumbent president himself – conducted an intensive effort to publicly demonise individual election workers in the pursuit of overturning the election."" The next Select Committee Hearing kicks off from 1pm on Tuesday, June 21 Washington time. That's 3am Wednesday, June 22 AEST. It will be live-streamed via YouTube on the committee's website. In case you missed it, there was a big focus on Mike Pence last week. The committee praised the former vice-president in former hearings for standing up to Mr Trump's demands to overturn the election, despite the former president being told repeatedly that his deputy didn't have the power to do so. But it doesn't look like Republicans and Democrats are suddenly going to start getting along after these revelations. Pence on Monday slammed Mr Biden for his economic record, accusing him of not keeping his election promises to the American people. ""The time has come, for the sake of the American people, for President Joe Biden to put our country first and put our families first and put America back on a path to prosperity built on American principles and ideas,"" Mr Pence said during a speech at the University Club of Chicago. Well, he can't tweet. But he's had plenty to say on his own social media platform, Truth Social, about the latest hearings. Over the weekend Mr Trump shared updates accusing the committee of ""trying to create a fake narrative"" that he was aware of his election loss and pushed ahead with attempts to overturn it anyway. ""This is completely false,"" Mr Trump said in a post online. ""I felt the election was RIGGED & STOLLEN (sic), have from the very beginning, & have only gotten stronger in that belief with time."" Mr Trump also continued to call the investigation a ""witch hunt"" and said his correspondence with Brad Raffensperger as first reported by the Washington Post was ""perfect"" and ""appropriate"".

57,Floods in Bangladesh force military to help millions marooned in towns and villages as Indian flood crisis eases,world,"  Floods in Bangladesh force military to help millions marooned in towns and villages as Indian flood crisis eases Soldiers on small boats have delivered relief material across flooded towns and villages in Bangladesh, after more than nine million people were marooned in the low-lying country and neighbouring India following heavy rains, officials said. At least 32 people have been killed in Bangladesh since late last week when monsoon downpours triggered catastrophic flooding in the north-eastern Sylhet administrative division. It has left around a quarter of Bangladesh's 15 million population stranded amid fast-rising waters and swollen rivers. ""The flooding is the worst in 122 years in the Sylhet region,"" said the director-general of Bangladesh's Department of Disaster Management, Atiqul Haque. He added that a dozen districts in the north and north-east of Bangladesh had been swamped by floods. ""Rescue and relief operations have been intensified, with army and navy officials reaching out to more people trapped in floodwater,"" Mr Haque said. Large areas of entire settlements were submerged under brown, swirling waters, as military personnel in boats arrived with drinking water and food for people sheltering in the upper floors of buildings, local television footage showed. Government authorities are attempting to deliver 1,720 tonnes of rice and 58,000 packets of dry food, as well as water purification tablets and medicines, to flood-hit communities. The situation in Bangladesh has been worsened by waters cascading down from the surrounding hills of India's Meghalaya state. This includes some of world's wettest areas, such as Mawsynram and Cherrapunji, which each received more than 970 millimetres of rain on Sunday, according to government data. Meghalaya and neighbouring Assam state have received 134 per cent more rainfall than the average for June, according to data compiled by the state-run India Meteorological Department. In Bangladesh, around 300,000 people have been moved to shelters in Sylhet, but more than four million people are stranded near their homes. Khalilur Rahman — a resident of Sylhet's Sunamganj district — said flood waters had swamped the ground floor of his two-storey house. A perfect storm of factors created conditions for devastating flooding across Queensland and NSW this year and global warming may have made them worse, says the Bureau of Meteorology. ""I have never seen such floods in my life,"" Mr Rahman, 43, said by phone, adding that there had been no electricity since heavy rains began on Thursday night. ""Dry food is running out. There is no drinking water."" In India's Assam state, where at least 26 people have been killed since heavy rains began about a fortnight ago, flood waters have started receding, the state government said. However, 4.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with around 220,000 staying in makeshift shelters run by the government. Over a million hectares of farmland have been flooded. ""The overall flood situation is improving [but] the biggest challenge is to reach out to the displaced people and provide them with relief materials,"" said Pijush Hazarika, Assam's Water Resources Minister.

58,'Get a grip': Ballon D'Or winner Megan Rapinoe criticises exclusion of trans athletes,world,"  'Get a grip': Ballon D'Or winner Megan Rapinoe criticises growing exclusion of trans people from sport Two-time Women's World Cup football champion and former Ballon D'Or winner Megan Rapinoe has defended the inclusion of transgender athletes in sport as more governing bodies, including FIFA and World Athletics, consider tighter restrictions on trans people's participation. Warning: This article contains discussion of suicide. Speaking to Time Magazine on Monday, Rapinoe said much of the decision-making from governing bodies that excluded trans people was misinformed, and that the rationale behind blanket bans was both unethical and not supported by evidence. Her comments come as FINA, world swimming's governing body, voted to further restrict trans women from competing in elite competitions. ""I'm 100 per cent supportive of trans inclusion,"" Rapinoe said. ""People do not know very much about it. We're missing almost everything. Frankly, I think what a lot of people know is versions of the [political] right's talking-points, because they're very loud, they're very consistent, and they're relentless. ""At the highest level, there is regulation. In collegiate sports, there is regulation, and at the Olympic and professional level. It's not like it's a free-for-all where everyone's just doing whatever. ""Show me the evidence that trans women are taking everyone's scholarships, are dominating in every sport, are winning every title. I'm sorry, it's just not happening. ""So we need to start from inclusion — period. And, as things arise, I have confidence that we can figure it out. But we can't start at the opposite. That is cruel. And, frankly, it's just disgusting. ""We really need to take a step back and get a grip on what we're really talking about here because people's lives are at risk. Kids' lives are at risk with the rates of suicide, the rates of depression and negative mental health and drug abuse. ""We're [framing] everything through 'God forbid a trans person be successful in sports'. Get a grip on reality and take a step back."" While those who believe trans women should be excluded from sport have defended their right to ""free speech"", little airtime has been given to examining the science behind the claims being made. Rapinoe, who plays alongside Canadian women's national team and non-binary, trans footballer Quinn at NWSL club OL Reign, has used her high-profile platform to advocate for social causes for several years. She was the first footballer in the world to kneel in solidarity with NFL player Colin Kaepernick, was a leader in the US women's national team's fight for equal pay, and regularly uses interviews and award acceptance speeches to shine a light on issues affecting the LGBTQIA+ community, of which she is part. ""I am not just speaking for me,"" she said. ""I'm speaking for a lot of people. ""For a long time, I was the only player that was 'out'. And, so, just being the only spokesperson and making sure I'm setting the right example, saying the right things, whether it comes to gay marriage or difficult and nuanced topics like trans inclusion in sports. ""Those are the challenges of just continuing to stay educated. ""Nothing goes unsaid. Speak it plainly. And I'm gonna speak it loudly, and I think that helps other people who maybe don't have the ability to do that, or who aren't in a place to do that quite yet."" The United States is facing its own reckoning when it comes to trans people's inclusion in sports, with several Republican-controlled states banning trans people from all sport, despite not being able to provide evidence to support it, while others have passed laws requiring school-aged girls ""suspected"" of being trans to receive physical genital examinations to ""prove"" their gender presentation matches their biological sex characteristics. For Rapinoe, these blanket sports laws not only disproportionately affect an already-marginalised community, but they also feed into a discourse where success in elite sport takes priority over the rights and freedoms of trans people. ""I think people also need to understand that sports is not the most important thing in life, right? Life is the most important thing in life,"" she said. During the election campaign, focus turned to the issue of transgender women in sport, leaving more significant issues unchallenged, writes Tracey Holmes. ""And so much of this trans inclusion argument has been put through the extremely tiny lens of elite sports. That is not the way to be framing this question. ""We're talking about kids. We're talking about people's lives. We're talking about the entire government coming down on one child in some states, three children in some states. ""They are committing suicide because they are being told that they're gross and different and evil and sinful and they can't play sports with their friends that they grew up with. It's monstrous. ""I would also encourage everyone out there who is afraid someone's going to have an unfair advantage over their kid to really take a step back and think, 'What are we actually talking about here?' ""We're talking about people's lives. I'm sorry, your kid's high school volleyball team just isn't that important. It's not more important than any one kid's life.""

59,'Distraught': Detained WNBA star Brittney Griner unable to talk to wife due to US embassy's lack of staff,world," Sport Brittney Griner makes 11 unanswered calls to wife from jail in Russia with US embassy unstaffed WNBA star Brittney Griner tried to call her wife nearly a dozen times through the American embassy in Russia on Saturday, but was unable to connect because the phone line at the embassy was reportedly not staffed. Cherelle Griner provided the update on Monday, saying the phone calls came on the date of the couple's fourth anniversary. The couple has not been able to speak by phone in the four months since the two-time Olympic gold medallist's arrest in Russia, where she remains in jail. Their long-awaited call was to take place on Saturday, after the couple finally received Russian government approval. However, the day came and went without any contact, leaving an anguished Cherelle Griner to wonder what went wrong. On Monday, she said she learned that Brittney Griner had tried to call 11 times over a period of several hours, dialling a number she'd been given for the US embassy in Moscow. The couple had been told that call would then be patched through to Cherelle Griner in Phoenix. However, each time Brittney Griner rang, the call went unanswered, because the desk at the embassy where the phone rang was apparently unstaffed on Saturday. ""I was distraught. I was hurt. I was done, fed up,"" Cherelle Griner told The Associated Press, adding that she was in tears. ""I'm pretty sure I texted [Brittney Griner's] agent and was, like: 'I don't want to talk to anybody. It's going to take me a minute to get my emotions together, and just tell everybody I'm unavailable right now.' ""It just knocked me out. I wasn't well. I'm still not well."" Brittney Griner, a seven-time WNBA All-Star who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, was detained at a Russian airport on February 17 after authorities there said a search of her bag revealed vape cartridges containing hashish oil. On Monday, the State Department released a statement saying they ""deeply regret that Brittney Griner was unable to speak with her wife because of a logistical error"". The department reiterated that it has no higher priority than the safety of Americans overseas and that it remains in regular contact with families of hostages and wrongful detainees. In an interview with the US television network NBC news, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the US basketballer was guilty of drug offences and denied she was a hostage. For Cherelle Griner, the experience has exacerbated already simmering frustrations about the US government's response to her wife's case. Although US officials have repeatedly said they were working behind the scenes to get the WNBA star home from Russia, Cherelle Griner said she was ""very pissed"" about the incident. ""I find it unacceptable and I have zero trust in our government right now,"" she said. ""If I can't trust [the government] to catch a Saturday call outside of business hours, how can I trust [them] to actually be negotiating on my wife's behalf to come home? ""That's a much bigger ask than to catch a Saturday call."" Cherelle Griner said a contact in the US government had apologised to her for the error. She added that she had since since learned that the number Brittney Griner had been given to dial typically processes calls from prisoners on Mondays through Fridays, which is why no one was there to transfer the call. When Brittney Griner was arrested in May, the State Department designated her as wrongfully detained, moving her case under the supervision of its Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, effectively the government's chief hostage negotiator. Russian state-run news agency Tass reported last week that her detention had been extended until July 3. Basketball star Brittney Griner remains detained in Russia and it's unclear how an unexpected prisoner exchange deal that saw Russia free a US marine veteran will affect the the WNBA star. Cherelle Griner said she was still hoping to talk to, or meet with, President Joe Biden, but ""at this point it's starting to feel like a no"". So far, Cherelle Griner says she's had to rely exclusively on others' assessments about her wife's condition. Lawyers and consular affairs officials have been able to speak to the basketball star, but her wife has not. ""This was such a big moment, because this would have been the first time where I truly could tell if she's OK,"" Cherelle Griner said. ""This would have been the first time for me to actually just hear her in real time and to truly know if she's OK, or to know if she's seconds away from not being in existence anymore.""

60,Americans caught fighting in Ukraine detained by Russia for 'illegal activities',world,"  The Kremlin says two Americans detained in Ukraine while fighting on the Ukrainian side of the war were mercenaries who endangered the lives of Russian servicemen and should face responsibility for their actions. In an interview with the US television network NBC news, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said US basketball star Brittney Griner, who has been held in Russia for more than two months, was guilty of drug offences and not a hostage. Mr Peskov's comments were the first formal acknowledgement that the two men, identified in US reports as Andy Huynh, 27, of Hartselle, Alabama, and Alexander Drueke, 39, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, were being held and were under investigation. ""They are soldiers of fortune. They were involved in illegal activities on the territory of Ukraine. They were involved in firing at, and [the] shelling of, our military personnel. They were endangering their lives,"" Mr Peskov said. ""And they should be held responsible for those crimes they have committed. Those crimes have to be investigated …The only thing that is clear is that they have committed crimes. They are not in the Ukrainian army. They are not subject to the Geneva convention."" Family members said last week the two men went to Ukraine as volunteer fighters and had gone missing. Many assumed large-scale, brutal conflict lay in the past, but the 116 days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine have proven massed attrition-style wars may occur in our near future, writes Mick Ryan. Russian media last week broadcast images of them captured while fighting for Ukraine. Mr Peskov would not reveal where the men were being held. Two Britons and a Moroccan have already been sentenced by a court under the jurisdiction of separatists in Donetsk, on grounds that they were mercenaries and not subject to the Geneva Convention governing prisoners of war. Kyiv condemned the court ruling as having no authority and said the fighters were members of the Ukrainian armed forces and, thus, subject to Geneva Convention protection. Moscow calls its actions a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and to protect it from fascists. Ukraine and its allies in the West say the fascist allegation is baseless and that the war is an unprovoked act of aggression. Mr Peskov said Ms Griner — who had come to promote basketball in Russia — was being prosecuted under laws forbidding the importation of drugs. ""Russia is not the sole country in the world to have quite strict laws in that sense … it is prosecuted by law. We can do nothing about that,"" Mr Peskov told NBC. He ""strongly disagreed"" with any notion that Ms Griner, who arrived in Russia in February, was being held hostage. ""We cannot call her a hostage. Why should we call her a hostage?"" he said. ""She violated Russian law and now she is being prosecuted. It not about being a hostage."" Russian customs officials say vape cartridges containing hashish oil were found in Ms Griner's luggage. The US State Department determined in May that Ms Griner was wrongfully detained and assigned diplomats to work for her release. Her wife, Cherelle Griner, has said she is being used as a political pawn. Meanwhile, in the US, Brittney Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, says she is 'distraught' because the couple has not spoken in four months.

61,Mekong fisherman snags largest-recorded freshwater fish that 'stuns' scientists,world,"  Largest-recorded freshwater fish caught, tagged and released in Mekong River, Cambodia The world's largest-recorded freshwater fish, a giant stingray, has been caught in the Mekong River in Cambodia, according to scientists from the South-East Asian nation and the United States. The stingray, captured on June 13, measured almost 4 metres from snout to tail and weighed slightly under 300 kilograms, according to a statement on Monday by Wonders of the Mekong, a joint Cambodian-US research project. Previously, the record for a freshwater fish was a 293-kilogram Mekong giant catfish, discovered in Thailand in 2005, the group said. The stingray caught recently was snagged by a local fisherman south of Stung Treng, in north-eastern Cambodia. That fisherman alerted a nearby team of scientists from the Wonders of the Mekong project, which has publicised its conservation work in communities along the river. The scientists arrived within hours of getting a post-midnight call with the news, and were amazed at what they saw. ""Yeah, when you see a fish this size, especially [coming from] freshwater, it is hard to comprehend. So, I think all of our team was stunned,"" Wonders of the Mekong leader Zeb Hogan said in an online interview from the University of Nevada in Reno. The university is partnering with the Cambodian Fisheries Administration and USAID, the US government's international development agency. Freshwater fish are defined as those that spend their entire lives in freshwater, as opposed to giant marine species — such as bluefin tuna and marlin — or fish that migrate between fresh and saltwater, such as the huge beluga sturgeon. The stingray's catch was not just about setting a new record, he said. ""The fact that the fish can still get this big is a hopeful sign for the Mekong River, "" Dr Hogan said, noting that the waterway faces many environmental challenges. The Mekong River runs through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. It is home to several species of giant freshwater fish but environmental pressures are rising. In particular, scientists fear a major program of dam-building in recent years may be seriously disrupting spawning grounds. ""Big fish, globally, are endangered. They're high-value species. They take a long time to mature. So, if they're fished before they mature, they don't have a chance to reproduce,"" Dr Hogan said. ""A lot of these big fish are migratory, so they need large areas to survive. They're impacted by things [such as] habitat fragmentation from dams, [and,] obviously, impacted by overfishing. ""So about 70 per cent of giant freshwater fish, globally, are threatened with extinction, and all of the Mekong species [are, too]."" The team that rushed to the site inserted a tagging device near the tail of the mighty fish before releasing it. That device will send tracking information for the next year, providing unprecedented data on giant stingray behaviour in Cambodia. ""The giant stingray is a very poorly understood fish. Its name, even its scientific name, has changed several times in the last 20 years,"" Dr Hogan said. ""It's found throughout South-East Asia, but we have almost no information about it. ""We don't know about its life history. We don't know about its ecology, about its migration patters."" Researchers said it was the fourth giant stingray reported in the same area in the past two months, all of them females. They think this may be a spawning hotspot for the species. Local residents nicknamed the stingray ""Boramy"" — or ""full moon"" — because of its round shape and because the moon was on the horizon when it was freed on June 14. In addition to the honour of having caught the record-breaker, the lucky fisherman was compensated at market rate, meaning he received a payment of approximately $860.

62,Japanese court rules same-sex marriage ban doesn't violate the constitution,world,"  Japanese court rules same-sex marriage ban doesn't violate the constitution A Japanese court has ruled that the country's ban on same-sex marriage does not violate the constitution, and rejected demands for compensation by three couples who said their right to free union and equality has been violated. The Osaka District Court ruling is the second decision on the issue, and disagrees with a ruling last year by a Sapporo court that found the ban on same-sex marriages unconstitutional. It underscores how divisive the issue remains in Japan, the only member of the Group of Seven major industrialised nations that does not recognise same-sex unions. In its ruling, the Osaka court rejected the plaintiffs' demand for 1 million yen ($10,600) in damages per couple for the discrimination they face. The plaintiffs — two male couples and one female couple — were among 14 same-sex couples who filed lawsuits against the government in five major cities — Sapporo, Tokyo, Nagoya, Fukuoka and Osaka — in 2019 for violating rights to free union and equality. They argued that they have been illegally discriminated against by being deprived of the same economic and legal benefits that heterosexual couples enjoy through marriage. Support for sexual diversity has grown slowly in Japan, but legal protections are still lacking for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. LGBTQ people often face discrimination at school, work and at home, causing many to hide their sexual identities. Rights groups had pushed for passage of an equality act ahead of last summer's Tokyo Olympics, when international attention was focused on Japan, but the bill was quashed by the conservative governing party. The Osaka court on Monday said freedom of marriage in the 1947 constitution only means male-female unions and does not include those of the same sex, and therefore banning same-sex marriages is not unconstitutional. Judge Fumi Doi said marriage for heterosexual couples is a system established by society to protect a relationship between men and women who bear and raise children, and that ways to protect same-sex relationships are still undergoing public debate. The court, however, urged the parliament to seek methods to better protect same-sex relationships, including options to legalise same-sex marriage. Monday's ruling was a setback for activists who were hoping to further pressure the government after the ruling by the Sapporo district court in March 2021. The plaintiffs and their lawyers called Monday's ruling unacceptable and said they would appeal. Akiyoshi Tanaka, a plaintiff, said at a news conference that they took legal action to obtain backing from the judicial process for parliament to take action, but ""the court stayed away from making a decision"". He said he will keep fighting. ""We don't have time to feel discouraged,"" he added. Kodo Nishimura is a Buddhist monk and make-up artist who has worked on some of the world's biggest beauty pageants, including the Miss Universe competition, and in 2019 teamed up with Queer Eye for a special limited series. He hopes he will inspire many young people who feel burdened by the pressure to conform. Public opinion in Japan currently favours legalising same-sex marriage. Under current rules in Japan, same-sex couples cannot inherit each other's property, house or other assets they share, and have no parental rights over each other's children. They are often barred from renting apartments together, and from hospital visits and other services available to married couples. More than 200 municipalities across Japan, or 12 per cent of the total, have begun issuing non-legally binding partnership certificates to same-sex couples since Tokyo's Shibuya district became the first to do so in 2015. The Tokyo metropolitan government recently adopted a plan to accept registrations starting in October from same-sex couples seeking certificates of their partnerships. Still, this is not the same as a marriage certificate and does not provide equal legal protection. Taiwan is the only Asian nation or territory that has legalised same-sex marriage.

63,The dark history of the guerrilla group of which Colombia's new president was once a member ,world,"  Colombia's new president was once part of a guerrilla group with a wild history. Now he promises social change Leftist leader Gustavo Petro has become Colombia's new president after winning against real estate millionaire Rodolfo Hernández in the 2022 presidential elections. He's the first progressive to do so in the country's history, marking a drastic shift in Colombia's political game. However, long before Mr Petro had a career in politics, he was once part of the M-19 guerrilla rebel group. From kidnappings to elusive conspiracy theories around Pablo Escobar, the group often used violence to seize power over the country. If you're a fan of the American crime drama Narcos — which delves into the world of drugs and Colombian politics in the 1980s and 90s — then their name might sound familiar. But what do we actually know about the lucrative group? Here's a deep dive into their colourful history. Between sword stealing and drug cartels, the dark history of the M-19 rebel group is as colourful as the Narcos series, but the fictional depiction is not always as accurate. The group formed in response to unhappiness over under-represented groups in the county's 1970 election. They were also known as the 19th of April Movement (Movimiento 19 de Abril), named for the date that the group asserted the1970 election was ""stolen"" from former dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. In 1980, M-19 stormed the embassy of the Dominican Republic in Bogota and took 52 hostages, including 15 ambassadors. In 1985, they stormed Bogota's Palace of Justice, leading to the deaths of more than 100 people, including nearly half of the country’s Supreme Court justices. Members of the group took over the palace and held the Supreme Court hostage, intending to hold a trial against then-president Belisario Betancur. Supreme Court President Alfonso Reyes Echandia, who died in the siege, pleaded in telephone calls to a Bogota radio station for a ceasefire and dialogue with the rebels. Mr Betancur refused to call off the siege. But it was when the group stole a sword — that belonged to South America's revered liberator Simon Bolivar — that they launched to national attention. The sword of Simon Bolivar was used in Colombia's battle for independence from Spain. Bolivar — who freed much of South America from Spanish rule — died in Colombia in 1830. M-19 stole the sword  in 1974 from Bolivar House, the patriot's former residence in Bogota. They promised to return it by December 18, 1990, the 160th anniversary of Bolivar's death. But the group found itself at the centre of a political storm when it was unable to keep its pledge. The sword was also rumoured to have passed into the hands of infamous drug trafficker Pablo Escobar, in return for favours granted to the M-19. That group demobilised in 1990 after a peace deal with the government. In that same year, the sword was eventually returned to its home in a ceremony led by the members of the rebel group, according to The Associated Press. ""It has crossed mountains, been hidden in the homes of patriots, and crossed borders,"" M-19 leader Antonio Navarro Wolff said on the day it was returned. But the mystery surrounding the sword remained. Some have even claimed it had been given to Fidel Castro for safekeeping while others said it was in the custody of a cabal of fewer than a dozen men called the Guardians of the Sword. Mr Petro said his political awakening came when he watched his father weep over the death of Argentinian revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. The 62-year-old senator and former Bogota mayor also credits the 1973 military coup that ended the rule of Chile's socialist President Salvador Allende as a reason to enter politics. At the time, Colombia was descending into violence. Mr Petro — the son of a teacher — pledged to fight the ""feudal"" oligarchy enriching itself at the expense of Colombia's poor, he said. ""Twenty-first century politics is between the politics of life and the politics of death,"" the father of six told Reuters in April. ""I represent the politics of life,"" he said. Although never a combatant, Mr Petro's years in the M-19 rebel group have created fuel for critics. He was arrested for weapons possession and served 18 months in prison, where he has said he was tortured. Mr Petro's win is said to mark a drastic change in presidential politics for Colombia, which has long marginalised the left for its perceived association with armed conflict. This campaign was Mr Petro's third presidential bid and his win comes amid widespread discontent over inequality, inflation and violence in the country. Those factors led voters in the election's first round last month to turn their backs on the long-governing centrist and right-leaning politicians and chose two outsiders. In historically conservative Colombia, Mr Petro's proposals — especially a ban on new oil projects — have startled some investors, as oil accounts for nearly half of exports and close to 10 per cent of national income. He's also pledged to fight inequality with free university education, pension reforms and high taxes on unproductive land. Mr Petro will take office at a time when Colombia is struggling with low credit ratings, a large trade deficit and national debt, which is predicted by the end the year to be at 56.5 per cent of GDP.

64,Russian forces take territory as Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns of escalating attacks,world,"  Russian forces have captured territory along a frontline river in eastern Ukraine, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy predicted Moscow would escalate attacks ahead of a summit of European leaders expected to welcome Kyiv's bid to join the EU. Moscow's separatist proxies claimed to have captured Toshkivka, a town on the mostly Ukrainian-held western bank of the Siverskyi Donets river, south of Sievierodonetsk, which has become the main battlefield city in recent weeks. Ukraine acknowledged that Moscow had success in Toshkivka and said the Russians were trying to gain a foothold there to make a breakthrough into the wider, Ukrainian-held pocket of the eastern Donbas region. It also confirmed a Russian claim to have captured Metyolkine on Sievierodonetsk's eastern outskirts. ""Obviously, this week we should expect from Russia an intensification of its hostile activities,"" Mr Zelenskyy said in a Sunday nightly video address. ""We are preparing. We are ready."" Mr Zelenskyy also repeated his plea for more Western weapons to fend off the Russian onslaught. ""We need your support, we need weaponry, weapons that will have better capabilities than the Russian weapons,"" he told a forum in Milan. ""This is a matter of life or death."" At a summit later this week, EU leaders are expected to give their blessing to Ukraine becoming an official candidate to join. That would be be marked as a triumph in Kyiv. Though it would take years for Ukraine to enter the EU, for the bloc to reach deep into the heart of the former Soviet Union would bring about one of Europe's biggest economic and social transformations since the Cold War. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says Ukraine has demonstrated its determination to live up to European values and standards. Ukraine applied to join just four days after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops across the border in February. Mr Putin said the ""special military operation"" was aimed at disarming a neighbour Russia has viewed as a threat and protecting Russian speakers there. Kyiv believes Moscow's wants to restore control over Ukraine and erase its national identity. In the strongest step yet proposed by Kyiv to enforce a cultural break with Moscow, the Ukrainian parliament passed bills on Sunday (local time) that would ban the publication of books or the public broadcast of music by citizens of post-Soviet Russia. The measures, which require Mr Zelenskyy's signature to become law, ""are designed to help Ukrainian authors share quality content with the widest possible audiences, which after the Russian invasion do not accept any Russian creative product on a physical level"", Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said. Russian forces were defeated in an assault on the capital Kyiv in March, but have since launched a new one to capture more territory in the east and solidify their hold on the south. The war has entered a brutal phase of attrition in recent weeks, with Russian forces concentrating their overwhelming artillery firepower on a Ukrainian-controlled pocket of the Donbas, which Moscow claims on behalf of separatists. Much of the fighting has taken place along the Siverskyi Donets river. Russia's TASS news agency quoted Vitaly Kiselev, an aide to the interior minister of the self-proclaimed Russian-backed Luhansk People's Republic separatist administration, as saying on Monday that Toshkivka had been ""liberated"". The town is located on the river's western bank, south of Sievierodonetsk's twin city Lysychansk, a key Ukrainian bastion. Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai acknowledged that a Russian attack on Toshkivka ""had a degree of success"". Russian forces were trying to break through and gain a foothold there and near the small village of Ustinovka further north along the river, he said. The Russians were bringing a huge amount of heavy equipment there including tanks. He also confirmed Russia's claim to have captured Metyolkine on Sievierodonetsk's eastern outskirts. ""Unfortunately, we do not control Metyolkine today,"" he said. Mr Haidai said the situation in Sievierodonetsk was ""very difficult,"" with the Ukrainian forces maintaining control over just one area — the Azot chemical plant, where a number of Ukrainian fighters, along with about 500 civilians, are taking shelter. ""It's just hell there. Everything is engulfed in fire, the shelling doesn't stop even for an hour,"" Mr Haidai said. Sievierodonetsk Mayor Oleksander Stryuk said Russian forces controlled about two-thirds of the city, including most residential areas, and Moscow kept throwing forces at the Ukrainians in an attempt to take over completely. Ukraine's war with Russia is exacerbating an already alarming global food crisis. Only a fraction of 100,000 people who used to live in Sievierodonetsk before the war remain in the city, with no electricity, communications, food or medicine. Even so, Mr Haidai said, the staunch Ukrainian resistance is preventing Moscow from deploying its resources to other parts of the country. International concern has focused on trying to restore Ukrainian exports of food, now shut by a de facto Russian blockade. Ukraine is one of the world's leading sources of grain and food oils, leading to fears of global shortages and hunger. The war has also disrupted global energy markets, including Russian shipments of oil and gas to Europe, still the continent's main source of energy and Moscow's primary source of income. Moscow threatened unspecified retaliation against EU member Lithuania for banning transport of basic goods to Kaliningrad, a Russian outpost on the Baltic Sea surrounded by EU territory. The Lithuanian ban, which took effect on Saturday, blocks shipments of coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology to the outpost. Russia's foreign ministry summoned Lithuania's top diplomat and demanded Vilnius reverse the ""openly hostile"" move immediately, or else Russia ""reserves the right to take actions to protect its national interests"". Lithuania said it was required to enforce the ban under sanctions imposed by the EU. The Russian rouble surged to a near seven year high against the US dollar on Moscow Exchange. The rouble, which has become the world's best-performing currency this year, is steered by Russia's high proceeds from commodity exports and a sharp drop in imports along with a ban on households withdrawing their foreign currency savings. Top policymakers used Russia's annual economic forum in St Petersburg last week to highlight the rouble's recent strength. There are concerns this could weigh on the economy as it tips into recession amid harsh sanctions. This week the rouble could extend gains as companies will need to pay taxes, for which export-focused firms usually convert their dollar and euro revenues.

65,Worried about lettuce? Try living in one of the world's most expensive cities as inflation surges,world,"  Worried about the cost of living? This is the impact inflation is having in some of the world's most expensive cities Australia isn't the only country seeing everyday items like iceberg lettuce go from basic to bougie. Across the globe, people are feeling the pinch as surging inflation becomes a ""global phenomenon"". In some countries, people are already witnessing grocery prices doubling and experts say we're yet to see inflation peak. This is how life is being impacted in some of the most expensive cities in the world. In Hong Kong, Yifan Jin chooses to live in a long-stay hotel close to where she works as a tax consultant rather than rent an apartment. The 26-year-old pays around $HK12,000 ($2,177) per month — an amount she says would not guarantee her a ""good and decent"" flat. ""For $HK12,000, you can only rent rooms in old buildings, with broken toilets, thin glass windows, all kinds of problems,"" Ms Jin told the ABC. Ms Jin describes herself as a ""Hong Kong drifter"", referring to a group born in mainland China but living in Hong Kong. She said most ""Hong Kong drifters"" spend more than one-third of their salaries on rent, which makes life difficult as cost of living rises in the notoriously expensive city. After paying for rent, food and other daily necessities ""there's nothing left"", she said. Hong Kong was ranked at the top of ECA International's 2022 list of most expensive cities to live in. The global mobility company's annual report compares commonly purchased consumer goods, household staples, rents, public transport, and factors in the strength of local currency. The report considered 207 cities in 120 countries and territories, focusing on expats and foreign workers. Although Hong Kong has been less impacted by rising global inflation than other locations, price increases were higher than what is typically witnessed in the city, the report said. It found that a cup of coffee was around $7 and 1 kilogram of tomatoes had gone up to $16.39. Anna Michielsen, ECA's Australia, New Zealand and Pacific general manager, was shocked at the rate at which prices were increasing for everyday goods. ""We're surprised at how quickly and across how many locations inflation has escalated,"" Ms Michielsen said. ""We're not alone in this in any way, shape or form."" No Australian capital cities were among the 10 most expensive, but were all ranked in the top 100, except for Hobart which wasn't included in the report. Sydney was ranked as the most expensive Australian city, coming in at 39. Five of the top cities ranked in the ECA report were in Asia, including Shanghai, which came in at number eight. Jerry Jiang started experiencing skyrocketing food prices about two months ago when China imposed strict COVID lockdowns on the country's second-largest city. ""In April, Shanghai faced a supply shortage at the beginning of the lockdown for a while, so prices surged very fast,"" he said. ""Everything is getting more expensive, like dining out, getting a haircut, rents, petrol, et cetera."" Tomatoes cost almost double what they did a year ago. Mr Jiang is still under lockdown, meaning he is forced to shop online, which is more expensive than at the markets. Katrina Ell, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, said the pandemic was the initial trigger for the increases, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine created a scenario that ""no one expected"". Ukraine's war with Russia is exacerbating an already alarming global food crisis. ""Just as the pandemic was kind of easing off, Russia's invasion of Ukraine threw another spanner in the works and really pushed inflation beyond expectations,"" Ms Ell told the ABC. ""What we're seeing is that it's almost been a perfect storm of factors that have really driven this surge in acceleration that has been a global phenomenon."" The war has pushed up the price of food and energy because both Russia and Ukraine are important suppliers of those commodities. ""Ukraine is an important supplier of fertiliser, wheat, and other really critical non-specific food items. So that's an additional kind of push,"" Ms Ell said. Cities across Asia have been particularly impacted due to their reliance on food and energy imports. ""Within Asia, there are some interesting dynamics at play,"" Ms Ell said. ""Places like Singapore import all their food needs… they're really exposed to that spike in global prices."" Some countries are also restricting their exports to try and keep their own food prices down to the detriment of others, which is further adding to the stress within Asia, she added. Alexander Ponting, an English teacher who moved to Seoul last year, is thankful that things like public transport and coffee are so cheap. But he continues to be shocked by food prices in Seoul, which was ranked as the 10th most expensive city to live in. ""Fruit and vegetables are insanely expensive,"" Mr Ponting said. ""In the UK, a bag of spinach will be like 70 pence ($1.22) or something but here it will cost you three pounds ($5.26)."" Apples are around one pound for a bag in the UK and in Seoul he can pay up to six or seven pounds. In the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, fruit and vegetable prices are nearly doubling. ""The food in Israel is based on vegetables so it's pretty dramatic,"" Tel Aviv resident Ronnie Brodetzky told the ABC. Lettuce used to be four shekels ($1.6) and now it's seven shekels, she said. ""Tomatoes became between 10 to 12 shekels when normally they were four to six. Everything is much more expensive."" Tel Aviv was ranked as number six on ECA's list, while a recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit named Tel Aviv as the world's most expensive city. Ms Brodetzky said the increasing cost of living is becoming a daily topic of conversation. ""I'm feeling a lot of tension, everyone in Israel is,"" she said. ""No-one knows what is going to happen with so much chaos in the world."" Rents have increased 10-14 per cent since COVID, and even activities like going to the swimming pool costs up to 80 shekels when it used to be between 20 and 40. ""When I was a kid, everything was cheap and normal. You wouldn't need to be rich to be able to enjoy your life,"" the 38-year-old said. ""Nowadays, even if you are middle class and have a good salary like me it's not enough. You need to be really rich."" The US has been dominating headlines as it tries to control an inflation rate that has reached a 40-year high. It's not an exaggeration to say millions of Australian households are needing to foot hundreds of extra dollars a week to keep a roof over their head, the lights on and food on the table — and wages aren't keeping up. Last week, the Federal Reserve rolled out its biggest rate hike since 1994 and there are fears the world's largest economy will slip into a recession. But in New York, which was ranked number two on the ECA list, many locals have become desensitised to high costs of living. Beata Kanter said prices have been increasing by ""a dollar here and there"". ""It's more these little incremental increases that probably go unnoticed in day-to-day life,"" she told the ABC. ""New York is already so expensive, so I've been used to spending $US8 ($11.50) on an iced coffee for a long time now."" Mark Dessaix, a New York-based actor from Sydney, hadn't noticed any ""major leaps and bounds"" until recently. The 40-year-old went to buy apples and the cost had doubled. ""In this grocery shop it was $US9 for four apples when it's usually $US4,"" he said. While everyday price increases are not something he is too concerned about, surging rents may impact Mr Dessiax's plans to move into his own apartment next year. ""I pay per month to live with three other people what I was paying to live by myself in Potts Point [in Sydney],"" he said. ""The average to live alone in a studio or one bedroom apartment here is around $US1,600 to $US1,700 a month (around $2,300-$2,440)."" A number of factors will determine how long it will take for inflation to ease, but the conflict in Ukraine plays a major role. ""Because Russia's invasion has driven that change in energy and food costs quite substantially, if that situation deteriorates then inflation will get worse across the globe,"" Ms Ell said. ""Our expectation at the moment would be that inflation will peak around the second or third quarter of this year, and then will gradually come down."" She predicts inflation to be above a rate that central banks are comfortable with through 2023. ""Because of that, we will continue to see central banks lifting rates and borrowing costs remaining elevated.""

66,"Israel dissolves parliament, setting the course for the fifth election in three years",world,"  Israel set for a general election after Naftali Bennett-led ruling coalition dissolves parliament Israel's weakened coalition government has decided to dissolve parliament and call a new election, the country's fifth in three years. The vote, expected in Israel's autumn, could bring about the return of a nationalist religious government led by former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu or another prolonged period of political gridlock. Israel's previous four elections focused on Mr Netanyahu's fitness to rule while he was on trial for corruption charges. They ended in deadlock. In a nationally televised news conference, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said it was not easy to disband the government, but he called it ""the right decision for Israel"". The fragile coalition government — which includes parties from across the political spectrum — lost its majority earlier this year and has faced rebellions from different lawmakers in recent weeks. Foreign Minister Yair Lapid will take over from Mr Bennett on an interim basis in an agreement they announced together. Mr Bennett listed a series of accomplishments and promised an ""orderly"" transition. Mr Lapid thanked Mr Bennett for putting the country ahead of his personal interests. ""Even if we're going to elections in a few months, our challenges as a state cannot wait,"" Mr Lapid said. Mr Bennett formed the eight-party coalition in June 2021 after four successive inconclusive elections. For more than a decade, Israel's longest-serving leader has wielded a seeming invincibility, batting off crises and scandal to remain in power. But now a team of rivals, led by Benjamin Netanyahu's former protege, are joining forces to unseat the Prime Minister. The coalition included a diverse array of parties, from dovish factions that support an end to Israel's occupation of lands captured in 1967, to hard-line parties that oppose Palestinian independence. Often described as a political ""experiment"", it made history by becoming the first Israeli coalition government to include an Arab party. The alliance made a series of accomplishments, including passing the first national budget in several years and navigating a pair of COVID-19 outbreaks without imposing any lockdowns. However, eventually, it unravelled, in large part because several members of Mr Bennett's hard-line party objected to what they felt were compromises made by him to keep the coalition afloat and his perceived moderation. The immediate cause for Mr Bennett's decision was the looming expiration of laws that grant West Bank settlers special legal status. If those laws were to expire, settlers would be subject to many of the military laws that apply to the territory's more than two million Palestinians. Parliament was to vote to extend the laws earlier this month. However, the hard-line opposition — comprised heavily of settler supporters — paradoxically voted against the bill in order to embarrass the government. Dovish members of the coalition who normally oppose the settlements voted in favour of the bill in hopes of keeping the government afloat. Israel has announced plans for a further 6,000 new settlement homes, which has excited some Israelis but left Palestinians fearing further restrictions on their daily lives. By dissolving parliament, the laws remain in effect. Mr Bennett, a former settler leader, said that if he had allowed the laws to expire, there would have been ""grave security perils and constitutional chaos"". ""I couldn't let that happen,"" he said. The dissolution threatens to overshadow a visit scheduled by President Joe Biden for next month. The US Embassy said it assumed that the visit would take place as planned. Mr Netanyahu described the imminent dissolution of parliament as ""great tidings"" for millions of Israelis, and he said he would form ""a broad nationalist government headed by Likud"" after the upcoming elections. Israel held four inconclusive elections between 2019 and 2021 that were largely referendums about Netanyahu's ability to rule while on trial for corruption. Mr Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing. Opinion polls have forecast that Mr Netanyahu's hard-line Likud will once again emerge as the largest single party. But it remains unclear whether he would be able to muster the required support of a majority of lawmakers to form a new government.

67,"After wild flooding, Yellowstone National Park expected to reopen within next two weeks",world,"  Yellowstone National Park expected to reopen within next two weeks following floods Most of Yellowstone National Park should re-open within the next two weeks — much faster than originally expected after record floods pounded the region last week and knocked out major roads, according to federal officials. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said the world-renowned park will accommodate fewer visitors for the time being, and it will take time to restore road connections with some southern Montana communities. Park officials said on Sunday they will use $US50 million ($72 million) in federal highway money to speed up road and bridge repairs. There's still no timetable for repairs to routes between the park and areas of Montana where the recovery is expected to stretch for months. Yellowstone will partially reopen at 8am on Wednesday, more than a week after 10,000 visitors were forced out of the park when local rivers flooded, swollen by melting snow and several inches of rainfall. Only portions of the park that can be accessed along its southern loop of roads will be opened initially and access to the park's scenic back-country will be for day-hikers only. Within two weeks, officials plan to also open the northern loop, after previously declaring it would likely stay closed through the summer season. The northern loop will give visitors access to popular attractions including Tower Fall and Mammoth Hot Springs. They will remain barred from the Lamar Valley, which is famous for its prolific wildlife including bears, wolves and bison that can often be seen from the roadside. Record flooding and rockslides have prompted the rare closure of all five entrances to the United States' Yellowstone National Park. ""That would get 75 to 80 per cent of the park back to working,"" National Park Service Director Charles ""Chuck"" Sams said on Sunday during a visit to Yellowstone to gauge the flood's effects. It will take much longer — possibly years — to fully restore two badly-damaged stretches of road that link the park with Gardiner to the north and Cooke City to the north-east. During a tour of damaged areas on Sunday, park officials showed reporters one of six sections of road near Gardiner where the raging floodwaters obliterated most of the roadway. Muddy water now courses through where the roadbed had been only a week ago. Trunks of huge trees litter the surrounding canyon. With no chances for an immediate fix, Superintendent Sholly said 20,000 tons of material were being hauled in to construct a temporary, alternate route along an old road that runs above the canyon. That would let employees who work at the park headquarters in Mammoth get to their homes in Gardiner, he said. The temporary route also could be used by commercial tour companies that have permits to lead guided visits. ""We've gotten a lot more done than we thought we would a week ago,"" Superintendent Sholly said. ""It's going to be a summer of adjustments."" Meanwhile, some of those hardest hit in the disaster — far from the famous park's limelight — are leaning heavily on one another to pull their lives out of the mud. In and around the agricultural community of Fromberg, the Clarks Fork River flooded almost 100 homes and badly damaged a major irrigation ditch that serves many farms. The town's mayor says about a third of the flooded homes are too far gone to be repaired. Not far from the riverbank, Lindi O'Brien's trailer home was raised high enough to avoid major damage. But she got water in her barns and sheds, lost some of her poultry and saw her recently deceased parents' home get swamped with several feet of water. Elected officials who showed up to tour the damage in Red Lodge and Gardiner — Montana tourist towns that serve as gateways to Yellowstone — haven't made it to Fromberg to see its devastation. Ms O'Brien said the lack of attention is no surprise given the town's location away from major tourist routes. She's not resentful but resigned to the idea that if Fromberg is going to recover, its roughly 400 residents will have to do much of the work themselves. ""We take care of each other,"" Ms O'Brien said as she and two longtime friends, Melody Murter and Aileen Rogers, combed through mud-caked items scattered across her property. Ms O'Brien, an art teacher for the local school, had been fixing up her parents' home with hopes of turning it into a vacation rental. Now she's not sure it's salvageable. ""When you get tired and get pooped, it's OK to stop,"" she said to her friends, whose clothes, hands and faces were smeared with mud. A few blocks away, Matt Holmes combed through piles of muck and debris but could find little to save out of the trailer home that he shared with his wife and four children. Mr Holmes had taken the day off, but said he needed to get back soon to his construction job so he could begin making money again. Whether he can bring in enough to rebuild is unclear. If not, Mr Holmes said he may move the family to Louisiana, where they have relatives. ""I want to stay in Montana. I don't know if we can,"" he said.

68,Macau shuts down amid COVID outbreak but casinos stay open,world,"  The world's biggest gambling hub, Macau, has begun a second day of mass COVID-19 testing after dozens of locally transmitted cases were discovered over the weekend. Banks, schools, government services and other businesses have been shut, but casinos remain open. The testing of Macau's roughly 600,000 residents is expected to end on Tuesday as the Chinese-ruled former Portuguese colony adheres to China's ""zero COVID"" policy aimed to eradicate all outbreaks. Most residents have been asked to stay home, restaurants have been shut to dine-in customers, and border restrictions have been tightened, meaning casino revenue is likely to be close to zero for at least a week and likely the coming weeks, analysts say. Shares in Macau casinos tumbled on Monday morning, with Sands China leading the slide, falling more than 8 per cent — the biggest decline since March 15. Shares in five other casinos dropped between 4 and 7 per cent. Macau's government relies on casinos for over 80 per cent of its income, with most of the population employed directly or indirectly by the casino industry. For decades, Macau has pledged its loyalty to Beijing in exchange for a steady influx of cashed-up gamblers. But the dramatic arrest of a casino owner leaves many wondering what lies in this port city's future. The latest outbreak came suddenly and had been spreading rapidly, with the source still unknown, Macau's chief executive Ho Iat Seng said in a statement on the government's website. This is Macau's first major outbreak in eight months — its previous coronavirus outbreak was in October last year — and it has so far recorded no COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic. An outbreak in the neighbouring Chinese territory of Hong Kong this year saw more than 1 million confirmed infections, and more than 9,000 deaths, swamping hospitals and public services. While Hong Kong has seen an increase to over 1,000 daily cases in the past week, officials have said they are unlikely to further tighten restrictions as the pressure on medical services has not increased. Macau only has one public hospital and its services are already stretched on a daily basis. The territory's swift plan to test its entire population comes as it keeps open the border with mainland China, with many residents living and working in neighbouring Chinese city Zhuhai. China, in contrast, has not opened its borders to Hong Kong, with the financial hub largely isolated from the mainland and the international world. Macau's legislature is this week due to approve an amended gaming law which will lay the groundwork for what is required from the multi-billion-dollar casino operators so they can continue operating. ""Depending on how quickly Macau is able to get the newest outbreak under control, there is risk of delay to finalisation of the gaming law amendments and subsequent concession tender process,"" Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, said.

She finished second behind Martina Wegman of the Netherlands, with Ukrainian Viktoriia Us taking the bronze medal. ""This year it's stepped up a whole other level and the quarter finals are feeling like a final from the get go,"" Fox said. ""So I'm taking it step by step and we'll see what happens (for Paris 2024). ""It was definitely a battle out there. Last week in Prague I finished fourth, and it's good to be in the final again but get a bit of bling."" The third ICF World Cup will be held this weekend in Slovenia.
