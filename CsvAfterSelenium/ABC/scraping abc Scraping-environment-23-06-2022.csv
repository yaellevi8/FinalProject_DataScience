1,"Who are Blockade Australia, and why are some members facing charges that carry up to 10 years in prison?",environment," Science Who are Blockade Australia, and why are some members facing charges that carry up to 10 years in prison? Last Sunday, a property in Colo, north-west of Sydney, was raided by heavily armed police in dramatic fashion, with dogs and helicopters in tow. People on the property, some of them members of climate activist group Blockade Australia, say earlier that morning they stumbled across two armed individuals near their camp, dressed in camouflage gear and who refused to identify themselves. The two men, according to witnesses, jumped into an unmarked car and sped off, hitting two people in the process, but did not immediately get away. Police say the officers were surrounded by activists as they sheltered in their car, their tyres were damaged and they ""feared for their lives"". Police said seven men had been charged with offences including affray, assaulting or hindering police, and destroying or damaging property. So, what do we know about the incident, and what have recent changes to New South Wales' protest laws got to do with it? Blockade Australia describe themselves as an ""organising network"" established in response to Australia's failure to respond to the ""climate and ecological crises"". Their stated aim is to ""build a political movement that can physically resist Australia's planet-destroying operations with disruptive and targeted action"". Members have been previously linked to a series of protests, most recently in Sydney in May, when operations at Port Botany were disrupted, a freight train was scaled in Marrickville and a train line was blocked in Tempe. Up to 40 people were gathered at a bush property, about 80 kilometres from Sydney. According to Greg Rolles, who was present at the time, they were a ""loose network of people interested in a safe climate future"". About 8.30am on Sunday, a member of the group noticed two armed men dressed in camouflage on a ridge line above the camp. Mr Rolles says members of the group approached the two men and attempted to speak to them. However, they didn't move or respond to their questions. ""They were trying to act as if they were invisible,"" Mr Rolles says. ""Then they swung up and pushed my friend away and [one of them] pulled out a radio and said, 'we're compromised, we're compromised'."" At this stage, Mr Rolles says there was confusion in the group as they tried to work out who the men were. Recent reports of VicForests hiring private security to spy on protesters led the group to think that could be the case here, Mr Rolles says. The ABC can reveal VicForests hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance on conservationists and, more recently, conducted what some have called ""digital surveillance"" on people the agency argues are trying to ""discredit"" it. ""My instinct with the camo gear was that this is private security guards — that was my initial response. ""We even thought it could be some right-wing group who'd found out where we were. ""We were very scared about who these trespassers were on our property."" At 9am, according to a statement from Blockade Australia, a ""large black car sped down the driveway"" to the campsite, and the two officers in camouflage ran toward and entered the vehicle. The vehicle then ""tried to speed away, hitting two people"", Mr Rolles says. It was then surrounded by members of the group, who Mr Rolles says were trying to work out who the occupants were. People from the group tried to stop the car leaving, with some on the car's bonnet, according to Mr Rolles. Members of Blockade Australia asked the four occupants of the vehicle, which had no police markings, to identify themselves, but they refused, according to the Blockade Australia statement. Mr Rolles says the car then ""sped off"" again through a crowd, with people on the bonnet. ""I think it was a miracle no-one was killed."" Mr Rolles denies any suggestion that the vehicle's tyres were slashed, or tyre valves were removed. According to the group, about 100 police, including a dog squad, helicopters and uniformed officers, then descended on the property and arrests were made. Mr Rolles and the Blockade Australia group have made several claims against the police, including that later in the day a police officer urinated in front of a 14-year-old girl. The group also denies any use of violence. ""The police claim made on [Sunday] that officers experienced fear or felt threatened is disingenuous,"" the group's statement said. ""We were not the ones with the guns."" New South Wales Police referred questions from the ABC to a media release as ""a number of people are now before the courts, [they] are not in a position to provide more information at this stage."" ""About 8.30am yesterday (Sunday 19 June 2022), police were conducting planned investigations at a property on Putty Road, Colo, when they were approached by a group of people. ""Police will allege in court the officers were surrounded by a group of people and the tyres of an unmarked police vehicle were damaged, rendering it undriveable. ""Officers attached to Hawkesbury Police Area Command responded to the incident, as well as neighbouring commands and specialist resources including PolAir, the Dog Unit, the Public Order and Riot Squad, Police Rescue, Raptor Squad and Operations Support Group."" Speaking to the media on Sunday, Acting Assistant Commissioner Paul Dunstan said officers from Strikeforce Guard were ""conducting investigations"" in the Colo area that morning when they were ""approached by a group of people in near vicinity to a property in Colo Valley"". ""That group set about circling the police as they moved towards their vehicle, and they pushed, shoved, jostled police before they managed to enter the vehicle. ""The police fortunately managed to leave the area after a struggle and some time ensued. ""This activity will not be tolerated by the New South Wales Police Force. ""Those police that were attacked by that group this morning feared for their lives."" According to Acting Assistant Commissioner Dunstan, the NSW Police commenced Strikeforce Guard to ""prevent and disrupt further protest activity that would … disrupt the city in June this year"". On the Blockade Australia website, there is a call for people to join climate protests in Sydney between June 27 and July 2: ""Converge on Sydney from Monday June 27th to blockade the streets of Australia's most important political and economic centre and cause disruption that cannot be ignored. We will meet in the CBD to participate in mass, disruptive action."" In April this year, NSW parliament passed legislation, including fines of up to $22,000 and/or jail terms of up to two years, for protesting illegally on public roads, rail lines, tunnels, bridges, and industrial estates. That followed protests that disrupted operations around Sydney's Port Botany in March. NSW's Attorney-General says the laws will target ""anarchist protesters"", but The Greens say they undermine the right to peaceful protest. Of the seven people who faced court on Monday, at least one is facing a charge of planning to block traffic, according to their lawyer, Mark Davis from Sydney City Crime. ""The basis of that is he was seen [using] a whiteboard showing a road. He was one whose bail was refused."" The new laws are also likely to make some of Blockade Australia's planned protest action at the end of the month illegal. ""The sinister part of that new law is it's an offence to be on a road,"" Mr Davis says. ""People could [previously] march into town, for instance. Now they've made that new law — to be on the road — it's pretty extreme."" A number of human rights, civil liberties, and environment groups condemned the laws as draconian when they were introduced, and said they threatened the democratic process. ""The new, repressive measures in the Roads and Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 2022 deliberately target protesters, threatening everyone from school children marching for climate action to anti-war protesters with up to two years in jail and a $22,000 fine,"" a statement from the Environmental Defenders Office said. ""A healthy environment and safe climate cannot be achieved in the absence of a robust and healthy democracy."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. But the most serious charges being faced by the seven stem from alleged incidents that occurred on the property on Sunday morning, with at least four people facing individual charges that carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in NSW, Mr Davis says. ""They're extremely serious charges,"" he says. ""Intimidation, assault of a police officer, affray — which is a particularly heavy charge, normally reserved for [things like] gang attacks on people — it's indictable and comes with a heavy prison term."" The youngest person facing affray is a 21-year-old woman from Brisbane. ""All of these charges are utterly absurd, not just on the facts of what happened, but on the circumstances,"" Mr Davis says. ""These officers did not identify themselves."" Mr Rolles says the right to protest is more important than ever. ""We're in the middle of a climate crisis and we need civil disobedience to help us have a safe future. ""Yesterday was an example of how the system that causes the climate crisis is going to protect itself."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

2,Gondwana-era rainforest walk to draw ecotourists to Dorrigo National Park in $56-million investment ,environment,"  Dorrigo National Park investment to rival 'the Daintree' with $56 million Gondwana-era walk A four-day walking track featuring three suspension bridges over World Heritage-listed rainforest is set to put the New South Wales town of Dorrigo on the bucket list for ecotourists. Bellingen Shire Council Mayor Steve Allan said the entire Mid North Coast region had been buzzing since the state government announced the $56.4-million investment. It will include a 46-kilometre walking track, as well as walker's hut precincts, new camping areas, three suspension bridges and a new Arc Rainforest Centre. ""This is such a huge opportunity for Dorrigo and Bellingen Shire,"" Mr Allan said. ""It will not just create over 250 jobs, but will bring people from all over the world to visit our world class site. ""It's certainly going to put Dorrigo on the map."" National Parks and Wildlife Service Coffs Coast area manager Glenn Storrie said the project would be an opportunity for tourists to take a step back in time to the Jurassic period. ""Gondwana rainforest goes back to the time when we were part of this supercontinent,"" he said. ""We have living fossils that are part of this rainforest, massive trees, teeming waterfalls and so much wildlife. ""The experience will be like a moment back in time."" NSW National Parks injects $18 billion into the state economy annually, with 75 per cent of that economic benefit generated from regional areas. The state government hoped the project would attract an extra 200,000 domestic and international visitors to the region. ""We really wanted to create places where you can experience the rainforest, smell the cool mountain air and hear the birds,"" Mr Storrie said. ""It's vital for our mental wellbeing and we wanted to reflect that."" NSW Environment Minister James Griffin said the project was part of the largest ever capital investment program in the state's national parks. ""The rainforest at Dorrigo National Park is even more spectacular than the Daintree,"" he said. ""We'll be happily tempting domestic and international tourists away from Queensland."" The walk and new rainforest centre will also incorporate connection and education about the culture of the traditional custodians of the rainforests, the Gumbaynggirr people. ""This is about having people come to national parks as tourists, and leave as conservationists,"" Mr Griffin said.

3,Biogas supply chain emissions found to be higher than fossil fuel equivalent,environment," Science Gas might be expensive, but biogas comes with its own hidden cost in methane emissions Compared to fossil fuels including natural gas, biogas — which is made from waste — is a cleaner, greener alternative. The International Energy Agency estimates that biogas (and biomethane) could meet up to 20 per cent of the world's gas requirements during the transition away from fossil fuels, and help us get closer to net zero. But a new study, published in the journal One Earth, claims emissions from biogas could be higher than we've been estimating, and there is significant work to be done to get its emissions down. The researchers looked at data from European biogas producers. They found the rate (not the total volume) of emissions along the biogas supply chain — from production through to supply — was comparable and generally higher than for natural gas, according to lead author Semra Bakkaloglu from the Imperial College London. ""The level of emissions was higher than we thought it would be,"" Dr Bakkaloglu said. ""At present, our results indicate [biogas emissions] are high — higher even than natural gas, which is clearly a worry."" It's important to point out here that even with high emissions along the supply chain, biogas is still the greener alternative to natural gas. That's because biogas is created out of waste that would have otherwise released emissions as it decomposed naturally. However, that's not to say that biogas is always climate neutral. To create biogas, you start with a feedstock, which might be, for instance, cattle manure or food scraps. That's broken down anaerobically by microorganisms. They create mostly methane and some carbon dioxide as by-products, which are captured as gas — but some of it escapes into the atmosphere. Compared to carbon dioxide, which is released during aerobic digestion, methane is a much more potent, albeit shorter-lived, greenhouse gas, according to Peter Ashman, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Adelaide, who wasn't involved with the research. ""What they're highlighting here is important because if you take CO2 from the atmosphere and you emit it back into the atmosphere as methane, that methane has a much higher potency as a greenhouse gas than CO2,"" Professor Ashman said. Unlike biogas, the International Energy Agency has warned there can be no new coal, oil, or natural gas developments if the world is to reach net zero by 2050. The researchers argue that if we're going to use it as a transition fuel, we need to know biogas emissions for nations to accurately gauge their greenhouse gas footprints. ""If biomethane is to be used to achieve decarbonisation goals in future, biomethane supply chain emissions must be minimised,"" Dr Bakkaloglu said. ""We believe that with the proper design, detection, measurement, and repair techniques, much of the observed emissions can be avoided."" Once the gas is captured during the production of biogas, what's left of the feedstock at the end is what's known as digestate. According to the research, the greatest source of emissions along the biogas supply chain was at the digestate storage stage. The researchers found that methane emissions from digestate were up to 23 per cent higher than had been previously reported. The next highest source of emissions was found to be during the biogas production stage, mostly from the anaerobic digester. Professor Ashman said he wasn't shocked that supply-chain emissions might be higher from European biogas producers, as they lacked the scale and financial backing of most natural gas operators. ""That doesn't surprise me,"" he said. ""Some of these operations are pretty agricultural and they probably don't put much effort into capturing those emissions."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. The researchers said there was a silver lining to their work. First of all, they found there were ""super emitters"" — a few operations responsible for the vast majority of escaping methane. In this case, just 5 per cent of biogas producers were responsible for more than 60 per cent of all methane emitted. Dr Bakkaloglu said it was a similar case for the fossil fuel gas industry. ""Biomethane and biogas supply chains exhibit similar emissions characteristics to oil and natural gas, with super emitters present at all stages,"" she said. ""In natural gas supply chains, about 50 per cent of emissions are down to only about 5 per cent of sources."" For biogas, what that means is that targeting those few worst offenders can put a big dent in the overall greenhouse-gas footprint of the industry. And there are some fairly straightforward steps to plugging leaks in the supply chain. ""We do not want to discourage the production and use of biomethane,"" Dr Bakkaloglu said. ""Rather, we want to highlight those emissions and encourage people to take immediate action to tackle them. ""Biomethane is an important renewable source, but it has the potential to be even better."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

4,"Millions of homes flooded, death toll rises in Bangladesh and India",environment,"  Dozens killed, armed forces deployed, millions displaced as floods hit Bangladesh and India At least 25 people have been killed, millions of homes flooded, transport links severed and people left marooned in low-lying parts of Bangladesh over the weekend, during the country's worst monsoon floods in recent history. In northeastern Sylhet, on the banks of the Surma River, thousands have been seeking shelter in temporary relief centres as flooding from swollen rivers has caused extensive damage to fields and property. Flights at Osmani International Airport in Sylhet were suspended and the Sylhet Sunamganj highway was flooded. Water levels in all major rivers across the country were rising, according to the flood forecasting and warning centre in Dhaka. Bangladesh has about 130 rivers. In the neighbouring Indian state of Assam, at least 17 people were killed during the wave of flooding that began this month, police officials said on Sunday, local time. Thousands of police officers and army personnel have been deployed to parts of the country to help search and rescue efforts. About 105,000 people have been evacuated so far, but police estimated that more than four million were still stranded. Syed Rafiqul Haque — a former ruling party politician in Bangladesh's Sunamganj district — said the country was facing a humanitarian crisis if proper rescue operations were not conducted. ""Almost the entire Sylhet-Sunamganj belt is under water, and millions of people are stranded,"" he said, adding that victims had no food or drinking water, and communication networks were down. Regional officials said about 3.1 million people were displaced, 200,000 of whom were staying in government-run makeshift shelters on raised embankments or on other high land. Last month, a pre-monsoon flash flood, triggered by a rush of water from upstream in India's northeastern states, hit Bangladesh's northern and northeastern regions, destroying crops and damaging homes and roads. The country was just starting to recover when fresh rains flooded the same areas again this week. Bangladesh, a nation of 160 million people, is low-lying and faces threats from natural disasters such as floods and cyclones, made worse by climate change. According to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, about 17 per cent of people in Bangladesh would need to be relocated over the next decade or so if global warming persisted at the present rate.

6,'Almost spiritual': Surf skier's close brush with curious humpback whales on migration,environment,"  Humpback whales have close brush with humans during migration along Bundaberg coast A surf skier has described the moment a humpback whale swam so close it could have scraped its barnacles off, as experts suspect the creatures are exploring more along the Queensland coast. Kevin Hill lives in Bargara, about 4.5 hours drive north of Brisbane, where the photographer and nature enthusiast has had two close encounters with whales in recent weeks. The first happened at the start of June, with Mr Hill capturing the moment on camera as one whale breached in front, and another swam within centimetres of his ski. ""I had got him as he flew up, he was about 50 metres away, close enough, you know, to hear the slap as it hit [the water],"" Mr Hill explained. ""As I was doing so one of the other whales came across in front of me, and just about scraped its barnacles on the front of my ski."" In the second close encounter this week, he said he was followed by a humpback whale as he paddled in his ski off Bargara Headlands. ""What I found is that they're very inquisitive. They know you're there and they just come around and want to have a look,"" he said. ""When they come up, you actually see their eyes… it's almost spiritual. ""I don't feel any fear with them. It's just an amazing experience."" An estimated 40,000 humpback whales migrate from Antarctica to breeding grounds in the Whitsundays between mid-June and October each year. Marine biologist Wally Franklin said the sightings were likely of juvenile whales. ""It's the early part of the migration and you're getting the younger whales up the east coast up past Fraser Island and into the reef area,"" he said. ""These young whales are curious and interactive."" Bundaberg is not as well known for whale spotting as places such as Hervey Bay or the Gold Coast, but an increase in the humpback whale population could be driving them to explore outside their usual waters. ""Over recent years with the increase in the population, they have been spreading out during this northern part of the migration,"" Mr Franklin said. ""That's reflective of the fact that you're getting the whales coming in earlier."" Mr Hill agreed they were becoming a more common sight off Bundaberg. ""There are more and they're coming earlier. And that's brilliant,"" he said. ""Once they give birth further up north and start coming back into Hervey Bay, we're going to have a treat.""

7,"Endangered catfish get marooned in Sunraysia's irrigation channels, but it's illegal to help",environment," ABC Rural Endangered catfish get marooned in Sunraysia's irrigation channels, but it's illegal to help Many native fish, including endangered catfish, have been rescued from Sunraysia's irrigation channels in Victoria's north-west this winter, but what some of these fish's friends are doing is illegal. Each year, channel operators Lower Murray Water drain them to perform maintenance like repairing walls and clearing silt, but fish get stranded in small pools of water. Sixteen-year-old Deluca Taylor said in the past few weeks he had seen 30 catfish in the channels around Irymple, some alive and others dead. He keeps an eye out for catfish with nowhere to go. To help, concerned residents have been entering the irrigation channels to rescue the remaining catfish, taking them to other nearby waterways like Kings Billabong. But Deluca has discovered it is against the law. ""They're an endangered species and they should be in the rivers where they belong. They shouldn't be in water this shallow,"" Deluca said. ""Raise the waters again instead of having them shallow, and release them back to the wild where they came from."" Lower Murray Water discourages people from entering the channels. ""The channel banks can be slippery and awfully dangerous,"" said managing director Anthony Couroupis. ""They're made of hard surfaces so if you slip over and hit your head it could end poorly."" Instead, people who spot native fish in irrigation channels should contact Lower Murray Water or one of the agencies involved in fish rescues. OzFish Unlimited, the Victorian Fisheries Authority, Goulburn Broken Catchment Management Authority, North Central Catchment Management Authority, and the Arthur Rylah Institute rescued many native fish from the channels in May. ""We'll do as much as we can to try and protect those populations and work with those community groups and see what we can do,"" Mr Couroupis said. The fish now have new homes hundreds of kilometres from Mildura. ""One is a breeding facility at Snobs Creek, operated by the Victorian Fisheries Authority, where the fish will spawn the next generation of catfish and help save the species from extinction,""  Mr Couroupis said. ""The other location is Broken Creek, which is an important creek for the Yorta Yorta Indigenous community who are looking to bring catfish back to this stream.""

8,Kangaroo Island's dunnarts got hit hard by bushfires. Then the cats came,environment," Science Kangaroo Island's dunnarts were hit hard by bushfires. Now feral cats threaten them with extinction Kangaroo Island's endangered dunnarts took a huge hit after the Black Summer bushfires tore through 98 per cent of their habitat. Now researchers are fighting to stop feral cats from driving the final nail in the coffin for the survival of the species. A study of the stomach contents of cats trapped on the island in the months following the fires found the remains of eight dunnarts from the 86 cats sampled, according to a study published in Scientific Reports today. While eight may not sound like a huge number, a cat's digestion time is in the range of about 24 to 36 hours, according to study co-author Louis Lignereux from the University of Adelaide. ""We have to see that as a screenshot basically, because from the mouth of the cat to the other end takes about 24 hours,"" Dr Lignereux said. ""So eight dunnarts in seven cats doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a massive pressure."" Before the fires, the population of dunnart on the island was estimated to be around 500. However, because of their small size and shy nature, the animals are notoriously difficult to find, according to study lead author Pat Hodgens, a fauna ecologist with Terrain Ecology. ""They're a very cryptic species that are very difficult to study,"" Mr Hodgens said. ""Before the fires … not a lot was known about them."" A total of 263 different prey items were found in the cats' stomachs altogether, including an endangered southern brown bandicoot. While it was suspected, it had not been previously confirmed that cats were preying on the dunnarts, Mr Hodgens said. ""We know enough about feral cats and native mammals across Australia that any interaction they have is probably not going to be a positive one."" Based on that suspicion, Mr Hodgens moved in soon after the bushfires to try to capture and remove as many feral cats as possible from the only known dunnart habitats at the western end of the island. He said cats were also closing in on the area, in a situation he described as ""like a battleground"". ""Threatened species were trying to survive and also the feral cats were trying to survive because they couldn't get enough food [after the fires]. ""So we started trying to remove the feral cats [and] with the first analysis we did we were shocked. ""Not only were we finding [a lot of cats], but a very large proportion of the stomach contents had dunnarts in them."" The findings show how the devastating, cumulative impacts of extreme bushfires go on long after the blazes are put out, Dr Lignereux said. ""The cats that are already there, they're just killing the last remaining dunnart in the refuge areas after the fire."" Previous estimates of how many cats are on the island have ranged from about 1,000 up to about 5,000, but cat numbers are also difficult to assess. Based on what he found during his capturing efforts, Mr Hodgens thinks previous estimates were low. ""There was an estimate of between 1,000 and 2,000 cats, but we know that was an underestimate. On the western end they took out several hundred alone."" ""The number of cats we've been trapping has been staggering and they're in really good health as well."" As well as removing cats, Mr Hodgens worked with local private landholders, the Australian Wildlife Conservancy, and the Kangaroo Island Land for Wildlife to build a cat-exclusion enclosure over some of the remaining dunnart habitat after the fires. He thinks that has gone a long way to helping endangered species in the aftermath. The enclosure, known as the Western River Refuge, is a 369-hectare ""predator-free refuge"". Meanwhile, cat eradication programs have been operating on the island for years, and right now there are four projects happening in different areas. In 2016, the federal government introduced a plan to eradicate all feral cats from the island within 15 years. While that won't happen, James Smith, who is the project leader for feral cat eradication with the Kangaroo Island Landscape Board, says he thinks it's a long-term possibility. Mr Smith's operation had already removed cats from about 65 per cent of the Dudley Peninsula in the island's east, and he said they're on track to clear the entire 384 square-kilometre peninsula by 2025. Given the success of their operation, and with the fire having knocked out a large number of cats, he said it made sense to push for total eradication. ""So much work has been done, so much [of the cat population] has been knocked down by the fire, there's been so much work on the east and the west, so why don't we just keep going across the whole island?"" Mr Smith said. If they were to succeed, it would be the largest island in the world to have ever been cleared of cats. People on Lord Howe Island are trying to save their slice of paradise from a rat infestation, but a controversial eradication program has divided families and friends on the tiny outpost 600km off the NSW coast. But advances in cat monitoring and trapping technology means cat eradication is getting a lot less labour intensive. Rather than checking cage traps every day, alerts can be sent to a phone or computer once an animal becomes trapped. And motion-detection cameras can send an image straight to a mobile device as soon as a cat walks in front of the sensor. ""[Wiping out cats is] much more feasible than it was three years ago because of those advances,"" he said. ""You have to have a whole lot of weapons in your arsenal to make sure you get each one. ""The caveat is, it is [only] possible if people are going to throw money at it."" The biggest obstacle to getting a project like that running is having the public onside. When an ambitious rat eradication program was slated for Lord Howe Island off the coast of New South Wales, locals were fiercely divided. Many feared that poisons used to kill the rats would also kill the island's wildlife. But that's not an issue for Kangaroo Island, where Mr Smith estimates public support to be up around 99 per cent in favour of getting rid of feral cats.

""They spread two diseases, which really hamper primary industry,"" Mr Smith said. Mr Hodgens was also in support of trying to eradicate cats and hoped to see a continued multi-pronged approach to conservation on the island, as some bushfire-relief funding was starting to dry up. ""It's great to have that goal. It would be amazing, it would be incredible, I think it's definitely worth a shot,"" he said. ""But in the meantime, it's still really important to continue that cat control in the threatened species habitat, and to not put all your eggs in the one eradication basket.""

11,Rising petrol prices fuel EV market growth in Tasmania,environment,"  Rising petrol prices fuel electric vehicle market growth in Tasmania Penny Cocker splashed the cash and bought her first electric vehicle just over a year ago, and she hasn't looked back. ""It took me a while to spend the money,"" she said. ""My joke is I bought the cheapest one, the more honest statement is I bought the least expensive."" The chair of the Tasmanian branch of the Electric Vehicle Association is among a growing number of Tasmanians buying electric vehicles. ""I absolutely love driving electric vehicles, you never want to drive a petrol car again once you drive an electric vehicle, they are so nice to drive,"" she said. ""And of course, the cost, I'm not shelling out for petrol every day. Irrespective of the price, petrol is still an expensive component of owning a car. ""[EVs are] much cheaper to run, and they're just beautiful to drive."" Skyrocketing petrol prices have urged many Tasmanians to turn to electric vehicles and their popularity is booming. There are currently 1,025 registered electric vehicles in Tasmania. The figure includes 637 cars, 267 station wagons and 111 motorcycles. Between 2011 and 2016, there were just 56 EV purchases in Tasmania. But when compared to Tasmania's 687,000 registered vehicles, the electric vehicle uptake is small. The demand might be rising in Tasmania, but the cost of a new EV is prohibitive for many. One company is trying to change that. Hunter Murray drove 8,000km in the first week of owning an electric vehicle to prove it could work even for people in remote Australia The Good Car Company imports cheaper second-hand vehicles which come from Japan or the United Kingdom. Co-founder of The Good Car Company, Anthony Broese van Groenou, said demand for their used vehicles was high. ""We've got a massive rise in fuel price that's driven a lot of people to be searching for a cheaper option for being able to drive around and these are people [who] wouldn't normally be looking at electric cars or maybe weren't considering them for another few years at least."" Once you have committed to buying an electric car, sellers claim you will save on the on-road costs. ""If you're plugging into a normal power point at home and using your regular energy tariff, then it's about $3 for 100 kilometres,"" Mr Broese van Groenou said. ""If you've got solar on your roof, it's about $1.50 for 100 kilometres, which is pretty amazing."" Electric vehicles are coming, and they don't need liquid fuel. That spells trouble for service stations. Ms Cocker paid about $45,000 for her electric car last year and said the second-hand EV market was making it more affordable for many. ""A lot of people are quite prepared to spend $20,000 and $30,000 on a car, whereas paying $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 is quite a different story."" It will cost about $150 to have the battery annually serviced. Buyers are waiting about four months for a second-hand vehicle and up to a year for a new one. Advocacy officer from the RACT, Garry Bailey, said the price of owning a new electric vehicle has been an impediment to ownership. ""They're significantly more expensive,"" he said. ""You'll see perhaps the same model, one runs on fuel, one runs on electricity and you might see a $15,000 to $20,000 difference in the price."" He says many people are making the switch for a number of reasons. ""You might pay more for an EV but the running costs are about half of petrol-driven or diesel-driven vehicles,"" Mr Bailey said. ""Also greater environmental awareness, people are aware you have a lower impact on the environment; there are no vehicle emissions."" More than 80 per cent of the global car market now follows 'Euro 6' emissions standards — but Australia's resistance to signing on is leaving the country with less efficient, less safe and higher polluting cars, experts warn. Some who can afford an electric vehicle are still reluctant. ""There's also range anxiety, how far you think you can go before you have to recharge but that's certainly improving as well,"" Mr Bailey said. ""The great thing about Tasmania is we do have an extensive charging network."" There are now dozens of charging stations throughout the island state. The Tasmanian government is also on board and is transitioning its fleet to electric vehicles. They also have a stamp duty waiver in place for the purchase of new and second-hand electric vehicles which runs until next year.

12,Tuvalu is sinking. An entrepreneur has a bold proposal for the Pacific nation to continue to exist in another form,environment,"  Tuvalu could be underwater within 100 years. How could virtual reality help? It's a question that's both tragic and hopeful: if a country stops existing physically, can it continue to exist digitally? Thanks to climate change, this curious question is becoming an essential one – and some countries have already started trying to answer it. Tuvalu, the tiny Pacific nation of 12,000 people that's halfway between Australia and Hawaii, is one of them. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has described the nation as being ""on the extreme frontlines of the global climate emergency"". And in 100 years, it's likely that Tuvalu will be underwater, according to Karlos Lee Moresi, Tuvalu's former Secretary of Finance. So, as well as trying to address the impacts of climate change, Tuvalu is exploring an innovative way to maintain its sovereignty, culture and economy in the face of physical destruction. Virtual words, blockchain technology and some serious forward thinking all play a part in the plan. Sunday Extra presents a lively mix of national and international affairs, analysis and investigation. Two years ago, entrepreneur expert George Siosi Samuels, an Australian citizen who is the son of a Tuvaluan-Samoan mother and Fijian-Indian father, came up with an idea to address Tuvalu's existential threat. ""I had heard that places like Dubai were literally just building islands out of nothing, because they had the money, and … I was like, well, I'm not a Saudi prince, so let me just have a look at what I could do in case anything dire did actually happen,"" he tells ABC RN's Sunday Extra. ""Tuvaluans, South Pacific Islanders, Polynesians – we're very culturally oriented. Stories matter a lot. So I thought, why not just start preserving a lot of these stories."" Mr Samuels' idea grew to a five-point plan to future-proof Tuvalu, and to use technology to help preserve its economy and its cultural heritage. In the plan, he suggested improving Tuvalu's internet infrastructure, making the nation cashless and upgrading the population's digital skills. And almost all of the plan comes back to blockchain. You're not alone if you're not sure what blockchains are. Essentially, they're ""quite a boring thing that can be used as databases,"" explains Kelsie Nabben, a researcher at RMIT University's Blockchain Innovation Hub. But the technology's potential is more interesting. Blockchain databases are formed between peer-to-peer networks, which means that no one person or company controls them – rather, a public network does. Data can't be changed or removed, so it forms a ""timestamp or an immutable, unchangeable record of history"", Ms Nabben says. Even if one computer is blocked, or goes offline, everyone else still has a copy of the data. And everyone shares it. Mr Samuels says blockchains could allow Tuvalu to ""actually be ahead when it comes to the digitisation of services"" and preserving data, as well as assisting ""in the cultural preservation of the entire nation"". Foreign start-ups are coming to the Pacific to pilot a number of world-first blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. But there are fears companies could be using the region to test the technologies. He says going cashless would enable the nation to profit from the bitcoin economy, the basis of which is blockchain technology. Additionally, cultural data stored in blockchain would be protected online, collected by and open to the public. The Tuvaluan government saw merit in the plan. It has taken up some of Mr Samuels' ideas and included him on its information and communications technology task force. ""One thing I really appreciate about the Tuvalu Government is that they're not just trying to bring on a new technology because it's cool or sexy,"" Mr Samuels says. ""It's actually about using the technology in a way that benefits the government [and] its people long-term."" Another of Mr Samuels recommendations for Tuvalu is generating revenue by investing in property – but not in the way you might imagine. He suggests Tuvalu create a ""digital twin"" in the metaverse, the virtual world that's built on blockchain technology. It's been dubbed ""the successor to the internet"" — but what do you know about it? He says it could help Tuvalu maintain economic rights around its islands, even if they sink. South Korea's capital Seoul already has a digital twin in the metaverse, and is working towards making public services and cultural events available there. ""For Tuvalu, they actually have a more urgent need for something like this,"" Mr Samuels argues. ""If [Tuvalu] disappears, but they have a digital twin, could they use their digital property rights as a way of still maintaining sovereignty and legal ownership over the exclusive economic zone for Tuvalu, which is quite large, comparative to their land size? ""This is something I know that they are playing with the idea of … It would be a very interesting legal case."" Mr Samuels insists his ideas are ""not too far-fetched"". Indeed, Ms Nabben says using blockchain technology to help preserve culture is an idea that is rapidly taking hold. That includes in Australia, where a team including artists, researchers and lawyers are working towards First Nations cultural preservation in the metaverse. ""Virtual worlds will increasingly become a part of the 'land on which we meet' [and] First Nations Peoples need a seat at the metaverse table,"" the paper states. There have been widespread criticisms about the environmental impact of blockchain technologies such as bitcoin. That's because the way the technology has worked historically is by using ""a lot of electricity to run computers 24-7"", Ms Nabben explains. It started as something individuals could do from home and today there are data warehouses running the technology at commercial scale. In 2021, the University of Cambridge's Centre for Alternative Finance estimated the annual consumption of electricity by the bitcoin network as being more than countries such as Sweden, Pakistan and Malaysia, and about 61 per cent of Australia's total energy consumption. Elon Musk says Bitcoin is bad for the environment, and some very big numbers are behind it. But Ms Nabben argues that blockchain is not the source of the environmental problem. ""Really, people should be talking about these broader trends of digitisation,"" she says. ""Massive amounts of computing energy, which means electricity, are used for many digital processes. This includes AI, machine-learning algorithms, and all these kind of directions that we're going around technology and society. ""Blockchain is just one sliver of that."" In fact, Ms Nabben believes the technology can be used to address environmental issues. ""One interesting thing about blockchain is that it's a coordination technology. So it helps people to do things in this peer-to-peer way,"" she says. ""So I wonder if, in such a well-resourced area, where people are being extremely innovative and self-organising, that might actually lead to people wanting to address climate concerns – and doing that through this technology."" Mr Samuels concedes that much of what he proposes for the future of Tuvalu is ""worst-case scenario planning"". He also acknowledges that there are other pressing issues that need addressing – a point Ms Nabben echoes. She says ""technology doesn't solve social problems"", such as the repatriation of people displaced by climate change, meeting basic needs and helping people ""learn languages for wherever they end up"". But Mr Samuels says that in planning for the role of digitisation in an ""in-case of"" scenario, he hopes momentum and support can be generated to have changes ""take place sooner rather than later"". After all, he says, climate change has taught us ""what happens when we leave things too late"". Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.

13,Mothers at the searing edge of climate change in this hottest city on Earth,environment,"  Mothers at the searing edge of climate change in hottest city on Earth, Jacobabad Heavily pregnant Sonari toils under the burning sun in fields dotted with bright yellow melons in Jacobabad, which last month became the hottest city on Earth. Her 17-year-old neighbour, Waderi, who gave birth a few weeks ago, is back working in temperatures that can exceed 50 degrees Celsius, with her newborn lying on a blanket in the shade nearby so she can feed him when he cries. ""When the heat is coming and we're pregnant, we feel stressed,"" said Sonari, who is in her mid-20s. These women in southern Pakistan and millions like them around the world are at the searing edge of climate change. Pregnant women exposed to heat for prolonged periods of time have a higher risk of suffering complications, an analysis of 70 studies conducted since the mid-1990s found. For every 1C in temperature rise, the number of stillbirths and premature deliveries increases by about 5 per cent, according to the meta-analysis Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education at Columbia University, which was carried out by several research institutions globally and published in the British Medical Journal in September 2020. Cecilia Sorensen, director of the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education at Columbia University, said the unfolding impact of global warming on the health of women was ""highly underdocumented"", partly because extreme heat tended to exacerbate other conditions. ""We're not associating health impacts on women and oftentimes it's because we're not collecting data on it,"" she said. ""And often women in poverty are not seeking medical care."" ""Heat is a super big deal for pregnant women."" Women are especially vulnerable to rising temperatures in poor countries on the frontline of climate change because many have little choice but to work through their pregnancies and soon after giving birth, according to interviews with more than a dozen female residents in the Jacobabad area as well as half a dozen development and human rights experts. Further adding to the risks, women in socially conservative Pakistan — and many other places — typically cook the family meals over hot stoves or open fires, often in cramped rooms with no ventilation or cooling. ""If you're inside cooking next to a hot open fire you have that burden of that heat in addition to the ambient heat, which makes things that much more dangerous,"" Sorensen added. South Asia has suffered unseasonably hot temperatures in recent months. An extreme heatwave that scorched Pakistan and India in April was 30 times more likely to happen due to climate change, according to scientists at World Weather Attribution, an international research collaboration. Global temperatures have risen by about 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. As temperatures continue rising, extreme heatwaves are only expected to increase. Jacobabad's roughly 200,000 residents are well aware of their city's reputation as one of the world's hottest. ""If we go to hell, we'll take a blanket,"" is a common joke told in the area. Few places are more punishing. Temperatures hit 51C on May 14, which local meteorological officials said was highly unusual for that time of year. Tropical rains can combine with warm winds from the Arabian Sea to drive up humidity later in the year. The more humid it is, the harder it is for people to cool down via sweating. Such conditions are measured by ""wet bulb temperatures,"" taken by a thermometer wrapped in a wet cloth. Wet bulb temperatures of 35C or higher are considered the limit of human survival. Jacobabad has crossed that threshold at least twice since 2010, according to regional weather data. And, globally, such ""extreme humid heat events"" have more than doubled in frequency in the last four decades, according to a May 2020 study in the journal Science. Sonari, who is in her 20s, and Waderi work alongside about a dozen other women, several of them pregnant, in the melon fields about 10 kilometres from Jacobabad's centre. They begin work each day at 6am with a short afternoon break for housework and cooking before returning to the field to work until sundown. They describe leg pains, fainting episodes and discomfort while breastfeeding. ""It feels like no-one sees them, no-one cares about them,"" aid worker Liza Khan said more broadly about the plight facing many women in Jacobabad and the wider Sindh region, which straddles the border of Pakistan and India. Ms Khan's phone rings constantly as she drives to one of three heat stroke response centres she has helped set up in recent weeks as part of her work with non-profit group the Community Development Foundation. With a finance degree, Ms Khan has lived in cooler cities across Pakistan but returned to her hometown because she wanted to be a voice for women in the conservative area. ""Nowadays I'm working 24/7,"" said the 22-year-old, adding that her organisation was finding the impact of extreme heat increasingly intertwining with other social and health issues affecting women. The harsh conditions facing many women were brought into tragic focus on May 14, the day temperatures in Jacobabad hit 51C, making it the world's hottest city at that time. Nazia, a young mother of five, was preparing lunch for her visiting cousins. But with no air-conditioning or fan in her kitchen, she collapsed and was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead from a suspected heat stroke. District health officials did not answer requests for comment about Jacobabad's record of heat-related deaths in recent years, or more specifically about Nazia's case. Her body was taken the following day to her ancestral village to be buried and her children, the youngest a one-year-old who was still breastfeeding, regularly cry for their mother, a relative said. Widespread poverty and frequent power cuts mean many people can't afford or use air-conditioning or at times even a fan to cool down. Potential strategies recommended by experts include providing clean-energy stoves to replace open-fire cooking, offering women's medical and social services during early morning or evening hours when it is cooler and replacing tin roofs with cooler material in white to reflect solar radiation away from the home. Climate Change Minister Sherry Rehman told Reuters that women were likely to bear the brunt of rising temperatures as they continued to scorch the country, adding that climate change policies in the future needed to address the specific needs of women. ""A mega trend like climate change ... poses a significant threat to the well-being of unempowered women in rural areas and urban slums,"" she added. ""Pakistani women, especially on the margins, will be impacted the most."" Some in Jacobabad find it galling that Pakistan is responsible for just a fraction of the greenhouse gases released in the industrial era and now warming the atmosphere. ""We are not contributing to the worsening, but we are on the frontline as far as suffering is concerned,"" said Hafeez Siyal, the city's deputy commissioner. In a residential neighbourhood of the city, a donkey-drawn cart stacked with blue plastic jerry cans stops near the entrance to warren-like lanes leading to a cluster of homes. The cart's driver runs back and forth delivering 20-litre containers of water from one of a few dozen private pumps around the city. Most residents of Jacobabad rely on such water deliveries, which can cost between a fifth and an eighth of a household's meagre income. Still, it's often not enough, and some families are forced to ration. For young mother Razia, the sound of her six-month-old Tamanna crying in the afternoon heat was enough to persuade her to pour some of her precious water over the baby. She then sat Tamanna in front of a fan, and the child was visibly calmer, playing with her mother's scarf. Local officials said water shortages were partly due to electricity cuts, which meant water could not be filtered and sent via pipes throughout the city. There are also severe water shortages across Sindh, with the Climate Change Minister, Ms Rehman, flagging shortfalls of up to 60 per cent of what is needed in the province's key dams and canals. Rubina, Razia's neighbour, fried onions and okra over an open fire, explaining she usually felt dizzy in the heat and tried to soak herself in water each time she cooked to prevent herself from fainting. There was not always enough water to do so, though. ""Most of the time, it ends before it's time to buy more and we must wait,"" Rubina said as she closely supervised her children and grandchildren sharing a cup of water. ""On the hot days with no water, no electricity we wake up and the only thing we do is pray to God.""

14,"Tasmania's cold climate, renewable energy has bitcoin miners scrambling",environment,"  Bitcoin company TDI eyeing off old lead and zinc Que River mine on Tasmania's west coast An old lead and zinc mine on the west coast of Tasmania could become home to what an Australian bitcoin miner is describing as ""Australia's largest emerging, 100 per cent renewable energy bitcoin mine"". The Que River mine, 20 kilometres south of Waratah, has not operated for years, but the purchase by newly formed company Tasmanian Data Infrastructure (TDI) could see a very different type of mining operation on the site. Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency, and while it is completely digital, it still needs to be mined. ""Mining"" in this case operates differently from regular mining, with high-tech computers required to run complex algorithms to produce bitcoins. Each bitcoin mining computer around the world races to be the first to complete a 64-digit hexadecimal number, or hash, for a new bitcoin. Only one computer achieves the hash and is rewarded 6.25 bitcoins, currently valued at $207,330. Then, the process repeats itself around every 10 minutes. There are currently an estimated 1 million bitcoin mining computers around the world. Each mining hub needs a lot of computers to generate bitcoin, which takes up a lot of space. A location like an abandoned mine provides enough space for the construction of a bitcoin facility, with some of the necessary infrastructure already in place. Additionally, the Que River mine sits at an altitude of 700 metres, which provides an ideal climate for the machines. Tasmania's popularity for new bitcoin ventures is due to several reasons, but the predominant one is renewable energy. Bitcoin mining uses an immense amount of energy. If bitcoin mining were a country, it would be the 23rd highest consumer of energy annually, not far behind Australia's usage. Bitcoin has come under fire from environmentalists who say it relies too heavily on power from fossil fuels, a claim denied by industry proponents. On top of that, it is expensive to run bitcoin mines because of the rising cost of electricity. With 100 per cent renewable energy, as well as cheaper power, Tasmania solves a lot of problems. Tasmania is also the coldest state in Australia. This is important as bitcoin mining computers generate a large amount of heat and need to be cooled down. With a naturally cooler climate, bitcoin miners would save money by using less power. It has put Tasmania on the top of Australian miners' lists. Newly formed company TDI has purchased the mine, subject to government approvals. Michael Addison is the executive director of TDI and founder of GENEX Renewable Energy. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices have surged to dizzying heights since their creation amid the global financial crisis. He said he expected the project to gain approval by the end of July. Australian bitcoin miner Mawson Infrastructure Group has taken a 33 per cent stake in the company, in exchange for around 2,000 mining computers for its own use. In a statement, Mawson chief and founder James Manning said it was a mutually beneficial partnership. ""By exchanging a portion of our ASIC bitcoin mining fleet for an equity position in TDI, we have continued to demonstrate our capital discipline whilst obtaining a meaningful equity position in one of Australia's largest emerging, 100 per cent renewable energy bitcoin miners,"" he said. In the first stage of the project, TDI plans to install three container-sized mining installations, each holding around 650 bitcoin mining machines. Eventually, the site is anticipated to hold 10,000 computers, including the 2,000 from Mawson Infrastructure. I tipped in $100, hoping that having some skin in the game would help me better understand this brave new financial world. Construction and machinery costs for the first two stages of the project are expected to reach $100 million. While bitcoin mining uses a significant amount of power, Mr Addison said Tasmania had an ample supply and the government would not be subsidising power costs. ""We will be buying energy at the wholesale price, so we're not seeking any subsidies from any governments at all,"" he said. The site is estimated to spend $130,000 on power each month when it is up and running, and $1.56 million annually. It means the network charge will be paid to TasNetworks, theoretically lowering the costs for other customers.

16,From body hair to boats: How one material 'shaped the whole of human history',environment,"  Wood 'shaped the whole of human history', says this expert, which is why we must protect trees To say Roland Ennos loves trees is a very big understatement. Like many people, this professor of biological sciences from the University of Hull appreciates trees for their aesthetic, ecological and material value. But for Professor Ennos, it's much more than that. He believes trees made us. He says we have trees — specifically wood — to thank for much of human progress to this point. In his latest book, The Wood Age: How One Material Shaped the Whole of Human History, Professor Ennos argues that wood is closely intertwined with our evolution and has helped to define who we are today. And as the world experiences rampant deforestation and the effects of climate change, he says it's a crucial time to understand just how important trees are to humans. Our connection with trees stretches back millions of years to early human ancestors and, according to Professor Ennos, is still imprinted on our DNA. ""We think we're different from the rest of the primates, but most of our body is actually designed to allow us to live in trees, which we used to do. For example, we have grasping hands, arms that help us pull up and climb trees,"" he tells ABC RN's Late Night Live. From razor-sharp analysis of current events to the hottest debates in politics, science and culture, Late Night Live puts you in the big picture. When our early ancestors decided to relocate from the branches to the ground, trees provided one of the most important tools for human development: flammable wood which could be used to create fire. Fire offered not only protection from predators and the ability to cook, but Professor Ennos says it also played a role in the evolution of our complexion. As our ancestors started communal living and sleeping around campfires, rather than being alone in the treetops, they were much more likely to share tiny organisms that lived on their scruffy, hairy bodies. ""I believe we lost our hair to stop ourselves from having so many ectoparasites — ticks, fleas and the like,"" Professor Ennos says. And the use of basic wooden structures for shelter and extra warmth meant we didn't miss that excess hair. Professor Ennos says that throughout history, there has been too much attention paid to stone, bronze and iron tools, with wood trumping all of these in importance. Our very first tools were made from wood and the earliest recorded wooden tool is the Clacton spear, which is estimated to be around 450,000 years old. ""It's only much later that humans started to add stone tips [to spears] … all the spears that we used up to about 150,000 years ago were just made of wood,"" he says. The rise of wooden spears brought new types of food (like mammoths) but also new types of conflict. ""It's one of those sad facts that once you have a useful tool … then what do humans usually tend to do? Well, they think 'let's kill other humans.' So spears became a tool for, not only hunting, but for killing other humans for hundreds of thousands of years,"" Professor Ennos says. A myriad of wooden tools and inventions followed: from the wheel to windmills to paper (and toilet paper) to entire townships made largely from wood. Professor Ennos points out that wood gave many societies music, as the material is ""light and stiff enough to conduct sound at high speeds and so resonate at high frequencies."" And he gives a shout-out to wooden barrels (which were probably invented by the Celts around 350 BCE) as they were ""the lifeblood of commerce in pre-industrial times, the equivalent of the tin cans, plastic bottles, and shipping containers of today combined."" One of wood's most consequential impacts has been giving humans the ability to traverse rivers, seas and oceans. The invention of wooden ships and consequently, the movement of people, trade and conflict has had an immeasurable effect on our history. The oldest intact boat ever found is the Khufu ship in Egypt, a 40-metre long wooden boat that was sealed into a pit at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Pharaoh Khufu. Despite being around 4,500 years old, the craftsmanship was so good that experts claim the ship would still sail today if it was put into the Nile or to sea. Powerful countries used wooden ships to explore and plunder other nations, reaching a peak when Europeans criss-crossed the world from the 15th century onwards. Access to wood also determined access to power, with Professor Ennos highlighting the ""mast wars"" of the 18th century. ""The great workhorse of international power was the galleon, these great ships which fought each other with cannons,"" he says. ""There were two nations which were vying for power — there was Britain and there was France … [And for the ship masts] each had to find huge pieces of wood, sometimes over 100-foot [or 30-metres] tall."" France sourced masts from local forests in the Pyrenees, while Britain sourced theirs from its many colonies. The more masts, the more power the country would have at that point. In recent centuries, deforestation has ramped up dramatically across every continent that has forests. According to the latest UN Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) State of the World's Forests Report, 420 million hectares of forest were lost through deforestation between 1990 and 2020. The report found the rate of deforestation is declining but was still 10 million hectares per year in 2015–2020. It said that halting deforestation ""is potentially one of the most cost-effective actions for mitigating climate change if efforts ramp up."" Professor Ennos says wood could take on even greater importance as a resource in the future and, in doing so, may once again push human progress ahead.

17,Archbishop accused of promoting climate change denier's views on anniversary of Pope's letter,environment,"  Archbishop accused of promoting climate change denier's views on anniversary of Pope's landmark letter Tasmania's Archbishop has been accused of promoting the views of a climate change denier at the same time the global church is marking the seventh anniversary of Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato Si: On care for our common home. The May edition of the Catholic Standard included an article titled Exposing the 'modern green religion', a report of a speech given by geologist Professor Ian Plimer in Hobart at the invitation of the Christopher Dawson Centre, a think tank established by Archbishop Julian Porteous. In the article, Catherine Sheehan, the Archdiocese of Hobart's communications coordinator, wrote: ""Professor Ian Plimer has written his most recent book on what he believes is a worrying trend in the debate of the science of climate change. ""He argues that the movement claiming human activity is responsible for global warming has been transformed into a 'modern green religion' filling the void left by the decline of traditional Christianity in first-world Western countries. ""For 25 years Professor Plimer has been asking fellow scientists to provide even one study that clearly shows human emissions of carbon dioxide are causing global warming. To date, he maintains no such proof has been offered."" The article lays out concerns Dr Plimer, a former director of mining companies, has about climate science, his criticisms of renewable energy, and concerns about the approach taken in Pope Francis' Laudato Si. Dr Plimer is quoted as saying: ""These people [advising the Holy Father] are well known in the climate industry as being socialists who are pushing a certain agenda … these green activists have got into his ear rather than the pope getting a balanced view on it."" The Catholic Standard is the official publication of the Catholic Church in Tasmania and is produced under the authority of Archbishop Porteous. Concerned Catholics Tasmania, a group advocating for renewal and reform in the church, said ""the article, the event it reported, and the fact that it was given such prominence in the official publication of our Archdiocese have caused widespread concern for Tasmanian Catholics"". The group has written to the Standard's editors asking that a letter of objection be published in the June edition of the Standard. ""While he is entitled to his opinion, I do not see why what he says and writes should be given free rein in a Catholic Church publication, especially without qualification,"" chairman Kim Chen wrote. ""At the very least, there should be a statement apologising for any offence caused by this article and stating clearly that the views expressed are not those of the Archdiocese of Hobart."" Concerned Catholics has not yet received a response. No mention of the article has been made in the June edition of the Standard, which has just been published. In a response to the ABC, a spokesman said: ""The Archdiocese of Hobart politely declines the opportunity to participate in your story."" Concerned Catholics wrote to the Archdiocese in March expressing concern about material ""not deemed suitable for publication through the Standard simply because they were organised by Concerned Catholics"". In response, the Archdiocese's chancery services director Michael McKenna wrote: ""The Standard has long been the principal (sic) historical Catholic record and source of information regarding official church teaching."" Mr Chen said the publication of the article featuring Dr Plimer showed hypocrisy. ""The official position the Pope's put out is Laudato Si and they're (the Standard) giving air to people who are putting a contrary view,"" he said. ""It seems to be skewed and the articles in it seem to be skewed towards what I call a more right-wing position. ""I'm aware of people who want to contest what's been written, people who are good practising Catholics, but their voice doesn't get heard."" Laudato Si was published in May 2015. In it, Pope Francis said the climate is ""a common good, belonging to all and meant for all"". ""A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system,"" he wrote. ""Humanity is called to recognise the need for changes in lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it. ""It is true that there are other factors (such as volcanic activity, variations in the earth's orbit and axis, the solar cycle), yet a number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity."" An opinion piece written by Dr Plimer and published in The Australian in 2019, titled Let's not pollute minds with carbon fears, was criticised by climate scientists for being false. Ten climate scientists reviewed the article for Climate Feedback, a global network of scientists who fact-check and analyse claims made in the media and said: ""As was the case with three other op-eds written by Plimer that we evaluated previously, reviewers unanimously rated the scientific credibility of this article 'very low' ... the scientists identify a large number of inaccurate or incorrect statements about the way Earth's climate system works, how climate has changed during Earth's history, and what we know about the impacts of continued climate change.""

18,'Like a horror film': Marion’s walls are covered in oil after Lismore floods ruptured disused Boral tanks,environment,"  Lismore residents whose homes were covered in oil from Boral asphalt depot after floods left with daunting clean up Having owned a home for 33 years in one of Lismore's lowest-lying areas, Marion Conrow is no stranger to floods. But on February 28, 2022, when more than 14 metres of water inundated the Northern Rivers town, she was blindsided by the dark sticky oil that came with it. Every surface and wall inside her raised hardwood home was marbled with a bitumen product. ""It's like a horror film,"" she said. ""Your eyes are watering [from] the fumes, from the bitumen, the kerosene and God knows what else from the bitumen spill."" Ms Conrow lives two doors down from an industrial depot owned by construction giant Boral. The South Lismore site supplied bitumen and asphalt but was largely unused for the past two years. Despite being in one of the city's flood-prone areas, several tanks remained on site. As floodwater rushed in, the tanks were knocked over, spilling substances across neighbouring homes. In the immediate aftermath, samples were taken from Ms Conrow's home to find out exactly what the substance was. Preliminary results emailed to her on March 18 stated the ""dominant compounds"" were ""kerosene, diesel and oil"" and she should ""avoid continuing to live at the premises"". She says Boral compensated her with a payment of $3,000, and then $350 a week for three months to cover rent. Marion moved to a friend's property where she says she has to walk 60 metres to get to amenities. Boral's stakeholder manager Kate Woodbridge has apologised for the spill, and says the company is ""committed to remediating any persons or businesses that have been impacted by residue from Boral during the flood event."" Ms Woodbridge says Boral has worked ""every day since the event"" to finalise ""cleaning methodology"" plans for affected properties, but weather and a shortage of tradespeople have contributed to delays. While remediation has begun at some properties, Ms Conrow says she's still waiting for news on when her home will be cleaned — and whether the hydrocarbons on her walls pose a risk to her health. ""I don't really want much, I just want my life, I want my home, and I really need to come home and get my life back on track,"" she said. Just one block away from Ms Conrow, Jack Bobbin's house and shed is marked with the same sticky residue. The 82-year-old says he hasn't had any contact from Boral and has already started on the clean-up job. Mr Bobbin believes that when the company stopped operations at their South Lismore depot, they should have removed the tanks containing product used to make roads. ""They didn't clean the site up. They should've checked it out before they left. It's obvious they didn't,"" he said. Neighbour Geoff Davis, whose elderly mother's windows remain smeared with oil, feels the same. ""Take your stuff with you when you leave. Just don't leave it. Just don't leave it there and no one would have this problem,"" Mr Davis said. Both Boral and Lismore City Council, as the regulatory authority, say the company followed all relevant regulations. ""We are able to store material at the site as part of our consent through council and as part of our development application, so any materials have been stored in an appropriate tank,"" Ms Woodbridge said. Council chief executive officer John Walker could not clarify how regularly the site was inspected. ""Things will always go unnoticed,"" Mr Walker said. ""Whether they should or shouldn't, I guess what we found out in the fullness of time, but it's not our role to be policing people checking out every industrial property in the local government area to make sure everything is compliant."" Mr Walker says an investigation is underway and the council has received two letters from legal firms asking questions about the involvement of the various parties. Boral has also confirmed they have recently made submissions to the council to remove the structures and equipment from the site. NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet says reports of the oil spill are ""devastating"" and that towns in the Northern Rivers need to be rebuilt in a ""better way."" Mr Perrottet said he's ""happy to look into"" whether regulations around the location of construction sites in flood zones need to be changed. ""We want this to be a great town now, and into the future, and the best way of doing that [is] having the right regulation in place,"" he said. While Ms Conrow waits for the ongoing investigation, she says she has no choice but to return to the site and live in a caravan. ""People have asked me, 'why are you going back there?' but where else am I going to go?,"" she said. ""There's absolutely nowhere around, I don't have enough money to pay rent anyway, and so a tiny caravan under the house is like my only option for now."" In a statement, the NSW Environment Protection Authority says they've assisted with the clean-up of three different spills of this nature resulting from recent floods.

19,It's a 'horrible plastic' — and these 'superworms' can grow from eating it,environment," Science 'Superworms' survive solely on polystyrene, as researchers look to create plastic recycling technology A polystyrene-munching beetle larvae called a ""superworm"", can gain weight on an exclusive diet of polystyrene, researchers have found. They hope their findings can pave the way for technology to degrade and recycle the plastic on a large scale, but others are sceptical of the approach. Fed only polystyrene (aka styrofoam) for three weeks, the superworms — larvae of the darkling beetle (Zophobas morio) — survived at comparable rates to larvae fed on a diet of bran, according to the study published today in Microbial Genomics. The fact that the superworms were able to gain a small amount of weight from eating polystyrene exclusively is an indication that they're able to convert the material into energy, according to study co-author Christian Rinke from the University of Queensland's School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences. ""They have to get the energy from somewhere,"" Dr Rinke said. Groups of superworms were fed either bran, polystyrene, or given no food for the three-week trial period. The bran-fed worms more than doubled their weight over the three-week period, the styrofoam-fed worms added a small amount of weight, whereas those on the starvation diet roughly maintained their starting weight. The worms fed bran or polystrene were also far more active compared to the starvation diet worms, according to Dr Rinke. ""In terms of activity, the worms that had the bran were super active, the polystyrene ones were a bit slower, and the ones that were starving were basically still all the time."" The rate of pupation after the three-week trial was also looked at. The ""worm"" or larval phase of the superworm, is followed by the development of pupae — where the animal cocoons itself and metamorphoses into a darkling beetle. As expected, the rate was highest in the bran-fed beetles with more than 90 per cent becoming pupae. But there was also a significantly higher pupation rate in the polystyrene-fed beetles compared to the starved beetles — more than 60 per cent compared to 10 per cent, again indicating that the polystyrene diet was at least superior to the starvation diet. For every larva that entered the pupa phase from each diet group, all successfully hatched as beetles. At the beginning and end of the study, a portion of the worms from each group were frozen and their gut contents and microbiome analysed. Bacteria in the microbiome produce enzymes that, among other functions, can aid in digestion. Though the plastic diet was found to have a negative impact overall on the worms' gut microbiome diversity and health, the researchers identified several enzymes in the superworm gut that they think can degrade the polystyrene. While it's been known for a while that some types of beetle larvae can consume polystyrene, this study takes it a step further, according to Colin Jackson from the ANU's Research School of Chemistry, who wasn't involved with this study. ""This study goes a long way towards understanding how the bacteria in [the worms'] gut do this at the molecular level,"" Professor Jackson said. ""[That's] important for translation and use of this type of approach in recycling."" To get that information, the researchers used genetic analysis, according to Dr Rinke. ""The novelty here is we've used a technique called metagenomics — that allows us to identify all the genes in the microbiome,"" he said. Although the researchers in this case inferred which enzymes were breaking down the polystyrene, no experiment to date has managed to isolate the critical enzymes and demonstrate the process in a test tube. What that means is, although the researchers think they know which enzymes are responsible for breaking down the plastic, there is still some room for doubt. Some researchers remain sceptical that the polystyrene is able to be biologically degraded. It's possible, some argue, that any weight gain associated with consumption of the product is more likely to be related to other chemical elements in the styrofoam, such as flame retardants or expanding agents. Polystyrene is primarily made from styrene, a hydrocarbon. Although it can be synthesised, styrene is also a naturally occurring, highly volatile chemical that is used to make plastics, rubber and foam. The idea, according to Dr Rinke, would be to degrade polystyrene to styrene, then use that to create new materials. ""It's still early days,"" he said. ""The next step would be to engineer [the enzymes], to increase that efficiency. ""In an ideal scenario … if it all works out you can add the enzymes or the microbes that degrade the polystyrene to a bunch of chemical compounds and then use those compounds to form other products like bioplastics."" While the findings are promising, it's not the first biological agent found to be able to consume plastics. Certain species of fungi, marine microbes and even bacteria found in cows' stomachs have previously been found to have some plastic-degrading potential. But if the worms are able to consume and degrade polystyrene, there are still many difficulties in developing a feasible recycling technology. The first is the capacity to scale this type of technology to where it may have some significant impact on plastic pollution, Professor Jackson said. ""The scale-up and translation of research like this is always a challenge, which is magnified in the area of plastics by the incredible scale of the problem and the economics in terms of how cheap new plastic is to produce,"" he said. Muxina Konarova from the University of Queensland's School of Chemical Engineering, who wasn't involved in this study, said even if the technology could be scaled up, you'd potentially be creating a raft of new environmental and health problems. ""There are carcinogenic co-products that could potentially come out of the styrofoam,"" Dr Konarova said. Benzene is one of the chemicals used to make styrofoam, and is listed as a carcinogen on Australia's National Pollutant Inventory. ""That's the main reason they don't recycle polystyrene, because you end up with these compounds that you don't want to touch,"" Dr Konarova said. There are also greenhouse gas emissions associated with the potential by-products of the process as well, she said. ""Even if we convert this to biodiesel, then we're going to burn the biodiesel, which is going to make CO2,"" Dr Konarova said. ""I don't want to give the impression that there's a solution [to styrofoam pollution] when there's not. ""Why not just ban this polystyrene? It's a horrible plastic."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. In Australia that may soon be happening, at least in part. In 2021, the federal government launched a plan to phase out certain uses of polystyrene in packaging and containers. By July this year, the aim was to end the use of loose-fill styrofoam packaging, and moulded consumer packaging — like the type that televisions, computers and homewares come encased in. By the end of this year, styrofoam food and drink containers are also supposed to be phased out. Although broadly supported at the time, the plan was also criticised for being voluntary and lacking legislated targets. The phase-out doesn't include polystyrene in building and construction, in ""business-to-business"" packaging, or in medical applications. In response to questions from the ABC regarding the phase-out, a spokesperson for Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said she was currently receiving briefings from her department on her new portfolio. ""However, Australia should be ambitious in reducing waste and phasing out problematic plastics and polystyrenes,"" they said. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

20,'You can't do deals on koalas': Outgoing Liberal MP says legislation strips oversight for native vegetation clearing,environment,"  NSW Premier defends state’s koala plan as outgoing MP Catherine Cusack slams it as 'sheer madness' New South Wales Premier Dominic Perrottet is standing by his government's environmental record after outgoing Liberal MP Catherine Cusack slammed its koala plan as ""sheer madness"" and ""grotesque"". Ms Cusack made the claims during a parliamentary debate on Wednesday night in the state's Upper House on a Greens motion to create a ""Great Koala Park"" on the mid-north coast at Urunga. The north coast-based MLC revealed conversations she had with then-premier Gladys Berejiklian and former environment minister Matt Kean during the infamous ""koala wars"" that almost fractured the coalition in 2020. Ms Cusack said she was asked the lead the attack on the Nationals as the Liberals tried to pass the 2020 State Environmental Planning Policy [SEPP] into legislation but she was then sidelined. ""Until the most shocking legislation stripping environment controls and oversight for logging and clearing for native vegetation was suddenly introduced to this parliament."" She said she told the then-premier she would not support it and would cross the floor, so Gladys Berejiklian sent Matt Kean to speak to her. ""I said, 'Matt, this bill is a stain on your reputation as an environment minister', and he was angry and said, 'That is rubbish — I am one of the greatest, probably the greatest environment minister in Australian history'. ""I was stunned and thought oh he was joking — but he wasn't,"" she said. She said he then turned the conversation to his new renewable energy bill. ""And how he had broken through when no-one could, and I said, 'What about koalas?' and he said, 'I don't know anything about that — it is all [then-planning minister] Rob Stokes"". ""And I said, 'Why did Gladys even send you up here?' He pretty much shrugged. He asked me what I was offered in exchange for my vote and I said, 'nothing'. ""And he said. 'Well no wonder you won't vote for it, what do you want?' and I said 'Well you can't do deals on koalas,' and he said 'Catherine, how else do decisions get made?' — like I was some kind of stupid little two-year-old."" Ms Cusack told the parliamentary debate she now realised Mr Kean had secured Nationals support for his renewable energy plan and the Liberals had acquiesced to the Nationals' demands on koalas. ""The 1994 SEPP is still in force for all rural-zoned land,"" she said. ""Only residential land has been protected, and hardly any koalas are assisted by that,"" Ms Cusack note that koalas had recently had their threatened status updated to endangered. ""How can this government stand there and tell us with a straight face and tell us their strategy is succeeding? ""This is sheer madness, the spin about doubling koala numbers is such a joke, there are no numbers to tell us what that means. It is just grotesque."" The Greens welcomed Ms Cusack's support for their bill but failed to win backing from the government or the opposition. The proposal would have combined state forest and national parklands to form a 315,000 hectare sanctuary on the mid north coast, providing protection for 20 per cent of the state's koala population. During the debate on the Greens bill, Labor's Penny Sharpe said although the opposition ""urgently supports the need to protect koala habitat"", it could not support the Greens proposal. ""The bill, if passed put into the hands of an underfunded government department the creation of a national park that a hostile government does not want"". The bill was defeated and Greens MLC Cate Faehrmann lamented the result. ""I think what we have seen tonight once again and revelations from the right honourable Catherine Cusack that politics is always winning out,"" she said. ""Politics is always winning out over koalas and what we are seeing from the Labor Party is that it is more about politics than it is about koalas."" In March, Ms Cusack announced her intention to resign from parliament over the then-federal Coalition government's  handling of the flooding disaster in the Northern Rivers. In May, she said the earliest practical date for her resignation would be the first week of August. Mr Kean, who is now Treasurer, in question time on Thursday rejected Ms Cusack's account of their conversation. ""I wholeheartedly reject the recollection of events by Ms Cusack, I think it is clearly some wild fantasy dreamed up at night,"" he said. Mr Perrottet said as an environment minister Mr Kean was ""pretty good"". ""In an area where Liberals and Nationals are not seen to be leaders when it comes to the environment, I think ... our environmental record here in our state is by far the best in the country and a lot of that is testament to the policies of Minister Kean."" The Premier said he met with Ms Cusack yesterday and still saw her as ""valued member of our team"" and respects her passion and how she expresses her views with ""colour"".

21,Parks Victoria refuses to confirm if it's behind brumby carcasses found hidden in national park,environment,"  Parks Victoria refuses to confirm if it's behind brumby carcasses found hidden in national park Parks Victoria has refused to comment on claims it is shooting brumbies and leaving the carcasses hidden in Barmah National Park on the New South Wales-Victoria border. Warning: this story contains an image that readers may find distressing. Members of local brumby preservation group claim they have found more than 30 carcasses in the park, and they believe there could be more. They claim Parks Victoria is responsible. ""They've gone out behind our backs and mounted several shooting operations,"" Barmah Brumby Preservation Group vice-president Murray Willaton said. Last year, Parks Victoria released an action plan outlining measures to reduce brumby populations through a combination of trapping, rehoming, and ground-shooting. While a Parks Victoria spokesperson confirmed ""planning and implementation"" of their plan was underway, they would not confirm how many horses had been culled to date, if any. However, Victorian Nationals leader Peter Walsh, who was sent photos of the carcasses from preservation group members, claimed it had already begun. ""My understanding is they're left like that until the knackery can come and take them away,"" he said. Parks Victoria would not confirm if the carcasses were a part of their action plan. They added they would not publish any operational details, such as the timing and location of feral horse control operations, to protect the safety of staff, contractors, and community members. In the wetlands of Barmah and the high country's alpine plains a battle is brewing over Victoria's brumbies. To some, the horses are an intrinsic piece of Australia's heritage and should be protected. But to scientists, ecologists, and rangers, brumbies are pests which must be swiftly removed to protect vulnerable native plants and animals. Meanwhile in Barmah, the Yorta Yorta people fear they pose a significant threat to sacred Aboriginal sites. But this week the battle spilled onto the steps of parliament, with the Victorian opposition announcing it will scrap Labor's feral horse cull if elected. The Liberal Member for Benambra, Bill Tilley, expressed his displeasure at government policy by riding a horse onto the steps of Parliament House. Mr Walsh said the Liberals and Nationals would instead focus efforts solely on the rehoming and fertility control of the horses. But while the announcement was warmly welcomed by brumby supporters, it was heavily criticised by others. Brumbies are only found in two Victorian parks – Barmah National Park, on the New South Wales-Victoria border, and the Alpine National Park in Victoria's high country. It is estimated there are 600 feral horses in Barmah, 100 on the Bogong High Plains, and approximately 5,000 in the Eastern Alps. Parks Victoria plans to completely eradicate the horses in Barmah and Bogong, and significantly reduce numbers in the east. While exact numbers of brumbies are contested, Charles Sturt University professor of ecology David Watson said the situation was reaching crisis point with populations growing unchecked. ""The longer we stand here wringing our hands saying 'oh look it's controversial, they're majestic we don't want to do the wrong thing', we have been doing the wrong thing for over a decade by doing nothing,"" Professor Watson said. ""It's going to become more of an issue, populations are going to be pushed to extinction, our creek lines are going to remain fouled, our trail waters are going to remain muddy."" He was critical of the Liberals and Nationals plan to focus mainly on rehoming. ""That would require about a hundred-fold greater number of animals being removed and rehomed than we've seen historically,"" he said. ""The number of people who actually rehome feral horses is minuscule."" Professor Watson added fertility control, while a good solution for small areas, would be impractical for uncontained populations in vast, mountainous regions. While Parks Victoria has been working to trap and rehome some of the brumbies, they recently claimed their efforts had been hindered. Chief executive Matthew Jackson told the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee some traps in the Alpine and Barmah national parks were no longer used after being pulled down or tampered with by members of the public. But the Barmah preservation group, which opened a brumby sanctuary last year to help rehome the horses, claimed this was not true. ""One set of traps have been used in the Barmah National Park. They have not been torn down,"" Mr Willaton said. He said Parks Victoria was not working hard enough to capture the brumbies. ""While Parks Victoria have promised the public that their main intention was to trap and rehome, they have actually done one week of trapping in the last 18 months,"" he said. Ten horses have been rehomed in the Barmah National Park to date, and none in the Alpine National Park. In 2018, legislation was passed across the border in New South Wales protecting the heritage of feral horses in Kosciuszko National Park. The bill drew widespread criticism from scientists, conservationists, and rangers, who said it prioritised an invasive species over native and threatened species. Victorian brumby supporters are calling for a similar bill. Professor Watson claimed the ""pro-horse"" cohort was a small group of people with ""very strong ideals"". And he said instead of ""pandering"" to these groups, urgent action should be taken to control brumby populations. ""They are taking the place of a whole lot of special mountain creatures, mountain wildflowers,"" he said. ""They are nowhere else on the planet, these things. You can see horses anywhere. ""We need to really have a long conversation about what matters to Australia and to Australians, and try and rise above this really nasty politics.""

22,Scientists warn backing projects like Woodside's Scarborough will make meeting climate targets more difficult,environment,"  Scientists warn backing fossil fuel projects like Woodside's Scarborough will make meeting climate targets more difficult As the Australian government grapples with a short-term fix to the energy crisis, climate scientists are warning against long-term fossil fuel projects that will exacerbate the climate crisis. The Albanese government has thrown its support behind Woodside Energy's $16 billion Scarborough gas project, which cleared major state and Commonwealth regulatory hurdles before the federal election. Most of the liquefied natural gas (LNG), expected to be ready for export by 2026, will go to Woodside customers in China, Japan and South Korea. But amid the energy crisis facing parts of Australia, the company has also flagged the potential to ship LNG to the eastern states in the future. ""It's a few years away from being helpful in the current crisis,"" Woodside CEO Meg O'Neill told 7.30. ""But certainly, if we can get the right sort of LNG importing facilities up and running, we would absolutely be interested in taking Scarborough LNG across to the east coast."" Ms O'Neill has also flagged kick-starting undeveloped gas fields. ""I think what the world has seen with Russia's invasion of Ukraine is that we don't want to be dependent on gas from that particular nation,"" she said. ""One of the things that worries me is that in the world's rush to address the climate crisis, which is a serious crisis, and does need to be addressed, is that we risk creating an energy crisis. ""We need to make sure that as we think about transitioning from the energy system we have today to the one that we want, that we do it in an orderly manner. ""And that's going to involve continuing to use the fuels that we use today, because we can't just walk away from them."" But Bill Hare, the founder and CEO of the global research group Climate Analytics, said the development of any new fossil fuel projects including Scarborough was inconsistent with the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""What I'm seeing now is the gas industry is basically using the Russian-induced energy crisis as a justification for essentially busting the Paris Agreement,"" he said. ""We're seeing this all over the world, not just in Australia. ""And it's one of mounting concern for all of those in the energy and climate business looking at how to meet the Paris Agreement."" A year ago, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned immediate action was needed to meet climate goals by 2050, including ending investments in new coal mines, oil and gas wells. Woodside Energy forecasts its Scarborough development will release 878 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over its lifetime. But Climate Analytics estimates the entire project would emit almost 1.4 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases over its lifetime – three times Australia's current annual emissions. Mr Hare said the project presented a challenge for the new Labor government, which had committed to reducing Australia's emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. ""The Labor government is going to struggle to meet the 43 per cent target as long as these kinds of projects are going ahead,"" Mr Hare said. But Resources Minister Madeleine King said Woodside's Scarborough project fit with Labor's climate targets. ""[Woodside] have an ambition themselves for net zero emissions by 2050, just like the government does,"" she told 7.30. ""Woodside are prepared and have guaranteed to the WA state government to implement the appropriate offsets for the development of the Scarborough gas field. ""Because it is a low carbon field, it is the kind of field we should be encouraging development of, so long as those offsets are there."" Part of Labor's plan to reduce emissions involves strengthening the safeguard mechanism, by forcing Australia's biggest polluters to keep their emissions below historic levels, known as the baseline. Energy analyst Tony Wood said he believed Woodside's Scarborough development could be accommodated within this policy because its emissions will be included in the cap and will need to be accommodated. ""So given that the cap is fixed, and will be declining, that means by adding a project which is going to add to emissions, something else has got to give,"" he said. ""And it also means other companies who are contemplating new gas developments will have a very clear and I believe credible framework to make these investment decisions. ""It won't require the government to ban these projects or otherwise. ""Because two things will happen: International demand for LNG will fall away as other countries move towards net zero emissions, and that very policy that Labor is putting in will constrain emissions in Australia."" Woodside's climate plan aims to reduce emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 by using measures such as better technology, tree planting and investing in carbon offsets. The company has no target for Scope 3 emissions – those created through the burning of fossil fuels by its customers. Instead, it will spend $5 billion on low-carbon projects and investigating carbon capture and storage. ""We're investing time and effort in things like hydrogen and ammonia, because those really will help our customers with their emissions challenge,"" Ms O'Neill said. Emboldened by high prices, Woodside Energy is looking beyond Scarborough. At last month's annual general meeting, Ms O'Neill said the energy crisis had strengthened the case for developing the Browse gas field – which is even bigger than Scarborough. ""We are in this position of financial strength at a time of significant volatility in global commodity markets including oil and gas, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" Ms O'Neill said in her AGM statement. ""The likelihood that major energy customers will continue moving away from Russian energy sources also strengthens the case for other undeveloped gas fields, such as Browse, to be brought on-line."" Alex Hillman, who worked as an engineer and lobbyist at Woodside for more than eight years and now works for the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), said big new fossil fuel projects would not fix today's energy problems but would exacerbate the climate crisis. ""Energy exporters, like Woodside, are talking a lot about increasing their supply as customers look for alternatives to Russian energy,"" he said. ""But building major fossil fuel projects takes years, so they can't fix today's energy problems. ""Meanwhile, gas importers have realised that domestic renewable energy is cheaper, cleaner, faster to build and provides higher levels of energy security than LNG imports. ""Taking Browse for example, it's infeasible that Browse could produce LNG, or generate revenue, until the 2030s. ""By this time, countries will have had plenty of time to reduce their gas dependency, creating huge risk for this investment."" Resources Minister Madeleine King said the government would support developments that met environmental standards and approvals and aligned with the move towards net zero emissions. ""If that includes Browse, and Browse stacks up environmentally and economically, then I can see no reason why not to support it,"" she said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told ABC Radio Perth last week gas would continue to play a role domestically as the country transitioned to net zero. ""The idea that you have a simple stop position [on fossil fuel projects] is one that does not reflect the needs of either our domestic economy or the global economy,"" he told ABC Radio Perth. Woodside sees its LNG as a solution to both energy security and the climate crisis. ""If we look at nations like China, Japan, Korea, where much of our product is sold today, all of those nations still have heavy dependence on coal,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""So gas is going to be part of their energy transition and meets both of those needs of being a secure source of energy, that is lower carbon than many alternatives."" But Professor of Sustainability at Curtin University Peter Newman said coal could be replaced by renewables. ""Around the world, coal is being replaced by solar, not natural gas,"" he said. ""The market for natural gas is up at the moment, very short-term. But in the mid to long-term, that market is going to collapse. It is going to disappear. ""You will have stranded assets. ""It is not acceptable to claim that somehow that market will go on and on over decades. It is not going to."" Curtin University energy economist Roberto Aguilera said the high price of fossil fuels should provide stimulation to renewable energy development. ""But we have to remember that around the world, fossil fuels still accounted for around 80 per cent of energy consumption,"" he said. ""So despite the very fast growth of renewables, this is coming from a fairly low base. ""They're not ready today to take the market share of gas and coal. That's a longer-term prospect that could take years, or in a worst-case scenario, several decades before they account for a majority of the total energy mix. ""The gas and LNG industry has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in this country over the past decade and it is difficult to see them walking away from these projects. ""The more likely outcome is for them to continue to invest in clean technologies, like carbon capture and storage, or hydrogen, or nature-based offsets like reforestation.""

23,Alice does everything she can to minimise her carbon footprint — but she won't be getting a home battery ,environment,"  Home battery subsidy scrapped as eco-conscious home owners grapple with cost of living For Alice Clanachan, driving a car is a luxury she – and the planet – can do without. Nine years ago, the art curator moved to Adelaide from Melbourne and committed to living as car-free as she could, relinquishing the idea of owning a vehicle. She uses public transport to travel to work, to the shops and to the CBD, and she keeps her occasional use of ride-sharing services to a minimum. ""I've tried to employ different strategies in my life to really support clean transport options,"" Ms Clanachan said. ""I catch the train to Bedford Park – to Flinders Uni – every day, I catch the tram regularly into the city, I catch the bus quite a lot, I also ride my bike. ""I have modified my lifestyle to suit my transport habits."" Ms Clanachan has also taken steps to reduce her carbon footprint in other ways, including subscribing to a ""zero-waste"" lifestyle through rigorous recycling, and recently investing in rooftop solar and a heat-pump hot water system. A home battery was on her wishlist, but a decision by the South Australian government to scrap a subsidy scheme has dented that ambition. As part of last week's state budget, the new government revealed it would be discontinuing its predecessor's Home Battery Scheme – which offered $2,000 incentives to home owners willing to invest – because of poor uptake. ""The [previous] government had promised 40,000 batteries by now — they got less than 20,000,"" Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis said last week. ""We're focusing on renewable grid-scale projects so we can get power prices down for everyone."" Big power suppliers face increased scrutiny from the competition watchdog amid concerns that rising prices will wipe out many electricity retailers. Ms Clanachan accepted that the battery scheme was ""not as popular as it could have been"". But she says it is worth persisting with at a time of high cost of living pressures and rising gas prices, which will be the subject of a meeting today between federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen and his state counterparts. ""Perhaps it's almost been axed at the point in time in which it would have been a bit more popular,"" Ms Clanachan said. ""Batteries are expensive, even with subsidies, and so it probably takes a while [for consumers] to think about how much … they might get out of such a big financial decision. ""The general kind of consensus has been do the solar first, batteries might get cheaper, think about that a bit later. ""For me, that's exactly what I did. ""I got rooftop solar last year, paid that off now and was thinking a battery might be good for the future, because I am generating a lot of electricity during the day that I'm not using at home."" Greens MP Robert Simms subscribes to that logic, telling ABC Radio Adelaide's Stacey Lee and Nikolai Beilharz that discontinuing the subsidy is ""really short-sighted"". ""We're in the middle of a climate emergency and … the cost of living is spiralling at the moment, skyrocketing out of control,"" he said. ""We've got huge electricity prices and home battery storage is a really good way for people to be able to reduce some of those cost-of-living pressures. ""If people aren't taking up the program and it makes sense from a public policy perspective, wouldn't you then say, 'What can we do to increase the uptake?'"" Premier Peter Malinauskas hit back at suggestions the scrapping of the battery scheme and other green initiatives, including an electric vehicle charging subsidy, showed a lack of environmental concern. ""They were dismal failures,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide earlier this week. ""Don't take my word for it — look at the market, look at the lack of take-up. ""Why would we be using state government or South Australian taxpayers' money investing in a policy that's been a proven failure? ""Why would anyone do that? That would be reckless."" It's been identified as the clean energy source that could help bring the world to net-zero emissions, but green hydrogen's future is not yet assured. Instead, Mr Malinauskas spruiked the government's plan for a $593-million hydrogen power plant, electrolyser and storage facility in the Upper Spencer Gulf region. ""We've got a very substantial policy to increase local generation, with our clean, green hydrogen production facility which is world-leading,"" he said. But a hydrogen hub that is not yet under construction and is four years from completion is not going to help Ms Clanachan's home-grown environmental battle. ""I would love the option of using an [electrical vehicle] on the weekends, but I think for now that's not an option for me,"" she said. ""With no incentives to buy an EV or take up a battery, I'll have to be waiting a really long time.""

24,It's been a hot and steamy start to the Top End's dry season. What's going on?,environment,"  The Northern Territory is set for a proper dry spell, but warmer weather is predicted to return Cooler weather is on its way to the Top End, says the Bureau of Meteorology. It's welcome news for many Territorians who have been copping some unseasonably hot, rainy and sticky weather to start the dry season. However, over the longer term, forecasters say temperatures and rainfall are likely to remain higher than usual across the north of Australia. Here's what's happening and why. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) says a cool and dry south-east surge will move into the Top End from Wednesday — bringing with it Darwin's first night below 20-degrees since September last year. The BOM expects the cooler weather to hang around until at least the end of the long weekend. ""If anybody's going camping inland, it will be nice cool overnight, and during the day as well,"" BOM senior forecaster Sally Cutter said. The same weather system has already seen temperatures in Central Australia plunge, with minimum temperatures dropping over 10-degrees in some spots. It is a big week of contrasting weather around Australia, with showers in the west, cold weather in the south-east, and steamy conditions in the north. The Katherine area is also expected to see a big dip in daily minimum temperatures. ""Overnight minimums around Katherine [could be] getting down to the low or high single figures,"" Ms Cutter said. ""Certainly, once you get in down through the southern parts of the Top End we are looking very much at those really cool nights. ""[Higher] in Top End will be in the teens as minimum [temperatures]."" The BOM is predicting maximum temperatures in Katherine to be slightly below average, at around 29-degrees, when the cooler spell begins. And in Darwin, those maximum temperatures are expected to sit around the 31 to 32-degree mark — a few degrees cooler than recent maximum of around 34-degrees. On Monday the Bureau of Meteorology said much of the north was 2 to 3 degrees above average for May. After 25 years as a mango farmer on the outskirts of Katherine, Mitchael Curtis thought he had seen it all – then, this morning, it rained. According to Ms Cutter, the warmer-than-usual conditions are due to the lack of high-pressure systems that typically bring cool, dry air from the southern ocean across the continent up into the Top End. ""It's mainly been the lack of these events that have led to those really humid conditions, because there's been nothing to flush that moisture out,"" she said. ""We've also got warmer sea surface temperatures around the Top End as well, which is helping to keep those minimums [high] particularly overnight."" Persistent cloud cover this dry season and large downpours across some parts of the Top End last week had mystified some awaiting a proper dry spell. Ms Cutter, however, said such weather was not that unusual around this time of year. ""We do quite often see these downpour events in the dry season,"" she said. ""It's called the dry season because that's when we have the least amount of rain — [but] it's not a total absence of rainfall. ""What's happened is we've just had that deep moisture build-up which has allowed those storms to occur. ""And that's been right through the records. There'll be these occasional big dumps of rain through and around Darwin. It's mainly the coastal areas that get them because you need that humidity that's been brought in by the sea breezes."" While the Top End is set for its first major dry spell, forecasters are predicting a hotter and wetter than usual next three to four months across the region. ""Unfortunately, we're looking at a good chance of having above average maximums and minimums right across the Top End [for the rest of the dry season],"" Ms Cutter said. Andrew King, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, said the Northern Territory's climate outlook follows a general pattern of warmer weather. ""We are seeing a warming trend of northern Australia in the dry season, and this seasonal outlook fits with that,"" he said. ""It fits in with the trends that we expect to see as the world continues to warm."" According to the most recent BOM climate outlook, released earlier this month, the following weather trends have been predicted between June and August: The BOM is also predicting the Top End will exceed its median rainfall during the dry season. ""But the average rainfall for this time of year is very low, so we don't have to get much to get above the average,"" Ms Cutter said.

26,Endangered dolphins hanging in there despite toxic algal bloom,environment,"  Survey finds no signs of skin lesions in rare Burrunan dolphins amid algal bloom A rare endangered dolphin species in the Gippsland Lakes has not been affected by a protracted blue-green algae bloom, a survey has found. Kate Robb from the Marine Mammal Foundation told ABC Gippsland Breakfast the organisation hoped to see whether the Burrunan dolphins had recovered from potentially deadly skin lesions last year. ""Fortunately, none of the dolphins we saw had any of those ulcerative skins lesions, so that's a really good sign,"" she said. Although the foundation's autumn survey only saw 11 of the 30 dolphins known to be living in the ecosystem, Dr Robb said the prognosis was good. ""In fact, one of our long-term females had a calf and that's a really good sign,"" she said. But due to weather conditions and the algal bloom, fewer people have been out on the water to spot the dolphins. ""One of the concerning things is that our citizen science report they haven't seen the dolphins in ages,"" Dr Robb said. ""We don't have trackers out on the dolphins, so it really relies on that presence on the water."" Dr Robb said those that were seen tended to be spending less time in the area than usual because of the algae. ""Most of their sightings are up around the Lakes Entrance area, which means they're coming in and out of the Lakes area more frequently,"" she said. Businesses relying on the Gippsland Lakes for tourism opportunities have also struggled due to the bloom. Scientists confirm that extreme rainfall due to climate change is the leading cause of a deadly skin disease responsible for the deaths of the endangered Burrunan dolphin. Sarah Carlisle says her Lakes Entrance-based stand-up paddleboarding business has been ""really affected"". ""We haven't been able to send people out on the Gippsland Lakes for the past month or a little bit more,"" she said. ""Fortunately it's a cooler time of the year, so less people are asking for that experience."" Ms Carlisle said she had been able to run some tours on Lake Tyers and was glad the bloom did not set in during the warmer months. ""We got Easter and the school holidays, so I was really thankful for that,"" she said.

27,analysis: The recent wet weather could become the norm in Australia — if this huge ocean current collapses,environment,"  A huge Atlantic ocean current is slowing down. If it collapses, La Niña could become the norm for Australia Climate change is slowing down the conveyor belt of ocean currents that brings warm water from the tropics up to the North Atlantic. Our research, published today in Nature Climate Change, looks at the profound consequences to global climate if this Atlantic conveyor collapses entirely. We found the collapse of this system — called the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation — would shift the Earth's climate to a more La Niña-like state. This would mean more flooding rains over eastern Australia and worse droughts and bushfire seasons over southwest United States. East-coast Australians know what unrelenting La Niña feels like. Climate change has loaded our atmosphere with moister air, while two summers of La Niña warmed the ocean north of Australia. Both contributed to some of the wettest conditions ever experienced, with record-breaking floods in New South Wales and Queensland. This summer we've had round after round of flooding rains. So what is causing all this rain and when is it going to end? Meanwhile, over the southwest of North America, a record drought and severe bushfires have put a huge strain on emergency services and agriculture, with the 2021 fires alone estimated to have cost at least $US70 billion. Earth's climate is dynamic, variable, and ever-changing. But our current trajectory of unabated greenhouse gas emissions is giving the whole system a giant kick that'll have uncertain consequences — consequences that'll rewrite our textbook description of the planet's ocean circulation and its impact. The Atlantic overturning circulation comprises a massive flow of warm tropical water to the North Atlantic that helps keep European climates mild, while allowing the tropics a chance to lose excess heat. An equivalent overturning of Antarctic waters can be found in the Southern Hemisphere. Climate records reaching back 120,000 years reveal the Atlantic overturning circulation has switched off, or dramatically slowed, during ice ages. It switches on and placates the European climate during so-called ""interglacial periods"", when the Earth's climate is warmer. Since human civilisation began around 5,000 years ago, the Atlantic overturning has been relatively stable. But over the past few decades a slowdown has been detected and this has scientists worried. Why the slowdown? One unambiguous consequence of global warming is the melting of polar ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica. When these icecaps melt they dump massive amounts of freshwater into the oceans, making water more buoyant and reducing the sinking of dense water at high latitudes. Around Greenland alone, a massive 5 trillion tonnes of ice has melted in the past 20 years. That's equivalent to 10,000 Sydney Harbours worth of freshwater. This melt rate is set to increase over the coming decades if global warming continues unabated. A collapse of the North Atlantic and Antarctic overturning circulations would profoundly alter the anatomy of the world's oceans. It would make them fresher at depth, deplete them of oxygen, and starve the upper ocean of the upwelling of nutrients provided when deep waters resurface from the ocean abyss. The implications for marine ecosystems would be profound. With Greenland ice melt already well underway, scientists estimate the Atlantic overturning is at its weakest for at least the last millennium, with predictions of a future collapse on the cards in coming centuries if greenhouse gas emissions go unchecked. In our study, we used a comprehensive global model to examine what Earth's climate would look like under such a collapse. We switched the Atlantic overturning off by applying a massive meltwater anomaly to the North Atlantic, and then compared this to an equivalent run with no meltwater applied. Our focus was to look beyond the well-known regional impacts around Europe and North America, and to check how Earth's climate would change in remote locations, as far south as Antarctica. The first thing the model simulations revealed was that without the Atlantic overturning, a massive pile-up of heat builds up just south of the Equator. This excess of tropical Atlantic heat pushes more warm moist air into the upper troposphere (around 10 kilometres into the atmosphere), causing dry air to descend over the east Pacific. The descending air then strengthens trade winds, which pushes warm water towards the Indonesian seas. And this helps put the tropical Pacific into a La Niña-like state. Australians may think of La Niña summers as cool and wet. But under the long-term warming trend of climate change, their worst impacts will be flooding rain, especially over the east. We also show an Atlantic overturning shutdown would be felt as far south as Antarctica. Rising warm air over the West Pacific would trigger wind changes that propagate south to Antarctica. This would deepen the atmospheric low-pressure system over the Amundsen Sea, which sits off west Antarctica. This low pressure system is known to influence ice sheet and ice shelf melt, as well as ocean circulation and sea-ice extent as far west as the Ross Sea. At no time in Earth's history, giant meteorites and super-volcanos aside, has our climate system been jolted by changes in atmospheric gas composition like what we are imposing today by our unabated burning of fossil fuels. The oceans are the flywheel of Earth's climate, slowing the pace of change by absorbing heat and carbon in vast quantities. But there is payback, with sea level rise, ice melt, and a significant slowdown of the Atlantic overturning circulation projected for this century. Now we know this slowdown will not just affect the North Atlantic region, but as far away as Australia and Antarctica. We can prevent these changes from happening by growing a new low-carbon economy. Doing so will change, for the second time in less than a century, the course of Earth's climate history — this time for the better.

28,Traditional owners launch Federal Court action to halt multi-billion-dollar Santos gas field,environment,"  Tiwi traditional owners launch Federal Court action to try to stop Santos Barossa gas field Indigenous traditional owners from the Northern Territory's remote Tiwi Islands have launched Federal Court action in a bid to stop the development of a multi-billion-dollar gas project off the coast of Darwin. Tiwi traditional owners are alleging they were not properly consulted about the projects impacts Santos recorded consultation attempts with the Tiwi Land Council Indigenous and environment groups are increasingly joining forces to bring the matter to court Santos last year signed off on the $4.7 billion Barossa offshore development, which includes a pipeline from a gas field in the Timor Sea to an existing LNG facility on Darwin Harbour. However, traditional owners claim the gas company and the federal government failed to ensure they were properly consulted about the project's potential risks to their marine environment, dreaming story tracks and animals. It is the second court action that Tiwi traditional owners have attempted to take against the development, after they failed last month to get a South Korean court to rule loans for the development should be halted. We answer some of your questions about what's happening. Energy giant Santos will pour $4.7 billion into opening up a new gas field off the coast of Darwin. Labelled as one of the biggest projects in the Australian oil and gas sector for almost a decade, the development will draw gas from an offshore field lying about 300 kilometres north of Darwin, in Commonwealth waters. Santos predicts it will help extend the life of the Darwin LNG processing plant by 20 years. Gas production is expected to begin in 2025, with the project to create an estimated 600 jobs during construction as well as 350 ongoing jobs in Darwin over the next two decades. Santos has said it plans to minimise climate changing emissions from the project by using carbon capture and storage. Senior Munupi Tiwi traditional owner and law man Dennis Murphy Tipakalippa's land and sea country is at the northern beaches on Melville Island. He is worried about well drilling, and that any possible spill of condensate oil could damage flatback and olive ridley turtle nesting areas and habitat there. ""I am worried about the turtles, we do have a nesting ground at Imalu Point, I am worried we might not see those clutches of eggs and those little turtles anymore,"" he said. ""If it's going to affect our marine areas, our bush tucker then what else our kids going to eat, our future generation?"" Mr Tipakalippa is also worried that the planned 260 kilometre pipeline is to be built through the Ocean Shoals Marine Park and within six kilometres of his Putjamirra homeland on Melville's Northern Beaches area. Munupi traditional owner Connie Puruntatameri, who lives on Melville's Northern Beaches area said that also worries her. ""All our life we've been eating bush tucker, and we don't want any drilling and pipelines at the ocean otherwise all our animals will go away,"" she said. In its application to have its Environment Plan for the gas field approved by the Federal Government, Santos outlined both planned and unplanned impacts including noise, ship movements, and spills of condensate oil to endangered turtles, whales and sharks as a risk to wildlife. It modelled that a spill of condensate oil, which is to be extracted along with gas, could pollute Tiwi Islands traditional waters, and four federal government marine parks, including Ashmore Reef, as well as the Ashmore Reef Ramsar site. The company found endangered and threatened animals that could be affected by construction, condensate ship movements, or an unplanned spill, including the spear tooth shark, whale shark, blue whale, loggerhead turtle and leatherback turtle. It also recorded that Seagull Island north of Melville has ""internationally significant"" nesting sites for 60,000 crested terns. Santos found that a number of Australian fisheries including the Northern Prawn Fishery, and Indonesian and East Timorese fishing waters could be affected by a condensate oil spill. In its Environment Plan, Santos said the risk of a spill was low to medium and it outlined a series of measures to prevent and deal with that eventuality, including having ships ready to try to clean a spill up, and building its wells to high technical and integrity standards. The Federal Government's offshore gas regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, approved the Environment Plan last month. The Authority said it was ""reasonably satisfied"" environmental risks are acceptable. Santos already has an operational gas field north-west of the Tiwi Islands and the Kimberley, Bayu Undan, from which it has piped gas to its Darwin LNG plant through a pipeline, without any major environmental incidents, since 2006. Consultation with stakeholders who may be affected by offshore gas projects is a legal requirement for federal approval. Dennis Murphy Tipaklippa said he and his family were not consulted about the risks from the Barossa project and pipeline. ""Me, I'm one of the law men for the Northern Beaches, they never confronted me or consulted me and my family clan group,"" he said. Mr Tipaklippa has lodged the Federal Court case against both Santos and the federal government, alleging both failed to ensure proper consultation took place. He is being backed by the Environmental Defenders Office green group special counsel Alina Leikin. ""There is an obligation on Santos to identify people who might be affected by the proposed activity, and then it has to provide them with enough information to meaningfully engage in that consultation process,"" she said. ""Then it has to take into account what's been said and factor that in to the way it takes the proposal forward. ""If our client is successful in this case we would expect that Santos would have to start this (the consultation) process again."" The company did not respond to the ABC's request for comment this week. However, in its Environment Plan, Santos recorded that it had emailed and phoned the Tiwi Land Council, which represents traditional owners, in June and July last year to provide information about the project risks. ""Tiwi Land Council was contacted by email on 11 June 2021 to offer a briefing on the Barossa Project,"" Santos said. ""[It] was provided the Barossa Development Drilling and Completions Stakeholder Consultation package via email on 11 June 2021 inviting comment. ""[It] was provided a follow-up email on 2 July 2021 inviting comment. Further contact attempts were made via phone. No response raising issues or concerns has been received to date."" In its Environment Plan for the pipeline, which was approved in March 2020, Santos's then project partner ConocoPhillips recorded that it consulted the Tiwi Land Council in 2018 and was able to satisfy its concerns about nesting turtles. ""A meeting with the Tiwi Land Council was held to discuss the gas export pipeline installation EP discussed the TLC's issues and concerns related to impacts and risks to the seabed and nearby habitat and turtle activity due to pipeline installation,"" it said. ""ConocoPhillips responded in writing to all the concerns raised and the TLC advised it was satisfied with the responses."" The Tiwi Land Council's long standing chairman Gibson Farmer Illortaminni told the ABC that ConocoPhillips and Santos had told the council about the Barossa project. But he said he told Santos it must directly consult with the correct traditional owners of areas that could be affected. ""We told Santos when we had that meeting, me as chair, I listen to my people,"" he said. ""We don't make a decision without the consent of the traditional owners. ""I said: you need to go and talk to the right traditional owners; I told they have to consult with the people."" This case is one of a series in Australia in which Indigenous traditional owners and environment groups have used the courts to try to tackle actual or threatened damage to the environment and cultural heritage. Emeritus Professor at the Australian National University, Jon Altman, gave evidence to the federal parliamentary inquiry into the Juukan Gorge destruction. ""We are seeing a paradigm shift of Indigenous land owners and people with native title rights asserting their rights to control what development happens on their lands and seas,"" he said. ""One of the weaknesses that Indigenous groups have had in the past is that they've been under-resourced ... so alliances with green groups are assisting them with resourcing."" Professor Altman said joint efforts are increasingly cutting through politically.

29,Federal Court intervention sought to refloat offshore gas plans sunk by former PM,environment,"  BPH Energy appeals to Federal Court for judicial review over PEP-11 gas exploration knockback A company that wants to explore offshore gas supplies between Sydney and Newcastle is asking the Federal Court to overturn a decision former prime minister Scott Morrison made to reject an extension of its licence. PEP-11 is an exploration licence covering 4,500 square kilometres offshore from Manly on Sydney's Northern Beaches to Nobbys Head in Newcastle. Prior to the federal election, Mr Morrison rejected BPH Energy's proposed two-year extension on the licence, which would have enabled it to drill an exploratory well to further test gas reserves off the coast. The veto came amid environment concerns and fierce community opposition to the project. Federal Labor's leader and now Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also promised to reject it if the ALP won government. BPH Energy told the ABC it had lodged paperwork with the Federal Court for a judicial review into the decision to reject its PEP 11 licence extension. The company questioned the process used by the Commonwealth-NSW Offshore Petroleum Joint Authority to make the decision and said it had appealed to the Federal Court asking for that process to be reviewed. The court action comes while eastern Australia is threatened by a gas supply crisis. Newly-installed Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the mechanism that allowed the government to requisition gas destined for export was poorly designed. He laid blame for Australia's current gas crisis on the Coalition, which he accused of botching energy policy for close to a decade. BPH Energy has previously said the east coast gas shortage would continue unless action was taken to source more gas at an effective price. A timeline for the Federal Court proceedings are yet to be determined. The NSW government said its opposition to PEP 11 remained in light of the current energy crisis.

30,"How a farmer who planted 15,000 trees turned his 'dust bowl' property around",environment,"  Farm in NSW central west given new lease on life after 15,000 trees planted in shelterbelts Twenty years ago, Will Johnson's farm in the New South Wales central west was a dust bowl, after the previous owner stripped the property of its trees. But after planting 15,000 trees in shelterbelts Mr Johnson has seen productivity on the farm, near Cargo, rapidly increase. A shelterbelt is a collection of trees and shrubs planted in a line to protect paddocks from the elements. Mr Johnson said the project had revitalised his property. ""When we moved to this farm there were quite a few paddocks that didn't have any trees at all, fully cleared, and not much left on the landscape,"" he said. ""The bird life has increased really well, there are a lot of small, native grass birds that you see most days. ""Not too many months go past where you don't see a different species of bird that you have never seen before."" A group of scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) Sustainable Farms project has been studying the impacts of shelterbelts across properties in the central west. The results show they reduce lamb mortality, improve live-weight gains, and increase wool production. ANU biodiversity field officer Eleanor Lang said they have seen more farmers planting trees as windbreaks, as they realise the benefits of increasing natural vegetation. ""In the past it [land-clearing] was a way of making the most of every inch of land that you could and maybe not fully appreciating the value of shelter,"" she said. ""We are starting to see the negative impact of removing vegetation and responding to it by putting trees back in."" Senior research officer Dan Florence said growing concerns about animal welfare were also contributing to the rise of shelterbelts. ""Animal welfare is now becoming more topical from a consumer and buyer perspective,"" he said. ""With a changing climate and really hot summers people are thinking more about their livestock's health and trying to give them a bit of shade and protection."" Mr Florence said the windbreaks could also play an important role in agriculture reducing net emissions. ""Some of those woodland trees hold a potentially large amount of carbon in them,"" he said. ""There is the potential to sequester a large amount more through targeted tree planting."" Mr Johnson said he became a sheep agistment farmer due to the success of his tree plantation project. He said the windbreaks created improved pastures for the livestock which led to improved production quality. ""Everyone who has had livestock here is very happy with the outcome when they do take them home or sell them,"" he said. ""It is a lot of work but the results are terrific.""

31,There's a potentially dangerous myth about venomous snakes that researchers have proven very wrong,environment," Science Think most venomous snakes don't climb? Think again There are a lot of misconceptions about Australian snakes that can lead to potentially dangerous false identifications. One myth that still gets brought up from time to time is that most venomous snakes don't climb — ie. if you see a snake in a tree or on a roof, it's either a harmless tree snake or a python. But a study conducted by three snake experts has conclusively dismissed that idea. Their research, published in Herpetology Notes late last year, found instances of climbing in a huge range of venomous Australian snakes (elapids), including king browns (Pseudechis australis), tiger snakes (Notechis scutatus), and the spectacularly patterned Collett's snake (Pseudechis colletti). In total, their research, which was based on literature studies, surveys, and personal observations, found instances of 20 different species of venomous snakes engaging in arboreal behaviour — tree climbing. When their observations were expanded to include venomous snakes climbing things other than trees, or snakes under extreme stress, such as when fleeing predators or rising floodwaters, the number of climbing species rose to 31. ""Even though we have 31 species recorded, which is just over a quarter of all [Australian] elapids, that number is likely to be higher,"" said Matt Sleeth, ecologist and lead author on the paper. ""Due to the difficulty of surveying this behaviour in these animals, it is likely that there are more [venomous elapid] snakes that do climb."" So, where does the misconception come from? Like most rumours, it is grounded in some truth. In Australia, there are five families of land snake — the pythons, file snakes, blind snakes, the rear-fanged snakes or colubrids, and the front-fanged snakes or elapids. Blind snakes are small, shy and rarely seen, file snakes are aquatic and live in northern swamps and billabongs, and pythons are widespread, non-venomous and are prolific climbers. Then there are the other two: elapids and colubrids. Almost all our venomous snakes belong to the elapidae family. Globally, elapids include the cobras of Asia and Africa, the mambas of Africa, as well as coral snakes, sea snakes, and in Australia, over 130 species of land and sea snake. While many elapids have evolved venom, Australia's elapids are singular in their potency. The world's most venomous land snake, the inland taipan, is capable of killing around 250,000 mice with the venom from a single bite, according to the LD50 parameter. Elapids are thought to have arrived in Australia many millions of years ago as a sea snake, according to evolutionary ecologist Rick Shine from the University of Sydney. ""In the case of the elapids, the ancestor that has come from Asia to Australia looks to be of a modern-day krait — a sea snake species,"" Professor Shine said. Today, sea kraits are among the most venomous snakes in the world, meaning Australia's elapids likely had a headstart in their development of potent venom. It also means that Australia's elapids started out as ground snakes. Though some may have moved into the trees, Australia then underwent a process of aridification — much of the vast forest that once covered the continent converted to deserts and grasslands. If any of those early Australian elapids had moved into the trees, the aridification of Australia would have counted against them, according to Matt Sleeth. ""Compared to places like Asia and Africa where there is plenty of forested habitat, Australia is much drier, so the potential for [tree dwelling] to be beneficial is limited,"" he said. Which brings us to the colubrids or rear-fanged snakes like the common tree snake, brown tree-snake, and keelback. The colubrids are the world's most successful family of snakes, and Australia is unique in being the only continent where elapids outnumber colubrids — only 10 species of colubrids occur here, according to the Queensland Museum. The colubrids are thought to have arrived in Australia after the elapids, but there is still some debate as to exactly when. And the path that they took to get here probably explains why many of Australia's colubrids are tree specialists. ""The colubrids came a lot more recently down through Asia and New Guinea,"" he said. What that means is that their migration path was a heavily forested one that favoured tree-dwelling species. ""There's probably a connection there where you're likely to get more tree-dwelling species,"" Professor Shine said. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. That migration pathway is the likely explanation for why many of Australia's non-venomous colubrids are climbers. Combined with the presence of non-venomous pythons, which also tend to climb, it's easy to see where the myth that climbing snakes are non-venomous came from. But while it might be a trend, it shouldn't be mistaken for a rule, according to Matt Sleeth. ""Myths among the public are pretty rampant, especially among non-charismatic species like snakes,"" he said. ""Generally speaking, if you do see a snake in a tree it's probably going to be a non-venomous python or a tree snake … but it doesn't have to be that way.""

33, 'Thank goodness they're still here': The fight to save the turquoise parrot after Black Summer fires,environment,"  New nesting boxes help Snowy Mountains' turquoise parrots recover from Black Summer bushfires When Louise Freckelton and David Bray were surveying their property in the New South Wales Snowy Mountains, after the devastating Black Summer bushfires, they were elated to find a unique and vulnerable bird species that had survived. The small population of turquoise parrots had held on during the Dunns Road fire by populating small, unburnt sections of bushland. ""It was very dry, and very little vegetation around, and I spotted it and thought, 'Thank goodness, they're still here,'"" Mr Bray said. However, the parrot relies on small hollows, low to the ground, to nest, and many of those were destroyed in the blaze. The fires were one of the worst events for wildlife in history, with a study from the World Wildlife Fund estimating almost 3 billion native animals were killed or displaced. Now, Ms Freckelton and Mr Bray are part of a project to help the parrot recover its population in the New South Wales high country and are hoping to inspire others to work towards bettering the environment. This is not the first time the turquoise parrot has faced a significant challenge. The bird was considered to be abundant in the 19th century, seen in large numbers from central Victoria, throughout Sydney and NSW, and all the way up to southern Queensland. It was so abundant that one 20th-century ornithologist met a man who had shot a number of the small birds to be cooked into pies. But with the introduction of early agriculture, land clearing and pests like rabbits, foxes and cats, by the 1920s, the turquoise parrot was widely considered to be extinct. ""Ornithologists at the time were going out looking for the species throughout much of its former habitat, and they weren't finding any birds,"" said Jayden Gunn, Central NSW woodland bird coordinator for BirdLife Australia. Since the 1930s, the bird has made a remarkable recovery, although not to its former numbers. ""The turquoise parrot has slowly recovered and is still slowly recovering, although not in all parts of its former geographical range,"" Mr Gunn said. ""It's only found in small pockets of suitable habitat."" But during the devastating 2019-20 bushfires, the species hit another hurdle, with the fires burning its nesting hollows and food. ""It's a hollow-nesting species, and often these hollows are less than 3 metres off the ground, which would have been the first things to burn in the bushfires,"" Mr Gunn said. ""Breeding for the species in some areas will now be incredibly difficult or non-existent, and this could take decades to recover without human intervention."" After Ms Freckelton and Mr Bray observed turquoise parrots on their property, they got in touch with Murrumbidgee Landcare, which is coordinating bushfire recovery projects in the Snowy Mountains. They used a grant to buy innovative new nest boxes, offering a temporary place for the parrots to breed while their numbers and habitat can recover. ""We identified, using mapping, that there are pockets of unburnt areas right across the fire scar,""  Murrumbidgee Landcare coordinator David Waters said. ""The animals would have sought shelter there during the fires, and then those populations will radiate out from those unburnt areas after the fires to repopulate the burnt areas. ""This is important because it's the world we live in, this is our region, and it got absolutely hammered by the fires. ""And we want it to recover, and we want it to be better than it was before the fires."" The boxes being placed in unburnt grassy box gum woodland on Ms Freckelton and Mr Bray's property are a new design, and described by their creators as a significant improvement on traditional timber nest boxes. ""Traditional nest boxes have been made out of timber for a long time, and the problem with those is they don't last very long,"" Habitat Innovation Management director Carl Tippler said. ""They get very hot and very cold, and they're not designed specifically for the targeted species."" The boxes are cased with polypropylene plastic, are modular and adaptable to different animals, and offer protection from extreme temperatures for their occupants. ""Turquoise parrots are a vulnerable species, and they have a very specific nesting requirement, "" Mr Tippler said. ""And these boxes are configured on the inside to have a very narrow nesting chamber that is designed specifically for the dimensions that turquoise parrots prefer."" Landholders Ms Freckelton and Mr Bray are hopeful they can build on their work with the turquoise parrot to improve their local environment and inspire others. ""We're in the middle of climate change and an extinction crisis, Ms Freckelton said. ""And we've got 333 hectares to make the world a better place, to create places for endangered species and make sure they survive.""

35,Sonar to ping dangerous debris and 'caravans' concealed underwater in Sydney and northern NSW rivers after flooding,environment,"  EPA uses sonar to clean up hazardous debris after New South Wales flooding Crews are relying on soundwaves to find dangerous underwater flood debris in rivers in northern NSW and Sydney. EPA contractors are using sonar technology to find hazardous flood debris in NSW rivers They have started in the Hawkesbury River and will work their way to the Queensland border More than 6,800 cubic metres of flood debris has been removed from shorelines since March The NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has moved into the next phase of this year's flooding clean-up to protect boaties and other water users. Contractors are using sonar technology, which emits pulses of soundwaves to detect submerged objects. The returning echoes create a dataset that can be turned into an image of the debris' shape and size on the riverbed. EPA flood recovery manager Martin Puddey said contractors started using the device mounted on a boat on the Hawkesbury River more than a week ago. ""We're expecting there will be stuff like caravans, really big tree trunks,"" Mr Puddey said. Chemical drums and farming equipment may also be found, based on what has been removed from shores. ""It just depends whether or not it's close enough to the surface to [have an] impact on navigation and human safety [and] that means we need to get it out,"" Mr Puddey said. No hazards have yet been found but he expected that to change. ""There's a lot of anecdotal stuff coming back from the boating safety officers and other people using the river,"" Mr Puddey said. ""Rivers are really dynamic systems. ""Even a small flood or a big tide — stuff moves around. ""I think there is a lot of debris out there."" Mr Puddey said the sonar program was one part of an EPA and NSW government agency effort to secure and mark hazardous debris. Transport for NSW and OceanWatch have collectively identified 13 priority areas in the Hawkesbury. The contractors are surveying those locations with the device until the middle of June, before moving to the North Coast, most likely to the Tweed, Richmond, and Clarence rivers. Mr Puddey said more than 6,800 cubic metres of flood debris has been removed from NSW shorelines since the beginning of March. ""[That's almost] three Olympic swimming pools of debris,"" he said. ""About 5,000 cubic metres of that has just come out of the Hawkesbury.""

36,Hundreds of newly planted trees burnt to the ground in Cairns park,environment,"  Cairns Treeforce won't investigate after hundreds of newly-planted trees set on fire More than 500 trees have been burnt after a fire tore through a recently planted rainforest rehabilitation project in a Cairns suburb. Treeforce organiser Boyd Lenne coordinated the planting efforts, and said they only heard about the fire in Glenoma park in Brinsmead when one of the volunteers went to visit the site and found it destroyed. ""Once it got lit, it moved through the most recent planting because that had the freshest, dried out material for the fire to run through,"" he said. ""Anything that we planted a month earlier had had a lot of rain on it and really broke that guinea grass down into the ground, so it wasn't able to carry a flame."" He said while some plants were saved by fire services, the damage was still significant. ""We're looking at more than $1,000 worth of trees implicated and $2,000 or more in total, if you include the preparation, machinery costs, weed control,"" he said. ""And then on top of that, you've got about 100 volunteer hours that have gone into that site."" Cairns Regional Council's Kristy Vallely was at the planting in late May. She said the fire was incredibly disappointing. ""Totally burnt, to the ground, but we're really hoping that they'll reshoot,"" she said. ""I'm hoping that it was more of a case of someone walking past and seeing it as an opportunity rather than setting out to destroy all these beautiful trees that we had just planted."" Mr Lenne said he thought the fire had probably been deliberately lit but he wasn't going to pursue an investigation. ""I have to assume it's probably younger kids or teenagers. Bored kids often do this sort of thing,"" he said. ""It's just a shame that they would fight against the whole community in that way because these linkages through Freshwater Creek, Goomboora Bike path, Goomboora park, the Rocks, Glenoma Park, that are really the playground of the whole region — all of that was just guinea grass."" He said over the past decade several groups and the council had turned the area around from a ""wasteland"" to a place everyone could enjoy.

37,"'A phenomenal effort': Researchers map habitat of 35,000 species, call for huge land area to be protected",environment," Science More than 40 per cent of Earth's land surface 'must be conserved to maintain biodiversity' More than 40 per cent of the land surface of the Earth needs protecting if we are to maintain current levels of biodiversity on the planet. That's the message from an international team of scientists who released a comprehensive global analysis of animal habitat today in the journal Science. The study, which the authors call a ""conservation plan for the planet"", mapped the distribution of more than 35,000 animal species across the globe and identified the minimum range required to conserve them. The researchers found that a total of 64 million square kilometres, or 44 per cent of the Earth's land surface, needs to be protected from development if we are to halt the current decline in biodiversity. The United Nations Aichi target 11 set out to protect 17 per cent of the planet by 2020. However, this was largely considered insufficient, according to today's report authors. The UN's post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework is currently in development, and will set an interim target for 2030 with the stated aim of ""living in harmony with nature"" by 2050. Today's analysis is one of the most comprehensive of its kind and can help in setting effective conservation targets, according to study co-author, ecologist, and conservation biologist April Reside from the University of Queensland. ""The global debate is coming up over the percentage of the planet that we're gong to protect, and the number that people land on will depend on their criteria [of analysis],"" Dr Reside said. ""This study is one of the more comprehensive because it covers so many species — more than 35,000, which is a phenomenal effort."" While 64 million square kilometres sounds like a huge amount of land, we're not starting from scratch. Researchers mapped how much of that land was intact, already under some form of protection agreement, a key biodiversity area, or in need of further protection. Their results showed that about 70 per cent of the land is already considered ecologically intact and includes large swathes of habitat in regions like Australia's remote interior, Canada, Russia, and Brazil, according to Dr Reside. In essence, that land already functions as habitat today, and, if protected, would not need significant rehabilitation compared to some more degraded areas. ""What's really noteworthy about this story is some of the really intact areas — the really big continuous areas — are in some cases in the wealthier countries like Canada and Australia,"" Dr Reside said. ""They're some countries where we can afford to be conserving these [lands]."" Commemorate World Environment Day on June 5 by going on a ""virtual field trip"" to an Australian town that's been designed around the impacts of climate change and disaster preparedness. But difficulties arise when the rights of people in developing countries to use their land for agriculture or other purposes comes into conflict with the global need for biodiversity conservation. The researchers mapped several scenarios of future development and found that between now and 2030, about 1.3 million square kilometres of intact habitat will be converted to intensive human use in the worst-case scenario. Its conversion from habitat to human use would be ""devastating for wildlife"", they said. Most of this threatened habitat is in developing countries, with Africa the continent with the most intact land at risk of conversion to intensive human use. The researchers note that much of that projected loss is being driven by demand for products in developed countries. According to environmental policy, conservation, and environmental politics researcher Megan Evans from UNSW, who was not involved in the study, the strength of this report is that it has attempted to quantify how global conservation intersects with human populations in these areas. However, she said there were a myriad of equity issues that need to be considered in implementing conservation at this scale. These include the potential for misguided (or mislabeled) sustainable development projects that end up ripping off local people. Some of Australia's iconic and unique natural ecosystems are headed for irreversible damage if we keep emitting carbon at current rates, climate experts warn. But they're not necessarily the ones you might expect. Corporate offsets — where corporations buy and lock up land in developing countries to offset their own impacts elsewhere — can also end up displacing locals. The best thing that wealthier countries such as Australia can do for global conservation is to focus on the impacts of our own industries and habits, Dr Evans said. ""The global north and rich countries like ours need to recognise that we, as wealthy countries, need to pick up our own game and demonstrate good conservation measures. ""Doing things like cutting out fossil fuels subsidies … and stopping trying to offset our activities overseas … we're [offsetting] in lieu of cutting our overconsumption, or cutting our reliance on fossil fuels. ""If we wealthy countries don't walk the talk, then how can we expect other countries to do so?"" While working out how much of the Earth's land surface needs to be conserved is an important conversation we need to have, working out the specific details of what that looks like in each place is where the work needs to be done, according to Steve Hemming from Flinders University's Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and Research. In many instances, it doesn't mean excluding people from using and managing land, and instead means putting a value on the role of indigenous land management, Dr Hemming said. ""Wilderness — that's what colonial powers have assigned to places that seem to them to be uninhabited."" From the Snowy River to Central Australia, respect and connectedness to the land are key Indigenous values. Many ecosystems suffer after people are excluded from them, and in Australia, we're seeing the effects of the forced removal of Indigenous people from country, he said. ""Taking people off country doesn't make country healthy — Indigenous people talk about that — if you take people off country you can see it,"" Dr Hemming said. ""Look at eastern Australia's bushfires; you take people out of the country, they don't manage and burn it, you end up with a system that's out of control. ""Bushfires are an outcome of colonisation and invasion — taking people off country."" And while today's research provides a good scientific framework to be having this conversation, the obstacles are often political, Dr Hemming said. ""Certainly in Australia, working with Indigenous people on environmental management, usually the biggest problem is the politicians. ""If the minister is not very supportive in integrating Indigenous management and the environment … then you've got a real problem."" The study estimated about 1.8 billion people currently live on lands it identified as needing conservation. Dr Reside also said valuing Indigenous land management, both in Australia and internationally, was key to future conservation. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more?

""Given that a lot of these lands are inhabited by people, another good news story is that Indigenous people play a really important role in conservation and they're already protecting so much of our land across the world,"" she said. Beyond intact lands and areas already under some sort of protection, the study identified 12.4 million square kilometres of land scattered across the globe in need of additional measures to stop its degradation. That includes significant patches down Australia's east and west coasts, north-western South America, China, and the United States. Much of that habitat is under threat from agriculture and urban sprawl, Dr Reside says ""The east coast of Australia is a prime example. There's lots of land conversion going on for urban development and agriculture,"" she said. ""You can see similar stories across the equator and Central and South America as well.""

38,'It's a market-wide issue': Eraring power plant running out of coal,environment,"  Australia's biggest power station running out of coal at a time when mine expansion recommended for approval Australia's largest power station, Eraring, is running out of coal to fire its turbines. Origin Energy has told the Australian Stock Exchange its coal stockpiles are running low at its Lake Macquarie plant, north of Sydney. Origin recently revealed Eraring would be closing in 2025, seven years earlier than planned. It said Eraring has been impacted by production constraints at the nearby Mandalong coal mine owned by Centennial Coal. Mandalong provides coal to both Vales Point and Eraring power stations, producing up to 6 million tonnes of coal annually. In an investor briefing after the announcement, coal analyst Rory Simington said he was perplexed by the situation. ""Obviously if Origin needs to source coal from other sources then they are going to have to pay spot prices, which are extremely high at the moment. So that is obviously a financial issue for them."" The ABC has been told no coal was being produced at Mandalong at present, leaving Origin to source it from elsewhere. Coal from the Mandalong mine is transported directly on a conveyer belt to Eraring, making the process quick and efficient. But finding alternate sources has meant getting trains to bring the coal in. Origin has told the ABC that had caused problems, as trains it had commissioned were competing for freight line space against other coal and commuter trains. It also has to pay a spot coal price, which is much higher, impacted heavily by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Origin has a coal stockpile at its Eraring power plant site of up to 1.6 million tonnes. But a source close to the operation has told the ABC that pile was very low. The source said workers were ""scraping up the dregs off the bottom of what's left of the coal stockpile to keep things going"". They added that Origin knew of potential supply problems. ""Origin would have been advised of that well in advance so should have planned for that & increased the coal stockpile."" Origin has confirmed the source's information, adding that trains to Eraring have been bumped in favour of ones travelling to the Port of Newcastle for the lucrative export market. ""It is a market-wide issue, it is not just Eraring, other power stations are affected, and it's just that Origin is saying so publicly,"" the company said. To add to the woes, Centennial is still reeling from an accident that sparked a regulatory investigation at Mandalong last month. Two workers were injured, but the incident has not been linked to supply problems. Centennial Coal said it was continuing to work with all customers to meet its contractual obligations. It said other power plants also had supply issues. At a time when Eraring is experiencing supply issues, there has been optimism in the Upper Hunter where a mine expansion is recommended for approval. MACH Energy wants to expand its Mount Pleasant Coal mine near Muswellbrook to extract an additional 247 million tonnes of coal. It would extend the life of the mine by 22 years up to December 2048. The NSW Planning Department put MACH Energy's plans on public display early last year and attracted 250 submissions. In a letter to the Independent Planning Commission, the Department said due to more than 50 unique objections to the project, it had requested the commission hold a public hearing. Planning officials said they considered the benefits of the project outweighed the costs, and the project was approvable subject to conditions. Want more local news?

39,"It's a clone, and it's massive: World's largest plant found off WA coast",environment," Science World's largest plant discovered right under our noses in Western Australia You'd think that the world's largest plant would stand out like a sore thumb. But researchers have today revealed there's a plant about 4,500 years old and measuring 180 kilometres across living right under our noses in Western Australia. Genetic testing has revealed that what was once thought to be part of a giant seagrass meadow in the shallow waters of Shark Bay, near Carnarvon, was actually a single massive clone of Posidonia australis seagrass. According to the researchers, who published their findings in Proceedings of the Royal Society B today, that makes it the single largest plant known to exist on Earth. ""Certainly by land area, to the best of our knowledge, it is [the largest plant in the world],"" said evolutionary biologist and study co-author Elizabeth Sinclair from the University of Western Australia. ""We were quite surprised when we had a good look at the data and it seemed to indicate that everything belonged to the one plant."" The researchers had initially set out to study how genetically diverse the seagrass meadows were. But they had an inkling that something was slightly off about the seagrass in the area, according to study co-author, ecologist and ecosystem health researcher Martin Breed from Flinders University. ""We were a bit suspicious because the plants around there don't act like normal seagrass,"" Dr Breed said. ""They don't flower as much, don't seed as much, so these signs of reproductive activity were a little bit unremarkable."" But when they took samples from 10 meadows throughout the Shark Bay area, they never expected nine of them to return a genetic match. ""We went in there with no preconceived ideas about finding the biggest plant on Earth,"" Dr Breed said. Instead, they were planning to use their research to inform which plants to use for restoration of the meadows, to help with their resilience against threats like bleaching. ""Our PhD student Jane Edgleloe did the DNA work and we soon realised that it was far more complicated than we were expecting. It blew us away,"" Dr Breed said. Being a clone probably helps to explain why this single plant has been so successful. It is what is referred to as a polyploid, meaning it possesses multiple sets of the same chromosomes, according to Dr Sinclair. ""It's got double the number of chromosomes as Posidonia on the coast,"" she said. ""That one has 20 chromosomes, this one has 40 chromosomes."" Most plant species, as well as humans and most animals, possess single pairs of chromosomes — known as diploidy. The largest organism on earth is a giant underground root system that sends up thousands of genetically identical clone aspen trees. But it's collapsing, according to researchers. Polyploidy in this case has occurred because at some stage, a Posidonia plant has hybridised with another related species. The disadvantage of this is that it is no longer able to reproduce sexually, so doesn't get any genetic variation across generations that might allow it to adapt to changing conditions over time. But the plus side is it possesses double the amount of genetic variability to begin with. ""What that does is double the amount of genetic diversity you have in that plant and probably broadens its capacity to deal with the challenges that come from its environment,"" Dr Sinclair said. While polyploidy can be a disadvantage, the conditions in Shark Bay are extremely variable and having double the chromosomes appears to be paying off for the Posidonia, according to Dr Breed. ""It can be 17 degrees in the water one day and 30 degrees the next and the salinity [varies widely]. The seagrass is able to hold the fort even when you've got massively fluctuating conditions,"" Dr Breed said. ""There was a big heatwave in 2010 -2011 — about a third of seagrasses were knocked off. But [it] bounced back very well."" During the last Ice Age, about 20,000 years ago, Shark Bay was exposed on the continental shelf. But as the ice caps thawed and the oceans rose, it filled in around 8,000 years ago. The researchers hypothesised that there were likely many seagrass plants that colonised the region soon after that. Posidonia australis hybridised and then edged out its competitors, Dr Breed said. ""Historically, there were probably a bunch of these diploid plants and it just so happens with time and survival of the fittest, this one emerged as the dominant plant."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Given the time needed for the plant to clone itself across such a huge expanse, the researchers conservatively estimate it to be at least 4,500 years old. ""The plant has spread over about 200 square kilometres and plants that have the same genetic fingerprint are spread apart by about 180 km,"" Dr Sinclair said. ""We know how fast the oceanic species grow — you take that into account and the fact that the plants don't actually grow in a straight line but they branch, you can get an estimate of about 4,500 years. ""The reason that it's been able to keep growing is that it's largely undisturbed. It's a beautiful world heritage site."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

40,'Anybody with any problems should be weeding': Meet the volunteers tending Brisbane's nature reserves,environment,"  Brisbane's nature reserves in good hands with these earnest volunteers It's a Saturday morning on Brisbane's northside and a small group of women are hard at work among the peaceful trees of Chermside Hills Reserve, pulling out invasive weeds by the handful. The Little Cabbage Tree Creek Bushcare Group is one of about 160 volunteer bushcare groups run Brisbane City Council dotted around the city, keeping Brisbane's native reserves and parks healthy. Serenaded by king parrots, wrens and kookaburras, and watched covertly by the odd wallaby, these volunteers have spent years patiently digging out weeds and caring for the reserve. Over the decades that coordinator Patricia Geue has been volunteering at Chermside Hills Reserve, she has seen the group dwindle to just two people. Now, it's on the up once more, with six volunteers turning up on Saturday. ""We've got to plant what's native to the area, and most of what we're doing is weeding … when people were building there was a lot of rubbish dumped and people still dump a bit of rubbish,"" she said. ""Some of those introduced plants grow like you would not believe."" The group meets every fourth Saturday at Chermside Hills, working for two hours in a labour of love to fight an endless battle against invasive species while nurturing vulnerable natives. Two other long-term volunteers are Val Struthers and Lesley Watson. Both volunteer for several bushcare groups around the area, and have seen the long-term results of their efforts in reams of weed-filled creeks being transformed into clear, fresh bushland. ""The group drifted right down to just Trish and me, and we were coming regularly but we saved some plants which had been planted by the council, I believe — we were pulling water from the creek,"" Ms Struthers said. ""Then came a big flood and washed half of them out. We keep saying it's not gardening, it's just maintenance."" For Ms Struthers, the benefits of volunteering are clear. ""I figure it's better than a nursing home,"" she said. ""First of all it was better than volunteering in a nursing home — now, it's better than living in one. ""Having friends and having conversations, especially when you live alone. You need to get out and speak to people, otherwise you might as well just pop off, which I've got no intention of doing in the near future."" Research from Volunteering Australia shows broad mental health benefits are gained by even short amounts of volunteering, including improved mental wellbeing, improved self-esteem, and strong benefits in mental health recovery. Ms Watson agrees, saying the mental health benefits of both volunteering and being outside in the bush once a month are powerful. Amid the clean-up from flood devastation, Gardening Australia's Costa Georgiadis shares his tips on what to do to bring the garden back to life. ""It's without a doubt the most satisfying thing going, doing this weeding,"" she said. ""Anybody who has got any problems should be weeding. I love it."" Brisbane environment, parks and sustainability chair Tracy Davis said the Habitat Brisbane volunteers had played an important role in restoring and rehabilitating areas affected by the February floods. ""In 2021, Habitat Brisbane volunteers cared for nearly 590 hectares of key waterways and bushland areas across the city and planted more than 72,500 plants. Their efforts are estimated to contribute $2.25 million annually to our city,"" Cr Davis said. ""Habitat Brisbane began in 1990 and now has more than 5,800 active volunteers, which has grown by 10 per cent over the past five years. ""Along with a passion for caring for our natural habitat, people love participating in the program because it builds a strong sense of community, ownership, pride and achievement within their local area."" Down by the creek bank, volunteer Lu Ponton is planting native blue flax lily (Dianella caerulea), propagated from her own native garden at home. ""I walk here quite often. I saw the sign up there … for the bushcare group, so I joined and it was great,"" she said. ""I'm an environmentalist, so I'm a bit conscious about this. I'm concerned about the environment changing and the devastating degradation of the environment."" While Ms Ponton is planting lilies, her fellow volunteer Chloe Parker is crouched beside an old fallen tree pulling out snakeweed, a clumping weed with long roots and stems of blue flowers. Toowoomba's green thumbs are having to find their own ways to adapt to a changing climate. One constant problem is garden escapees; plants sold at hardware stores and nurseries across Brisbane that are dumped or thrown out, quickly embedding themselves in bushland reserves. And for the volunteers it can be disheartening to see months of hard work undone by wild weather, with recent torrents of water dumping fresh armies of invasive plants on carefully weeded creek banks. But it's not always bad news. ""One of the silver linings [of the recent floods], although small, is that the weeds are very easy to get out at the moment, which is very nice because some of them can grow really big with really long roots,"" Ms Parker said. She's looking forward to a project planting native casuarinas and banksias for yellow-tail black cockatoos who regularly visit the reserve, their piercing screeches an unexpected delight. They're one of more than 100 bird species that make the reserve their home. ""It's really important to protect and treasure these sites, because they're so unique and precious,"" Ms Parker said. ""At the end of the two hours you can look back and you can see exactly what you've done. I think that's what's so rewarding about volunteering.""

41,Here's what you need to know about NSW's ban on lightweight plastic bags,environment,"  Single-use plastic bag ban comes into effect in NSW tomorrow You might still have a cupboard or drawer packed full of them — but from tomorrow, the humble lightweight plastic bag will be banned from use in NSW. Single-use plastic bags will be the first plastic item to be phased out in the state this year as part of the NSW government's plan to cut litter and pollution. The government and National Retail Association (NRA) have pledged to work together in assisting business with the transition, and don't expect every store to comply from day one. It is estimated more than 2.7 billion plastic items end up in waterways across NSW each year, and single-use plastic items equate to 60 per cent of the state's litter. Environment Minister James Griffin says it's time to forgo disposable items which provide ""a few convenient moments"" but cause years of environmental fallout. ""We each have the power to make positive environmental change at an individual level, and I encourage everyone to choose to go plastic-free as often as they can,"" he said. In November, the ban will be extended to other single-use plastic items such as cutlery, straws, stirrers, plates, bowls, polystyrene food ware, cotton bud sticks and personal care products containing microplastics. Plastic bags that are 35 microns — about 0.035mm — thick, or less, will be banned from Wednesday. That includes biodegradable and compostable bags falling below the thickness threshold. To put that into perspective, the average human hair is about 70 microns thick. The government says thin compostable or biodegradable bags were also being banned because they don't break down unless treated in an industrial composting facility, creating just as much of a problem as conventional plastic. Businesses caught supplying the banned bags face fines of between $11,000 and $275,000. The government says people who do their shopping at the major grocery and retail stores are unlikely to be affected too much. Bans do not apply to thicker reusable plastic bags, produce bags, waste bags or essential product packaging. That also includes things like dog poo bags, bin liners, medical bags or those thin ones you get your meat in at at the deli. Most bags distributed by major supermarkets and boutique stores are thicker than 35 microns and will be unaffected. Thicker reusable bags such as those made of fabric are, of course, fine to use. The NRA says it has engaged more than 10,000 retailers from across the state and the response to the move has been ""very positive"". ""Retailers and their suppliers are highly supportive of environmental initiatives, with many already phasing out single-use plastics, measuring their carbon footprint and committing to strong packaging and food waste targets,"" chief executive Dominique Lamb said. NRA representatives have been visiting retailers across the state handing out fact sheets and providing support in six different languages. Ms Lamb said it was important shoppers were aware of the change, although she noted there had been a 90 per cent drop in uptake since fees for plastic bags were introduced. ""It's important for shoppers to understand that more sustainable alternatives, like fabric, recycled paper and heavyweight recycled plastic, are more expensive and retailers may need to pass on these costs,"" she said. ""Of course, people can always bring their own alternatives such as reusable bags."" The state's Environment Minister, Mr Griffin, said many businesses had already phased out single-use plastics, but acknowledge this ban will involve a ""significant change"" for some. The government has vowed to support businesses during the transition. One thing the NRA says would help is changing the patchwork of state-based policies into a consistent national framework. ""One of the biggest challenges is that there are five state-based plastic bans just in the last 12 months, and they all have different rules,"" Ms Lamb said. ""Even small businesses have an online presence and it's very hard for them to keep track of so many bans, especially when they each provide different advice."" NSW was the last state to ban lightweight plastic bags, with all other states and territories having already enacted a similar policy. But when its single-use bans are extended in November, NSW will join Queensland and Western Australia as the states furthest along the path to a much less plastic future. Western Australia has already outlawed heavyweight plastic bags and plastic cups or lids. The state will ban coffee cups containing plastics, microbeads, fruit and veggie bags and cotton bud sticks next year. Queensland has proposed to ban those things too but its government has not yet set a date on when those rules would come into effect. This year the ACT will match South Australia in banning lightweight plastic bags, straws, drink strirrers, cutlery and polystyrene food and drink containers. Despite being dubbed Australia's ""most progressive"" state, Victoria has only banned lightweight bags so far and won't expand its list until February 2023. It puts it on par with the Northern Territory and Tasmania to have outlawed thin plastic bags alone.

42,Father-son duo salvage dilapidated boat for 'floating school bus' mission,environment,"  Sunshine Coast father-son duo steer boat from landfill to 'floating school bus' for Vanuatu A dilapidated boat that was taking up too much space in the backyard has taken a Sunshine Coast father-and-son duo on a journey of repurposing the vessel into a ""floating school bus"". The boat had been sitting out the back of their Yandina workshop for years, ""growing plants and taking on water"". But owner Dean Frith and his son Beau said sending it to the landfill was not an option. The pair, who were originally boat builders, had initially considered either breaking it up and disposing of it or turning it back into a functioning boat and selling it. Then Dean had another idea. ""[Dad] was just like, 'Hey, listen, we really believe in recycling and trying to do anything we can to sort of repurpose something ... instead of cutting it up and throwing it away, other people might get way more use out of it,'"" Beau said. ""From that point, I guess, we just chipped away at it over the last 18 months to get it ready."" Beau said the boat would be used to pick up school children from surrounding islands and take them to the boarding school on the island of Aore. But the work in progress — dubbed the floating school bus project — will have benefits for the wider community too. It will also give greater access to travel into the creek systems and other remote areas. ""It will be a multipurpose boat,"" he said. ""The fact [is] that they can get volunteers from the main island out to the school as well as getting building materials and other things they might need on the island."" He said the school's current boat was slower, more suited to transporting larger items and was ""in a bit of a state"". ""It definitely needs a bit of work done to it to be able to get it to the point where it's back to being seaworthy,"" Beau said. ""This thing will be a little bit smaller and more agile and [will have] less draw in the water."" Dean said he volunteered at the boarding school four years ago with another Sunshine Coast group that regularly visited Vanuatu. He hasn't been back since, but said the place and people held a special place in his heart. ""Once you go there, it just gets in your blood. The people are so lovely. They're extremely shy people,"" Dean said. ""It's just the difference you can make in somebody's life by showing them a few things, stuff I take for granted."" The tradesman said sharing those skills with the island community had a huge impact. ""You can show them how to concrete, or put roofing screws in or build a boat — you show them, and they learn so fast, it changes their life,"" he said. Beau said the boat — which he likened to a ""ute"" on water — would be loaded into a shipping container once it was complete. But it won't be the only item shipped off. ""A big part of what we like to do [is] try and give back as much as we can,"" Beau said. ""We want to make sure that we can get as many things into the container as we can."" He said building materials, clothing or anything else of use would be loaded in so the container didn't go over half empty. But he said the finished product could still be a year away. ""It's all really a matter of funding and spare time. That's probably our biggest challenge at the moment,"" Beau said. ""We're just sort of chipping away at it just using spare materials and things that we have available to us, but winter is always a good time for us because it's our slowest period.""

43,Independents warn federal election 'course correction' also message for NSW coalition,environment,"  Regional independents warn NSW Nationals and urban Liberals after federal 'course correction' Independents based in regional New South Wales say there are messages for the state government Nationals and the urban Liberals in the federal election result. South Coast based MLC Justin Field said the outcome of the federal election would force the state election next March to focus on policies the public voted on. ""It's a huge course correction in Australian politics,"" Mr Field said. ""At the top-level Australians do want a better politics, they want a kinder politics, and I was really heartened by the degree to which Australians put climate and the environment at the centre of the message they sent. ""Both major parties will be trying to get their policies prescriptions right to speak to those issues of environment, climate, integrity, women in politics and support for women generally. ""I also wouldn't be surprised if you see more independents candidates not just in Liberal heartland, but taking on some of those Nationals who are holding back policy reform in NSW."" Wagga Wagga independent Joe McGirr said he also saw a cautionary tale. ""I think a lesson for everyone across Australia in this, is how important integrity in government is,"" Dr McGirr said. ""The idea that people accept pork barrelling, that they will brush away allegations that grant schemes weren't administered properly ... I just don't think you can ever take the importance of trust and integrity and local issues too seriously."" In NSW while not losing any seats, the federal Nationals recorded a -1.2 per cent swing against them and received fewer primary votes than the Greens. Lake Macquarie independent Greg Piper said he ""wouldn't dismiss"" a similar trend at the state election. ""I would hazard a guess that people are looking at this relationship between the Liberals and Nationals and how their principles and values pushed by the Nationals don't align,"" Mr Piper said. ""Even though the Nationals seem quite remote they have a huge impact on the functioning of the government."" While all three independents gave credit to Treasurer Matt Kean for his commitment to renewables, Mr Field said voters would be watching to see if the promises made matched what was delivered. ""The state government does have the levers on a lot of this, and climate is a good one. It's all well and good to talk net zero by 2050, but it is the state government approving the coal mines and the land clearing,"" Mr Field said. ""There has been 10 coal and gas projects approved in NSW the last three years alone, all the emissions from them totally offset all the emission wins that Matt Kean's energy reform would have provided."" Want more local news? Sign up to the ABC Illawarra weekly email newsletter In NSW the Nationals control all the natural resources portfolios including the management of native forests and biodiversity. ""The government is resisting pressures to stop logging native forest and critical koala habitat – why is NSW holding on to this?"" Mr Field said. ""Again, the Nationals are holding the Liberal party back and if they are not careful there will be a reaction, not just in Liberal party seats, but in Nationals as well."" Mr Field said the Liberal party had also acquiesced to the Nationals on a review of native vegetation management until after the election. ""It's ticking time bomb for biodiversity."" Dr McGirr said environment planning instruments remain fraught issues. ""In regional areas, there are different views, the Nationals have picked up part of the constituency, but I think there is a growing constituency that would take issues around the environment and put a priority on these,"" he said. Mr Piper said the Mid North Coast has already seen the impact of coalition fallout over koala policy. This election produced the worst result for the combined Liberal and National parties since at least 1949, even if they win all the in-doubt seats they have a chance in. ""That led ultimately to the member for Port Macquarie saying enough is enough I cannot stay with the Nationals while this is the agenda and policy and she left to join the Liberals,"" he said. Leslie Williams defected to the Liberals in September 2020 after the ""politically reckless and unreasonable"" handling of koala policy when then-leader John Barilaro threatened to ""blow up"" the coalition agreement. ""A move I believe will be very well endorsed by her electorate who I don't feel would identify as National party voters, they support the member more than the party,"" Mr Piper said. ""The Nationals shouldn't think the management of natural resources and the contest with the environment in more remote areas is something that people in the cities aren't interested in — they are, they are well educated, and they are engaged with those issues."" In a statement Deputy Premier and Nationals leader Paul Toole said the Nationals were prepared for the challenge. ""The NSW National party is well accustomed to contesting seats against a range of candidates, including Labor, independents, and a variety of minor parties. Ongoing local engagement, and delivering in government for the regions, remains crucial for NSW Nationals' MPs and candidates.""

44,"'That was the first time, as a child, I realised I could make a difference': The young activists leading the climate fight",environment,"  These three young activists are changing the conversation on the climate crisis They're young, they're smart and they're determined to bring the voices of those most affected by the climate crisis to the fore. But climate activists Dr Mya-Rose Craig, Vanessa Nakate and Anjali Sharma have paid a hefty price for speaking up for the environment. Nineteen-year-old UK-based environmentalist and ornithologist Dr Mya-Rose Craig says her activism started before she really knew what activism was. She was 11. ""My family is from Bangladesh and I heard from those sources there'd been this terrible oil spill in the mangrove forest,"" she tells ABC RN's Late Night Live. The oil spill occurred in the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, in 2014. It is a UNESCO world heritage site and home to several endangered species including the Bengal tiger and Irrawaddy dolphin. At the time, local Bangladeshi forest officials labelled the spill catastrophic, so Dr Craig couldn't understand why more people weren't talking about it in the international media. ""I remember as a child just waiting for it to be picked up in the Western news and waiting for the outrage and the upset to happen — and it just didn't,"" she says. Dr Craig took matters into her own hands. Six months earlier, she'd started a blog called Birdgirl. Her parents were avid birdwatchers and had taken her twitching from when she was a few months old. ""Originally, as the title suggests, it was just for me to talk about birds,"" she says. But her blog took off and by the time the Sundarbans oil spill happened, she had a large following. ""It suddenly occurred to me that I had this platform and I could talk about this issue, even if no one else was."" Her blog posts on the issue, as well as articles she wrote for publications like the American Birding Association, helped raise more than $30,000 for the clean-up effort. ""That was the first time, as a child, I realised I could make a difference,"" Dr Craig says. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released in April 2022, says global greenhouse gas emissions must peak before 2025 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Following the report's release, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke of the ""unliveable world"" of our future if the IPCC targets were not met. The 25 year-old Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate has already seen glimpses of what this future looks like. She says many Africans are already suffering the ""devastating impacts"" of climate change. But in Ms Nakate's fight for climate justice, one of her biggest challenges has been trying to be heard. ""While the African continent is on the front lines of the climate crisis, it is not on the front pages of the world's newspapers,"" she says. ""Those who are being impacted the most are those who are least listened to, or who will find themselves removed from certain rooms or certain conversations — or certain pictures."" She speaks from experience. In early 2020, she was cropped from an image of several young European climate activists including Great Thunberg, who had all attended a climate conference in Davos, Switzerland. ""My name and my message were also not included in the article,"" she says. From razor-sharp analysis of current events to the hottest debates in politics, science and culture, Late Night Live puts you in the big picture. ""It felt like a complete erasure of my existence at the press conference, but above all the erasure of my message and my experience when it comes to the climate crisis,"" she says. Ms Nakate says she's not the only one being left out of important conversations. She says, for example, several African climate activists were unable to attend the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) held in Glasgow because they could not access the COVID-19 vaccine. This was despite the British government offering to inoculate conference delegates. Ms Nakate says the West is also largely blind to environmental issues in Africa such as the deforestation of the Congo rainforest, the second largest rainforest in the world and the largest in Africa. During her Save Congo Rainforest campaign, she was struck by how many people didn't even know it existed. The implications of that are inconceivable, she says. ""It's possible for an entire ecosystem to disappear without the whole world knowing it."" Over 75 million people depend on the existence of the Congo rainforest, Ms Nakate says. In fact, it is even more than that. According to the UN, the Congo basin is one of the last regions in the world to absorb more carbon than it emits, meaning its preservation is critical to slowing climate change. For Ms Nakate, the injustice cuts deep, especially given how little African countries contribute to global emissions, which she says is less than four per cent. Dr Craig is also acutely aware of the inequities. She says the domination of white European voices within the youth climate movement is a massive issue. In response, she spent much of her time during the UK lockdown speaking to Indigenous climate activists and people of colour, including Vanessa Nakate, for her book We Have a Dream, which was published in late 2021. She hoped it would amplify and uplift the voices of people that often go unheard. Melbourne-based climate activist and student Anjali Sharma had spent countless climate rallies behind a megaphone before her voice was heard on Australia's biggest stage. In 2020, when she was 16, she was the lead litigant in the successful class action against the federal government and then-environment minister Sussan Ley. In a landmark ruling, the court found the government had a duty of care to protect young Australians from climate change. Although the decision was overturned on appeal, Ms Sharma says it wasn't all for nothing. ""The appeal decision is just as devastating as it was on day one, but I've realised we've come so far. ""We made the Federal Court of Australia accept climate science unequivocally and realise that climate change is becoming an ever-relevant and ever-growing problem that's going to impact young people for many years to come,"" she says. ""And the fact that they were willing to take eight children back to court, that speaks volumes."" Although they've fought hard to be heard, these young activists have found that being the public face of the fight for climate justice has come at a terrible cost. Ms Sharma says, since coming into the spotlight two years ago, she's experienced a torrent of online abuse. Although she has a support team who helps regulate the comments section of social media posts, she says sometimes it's hard to block out. ""It's really hard to ignore the 60 message requests you get after an interview with death threats and rape threats,"" she says. Ms Nakate and Dr Craig have also been attacked online. Ms Nakate says when she first started posting to social media about her climate strikes, people accused her of being a prostitute and seeking male attention using climate activism as a cover. She says her biggest worry was that other young African women would see the comments and decide not to join the fight. ""It's complicated when you're young, but even more complicated when you are a young woman,"" she says. Dr Craig says the abuse highlights why it's so important to recognise the work women do. ""One of the most important things is going to be continuing to highlight the emotional labour of women and how much they give.""

45,Australian study finds microplastics in world's most remote oceans,environment,"  Australian study finds microplastics in world's most remote oceans An Australian man who has circumnavigated the world 11 times in a yacht has used his most recent voyage to collect seawater samples, which scientists now say are proof that microplastics have polluted even the world's most remote oceans. Researchers from Curtin University used samples collected by lone sailor Jon Sanders to develop what they described as the first accurate measure of the presence of microplastics in far-flung ocean environments. ""The aim of the study was to target areas of the world's oceans not previously sampled for microplastics and to produce a complete global snapshot of microplastic distribution,"" Professor Kliti Grice, the lead researcher on the study, said. ""Our analysis found microplastics were present in the vast majority of the waters sampled by Jon, even in very remote ocean areas of the Southern Hemisphere."" Mr Sanders collected hundreds of samples during his expedition, which he completed in January last year, spanning 46,100 kilometres of ocean, including areas that have never been tested for microplastics before. The water-sampling project was initiated by Mr Sanders, who had witnessed the extent of visible plastic pollution during his previous voyages around the world. He wanted to investigate the presence of less-visible microplastics in oceans that had never been tested before. Co-researcher Curtin University's Alan Scarlett told Nadia Mitsopoulos on ABC Radio Perth that previous tests had focused on other parts of the world. ""Most of the scientific voyages have been in the northern hemisphere, off like the UK coast and that sort of thing, so there was hardly any data on the Southern Ocean,"" Dr  Scarlett said. ""So it was actually Jon that came up with this idea. He came to us."" Microplastics come from products such as vehicle tyres, textiles, building debris, cosmetics and packing materials. Some of the particles are as small in width as a human hair. During his 455-day journey on board the Perie Banou II, samples were couriered back to the lab in Western Australia as Mr Sanders stopped at various ports along the way. Mr Scarlett said the average sample taken around the Australian coast detected about 33 particles of microplastics per cubic metre of seawater — which he said was in line with the global average. But the scientists believe their findings may be just the tip of the iceberg, with many fibres that were detected being too small to analyse. Mr Scarlett said other studies also suggested there were far greater numbers of microplastics at a greater depth than was sampled during this study. ""The numbers reported are likely to be an underestimate of the actual number of microplastics present in the oceans,"" he said. Curtin University's analysis of the samples was released on Friday in a report entitled ""Around the Plastic World in 455 Days.""

46,"This Victorian town has planted 100,000 trees in six years — and achieved a global first",environment,"  Shepparton plants largest number of trees for One Tree Per Child initiative, in global milestone Shepparton has reached a global milestone, planting the largest number of trees in the world as part of the One Tree Per Child initiative. Gardening Australia guru Costa Georgiadis was in Shepparton this week to help the city celebrate its 100,000th tree planted for the program. ""I'm blown away by the numbers,"" he said. ""This shows children that their volunteering matters. They're doing something for the next generation. ""It's not just little Shepp. It's big Shepp on the world stage."" The global initiative was co-founded by Olivia Newton-John and John Dee, with the aim of encouraging millions of children to plant trees. Mr Dee said it was ""incredibly exciting"" to see Shepparton reach this milestone. ""The first city in the world to do One Tree Per Child was Bristol in England. They've done 75,000 trees over there,"" he said. ""We never dreamed one single community in regional Australia would be planting 100,000 trees and shrubs and grasses."" Since the project launched in Shepparton in 2016, 33 schools have planted trees at more than 100 sites, with the help of council and landcare groups. ""I actually thought 10,000 [trees] was quite a good aspiration ... it's exceeded our expectations,"" Greater Shepparton City Council Mayor Kim O'Keeffe said. But now they've reached one milestone, they're already planning the next one — another 100,000 trees over the next four years. ""We've proved we can do that, so we're all feeling incredibly excited about the difference that's going to make to our environment,"" Cr O'Keeffe said. The majority of species planted have been Indigenous shrubs and ground covers, largely cleared from the region. These include river red gum, kangaroo grass and emu bush. About 95 per cent of these shrubs survived each year. It was hoped through this planting, woodland species could be restored, providing habitats for native species. ""It's creating a biodiversity corridor to generate more insect life,"" Georgiadis said. ""More insect life feeds the entire ecosystem so there'll be more birds and marsupials. ""This area will be full of life."" Cr O'Keeffe said she now planned to write to mayors across the country, encouraging them to get involved in the initiative. ""I think we should be sharing successes, and it's not just for our region, it's for our state and our country,"" she said.

47,Why scientists put these salamanders in a wind tunnel,environment," Science Salamanders' ability to 'skydive' in California redwood forests discovered by scientists In the crowns of the tallest trees in the world, an amphibian has carved out an unlikely niche. The wandering salamander, more closely related to a frog than the lizards it resembles, feeds on small invertebrates in the canopies of California's giant redwoods, nearly 100 metres above the forest floor. But living so high off the ground comes with a unique set of challenges, not least of which is falling. Rather than clinging on for dear life, scientists have observed the wandering salamander — Aneides vagrans —  leaping from the canopies when disturbed. Now they've figured out how the salamander avoids going splat when it reaches the ground. Finding the answer involved taking a bunch of salamanders from five different species, and a mini wind tunnel — a shrunken version of the type you might see skydivers practising in. The experiment from there, as you can probably imagine, was pretty straightforward — toss the salamanders into the wind tunnel and observe. The wandering salamander, which measures about 10 centimetres from snout to tail, and one other canopy-dwelling species ""parachuted"" in much the same way a skydiver would — spreading their limbs and slowing and controlling their descent. The researchers published their results in Current Biology this week. Although the trick has been observed in some frogs, this is a surprising first for salamanders, according to amphibian expert Jodi Rowley from the Australian Museum and UNSW, who wasn't involved in the research. ""It did surprise me that there was a species of salamander that actually did this,"" Dr Rowley said. ""As far as a I know, the only other species that do this are frogs."" In 2012, Dr Rowley and her colleagues discovered a new species of flying frog in Vietnam — Helen's Tree Frog — which is named after Dr Rowley's mother. ""My colleagues and I discovered Helen's Tree Frog, which is in this small group of crazy flying frogs,"" she said. ""[The frogs have] taken it to another level, they've got these huge parachute feet, they're webbed and they're impressive — they drop out of the trees."" But unlike some frogs, salamanders have no particularly obvious physical adaptations that might help them glide, aside from slightly larger footpads, according to study lead author Christian Brown from the University of South Florida. ""These salamanders were not only able to slow themselves down, but also used fine-scale control in pitch, roll, and yaw to maintain upright body postures, execute banking turns, and glide horizontally,"" he said. ""This level of aerial control was unexpected because these salamanders do not seem to possess conspicuous features for aerial control."" Not only were they able to control their fall, but through subtle movements of their tails and limbs, were able to glide directionally, Mr Brown said. ""Most surprising to us was the exquisite level of control that the more arboreal salamanders had in the vertical wind tunnel,"" the PhD candidate said. ""Wandering salamanders were especially adept and seemed to instinctively deploy skydiving postures upon first contact with the airstream."" The researchers think the salamanders probably use this skill to glide back to their tree trunk, rather than falling all the way to the forest floor below. The salamanders were able to slow their descent by up to 10 per cent. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. In all 45 trials, the wandering salamander was observed to ""parachute"", followed closely by the arboreal salamander, which slowed its descent on 40 of 45 occasions. The arboreal salamander inhabits smaller oak trees. But the ground-dwelling Ensatina salamander showed little propensity for flight, managing to slow its fall on just three occasions. On most occasions, it seemed to ""flail"" its limbs and demonstrated very little control when falling. Given that there are over 7,000 species of amphibian, Dr Rowley said it's a fairly rare trait to have evolved in just a few species. And it's likely the skill was developed the hard way. ""It would be survival pressure,"" Dr Rowley said. ""The salamander that jumped out of the tree and didn't do a good job landing, wouldn't have survived.""

49,analysis: The bad climate action memory that still haunts the Greens more than 10 years on,environment," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Climate change was the defining issue of this election. So what will more ambitious action actually look like? Despite Labor and the Coalition being conspicuously quiet about climate change during the campaign, it was in many ways the defining issue of this historic change of government. Arguably, Anthony Albanese enters government with a bigger mandate on climate than even he intended with a large part of the Coalition's decimation attributable to teal independents running on climate policies more ambitious than Labor's. There were all the signs that 2022 was going to be the climate election. But after similar predictions ahead of the 2019 poll didn't ring true, few were willing to declare that of this year's election before the weekend. According to the ABC's Vote Compass, more people listed climate change as their most important issue this election than any other topic. Amazingly that was true not just overall, but in every single electorate in the country except for two — Longman and Flynn — where it was the second-most mentioned issue after cost of living. And the election results on the weekend speak for themselves. The ""teal wave"" swept the country, ousting moderate Liberal candidates with campaigns that were primarily focused on climate change. The Greens, who have the most ambitious climate policies, look like they could increase their numbers in both houses by about three seats. And even in a seat like Flynn in Queensland — where fossil fuels are big business — there was a 4.3 per cent swing to Labor, indicating more ambitious climate policies did not drive voters away. But now the electorate has made their choice, and voted for more ambitious climate action, what will that look like? There are a few key elements to Labor's platform. The first is Australia's greenhouse gas emission target for 2030. Labor will lift Australia's 2030 target from the Coalition's 26-28 per cent to 43 per cent below 2005 levels. To get there, Labor has promised to implement its Powering Australia plan, which involves three key things: But the big question is whether Labor will feel urged — or even be forced — to take its climate policies further now that the electorate has, in many cases, voted in representatives in parliament who campaigned on stronger climate targets. There is still a chance Labor won't have a majority in the lower house. If that happens, there would be a significant role for the new teal independents before they pass to the Senate. And whatever happens — although Labor has said it won’t be pushed further on climate policy by the crossbench and will stick to its election promises — Labor will likely need to do deals with the Greens and others to get legislation through the Senate. When Greens leader Adam Bandt was asked about how they'll use the party's power in the new parliament, he doesn't focus on domestic emissions targets but on Labor's support for new coal mines that ""stack up environmentally, and then commercially"", as well as for the development of new gas basins like the Beetaloo in the Northern Territory. But the Greens might find themselves in a tricky situation. Memories from the last time Labor was in government haunt the Greens to this day. When the Rudd government tried to introduce its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) in 2009 — a type of emissions trading scheme — it was killed by Greens and the Coalition in the Senate. The Greens' criticism at the time was that the emissions targets in the policy were too weak — a criticism that was backed by some top climate scientists. But the narrative that stuck was simple and effective: the Greens were responsible for Australia's lack of action on climate change. To this day, the Greens argue Labor's policy was bad, and by blocking it, the party was able to work with the Gillard government to introduce a more ambitious Emissions Trading Scheme. But the narrative did damage, and if there's a threat of a similar narrative being weaponised again, will the Greens be neutered of its one key power: the ability to block legislation? Since 2009, public awareness of what's needed to stop climate change has increased dramatically — as has the urgency of action. The Greens would hope to bring the public with them if they find themselves wanting to stop plans they think aren't ambitious enough. And the parliament is very different too. With a swathe of teals in the lower house potentially making similar arguments, the Greens are unlikely to be alone in trying to change the discourse. With more Vote Compass respondents in nearly every seat in the country listing climate change as the most important issue to them, Labor might find negotiating with the climate-focused crossbench is the easiest way forward.

50,Critically endangered monarch butterflies expand toehold in Mexico,environment,"  Researchers buoyed by increased number of critically endangered monarch butterflies in Mexico The critically endangered monarch butterfly grew its presence in Mexico last year, giving a glimmer of hope to researchers who track the fluttering orange and black migrants despite a decades-long population collapse. In one of planet's most epic wildlife migrations, the slow-moving monarch butterflies travel south as far as 4,500 kilometres from spots in Canada and the United States to hunker down for the winter in warmer Mexico, where millions cover entire trees that tourists flock to see. Last winter, the pockets of Mexican forest where the intrepid insects end up each year saw 35 per cent more butterflies than in 2020, according to a study led by the local office of environmental organisation World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Biologists documented the presence of the species in 2.84 hectares last December in the two central Mexican states where they spend the winter, Michoacan and the State of Mexico, up from the 2.1 hectares in December 2020. But that compares to nearly 18.21 hectares of Mexican forest covered with monarch butterflies in the mid-1990s. The race to help the species recover is also tied to the crucial role it plays in the health of interconnected species. Specifically, monarch butterflies boost ecosystems as pollinators, with their migratory journey promoting a wide range of flowering plants as well as helping crops humans tend, WWF Mexico head Jorge Rickards said in a statement accompanying the study. But dire challenges to the butterflies' future persist, including climate change, illegal logging and the growing scarcity of the plant where they lay their eggs. Despite the recent uptick, the population's ""steady decline is worrisome"", the WWF added. The group recommends more scientific monitoring, sustainable tourism and forest management, as well as ""alternative income-generating ventures"" like mushroom production and tree nurseries to help restore the forest and boost local incomes.

51,Traditional owners vow to keep fighting billion-dollar gas project despite losing court battle,environment,"  Traditional owners vow to keep fighting Barossa gas field despite losing South Korean court battle Indigenous traditional owners say they won't give up their opposition to a multi-billion dollar gas project off the coast of Darwin, after losing a court battle in South Korea. Seoul Central District Court has dismissed an application to halt loans for the project Traditional owners say they will look for other avenues to challenge the project Santos says the project will extend Darwin's LNG processing plant by up to 20 years Santos signed off on the $4.7 billion Barossa offshore development last year, which includes a pipeline from a gas field in the Timor Sea to an existing LNG facility on Darwin Harbour. Tiwi Islands and Darwin Larrakia traditional owners had sought to delay the project by seeking an injunction in the Seoul Central District Court, to block loans being sought by Santos's South Korean partner SK E&S. The injunction application was an attempt to stop the Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) and the Korea Trade Group (K-Sure) from providing loans and guarantees of up to $700 million for the project. Larrakia Danggalaba traditional owner and elder Tibby Quall said he was determined not to drop his opposition. ""It's a bit of a disappointment, but it's not over,"" he said. ""We will keep fighting on because we think it's the right thing and it could be disastrous if the development goes ahead."" The NT Environment Centre helped the traditional owners take the court action. Jason Fowler from the centre said he was also disappointed, but not despondent. ""This is one small step in what will be a long battle,"" he said. ""The South Korean government decided that this is a problem for the Australian government to decide upon. ""It couldn't judge whether there would be any damage for Tiwi Islands and Larrakia people from this project."" The traditional owners had argued in the court case that they were not properly consulted about environmental and climate change impacts from the project. Santos predicts that the project, which is to consist of underwater wells, a floating production platform, storage and offloading vessel and the pipeline, will help extend the life of the Darwin LNG processing plant by 20 years. Energy giant Santos will pour $4.7 billion into opening up a new gas field off the coast of Darwin. Mr Quall said he was concerned that marine animals could be harmed by the construction, shipping channel dredging, increased gas ship movements and any spill or accident. ""We weren't consulted about that, no-one approached us, whenever you want to make business you should also consult the traditional owners of the land and the sea country,"" he said. ""You've got crocodiles, turtles, barramundi, there's plenty of species in the harbour that people fish for and that we are worried about."" ""And there are about five major sacred sites in the harbour that haven't been clarified yet. ""One of them, Shell Island, already looks damaged in aerial photos, and there are dreaming tracks in Darwin Harbour, and coming into the harbour like the Old Man Rock."" Santos said it did not want to comment on the court result because the action was aimed at its partner, not Santos. It has previously said that it carried out stakeholder consultations on the project, which Santos hopes will start supplying gas to its Darwin plant within three years. ""As is the case for all of our projects, we undertake consultation with all key stakeholders where they receive detailed information about the project,"" it has previously said. Santos estimates the project will create 600 jobs during construction as well as maintain 350 ongoing jobs in Darwin over the next two decades. Santos has said it plans to minimise climate changing emissions from the project by using carbon capture and storage. It has previously said that it successfully trialled CCS in South Australia's Cooper Basin. However, Mr Fowler was skeptical about whether it had been conducted on this scale. ""Santos hasn't done carbon capture and storage at its existing Bayu Undan field which has 6 per cent of carbon dioxide, whereas this Barossa field has nearly 20 per cent of CO2, the technology is not yet there,"" he said. Mr Quall said the federal election result, in which many voters endorsed stronger action on tackling climate change, suggested that both the Commonwealth and NT Governments should reconsider allowing the Barossa and other similar projects to go ahead. ""Climate change was a big reason for the election result and this development will create more climate change, and changes in our area, the governments should take notice of that,"" he said.

54,Burra's turtles found dead along roads due to creek drainage,environment,"  Burra's turtle population could become endangered without regular creek maintenance, locals fear Murray short-neck turtle and Eastern long-neck turtle populations have suffered heavy casualties in Burra Creek due to frequent water pump malfunctions, locals say. In the past two years, the water pump has broken twice, the first time in December 2020, when a switchboard failed causing the pump to catch fire. Last month, the pump failed again due to a stray current producing electrolysis and corrosion to the pump housing. The water pump's failures have stopped water from flowing into the creek, forcing the eastern long-neck turtles to venture out and look for more water, and ultimately killing the short-neck turtles. Animal rescue officer and ecologist Ruth Norris said she had found turtles wandering through the town. “They’re getting killed on the road. The creek is in the middle of the town, they have nowhere to go so they start walking on the roads and get squashed,” Ms Norris said. “We’ve had one report of a turtle that was run over on purpose. “People pick them up and relocate them, and over the last five years I would say their population has diminished by half. “Water holes that dry too frequently will have no turtles at all and I think Burra could be heading that way which could be disastrous.” She said last time the creek was dry, fish also washed up on the banks. Ms Norris started a Facebook group with the Chair of the Burra Community Management Committee (BCMC), Deb Selway, to spread awareness of the issue. The group has gained more than a hundred members and encourages volunteers to be on the lookout for turtles and temporarily adopt them until water levels return to normal. BCMC asked the council to consider purchasing a back-up pump, so the creek did not dry out again, and to also put a contingency plan in place to ensure the turtles' long-term survival. Goyder Mayor Peter Mattey said the council had replaced the faulty pump and water levels were returning to normal. “The pump has only broken down twice in the last few years,” Mr Mattey said. “The pump won’t receive regular scheduled maintenance but will only be repaired when required. “We plan to drain the creek soon so we can remove the overgrown reeds in the creek."" The Goyder Council also said in a statement that a back-up pump would cost $9,000, which was not considered viable. Ms Norris said the response from the council was not proactive. “If it’s broken twice then it could quite easily happen again,” she said. BCMC hopes to assist to the council with temporarily relocating the turtles once the reed removals begin, expected in January next year.

55,These cattle farmers worry they're in the firing line of the race to renewables,environment,"  NT farmers worried about the race to renewables and lithium exploration in the Top End Shannon and Daniel Tapp bought Spooks Hill station bordering Litchfield National Park near Darwin last year, hoping to get away from mining. Cattle station owners fear environmental impacts from lithium project in the Top End Miner Ragusa Minerals is promising to uphold the highest environmental standards An investigation is underway into allegations of pollution caused by another company at Finniss Lithium Mine ""We have a permanent beautiful spring that flows out of the hills here all year round, we have undulating ridge country, sand, and low lying flats, its just beautiful,"" Ms Tapp said. They sold their property in the Beetaloo Basin because it had been targeted for gas exploration. So Mr and Mrs Tapp were dismayed to have discovered through a newspaper advert that a Perth-based miner, Ragusa Minerals, had applied to explore for lithium on their new property. ""I thought we were going to be nestled in here on freehold land between another cattle station and the national park and that there was no way industry was going to turn up,"" Ms Tapp said. ""I'm just concerned about them coming to make their money and leaving, and leaving me with a mess."" Lithium is a critical mineral that is used to make batteries, and is particularly favoured by electric vehicle manufacturers because it is lightweight. Australia's miners are hot property as global demand for electric vehicles soars. Australia is home to some of the biggest known lithium deposits in the world. However, the push to extract the valuable resource has raised concerns for some Northern Territory pastoralists, including Shannon and Daniel Tapp, about what it would mean for the environment, and their livelihoods. While the gas industry is required to negotiate land access agreements with pastoralists in the Northern Territory to explore, minerals miners are not. Mr Tapp claims that for a relatively small property like theirs, mining impacts could be large. ""These aren't small impacts we're looking at, where potentially a third of our property could be basically under a mine pit,"" he said. ""It's going to disrupt our business."" The lithium exploration application also covers part of neighbouring Hazard Station, which has been in Ms Tapp's family since the 1960s and is now owned by her sister, Casey Townsend. Their father is buried there. ""I'm just gutted, because we've operated for so long without disturbance, if it goes ahead it is just going to disrupt our whole business,"" Ms Townsend said. ""Just coming onto the property with trucks, if gates are left open, it disrupts our breeding program."" The families are particularly concerned about whether mining runoff could pollute the creek, which runs through both stations. ""Because that's my creek where I have to drink from, we've got no other water here,"" Ms Tapp said. ""And if they say they can contain that, in our wet seasons when we sometimes have ten inches of rain, I don't see how they can do that on this country."" The family wanted to see what a lithium mine looked like, so they went to the new Core Lithium Finniss mine nearby in March. They said their concerns increased after discovering what they claim was runoff from the site, which they allege appeared to have reached a creek. The Environment Protection Agency told the ABC that the NT Environment Department is investigating. Core Lithium told the ABC that after receiving complaints in March and April, as the dry season started it carried out water testing which found that the site was not discharging sediment at levels that breached its licence. A new NT mine, Core Lithium, signs a major supply agreement with Tesla. Ragusa Minerals Chairman Jerko Zuvela is hoping to reassure landowners that his company's planned Litchfield Lithium Project will adhere to the highest environmental standards. ""It borders a national park so we've got an extra level of caution and concern,"" he said. ""The tenements, if they are granted, come with a lot of environmental conditions and requirements and obviously we would be following all those."" Mr Zuvela said the company is keen to foster good community relationships. ""We always work closely with the pastoralists to make sure that there's no lasting impacts, or minimal impacts, for the works that you are doing, and make sure that their concerns are mitigated,"" he said. ""If that means modifying exploration practices that is something we can consider. We want to get their approval and consent to do what we're looking to do."" Mr Zuvela said the company has a track record of working with farmers in Western Australia. ""For our Burracoppin Halloysite Project in Western Australia in the wheat sheep belt we were required to get the pastoralists' consent to enter the land and get the mineral rights so we worked with them to get their permission,"" he said. Daniel Tapp is not reassured. ""What we've seen is iron ore mines being approved and then causing damage in the Roper, there is no accountability, and the regulators are basically non existent,"" he said. Mr Tapp said he knows that because the world needs to change over to using renewable energy, more of the metal needed to make batteries and other equipment must be found, and that he could be accused of just not wanting it ""in his own back yard"". ""The industry needs to select areas that are sustainable,"" he said. ""This area here and the area where the Core Lithium Mine is is all swamp and spring country, that's no place for mines, it's just going to leach out into waterways."" ""And we need an overall picture of what this industry will be like when it's fully developed, so we can give informed consent."" The NT Environment Centre's Director, Kirsty Howey, said recent pollution by several NT mines suggests the Government is ill prepared to regulate more. ""At the moment we see that there's over five hundred square kilometres of lithium tenements covering an area which is renowned globally for its beautiful pristine nature,"" she said. Lithium battery developer 3ME is helping big miners switch to electric. ""And the concern is that mining regulation in the Northern Territory is an absolute basket case."" The NT Mines Department has not yet responded to a request for its response. Ms Howey said she realises that more lithium mines will be needed. ""There is no doubt we need to be moving towards renewables from fossil fuel extraction, but we need to make sure that in the move to this mining, that we ensure that these companies and regulators comply with the highest possible environmental standards,"" she said. Ragusa Minerals said it hopes to start exploration drilling within six months, and if it is able to verify that the Litchfield lithium resource is worth mining it hopes to develop a mine within five to seven years. Shannon Tapp said her family is determined to stay put. ""This isn't just an industry to me, it's a life that I am passionate about, and you want to defend it,"" she said.

56,Accused Darwin Harbour polluter loses Supreme Court appeal,environment,"  Developer Michael Anthony who failed to remove construction waste from Darwin Harbour loses Supreme Court appeal A prominent developer who failed to remove thousands of cubic metres of construction waste dumped in Darwin Harbour has lost a Supreme Court bid to avoid a $300,000 fine. Michael Anthony and his company were last year fined $300,000 for failing to comply with pollution abatement notices It was the largest fine of its kind ever handed down in the Local Court Mr Anthony and his company tried to appeal the conviction and fine in the NT Supreme Court In a long-running environmental protection case, Michael Anthony and his company, DWD Project Pty Ltd, were convicted and fined in October last year for intentionally failing to comply with orders from the Northern Territory Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), to clean up pollution at his waterfront property. The court heard evidence EPA officers physically observed significant amounts of material, including steel, concrete blocks, tiles and electric cabling, being bulldozed over the edge of Mr Anthony's premises into the harbour in April 2018. But earlier this year, the developer took his case to the Supreme Court in an attempt to have the conviction thrown out, claiming, in part, the pollution abatement notices were incorrectly worded and the combined $300,000 fine was ""manifestly unreasonable"". Justice John Burns today rejected all eight grounds of appeal filed by Mr Anthony and his company, dismissing his claim. Charges against Mr Anthony and his company have been before the courts for several years, in several long-running prosecutions. In October 2018, January 2019 and June 2020 Mr Anthony and DWD Project Pty Ltd were issued pollution abatement notices by the EPA, requiring the waste and contaminants be removed from the harbour. The NT's Environmental Protection Authority claims thousands of cubic metres of construction waste was illegally buried on Darwin harbour's foreshore. Mr Anthony and his company were later charged with failing to comply with the clean-up notices, as well as separate breaches of the Planning Act and contravening the Waste Management and Pollution Control Act by allegedly dumping the waste. In its judgement dismissing the appeal, the court noted that the EPA alleged that since October 2015, Mr Anthony and his company dumped around 13,430 cubic metres of waste, containing traces of arsenic, copper, PFAS and asbestos, into the Darwin Harbour to increase the size of his waterfront block of land. Justice John Burns's judgement noted that the charges related to the actual alleged dumping, laid in April 2019, are currently before the Darwin Local Court and have not been resolved. Mr Anthony and his company were found guilty in October 2021 of the failure to comply with pollution abatement notices. At the time, the EPA said it was the largest fine of its kind ever handed down in the Local Court. ""This incident was totally avoidable had the company and its sole director complied with accepted industry standards for the disposal and recycling of construction and demolition waste,"" the EPA's Peter Vasal said. Mr Anthony and his company launched an appeal before Justice John Burns, claiming eight reasons why the Local Court decision was incorrect. One of the main issues claimed was the penalties Judge Woodcock imposed were ""manifestly unreasonable"", in part because he had been ""encouraged"" by the Northern Territory planning department. The court heard Mr Anthony was in talks with the Northern Territory Government about his plans to purchase two adjacent blocks of Crown land for development, but that no agreement ever materialised. ""Nothing in that correspondence suggests that the Northern Territory government encouraged DWD, or Mr Anthony, to dump the waste that DWD did on any of the premises,"" Justice Burns wrote in his judgement. Justice Burns also found negotiations had taken place between Mr Anthony and the EPA which ""evidences an unwillingness on the part of the [DWD Project Pty Ltd and Mr Anthony] to undertake the remediation of the premises the [EPA] considers necessary."" The maximum penalty faced by Mr Anthony for failing to abide by the pollution abatement notices was $2.5 million, while his company faced a maximum penalty in excess of $3 million. ""By any measure the penalties imposed by [Judge Woodcock] were moderate,"" Justice Burns found. Mr Anthony and his company also claimed one of the three pollution abatement notices they were issued was worded incorrectly and was therefore invalid. Justice Burns rubbished the claim as 'unsubstantial.' Mr Anthony and DWD Project Pty Ltd will return to the Darwin Local Court at a later date for the other pending charges.

57,"analysis: Bushfires, reef bleaching, animal extinctions — Australia's environment is under threat. But are our politicians paying attention?",environment," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Federal election 2022: Australia's environment is under threat — but are our politicians paying it enough attention? Australia's environment — the places and animals that make the continent unique — has been a conversation point for communities and government in the past few years, but it's had relatively little attention for most of the election campaign. It's hard to forget the devastation wrought in 2020, as the Black Summer bushfires killed or displaced an estimated 3 billion animals, or the impacts this year when the sixth mass bleaching event hit the Great Barrier Reef. Look back at how the 2022 Australian federal election unfolded Koalas were listed as endangered across most of the east coast and we saw warnings that some of our ecosystems are heading for collapse. This all occurred while Australia remained atop an unenviable list, as the nation with the highest mammal extinction rate. It's against this backdrop that the next government will be measured, by those concerned with Australia's environmental standing. Labor has left it until the closing days of the campaign, but has now released an ambitious set of environmental policies, which marks a significant difference from what the Morrison government is offering. Climate change is being buried this election. So we asked some of Australia's leading climate scientists for their verdict on how the major parties' policies stack up. While the Morrison government's platform continues its existing measures, Labor is saying it will also honour those, and increase investment in several of them -- plus it's added a suite of new policies that aim to ease the extinction crisis and make Australia a global leader on environmental issues. Since the Coalition came to power, it has mostly copped criticism from environment groups. According to the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Coalition has cut spending on the environment as a proportion of the total budget by about 40 per cent since 2013. In the case of Australia's action — or inaction — on climate change, the science has something to say, writes Michael Slezak. Perhaps as a result of that funding cut, it has failed to develop recovery plans for more than 200 threatened species — a key mechanism under federal environment law to help reverse the decline of threatened species. And when it commissioned a landmark review into federal environmental laws by former ACCC boss Graham Samuel, Samuel said that if the government didn't implement the key reforms he recommended, it would be accepting ""the continued decline of our iconic places and the extinction of our most threatened plants, animals and ecosystems."" The government did not implement the reforms. Labor had been critical of much of this during its time in opposition but offered little in the way of a concrete alternative until this week. Now, Labor has said it will implement one of the Samuel Review's key reforms — establishing a federal Environmental Protection Agency to ensure compliance with environmental laws. And it has promised a full response to the rest of the review if it wins government. Last week, Labor promised $224.5 million over four years for its Saving Native Species Program,which it says will help clear that backlog of recovery plans, and help reduce the extinction rate in Australia. Combined with Labor's stronger policies on emissions reductions, the policies have won praise from conservation groups. Australian Marine Conservation Society chief executive Darren Kindleysides said that if enacted properly, the policies ""will bring a desperately needed boost to the protection of our oceans and threatened wildlife, which has been hamstrung by outdated and ineffective laws, weak enforcement and poor resourcing"". When a federal EPA has been mooted previously, the idea has been opposed by the mining lobby group, the Minerals Council of Australia, who said it would add to ""red and green tape which delays projects, costs jobs and threatens competitiveness."" When it comes to the Great Barrier Reef, the Morrison government announced in January it would invest a further $1 billion dollars in water quality, reef management and research. That was widely applauded by conservationists, most of whom complained, however, the government was not doing enough about the reef's biggest threat: climate change. Labor says it will continue that funding, and top it up with a further $194.5 million to help restore damaged reefs; to work with farmers to reduce pollution running onto the reef; and for additional research funds for heat-tolerant corals. Among the environmental issues the Morrison government has championed while in office is recycling. It's established a $280 million Recycling Modernisation Fund, trying to kick-start a ""circular economy"" in Australia. Labor is pledging to continue that, and strengthen it with a further $60m, as well as making sure that when the government itself buys things, they are more often made of recycled materials. Both parties are boosting Landcare (which facilitates local groups to help improve the environment) as well as the Indigenous Ranger program. Labor has also announced a $200m plan to improve urban rivers, and a set of initiatives intended to establish Australia as a leading player in international environmental programs and negotiations. The Greens have released a comprehensive environmental policy, which — like Labor — promises a federal Environmental Protection agency. Its plan also includes a target of zero extinctions by 2030, and a $24.5 billion investment over 10 years to restore wildlife habitat and the planting of 2 billion trees by 2030. The party wants to end native forest logging — an industry that has been implicated in increasing bushfire risk and contributing to the decline of threatened species — but which is often supported by Labor and Liberal-National governments. And the Greens have a range of other strong policies including phasing out single-use plastics and expanding Marine Protected Areas. The ""teal"" independents have a range of policies on the environment. They are all campaigning on strong emissions cuts, but many also have policies — which range in terms of detail — aiming to protect habitats and animals. On the other end of the spectrum, One Nation wants Australia to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, build more coal fired power stations and many more dams. It's clear Labor plans to do more than the Coalition to stop extinctions, and protect the places and habitats many Australians value. And, if we wind up with a minority government come Saturday night, odds are both major parties would be pushed for further action by the Greens, or independents on the crossbench.

58,Floating wetland along Yarra River among City of Melbourne's budget pledges,environment,"  Floating wetland along Yarra River among City of Melbourne's 2022 budget pledges City of Melbourne residents can expect to pay increased rates for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, helping to fund the council's proposed redevelopment of the northern bank of the Yarra River, graffiti cleaning and new parklands. It's the first major increase in rates after two years of relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. The draft budget, released today, passes on a 1.75 per cent rate increase, in line with the Victorian government's rate cap. ""Rates are fundamental to keep our city running and operational,"" said Cr Philip Le Liu, who heads up the council's finance portfolio. He said rates discounts of up to $247 would be available for seniors and pensioners. The draft budget also introduces a new annual waste charge for ratepayers, something that the council said was just a new way of reporting waste charges, which were previously included in rates and not an extra cost. The bottom line for the $838 million budget is still in the red because the council is forecasting a deficit of $11.3 million, with the budget expected to return to surplus in 2023-24. Melbourne Lord Mayor Sally Capp said $40 million would be invested in the council's flagship 'Greenline' project. The project aims to transform the northern bank of the Yarra River and eventually create a continuous pathway from Birrarung Marr to the Bolte Bridge. Ms Capp said the first-year works would improve more than 500 metres along the river's edge, including the development of floating wetlands. ""This will bring amazing biodiversity to our river and our riverbank, including insects and birds,"" she said. ""It's going to improve fish life, yes fish life, in the Yarra River."" Elsewhere, the council continues to invest in the Queen Victoria Market renewal project, with an extra $50 million for its next stage. Nearly $30 million will also be spent on graffiti cleaning and city safety, including extra lighting. Ms Capp said police data showed Melbourne was safer than ever but that making sure everyone feels it was a council priority. ""Feedback that we have from visitors, residents and students is that we have got to keep it a top priority and keep our city safe,"" she said. Melbourne is still forecast to become Australia's biggest city despite over 60,000 people leaving during the height of the pandemic — the biggest population drop of any capital city. The city will spend a further $50 million on maintaining public parks and gardens, and creating extra green space in North Melbourne and Southbank. It is hoping to recoup some of its spending through $47 million in extra revenue from parking fines and fees, as visitor numbers to the city increase. ""We anticipate people coming back and, actually, we want people to come back to the city, because the city is so much better when there are more people in it,"" Cr Le Liu said. Residents and businesses will have one month to provide feedback on the draft budget before it goes to a council vote in late June.

59,What happens after sunset? These researchers have found a way to generate solar power at night,environment,"  Australian researchers show solar power can be generated at night It may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Australian researchers have made a major breakthrough in ""night-time solar"" technology. In what they claim is a world first, a team of researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) has demonstrated that solar power can be generated at night. ""In a sense, we've only been dealing with half of the opportunity, when we use photovoltaic solar cells to collect sunlight [during the day],"" project leader Associate Professor Ned Ekins-Daukes tells ABC RN's Drive. So, what's behind this unlikely breakthrough? After the sun sets and the day darkens, Professor Ekins-Daukes says the potential for solar energy well and truly remains. ""We get energy from the sun — it arrives, it warms up the Earth but then the Earth actually radiates the exact same amount of energy back out into space,"" he says. ""As the energy flows from the Earth's surface … [there is a] thermal emission out into the universe that we can tap."" Professor Ekins-Daukes and his team contend that if the flow of this radiant heat could be tapped by a power cell device and converted into electricity, there's ""a large and unused spectrum of potential power to be exploited."" So, in a new study published in ACS Photonics, the team used a thermoradiative diode (a semiconductor sensor found in existing technologies like night-vision goggles) to capture photons leaving Earth along the infrared spectrum and converted them into electricity. ""What you're doing is interrupting that flow of radiant heat, which is released every night out into the universe anyway, and tapping off a little bit of electricity from that,"" Professor Ekins-Daukes says. He says what's ""really exciting"" is the technology ""allows us to generate electricity at night, just from the cold night sky."" Australia is one of the world's biggest adopters of rooftop solar. Since 2001, the number of customers with solar panels has ballooned to more than 3 million. And in 2021, there was a record uptake of more than 3,000MW of rooftop solar installed by Australian householders. Professor Ekins-Daukes stresses this new ""night-time solar"" technology is still very much in its early days. ""We've just demonstrated that this is possible … Right now, the device we've made is relatively low power. [But] this is to be expected when you're at the very early stages,"" he says. The amount of energy produced was only extremely small — roughly equivalent to 1/100,000th of a solar powered cell. But the team argues that it is the ""proof of concept that is big."" ""The question here for the thermoradiative diode is how can we get from this scientific demonstration, through to scaling the manufacturing to a level where we could get the cost down. And that really depends on how engaged industry can be,"" Professor Ekins-Daukes says. ""It will take some time … And I have to be honest, we need to find some new materials to achieve [widespread use]."" But he says, in the future it may be possible to combine photovoltaic devices, or the solar panels widely in use today, and the thermoradiative diode for ""night-time solar"" power. ""You could have a panel that generates power during the day, but then could also power the other items that are still running in your house at night.""

60,Very costly exercise or healing nature: Should this Australian lake be restored to its former glory?,environment,"  Lake Pedder was flooded 50 years ago. Could it be restored to its former glory? In Tasmania's rugged south-west wilderness, set among dramatic mountain scenery, lies one of the most controversial bodies of water in Australia. Lake Pedder was once a natural glacial lake, its dark waters ringed by a distinctive, pink quartzite beach. But in 1972, Tasmania's Hydro Electric Commission (HEC) dammed the Serpentine and Huon rivers, flooding the existing lake, devastating the surrounding ecosystem and creating the body of water that exists today. This decision caused a fierce, years-long environmental battle that would have both national and international consequences. Now, 50 years after the lake's flooding, activists say the time has come to drain the waters and restore Lake Pedder to its former glory. Few Australians have a connection to Lake Pedder like Rima Truchanas. ""From as early as I can remember, Lake Pedder has been part of my life,"" Ms Truchanas tells ABC RN's History Listen. ""[As a child], a few times a year, we'd walk the 17 kilometres into Lake Pedder … I remember wind-sculpted, long flutes of pink sandy beach, extending into the warm, dark tannin waters of the lake, where we played and learned to swim."" In 1967, the HEC announced plans to build a hydro-electric scheme on the Gordon River, which would involve constructing three dams and flooding Lake Pedder. The area around Lake Pedder had been a national park since 1955, but its status was abruptly revoked, with then-Tasmanian Premier Eric Reece saying the park ""wasn't of substantial significance in the scheme of things."" ""The thing that was significant was that we had to double the output of power in this state in 10 years in order [to] supply the demands of industry and the community,"" he said later, in an interview. Some Tasmanians supported the government's plans but others were aghast, including Rima's parents, Olegas and Melva Truchanas. Olegas had migrated to Australia from Lithuania and was working with the HEC. ""By 1968, my parents and others concerned about the fate of Lake Pedder began to mobilise to fight the Hydro's plans. I was only little at the time, but I still remember the excitement of campaign meetings around our kitchen table,"" Ms Truchanas says. As Rima's mother Melva recently recalled: ""In Hobart, we had started a small group which was called the South West Committee, later it became the South West Action Committee as more and more people were joining it."" As the HEC pushed on with its Gordon River dam plans, the fledgling environmental campaigners got creative. ""They organised events and actions to try to inform people about the unique beauty of the lake and the threat that it could be destroyed,"" Ms Truchanas says. Rima's father Olegas was a keen photographer and prepared public slideshow screenings of his photos of Lake Pedder and southwest Tasmania. ""I distinctly remember setting up at the Hobart Town Hall; the enthusiastic crowds; and watching Dad's full-colour images transport the audience,"" Ms Truchanas says. She says her father and another HEC colleague who helped out, Ralph Hope-Johnstone, could have lost their jobs if they'd spoken out directly against the dams. ""So they used art to educate and inform people,"" she says. According to Rima's mother, Melva, this simple idea had a big effect. ""It was a sellout ... and suddenly, the total beauty of the place and what was really being lost was publicly visualised."" At the time, Olegas said ""Lake Pedder is to me the very heart of the southwest."" ""When it is modified … into a large, deep inland sea, it will not be more beautiful. It will be an artificial man-made pond in the middle of the natural wilderness area. It will affect, in my view, the entire atmosphere, the entire make-up of the southwest of Tasmania."" By 1972, the battle over Lake Pedder had reached a crescendo. New and compelling histories from Australia and around the world. Then in September of that year, events took a dark twist. ""A remarkable Pedder campaigner called Brenda Hean was on her way to Canberra in a small aircraft, intending to skywrite 'Save Lake Pedder,'"" Ms Truchanas says. ""Tragically, the plane disappeared en route and mystery still surrounds the suspicious accident."" Ms Truchanas says Ms Hean and pilot Max Price died at a critical point for Lake Pedder. ""Day by day, campaigners watched the lake's pristine beach and the surrounding button grass valleys drown underwater."" That same year, in a last ditch effort to save Lake Pedder, a group of advocates formed the United Tasmania Group or UTG. ""Candidates stood at [that year's] state election specifically on this conservation issue,"" Ms Truchanas says. ""These actions gave birth to the world's first Green party — as UTG became the Tasmanian Greens, which in turn, led to the creation of the national Greens party."" Among those who were fighting to save the lake was former leader of the national Greens party and current co-convenor of the Lake Pedder Restoration Committee, Christine Milne. ""I thought it was a good idea to stop this dam and I was persuaded by the evidence. … [I thought] there's no way this could go ahead. It's an incredibly special place,"" Milne says. ""Well, [the Tasmanian government] didn't do the right thing. They flooded it. And that was when I got to understand the power of the Hydro Electric Commission in Tasmania … I determined then and there that I wouldn't let that happen again."" A young GP in Launceston named Bob Brown also became interested in the fight to save the lake. ""I was very, very shy. I got up to ask a question at a public audience in Launceston, I got halfway through and had to sit down … I couldn't finish the sentence,"" Brown says. He went on to have a career in politics that lasted almost 30 years, which included leading the national Greens party. Ultimately, the environmental activists were not able to stop the HEC's plans. The flooding caused significant environmental damage and led to the extinction of at least two invertebrate animal species. But while the activists lost the battle, the war for Tasmania's environment was only just getting started. Six years after the flooding of Lake Pedder, the HEC announced plans to dam the Franklin River for another hydro scheme. ""Bob Brown, Christine Milne and thousands of others spurred on by what had happened to Pedder began a determined campaign to save this part of southwest Tasmania at all costs,"" Ms Truchanas says. During the five-year Franklin River campaign, many protesters were arrested, including Milne, who ended up in Hobart's Risdon Prison. ""That was an incredibly empowering experience for me, [although] it horrified my parents!"" she says. But this time, the activists were successful. In 1983, a new federal government under Bob Hawke promised to halt the dam. This kickstarted a legal battle between the federal government and the Tasmanian state government. In a landmark decision, the High Court ruled in the federal government's favour and construction was stopped. Brown says the Lake Pedder campaign ""brought Australia into a position, in the intervening 10 years, to have a federal government, empowered through the World Heritage Convention, to save the Franklin."" ""[So] thank you Lake Pedder."" For Greg Lehman, there's often something missing when people talk about Lake Pedder. Professor Lehman is a Palawa man and the Pro Vice Chancellor of Aboriginal Leadership at the University of Tasmania. ""[Fifty years ago], there was no campaign to emphasise the Aboriginal values and the spiritual and cultural and heritage importance of Lake Pedder and so that as a conversation, as a topic, has really been left sleeping,"" he says. ""It's a bit like the lake, that's still sleeping under the flooding waters of the dam."" He says there is ""no doubt that the place was as rich in creation stories and understandings and knowledge that bound people as traditional owners as anywhere else in Tasmania."" He's looking to the future, saying ""I think one of the greatest opportunities for Aboriginal engagement will come in the restoration phase."" In 1995, a federal inquiry found that draining Lake Pedder to restore it to its pre-flooded state was technically feasible. But today's Tasmanian state government says it needs current hydro infrastructure to meet its renewable energy target and that restoring Lake Pedder would be a very costly exercise. Despite this, Christine Milne and the Restore Lake Pedder campaign group feel like the time has finally come. The United Nations has declared the next 10 years as the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, which it calls a ""a global rallying cry to heal our planet."" Member countries can nominate a restoration project and Milne has proposed that the Australian government nominate Lake Pedder. ""Before, you would talk to politicians about [restoring Lake Pedder] and they couldn't see a context for it. Now with the UN Decade … we are going to have to put something on the table for ecosystem restoration. And I am arguing strongly that Lake Pedder is a logical place you would start,"" she says. Bob Brown says there are examples around the world of a project like this, including the ""hugely exciting"" restoration of the Elwha River in the US. ""That's what Lake Pedder's restoration is about — taking action with a view to the future, rather than being bowled out by the horrors of the past,"" he says. Or as Milne puts it: ""The fantastic thing about Lake Pedder is that the people who fought to save it have never given up the hope of restoring it.""

61,This app allows you to find threatened species in your area — and petition your local member,environment," Science Can this app put Australia's biodiversity 'crisis' on the election agenda? Researchers have launched a web-based app that they hope will put Australia's ""threatened species crisis"" at the top of the election agenda. Threatened Australians, which was launched last week, allows users to access a profile of all the threatened species reported to be found — or which were until recently found — in their electorate. For each species that is recorded, there are details on what threats are causing the decline of the animals or plants in the selected electorate, and a ""how to help"" option. That option takes the user to a pre-written email addressed to their local sitting federal member, outlining the steps that member needs to take to strengthen protections for the species at risk. Other ""how to help"" options include connecting with NGOs working on local conservation projects. It's a politically non-partisan approach, which the developers said was born out of a recognition that ""Australian species are in a disastrous state"". App co-developer, conservation scientist James Watson from the University of Queensland, said he also hoped the tool would be used as a source of information for journalists, so that they might interrogate party leaders and environment portfolio holders on their policies. ""An app like this is set up for citizens to ask their member about species in their electorate and what they're going to do to stop them [going extinct],"" Professor Watson said. ""It's also set up for journalists and other stakeholders to ask questions around wildlife — instead of gotcha questions around the inflation rate, I would much rather questions about wildlife in their electorates.""' A number of researchers have been sounding the alarm over the continuing decline of Australia's native wildlife, which Professor Watson said had become much worse over the past decade. ""It's quite remarkable that the only real party talking about these wildlife issues is the Greens — the Opposition isn't bringing this up,"" he said. ""A fair-minded assessment would be that it hasn't been a good decade for wildlife — we've had declines in biodiversity around the country. ""All the science points to the fact that we haven't got a lot of time left — 10 to 20 years and a lot of these species will disappear, [but] there's still a chance it can be on the radar as we head to the polls."" As images of flooding fill our bulletins, it's important to remember that this isn't happening in a vacuum. Extreme weather is going to get more common under climate change. Labor has since announced $224.5 million over forward estimates for a national threatened species program. The Coalition has a Threatened Species Strategy, and committed $100 million to ""protecting Australia's biodiversity"" in the budget. The Threatened Species Index (TSX) is a database set up to measure the relative abundance of Australia's threatened and near-threatened species in order to track the success or failure of conservation efforts. According to the TSX data, on average there has been a steady decline in the relative abundance of birds, mammals and plants listed as threatened, vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered, going back to 1985, which is the earliest year for which they have data. The rate of decline for birds, mammals and plants began to accelerate around the late 1990s to early 2000s. Project manager for the TSX, Geoff Heard from UQ's Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation, said the Millennium Drought was likely the initial cause of that sharp decline in animal abundance. But habitat clearing, climate change, and bushfires combined to continue the downward trajectory long after the drought broke. The TSX is currently compiling its latest datasets, which will bring its measurements up to 2019, and Dr Heard says he thinks the trend of loss will continue. ""Habitat loss and degradation continues to be the main threat in Australia, with climate change coming over the top and [presenting] a more dominant threat over the last 20 years,"" Dr Heard said. ""So I would expect that trend to continue and potentially worsen — it wouldn't surprise me if it's worsened."" The Threatened Australians app developers note that the wildlife records for every electorate may not be perfect, but that they've sourced their data from ""the only current federal data available"", according to a statement on the website. Some of Australia's iconic and unique natural ecosystems are headed for irreversible damage if we keep emitting carbon at current rates, climate experts warn. But they're not necessarily the ones you might expect. One of those data sources — the Atlas of Living Australia — relies on information from citizen scientists reporting their own wildlife sightings. ""We wanted to utilise what is available to the public via the Australian government,"" the developers said. Euan Ritchie, a professor of wildlife ecology and conservation at Deakin University, said that lack of funding for science and the environment was one of the reasons it was difficult to get accurate wildlife distribution data. ""I think there's great potential for a tool like this, so a member of the public can see what species are in their area,"" Professor Ritchie said. ""For so many species, unfortunately, because of lack of funding, we don't have good biodiversity monitoring."" The release of the app comes amid criticism of the government's failure to release the State of the Environment Report before the election. The report, which is a comprehensive five-yearly independent assessment of the state of Australia's environment, was slated to be released early this year. After a review process by scientists last year, it was reportedly given to Environment Minister Sussan Ley last December. Under the Act, the Minister has 15 parliamentary sitting days to release it. The House has sat for 12 days since December. Ms Ley's office did not respond to a number of questions put forward by the ABC. However, an emailed response said that the report would be released ""within the statutory time frame set out under the Act"". Professor Ritchie said Australians had a right to see the report before the election. ""It's the most comprehensive environmental assessment we have,"" Professor Ritchie said. ""We know we're in the middle of this extinction and environmental crisis and Australian voters see climate change and the environment as the most important election issues. ""[They] have a right to see that assessment before they vote."" He says the report will probably tell us what we already know, but insists biodiversity loss should be part of the agenda this election. ""We know species are in trouble and we know the threatened species list is expanding,"" he said. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Professor Watson said releasing the report was crucial to accountability, and that more questions needed to be asked about biodiversity loss during the election campaign. ""It's no wonder that iconic species like the koala and platypus — that people around the world would expect us to be propping up and saving — have been going backward in the last 10 years,"" he said. ""Surely the government should be held to account and asked, 'What are you going to do to change the course for threatened species?'"" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

62,Vote Compass analysis has examined the ‘teal’ vote — here’s what it tells us,environment,"  Climate change cutting across political left-right divide, Vote Compass data shows Concerns over climate change are breaking the traditional left-right political divide and helping drive the ""teal"" vote as conservative voters rebel without having to choose Labor or the Greens, according to Vote Compass analysis. Independent candidates are mounting challenges against sitting MPs in traditionally Liberal-held, wealthy electorates on a platform of climate action. Vote Compass has already told us that more Australians mentioned climate change as their number one issue than any other topic. We have taken Vote Compass data and examined all 151 electorates on the same issue. A higher proportion of voters in Liberal seats like Wentworth, Kooyong, Goldstein and Mackellar listed climate change as their most important issue – above the national mean. ABC election analyst Antony Green said Vote Compass data showed climate change cut across the usual left-right debate. ""If you look at the economy... at one end of the scale, you've got most of the Labor electorates, and at the other end, the Liberal electorates,"" he said. ""When you look at climate change and whether it's important, the electorates are all jumbled up on the same scale. ""You get lots of really strong Liberal urban electorates very high on the issue of climate change, and at the other end of the spectrum you get lots of rural electorates — but you also get lots of urban Labor electorates, which just shows climate change as an issue doesn't run in parallel to normal politics."" Green said this meant candidates like ""teal"" independents — mostly women taking on Coalition MPs in wealthy electorates throughout Australia — had appeal with people who traditionally voted Liberal. ""What's going on in these Liberal electorates where teal independents are doing well is that if Labor or the Greens ran on the climate change agenda in the same way, the voters would still vote Liberal because Liberal voters view Labor and the Greens as having other left-wing views they don't find attractive,"" Green said. ""But for an independent to run on the issue entirely who's got other conservative credentials, then they are more attractive to voters who are traditionally Liberal voters who are attracted to getting a candidate who will do something with climate change."" In Tasmania, the Hobart seat of Clark has been held by independent Andrew Wilkie since 2010. Nyrelle Suhr, casting her vote ahead of May 21, said environment and climate change were among her top issues. ""Economy has a lot to do with it, people are losing their jobs, and COVID-19 has had a lot to do with things,"" she said. Another Clark voter said he was casting his vote based on ""stability in the economy"". ""Somebody who's got an idea of how to actually run this country, not pulling ideas out of a hat that appears to me to be coming forward from one party,"" he said. Teal independents have also been campaigning for a federal anti-corruption commission. The second most salient issue among independent voters was government accountability, with 16 per cent of people saying it was their most important issue this election. In third was the environment, nominated by almost 10 per cent of independent voters.

63,It's a key promise to limit enormous emissions from fracking. But a government email has fuelled concerns it might not happen,environment,"  NT government bureaucrat warns fully implementing fracking recommendation 9.8 could scare off gas industry in confidential email A senior Northern Territory environmental bureaucrat warned that fully implementing a key commitment to limit fracking emissions could scare off the gas industry, confidential government correspondence reveals. The document, obtained by the ABC under Freedom of Information, also warns there might not be enough carbon credits in Australia to offset all emissions from fracking in the Beetaloo Basin. The basin, about 500 kilometres south-east of Darwin, is a large shale gas field that has formed a critical part of the federal government's post-COVID ""gas-led recovery"". When the NT government lifted a ban on fracking in 2018, it agreed to ""seek to ensure"" there would be no net increase in Australia's life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from producing gas, a recommendation known as ""9.8"" in a landmark fracking inquiry. However, in an email from within the NT Department of Environment from March last year to Chief Executive Joanne Townsend, public servant Paul Purdon asks ""how ambitious"" the government wants to be, saying the ""preferred approach"" was to focus on emissions within the NT's control, as well as the net-zero by 2050 target. ""Full implementation of recommendation 9.8 would place the NT at a competitive disadvantage in attracting gas production and related downstream development,"" Mr Purdon writes. In response to questions about the email, an NT government spokeswoman said all public policy advice ""should include analysis of how it applies, intersects or conflicts with other policies and policy commitments"". Environmentalists claim the correspondence raises serious questions. ""It's not appropriate for the environmental regulator to be factoring in questions of whether or not the gas industry is going to appreciate having to offset their emissions,"" Hannah Ekin from the Arid Lands Environment Centre said. ""We see this again and again — [the government] are bending over backwards to facilitate this gas industry, regardless of what the impacts are on our community. The correspondence has escalated long-standing concerns that Recommendation 9.8 to offset emissions could be weakened. The fracking inquiry's recommendation specifically related to limiting life cycle greenhouse gas emissions – that is, all emissions created from the production of gas in the NT as well as its transportation and consumption elsewhere. Politicians, environmentalists, traditional owners and gas company representatives have arrived in Darwin for a public hearing into the Beetaloo Basin. Many of those emissions will occur outside of the Northern Territory, so the inquiry made the Recommendation a responsibility for the Commonwealth government too. The NT government has previously said gas companies will play a significant role too, and it has recently progressed policies that would require companies to use mechanisms like carbon credits to offset their emissions. However, in the email, Mr Purdon wrote that a key question for the government was ""how ambitious [it] wants to be in implementing recommendation 9.8 in the NT itself"". He wrote that one option would be ""to require the offsetting of all production emissions (petroleum companies only)"" and another would be to ""require the offsetting of all production, transportation and consumption emissions in the NT"". He also wrote that it was ""questionable"" whether the national supply of recognised carbon credits would be enough to offset life cycle emissions from NT gas. Mark Ogge, a climate and energy advisor with the Australia Institute and observer in this space, said it was ""absolutely damning that there's not enough offsets in all of Australia to offset the potential emissions from fracking in the Northern Territory."" ""If that's the case and there's not enough offsets, it simply means — if the emissions can't be offset — then fracking shouldn't be able to go ahead,"" he said. Other challenges Mr Purdon listed in the email include: ""The preferred approach to delivering recommendation 9.8 is to focus on the emissions that are in the Territory's control, in the context of the net zero by 2050 target and the pathway required to achieve the target,"" the email said. There is also confusion over the extent of the Morrison government's support for the recommendation. The federal government holds that the fracking inquiry's report was not a report for the Commonwealth, but said it would work with the NT government to honour its commitment. NT Renewables and Energy Minister Eva Lawler has denied the federal government has distanced itself, pointing to a bilateral energy and emissions deal signed last month. ""Recommendation 9.8 means that we all have to work together to achieve that recommendation,"" she said. She said her government had taken many steps to achieve the recommendation, including progressing emissions offsets policies which require companies to address climate change. Ms Ekin from the Arid Lands Environment Centre said she was concerned the government's focus was shifting to its broader target of net zero emissions by 2050. But she said failing to honour the commitment before production begins could call ""into question the viability of living in the Top End of Australia into the future"". ""We think everything needs to be done to prevent out-of-control climate change — the stakes are that high,"" she said.

64,"Wombat Forest clean-up makes more mess, activists say",environment,"  Wombat Forest salvage logging continues after Game Management Authority removes protesters The removal of logs felled by last year's ferocious storm through Victoria's central highlands has resumed in the Wombat Forest after protesters were removed from the worksite. Storms in June 2021 felled countless trees in parts of the Wombat Forest Vic Forest has employed contractors to clear fallen logs near Babbington Hill in the Wombat Forest Wombat Forestcare says removing the logs is unnecessary and is causing more damage to the environment Logging contractors were not impeded by local environmentalists from the Wombat Forestcare group on Wednesday, although several of the protestors continued to monitor the clearing work from a nearby road. The contractors and the protesters have accused each other of threatening behaviour during the dispute. Contractor Jim Greenwood said his team of four workers was employed by Vic Forest to remove the logs through 120ha of the forest at Babbington Hill. He said it came at the request of the commercial arm of the Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation. He said activists from Wombat Forest Care had not interrupted their work since Game Management Authority staff had intervened. ""It's the first time (the work has not been interrupted) for days,"" Mr Greenwood said. ""Overall, it's not real good: the interaction between the workers and protesters."" Wombat Forestcare spokesperson Gayle Osborne said her group was protesting the damage that was being caused by the group. ""This is meant to be a national park, and promised to be a national park, and now we are seeing this massive destruction of the area,"" she said. She said contractors had cleared nearly a hectare of standing trees to create a ""massive"" log landing that could fit two B-double trucks and machinery. ""They have compacted the soil and created large tracks through the forest,"" Ms Osborne said. Ms Osborne conceded the logs could not be removed without causing damage, however she said removing the logs was unnecessary because they did not present a fire risk. She said the logs needed to stay on the ground to provide future natural habitat. ""Some of the tracks are close to trees that survived the storm, which are home to threatened greater gliders, and have now been weakened to the extent they may fall anyway,"" Ms Osborne said. ""There's also a wedge-tailed eagle nest on the hill and the machinery has been working illegally too close to that."" Mr Greenwood said there had been additional damage to parts of the forest as the contractors removed the fallen logs. ""We can only do what we can but it's impossible to do no damage,"" he said. ""But we certainly aren't going out of our way to do more (damage) and we are not taking anything out that was not already damaged."" He said survey work had been done to protect threatened species. ""We have a tablet which tells us the areas we are not allowed in, and it's not just about the animals,"" he said. ""There are areas we are not allowed in because of a type of daisy."" Mr Greenwood said protesters were risking their lives by entering the work area. ""Three walked in other day just before dark,"" he said. ""They were all in grey and black clothing and you couldn barely see them."" He said he told the protesters whould have a vest on so workers could see them and they had taken that on board. ""It's about making sure no one gets hurt,"" he said. ""If I am lifting and moving a log that weighs 10 to 12 tonnes, I cannot just stop. ""They don't realise the danger they are in. It's crazy.""

65,"Western Australia gets its first real rain of the season, but it's too late for many sun-scorched plant",environment,"  Half of Western Australia forecast to get rain over the next two days in first decent falls of the season Parts of Western Australia are being warned to brace for heavy rain and damaging winds from this evening, as two systems combine to bring a blast of wintry weather to half of the state. Already on Thursday, rain totals of up to 60 millimetres have been recorded through west-coastal and south-western parts of the state. A road weather warning is in place for people in Perth. A severe weather warning has been issued for people in parts of the Central West, Gascoyne, and Pilbara for damaging winds up to 90 kilometres an hour and heavy rainfall, likely to develop from early afternoon near the coast. Six hourly totals between 60 and 90 mm are possible, and isolated falls of 100 to 150mm are possible in the north-west, including Exmouth and Onslow, according to the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). A separate warning has been issued for people on the south coast, from Augusta to Hopetoun, for damaging winds up to 90 kilometres an hour. Western Australia is being hit by its first significant rain of the season, bringing crucial falls to crops and sun-scorched forests in the south-west of the state. About half of the state is forecast to receive rain over the next two days, with showers extending from the West Pilbara to Eucla. BOM duty forecaster Jessica Lingard said today would be the main event. The south-west land division, including Perth, is expected to receive the highest rainfall totals between 20 and 50 millimetres from yesterday to Friday. Agricultural areas may receive between 10 and 30 millimetres and isolated falls of up to 80 millimetres are possible near coastal parts of the state. Most of the rain will fall on Thursday, with showers easing in the South West on Friday, but continuing in northern and eastern regions until Saturday. A dangerous swell of between five and eight metres is also expected to kick between Shark Bay and Israelite Bay from Thursday night and into Friday. Tides may also be higher than normal. Ms Lingard said the rain was being driven by a combination of a cold front and a moisture-laden cloud band extending from an ex-tropical cyclone. ""We had those three cold fronts that moved through in quick succession a couple of weeks ago, but they didn't bring much rainfall and they didn't push very far inland,"" she said. ""So this is sort of the first significant system that's moving decently over the agricultural areas."" After a scorching hot summer, which broke several heat records, including the hottest summer on record for Perth, it will be a much-needed break for the region. Murdoch University lecturer in environmental and conservation sciences Joe Fontaine said while some deeper-rooted plants had been shielded by a soaking wet winter in 2021, the intense heat had taken its toll. ""What we've been seeing in parts of the northern jarrah forest is that sites with a little less water for plants have begun to die,"" he said. ""Shrubs, which are the most shallow rooted plants, have begun to die, and in other places trees on a shallower rooted soil have begun to die back."" He said some plants would not recover, but there was still hope for others and the coming rain would be vital. ""So you can imagine, it's like running a marathon every summer for these plants,"" he said. ""The deeper you go into autumn without significant rainfall, the greater the likelihood that those plants don't make it over the finish line. ""So a good season break like this, that will dump 15 to 30mm of rain, is quite important."" Farmers in the Great Southern who have planted their grain crop for the year also have their hopes pinned on the rainfall. So far autumn rainfall has been mixed across the state. While the south coast, parts of the central west and Gascoyne are slightly above average, Perth, the Great Southern and the South West have had average to below-average rainfall. Tarin Rock grain farmer Ed Naisbitt told the WA Country Hour they had not had decent rainfall in over a month. ""The leaves are wilted and are hanging limp, and it's quite obvious that there's moisture stress, so under those situations they're not going to be growing vigorously. ""Looking at them probably just makes the person stressed. ""So you just cross you fingers and hope the rain will come."" He said they were hoping for another 25mm of rain. Agricultural areas are forecast to get between 10 and 30mm, according to the bureau. Current climate outlooks suggest it is going to be a wet winter for most of Australia, except for the south-west corner of WA, which has an equal chance of receiving an above or below-average rainfall. There are also early indications a negative Indian Ocean Dipole phase may develop in the coming months, however, the bureau notes the accuracy of outlooks at this time of year are low and should be viewed with caution. A negative Indian Ocean Dipole typically increases the chances of above-average winter and spring rainfall for much of Australia. Its influence is generally minimal for south-west WA, but it did play a role in Perth's wettest July in decades in 2021.

66,How do the climate policies of the three major parties stack up? We asked some experts to rank them,environment," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Climate change is being buried this election. We asked scientists to rate the major parties' policies You'd think the government and opposition would be keen to focus on the number-one issue for voters this election campaign. Yet if 2019 was the climate change election, 2022 is shaping up to be the don't-talk-about-climate-change election. Despite climate change topping voters' (29 per cent) list of concerns, both the Labor Party and LNP have been avoiding it like the plague. While that might suit them — given the perceived divisiveness of the issue among some of their prospective supporter bases — it leaves many climate-concerned voters with very little to go on. So, we've asked some Australian climate scientists, all of them IPCC-contributing authors, to take a look at the climate policies of the Coalition, Labor and the Greens, and give you a breakdown of how each major party's climate policies stack up. Responses have been trimmed for brevity, and omitted where they have doubled up. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese gear up for the third and final leaders' debate. The Liberal Party policy includes net-zero by 2050 and a 2030 emissions reduction target of 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels, though they say we're on track for higher than that. Their Long-term Emissions Reduction Plan includes such focuses as clean energy technology, carbon capture and storage, and investment in emerging technologies like low-emissions cement and agriculture. It's a ""clear plan"" for achieving net-zero by 2050, according to a statement on Scott Morrison's website, that will ""deliver results through technology not taxes"". The Labor Party policy includes a net-zero target by 2050 and a 2030 emissions reduction target of 43 per cent on 2005 levels. Their Powering Australia plan includes a national electric vehicle strategy, electricity grid upgrades, and investment in green manufacturing. Their plan will ""prioritise growth and investment for the regions"" according to the ALP website, while delivering Australian business ""certainty"". The Greens policy is to reach net-zero by 2035. Their focus includes clean energy generation and a transition away from coal and gas by 2030. Their Powering Past Coal and Gas plan outlines EV and green industry strategies, and includes ending fossil fuel subsidies and closing tax loopholes. Their plan will ""create hundreds of thousands of jobs, bring electricity costs down, and drive our economy into the future"", according to their website. The ABC put a set of four questions to each of the scientists. They were first sent on April 27, so some answers may pertain to policies current as of that date, regardless of subsequent updates. Peter Newman — no ""This policy is not seriously ensuring the transition begins immediately and leads to interim targets that are achievable, and hence could lead to net-zero by 2050. [That is what is needed to] keep us within reach of the 1.5C target. The work on hydrogen hubs may be the best thing the Liberals have done, but does not appear in the policy, so it doesn't seem a serious exercise. The assessment here is based on what is provided as the Liberal Policy for Environment. However, it does not set out many of the activities already underway and/or committed and in budgets. This means it seems to be lacking substance … [and] the public have only this very simplistic list of ideas."" Lesley Hughes — far from it ""If every country was to follow Australia's lead on climate, the world would be headed for warming in excess of 3C and even up to 4C. At 3C or 4C … Black Summer will be considered a cool year. Really, if we are to have any chance of limiting warming to 1.5C, Australia needs to be aiming high, and setting a target to cut emissions by 74 per cent by 2030 and getting to net-zero emissions by 2035. This is the target recommended last year by an independent Climate Targets Panel…"" Nerilie Abram — wildly inconsistent ""To limit warming to 1.5 degrees requires Australia's emissions to be cut by 74 per cent by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2035. The current Liberal Party policy would have used up our entire remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5 degrees before we even get to 2030."" Peter Newman — the best thing yet ""This policy is the best thing yet we have seen in Australian politics to get us to being a good global citizen that abides by its Paris commitments. An ALP government could take these commitments to the next UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] conference in Egypt in December and show they have ratcheted up their level of commitment with a clear set of strategies behind them."" Nerilie Abram — no ""It increases the ambition of Australia's 2030 emission reduction target to 43 per cent, which is a substantial improvement on the Liberal Party target, but isn't the 50-74 per cent reduction that Australia needs to make by 2030 to play our part in meeting the Paris Agreement."" Andy Pitman — 1.5C virtually impossible Professor Pitman gave the same response to this question for all parties. He said that he believes limiting warming to 1.5C is now ""virtually impossible"". ""Any party that commits to limiting warming to 1.5C needs to explain how [they will do it]. It would require overshoot and active removal of carbon from the atmosphere which is subject to multiple technical and feasibility constraints."" Peter Newman — yes, but ... ""Yes in theory, but not in practice. Paris requires commitments to go beyond targets by having detailed strategies of how to achieve them. These strategies are good ideas, but [need to be] linked into detailed modeling that relates to delivery."" Lesley Hughes — yes ""Yes, this policy does meet that goal. It is the only policy from a major party that matches the scale and pace of action the climate science demands. Any shot at limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius requires drawing down significant amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The Greens' plan recognises this, and proposes achieving 100 million tonnes of 'negative emissions' by 2040, although it does not elaborate on how this will be achieved."" Nerilie Abram — yes ""The policy of the Greens is consistent with the scientific evidence for the scale and speed of emission reductions needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees."" Lesley Hughes — no confidence ""To be frank, we have no confidence whatsoever in the LNP's Net Zero by 2050 plan. It may as well have been written in crayon. Remarkably, the Liberal-National Government's own modeling for this does not get Australia to net-zero by 2050. It is, in fact, only a little more than half by 2050."" Nerilie Abram — no confidence ""Their plan for net-zero relies on untenable assumptions of greenhouse gas removal and doesn't actually even get to zero by 2050."" Andy Pitman — not enough information to assess ""That is very hard to assess because there are no intermediate targets. Given it is not ""the Liberal Party"" that is central here, rather it is the Coalition, and given statements from some in the Coalition, I would prefer to see a legislated 2035 target from which to build."" Peter Newman — confident ""The modeling by Reputex [energy research company] in the ALP policy seems very credible and traces each policy into a quantitative delivery of 43 per cent greenhouse gas reduction by 2030, based on conservative and well-researched assumptions. These early interventions are the most important part of the transition to 2050, as once they are underway they take off."" Lesley Hughes — confident ""First of all, the modeling Labor has used is robust and it checks out. So I can say with confidence that the 2030 target in the ALP plan has set Australia on a path to achieve net-zero in 2050."" Andy Pitman — low confidence ""I think net-zero is hugely challenging to achieve and some of the strategies are less likely to deliver emission reductions than I think the ALP hope. However, they have set a target for 2030 which I think is important as it … allows an evaluation of how they are tracking."" NB. The Greens consider net-zero by 2050 a ""death sentence"" and aim to reach net-zero by 2035 or sooner. Some of the responses below relate to the Greens' aim of net-zero by 2035. Peter Newman — low confidence in net-zero by 2035 ""[I'm] not sure they can get to 100 per cent by 2035. This is a serious plan which is quantified and costed with jobs and greenhouse gas savings clearly assigned in each state. The need to make such policies become real and deliverable begins with good modeling and then has to bring all the states. This is hard to see in the document."" Nerilie Abram — low confidence in net-zero by 2035 ""I don't doubt the ambition of the Greens, and their aim for net-zero by 2035 is science based. But net-zero is a hugely challenging target that we don't yet have the technical capability to achieve, and this plan doesn't lay out the detail for how Australia will reach [it]."" Andy Pitman — moderately confident in net-zero by 2050 ""The Greens' climate policies are consistent with what scientists have been saying for a long time. If implemented, I think this would get Australia close to net-zero by 2050."" Peter Newman — not serious ""Not serious and lacking detail even on their best projects being announced. Obviously, they are divided and unable to make a serious contribution."" Lesley Hughes — not an effective climate policy ""The Morrison government's climate policy can be summarised pretty quickly and simply really, in that the Morrison government has no effective federal climate policy. [They] are actively supporting the expansion of fossil fuel production while at the same time banking on … technology that may or may not materialise sometime in the next three decades to solve the greatest threat of our time: climate change. That's a hell of a gamble."" Nerilie Abram — lacks ambition ""It has lots of catchphrases designed to make it seem like they are doing enough, but it lacks any real ambition and is not based on the scientific evidence."" Andy Pitman — difficult to assess without targets ""A 2035 target should be part of the equation in my view, and without that target, the viability of the Liberal strategies is difficult to assess."" Peter Newman — a solid start ""A very solid start with the potential to make a real difference. There is confidence in this climate policy as it's been taken seriously with a very good quantitative basis to the next steps, which can put us clearly into being Paris-compliant. There could be much more of a target, but it's still up there with most progressive nations."" Lesley Hughes — a good start ""It's a good start, but it could certainly be more ambitious. Under the ALP plan, renewable energy (like solar and wind) is expected to power 82 per cent of our electricity needs by 2030. So there's a focus on transitioning the grid to renewables. Notably, the modeling will lead to significant jobs growth and private investment."" Nerilie Abram — promising elements ""This policy has some very promising elements, including a strong focus on emission reductions this decade … that is certainly what is needed if we are going to tackle the climate change problem."" Andy Pitman — not particularly ambitious but … ""It balances what is electorally palatable with meeting the 2C limit under Paris. It is not particularly ambitious but, given where we are, it is probably about as ambitious as can be achieved without a very great deal of courage."" Peter Newman — strong, though lacking sophistication ""This has a series of policies for adaptation and mitigation that are quantified, though not with the sophistication of the Reputex [ALP] modelling. It shows how they will reach 100 per cent by 2035 and then by 2050, it goes into negative emissions by regenerating the landscape with carbon farming. However, it is not modelled showing delivery. It is simply straight lines from now to a precipitous drop to 100 per cent in the next 12 years. They have some transport policies including public transport, but in the end, they are focused on decarbonising power.

It's ambitious and it takes tangible and urgent steps to reduce emissions quickly and to rewire and electrify Australia. It would also see big polluters having to pay for the damage caused by their emissions contributions. However, it does have some gaps: it does not cover Australia's responsibility to support vulnerable communities abroad with adapting to the impacts of climate change. The plan could also be strengthened with clearer steps and targets for phasing out gas production and exports from Australia.""

67,Repeated mass emperor penguin chick deaths prompt dire climate change warning,environment,"  Emperor penguin at serious risk of extinction due to climate change The emperor penguin is at severe risk of extinction in the next 30 to 40 years as a result of climate change, according to research by the Argentine Antarctic Institute (IAA). The emperor, the world's largest penguin and one of only two penguin species endemic to Antarctica, gives birth during the Antarctic winter and requires solid sea ice from April through to December to nest fledgling chicks. If the sea freezes later or melts prematurely, the emperor family cannot complete its reproductive cycle. ""If the water reaches the newborn penguins, which are not ready to swim and do not have waterproof plumage, they die of the cold and drown,"" said biologist Marcela Libertelli, who has studied 15,000 penguins across two colonies in Antarctica at the IAA. This has happened at the Halley Bay colony in the Weddell Sea, the second-largest Emperor penguin colony, where for three years all the chicks died. Every August, in the middle of the southern hemisphere winter, Dr Libertelli and other scientists at Argentina's Marambio Base in Antarctica travel 65 km each day by motorbike in temperatures as low as -40 degrees Celsius to reach the nearest Emperor penguin colony. Once there, they count, weigh, and measure the chicks, gather geographical coordinates, and take blood samples. They also conduct aerial analysis. The scientists' findings point to a grim future for the species if climate change is not mitigated. ""[Climate] projections suggest that the colonies that are located between latitudes 60 and 70 degrees [south] will disappear in the next few decades; that is, in the next 30, 40 years,"" Dr Libertelli said. The emperor's unique features include the longest reproductive cycle among penguins. After a chick is born, one parent continues carrying it between its legs for warmth until it develops its final plumage. ""The disappearance of any species is a tragedy for the planet. Whether small or large, plant or animal — it doesn't matter. It's a loss for biodiversity,"" Dr Libertelli said. Global warming is already changing the world before our eyes — let's see what has happened in your lifetime. The emperor penguin's disappearance could have a dramatic impact throughout Antarctica, an extreme environment where food chains have fewer members and fewer links, Dr Libertelli said. In early April, the World Meteorological Organization warned of ""increasingly extreme temperatures coupled with unusual rainfall and ice melting in Antarctica"" — a ""worrying trend"", said Dr Libertelli, with Antarctic ice sheets depleting since at least 1999. The rise of tourism and fishing in Antarctica have also put the emperor's future at risk by affecting krill, one of the main sources of food for penguins and other species. ""Tourist boats often have various negative effects on Antarctica, as do the fisheries,"" Dr Libertelli said. ""It is important that there is greater control and that we think about the future.""

68,Proof's in the paddocks as young family breathes life into 'tired' property,environment,"  Permaculture principles help young SA family regenerate sustainable dream property Joel Catchlove and Sophie Green were focused on regeneration when they bought 19ha of hilltop grazing land on South Australia's Fleurieu Peninsula in 2012. They had spent years looking for the right property to apply their permaculture knowledge before finding what would become Yarnauwi, a small, scenic farm near Second Valley, about 80km south of Adelaide. Mr Catchlove, who had completed a permaculture design certificate at South Australian permaculture farm The Food Forest, said they arrived with ""90 per cent ignorance and 10 per cent masochism"". ""We had always had this sense of wanting to develop a small scale, regenerative vision for how you might regenerate a patch of land, but also be somewhat self-reliant with the community around you in terms of food and fuel,"" he said. They had a mammoth task of applying permaculture principles to manage a plot of rural land that had been cultivated for cattle, sheep and hay for 170 years. Mr Catchlove said he learned the difference very quickly having come from an urban context where the scale was different and people were used to being able to control a lot of elements. ""Things look a bit dry? You water them,"" Mr Catchlove said. ""Whereas we came here and suddenly there's everything going on — sinkholes forming, there's gullies, huge amounts of kangaroos. ""So there were all these things that were suddenly beyond our control."" With their children, Annika and Asher, Mr Catchlove and and Ms Green focused on a couple of influential permaculture ideas as they began work. The ""big one"" was about observing and recording. Mr Catchlove said it was about spending time learning about the unique capacities and limitations of their patch of land. It involved a stream of constant questions about what was happening with the soil, fungi, plants, weather and animals. Another is the idea of ""zoning"" the property by fencing it into different areas depending on the amount of energy they would need, such as house versus habitat zones. They also asked Adelaide University's Indigenous language group Kaurna Warra Pintyanthi for a property name and were granted Yarnauwi — meaning ""bald hills"". It was also a nod to nearby gathering place Yarnauwingga — to acknowledge the Kaurna people's cultural connection to the area. ""Part of the observe and interact thing for us has been about understanding the history and getting a sense of First Nations uses, but also how it's evolved over time, what the impacts have been of colonisation, and therefore [asking], 'What do we need to do to kind of help the landscape function?',"" Joel said. The proof is in the paddocks — after a decade of Joel's and Sophie's efforts, Yarnauwi is visibly thriving. Almost 8,000 trees have been planted on the property with the help of friends, family and neighbours to draw back local fauna. ""Rebuilding habitat has always been a really big motivator for us,"" Mr Catchlove said. ""When you see this landscape, it's been cleared for a long, long time and we really wanted to see, particularly, woodland birds come back. ""In the last couple of years, we've started seeing a number of those woodlands starting to return, which is really pleasing."" The Food Forest co-founder Graham Brookman said the permaculture movement hade gained traction internationally over the past 35 years. ""I think that the concept of sustainable living has exploded and permaculture is just one part of that,"" he said. ""Permaculture gives you the whole picture and I think that's why it's such a brilliant kind of philosophy — it's not aligned with any religious things, so it can be taught and accepted worldwide, and it doesn't have any particular political affiliation. ""All it's asking people to do is really respect the planet, and here are some really great tools for doing it, whether you live in a city, in the country or wherever."" Mr Brookman said permaculture would only continue to grow as climate change affected farming practices, fertiliser prices rose and the world faced a potential food crisis. ""The nurseries have not been able to keep up with the demand for seedlings and seeds,"" Mr Brookman said. ""If you look at our local Mitre 10, it's got more organic fertilisers there than you can shake a stick at. ""So this stuff is happening. Whether people use the word permaculture or not is sort of beside the point, as long as one way or another they get that idea of holistic decision making through their heads.""

69,Rare May fires driven by 'violent winds' in Siberia kill at least 10,environment,"  Rare May fires break out in Siberia, killing at least 10 Fires that have broken out across south-western Siberia have killed at least 10 people and damaged hundreds of buildings, according to local authorities. Hundreds of firefighters are trying to contain the blazes, which are a rare occurrence in the region during May and have been fuelled by a lack of rain and fierce winds, they said. In the Krasnoyarsk region, at least five people lost their lives in the fires, which damaged about 450 homes, the local authorities said, declaring a state of emergency. In the Kemerovo region, three people were found dead in a burnt home. In the Omsk region, two people died. ""Extinguishing [the fires] is being complicated by meteorological conditions. Violent winds are fanning the flames and preventing them from being put out,"" the regional ministry for emergencies in Krasnoyarsk said on Telegram. Regional governor Alexander Uss said gales of up to 40 metres per second had brought down trees and power lines across large swathes of the Krasnoyarsk region, sparking the fires. Authorities said 300 firemen backed by 90 vehicles were fighting the flames. ""We have called for help from neighbouring territories but are aware that will in the best case not arrive for some hours,"" said Mr Uss, adding temporary shelters were being opened for people in the worst-hit areas. ""I have given the order to cut off electricity in part of the region — save for survival facilities, service stations and water supply systems,"" he said. Roman Vilfand, of Russia's Hydrometeorological Research Centre, told the TASS news agency that such fires were rare in May. ""But there hasn't been rain for a long time, there were fires, and then strong wind,"" he said. Forest-rich Siberia has suffered from unprecedented fires for several years. Last year, they belched 16 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, according to an annual European climate report.

72,'Just hanging on': Can feral-free zones across NSW bring native mammals back from brink of extinction?,environment,"  Feral-free zones plan in South East NSW to bring native mammals back from the brink of extinction It may not be a well-known fact, but feral animals remain one of the biggest threats to Australia's native wildlife. Now it is hoped the construction of ""feral-free zones"" across NSW national parks will help bring dozens of species back from the brink of extinction. The state government is proposing to create 65,000 hectares of feral-free national parks, with the first coastal zone being proposed in the South East of NSW, near Bombala. Head of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, Atticus Fleming, said the plan would help address one of Australia's biggest conservation problems. ""Australia has the worst mammal extinction rate in the world, and we've got a lot of species that are just hanging on,"" he said. ""One of the biggest factors in that extinction rate has been the impact of feral cats and foxes and other feral animals."" The New South Wales government has proposed feral-proof fences around 2,000 hectares of the South East Forest National Park, Nungatta. Native mammals including the long-footed potoroo, eastern bettong, smoky mouse and eastern quoll are among the species the project could reintroduce into the area. The $2.5–$3 million zone is one of seven predator-free areas set up by the state government and the first to be established on the east coast. Mr Fleming said it was hoped it would help ""turn back time"" for the bushland. ""People will be able to come and see the Australian bush as it was a couple of hundred years ago before feral animals arrived,"" he said. Sections of the South East Forest National Park were severely burnt during the 2019–2020 bushfires. David Lindenmayer from ANU's School of Environment and Society said the reintroduction of native species would help the bush recover. ""These animals actually play a really important role in engineering the ecosystem,"" Professor Lindenmayer said. ""These animals do a lot of digging and burrowing, which actually helps lead to much better infiltration of rain, much stronger patterns of plant growth and much higher levels of plant cover."" While conservationists like professor Lindenmayer welcome the creation of these ""mainland islands,"" he said more work needed to be done. ""It really makes no sense to do these kinds of things unless we tackle the other drivers of animal decline,"" Professor Lindenmayer said. ""Problems like extensive logging, too much fire and land clearing need to be tackled as well."" Another issue he raised was the ""lack"" of funding for conservation by the state and federal governments. ""Our investment is about one-tenth of what it needs to be — so we need to get that sorted out,"" he said. ""We know that actually saving Australia's endangered species would be the equivalent of a screen door in a submarine."" However, NSW Environment Minister James Griffin said the government was spending more on conservation than it ever had. ""We've never spent more money than we're spending right now,"" he said. ""More than $80 million is going into wildlife restoration."" The public is encouraged to have their say on the plan of management regarding the South East feral-free zone before construction begins in the middle of the year. It's hoped the first native species can be reintroduced by the end of 2023.

73,How much are you willing to pay to help reduce carbon emissions? Vote Compass has the answer,environment,"  Australians overwhelmingly support action to reduce carbon emissions, Vote Compass data shows It is the question that has driven a protracted debate, which has gripped Australian politics for the better part of a decade. How much should Australia do to reduce its carbon emissions? At a time when climate change poses one of the biggest challenges for the nation and the globe, Vote Compass data shows an overwhelming number of Australians want more action. Almost 60 per cent of voters want ""much more"" cuts to emissions, and another 20 per cent said Australia could be doing ""somewhat"" more. In all, 79 per cent support further action. Just 7 per cent of voters thought Australia should be cutting fewer emissions, another 13 per cent thought we could be doing about the same as now. In Perth, Catherine Patterson and her family of four are doing everything they can to reduce their carbon footprint. Ms Patterson, who works for an environmental charity, said she and her husband are mindful of travelling too much and ""only do trips away when necessary"". Most of their furniture is second-hand and the family strives to reduce waste around the house by composting and thinking about each new item they buy. Ms Patterson is pleased that many other Australian families are also supportive of a move to cut our emissions further. ""It's really great to see that sentiment, because I feel that personally, but I am also quite surprised because a lot of people have jobs that rely on oil and gas, it's great to hear that [most Australians] feel that way."" Given the evidence is ""real, and that its impacts appear to be significant"", many voters believe climate change has personal implications, according to Dr Peter Chen at The University of Sydney. Tasmania has gone from being an emitter of carbon dioxide to now removing more than it is emitting to the atmosphere — with researchers saying the turning point was when the logging of native forests stopped. ""Since the last election, we've had major fires and major flooding."" Dr Chen, who lectures on public policy, said after the election later this month, political scientists will be asking one key question: ""Are we going to see a big impact of the salience issue of climate in this election? ""Because there was a lot of discussion about the climate at the last election which didn't really eventuate. ""People saw it as an important issue, but not one they would change their vote over."" A majority of voters who intend to support Labor, the Greens and the Liberal-National parties supported a greater cut in emissions. But there was a clear difference along party lines among those who thought Australia could commit to ""much more"" action. At 94 per cent, an overwhelming number of Greens voters are looking for much more action, 81 per cent of Labor voters agreed, compared with 23 per cent of Liberal-National voters. ""I don't think the split is surprising, I guess it shows that issue has become extremely partisan and a marker of party differences,"" Dr Chen said. There was still majority support among Coalition voters for Australia to reduce its emissions — 58 per cent thought the government could do more, while a third of Liberal-National voters were comfortable with what the nation was already doing. The Coalition and Labor have both committed to a net zero by 2050 target. But Labor has committed to cutting emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. The Coalition has stuck with its target of making cuts of between 26 and 28 per cent by 2030. Its plan includes utilising carbon capture, low emission steel production and hydrogen. Labor is investing in upgrading the transmission network and supporting community batteries and electric vehicles. Catherine Patterson's family factors in environmentally friendly investments into their budget. Investing in solar panels, an electric vehicle and charging station has enabled them to reduce their bills ""quite substantially"", Ms Patterson said. ""Before we bought them, it was an investment… but it's been quite incremental, we haven't tried to do everything at once, we've done one thing at a time and we've saved up for it."" Vote Compass asked how much voters would be prepared to spend each year to help prevent climate change. A quarter of Greens voters said they'd be willing to pay more than $2,000 annually to mitigate climate change. While a quarter of Coalition voters said they wanted to pay nothing. Paying between $100 and $500 per year felt about right for voters of all major parties — a quarter of Labor, Liberal-National and Greens voters selected this answer. And on the question of whether we should stop exporting coal to other countries to be used for electricity, Australians had a mixed response, with 23 per cent saying they strongly agreed. Another 24 per cent of Australians ""somewhat"" agreed. A relatively high proportion of voters were neutral on the question at 17 per cent, and 34 per cent disagreed either strongly or somewhat with stopping coal exports for energy. More Australian women agreed with halting coal exports — 55 per cent were in favour, compared with 37 per cent of men. Coalition voters were not in favour of stopping coal exports — 63 per cent disagreed with that idea, either strongly or somewhat.

74,Major mine sat on government panel that chose its own independent monitor,environment,"  McArthur River Mine representatives sat on government tender panel that chose new independent monitor A massive lead and zinc mine at the centre of numerous environmental scandals had a hand in the appointment of its own independent regulator, according to confidential documents obtained by environmentalists. The mine's new independent monitor was selected by a tender assessment panel late in 2019 FOI documents show two representatives from the mine sat on that panel The independent monitor's latest report found the mine was highly compliant with its environmental requirements The revelation is contained in tender documents released to the Environment Centre NT (ECNT) under Freedom of Information laws. They relate to the appointment of the McArthur River Mine's new independent monitor — an environmental oversight body that assesses the mine and the government department regulating it, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade (DITT). The documents show two representatives from the major mine, about 1,000 kilometres south-east of Darwin, sat alongside government bureaucrats on the seven-person tender assessment panel that selected the mine's new independent monitor in late 2019. Consulting firm Advisian scored highly on the procurement criteria and was subsequently awarded the work. However, it was later revealed that the government had changed the scope of the monitoring from an environmental assessment to a compliance audit and accepted a tender that was much cheaper than estimated. A group of NT public servants who alleged management fraud and misconduct has affected their ability to regulate major mines are dismayed the ICAC has rejected their complaint. The environment centre's Kirsty Howey said the mine's involvement in the tender process raised questions about the integrity of Advisian's glowing latest report card. ""The crux of the independent monitor report is that the monitor needs to be independent of government, and free of influence from government and the mining company,"" she said. ""It makes clear that [mine owner] Glencore has influenced that process. ""We think that is extremely concerning and completely at odds with the promise that's been made to Territorians about independent oversight of this mine"". The independent monitor's report is one of the key ways any significant environmental risks are monitored and disclosed to the public, including the waste rock dump that sparked health concerns when it spontaneously combusted in 2013. The government (DITT) said it did not believe the mine's involvement in the tender selection posed a conflict of interest. ""The tender assessment panel was led by the NT Government, and consisted of representatives from multiple NT Government departments and MRM,"" she said. ""An independent probity advisor was engaged to oversee the assessment process."" Asked if it requested to be on the committee, a spokeswoman from the mining company said: ""The Northern Territory Government has always been responsible for coordinating the tender and appointment of the Independent Monitor"". Advisian's latest report, covering the year to April 2021, was released yesterday and found both the mine and the department were highly compliant with their regulatory requirements. It concluded there were no environmental issues requiring urgent investigation and the McArthur River and its tributaries — a key concern for nearby communities — were in good health. However, Ms Howey claimed the report had become ""light on detail"" under the changed scope, and appeared not to include important information like a register of potential significant risks. ""Effectively, what this document has been reduced to is a tick-and-flick exercise which ticks off whether certain regulatory requirements have been met, rather than undertaking a comprehensive risk assessment of what this mine poses,"" she said. ""There has not been any assessment of risk able to be undertaken by the independent monitor, which means that really the report is worthless."" The report itself said the risk register had not been revised since January 2020 and risk mitigation controls had not been formally reviewed. The minor compliance issues it identified mainly related to record-keeping, and two of the open-cut mine's largest environmental risks — its waste rock dump and tailings storage facility — received near-perfect compliance scores. While concluding fish in the region were safe to eat, the report said metals above safe levels were detected in two fish species in a creek within the mining lease boundary. However, it said there was only an ""extremely low risk"" to human health from consuming fish in the area. The mine's acting general manager, Adam Hatfield, has welcomed the report. ""The Independent Monitor's positive findings about our environmental performance and the continued good health of the McArthur River are a testament to the ongoing progress we've made in recent years,"" he wrote in a statement. The ABC has previously revealed that the department sought a lower environmental security bond for the mine than the one the company itself calculated, raising questions about the relationship between the mine and the department regulating it. The department also approved a change to the mine while the government was in caretaker mode. The mine said it directly employs about 1,200 people and contributed $600 million to the economy last year.

76,Your home could be 'uninsurable' by 2030. Here are the top 10 electorates most at risk,environment," Science Climate change means 1 in 25 homes could become uninsurable by 2030, report warns About one in 25 Australian homes are at high risk of becoming effectively uninsurable by 2030, according to a new Climate Council report based on analysis by a climate risk assessment group. That number rises to more than one in 10 homes for some of the most affected regions, including parts of Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Greater Shepparton, Ballina and Port Adelaide. The report authors warn that Australia is heading for an ""insurability crisis"" as climate change increases the risk of worse weather extremes, resulting in ""skyrocketing"" insurance premiums. ""We're talking about half a million properties — it's not insignificant,"" said Nicki Hutley, report co-author and economist with the Climate Council. ""This has implications for every single taxpayer in Australia."" Of the top 10 electorates to be impacted, most (80 per cent) are due to the increasing insurance risk posed by riverine flooding, according to the ""Uninsurable Nation"" report, which was released on Tuesday. Bushfire and surface-water flooding, or overland flooding not associated with river swelling, also feature prominently in pushing insurance premiums higher in the coming years. When a property becomes ""effectively uninsurable"", it means the insurance premiums are so high as to be unaffordable to the average home owner, according to Karl Mallon from Climate Valuation, who provided the Climate Council with the data. Once there is more than a 1 per cent chance in any given year of a property incurring major damage from an extreme weather event, that's when premiums start to escalate, Dr Mallon said. ""Once you exceed that threshold, typically the costs start to increase; so instead of paying $1,000 a year, you get $3,000 a year and it climbs — we've seen premiums of $30,000 a year,"" he said. ""Essentially, we stand by the view that once you get above these levels, there will be many people who cannot afford this insurance."" Had trouble getting insurance for your home? We'd love to hear from you. You can contact us at science@abc.net.au. Had trouble getting insurance for your home? We'd love to hear from you. You can contact us at science@abc.net.au. Queensland is projected to be the hardest-hit state, with up to 193,000 properties (6.5 per cent of the total number) deemed to be at high risk of uninsurability by 2030, followed by New South Wales with more than 148,000 properties. The findings were based on a business-as-usual, high emissions outlook for climate change. Dr Mallon said what banks and insurance companies choose to base their premiums on varies, but they're required to factor in business-as-usual forecasts. Let's break down the climate change policies of the major parties: Coalition, Labor and Greens. ""The kind of guidance coming out from the governing regulatory bodies in Australia and around the world, they almost all insist that every company have a view on the high emissions scenarios,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, that's where we're tracking, is along those pathways."" At this stage, the high emissions scenario is looking likely through to 2030, Ms Hutley said. ""What we call the high emissions, worst-case scenario is the path we're currently on with no pathway adjustments,"" she said. ""This is actually what we're facing down if nothing happens [and] with the 2030 scenario, most of that [warming] is already baked in."" The report also includes an interactive map with moderate and best-case emissions scenarios, where users can explore outcomes through to 2100. ""Even under the moderate scenario, things still don't look that great,"" Ms Hutley said. In the federal electorate of Nicholls in Victoria, which includes Shepparton, Moira, Campaspe, Mitchell and parts of Strathbogie Shire, as many as one in four houses are predicted to move into the insurance ""high risk"" category by 2030. Strathbogie mayor Laura Binks said her community was ""already living the reality of climate change right now"", but she was still surprised to see how at-risk the Strathbogie Shire could become. ""Seeing this report, yes, it's the high emissions, worst-case scenario outlook for our community, but it's really alarming and arresting,"" Councillor Binks said. In 2021, Strathbogie became the 100th council in Australia to declare a climate emergency. Councillor Binks said this report had reinforced the need to get emissions down. As images of flooding fill our bulletins, it's important to remember that this isn't happening in a vacuum. Extreme weather is going to get more common under climate change. ""We'd absolutely welcome meaningful [climate] action at the state and federal level that the scientists are telling us we have to take,"" she said. Councillor Binks said there were already a number of climate-positive projects in the Strathbogie Shire, including a microgrid at Euroa and carbon-neutral wineries, but that building resilience against future extreme weather events posed a bigger challenge. ""It's certainly a part of the work that our operations and engineering teams are doing, is looking at ways we can build resilience,"" she said. ""[But] the challenge we have at Strathbogie is we have a large area but a fairly small rate base."" That means the council can't generate the revenue locally to invest in expensive infrastructure projects. ""What we'd love to see is more meaningful support and partnering from state and federal governments,"" Councillor Binks said. ""We don't want to see rural and regional places get left behind."" Our changing climate could soon make it harder to get a mortgage on the Queensland coast. We had three properties assessed, with mixed results. Climate Valuation calculated the data used in the report with a program that input variables including flood mapping, elevation, and forest cover, combined with global climate models, to assess the ""upper range"" of risks posed to every address in Australia. Assuming an average house cost of $314,000 (it was $320,000 last year according to the ABS), they then calculated what is called the MVAR, or maximum value at risk, for each property. Houses that scored an MVAR of 1 per cent, which means that extreme weather was likely to cost them on average 1 per cent of the value of their property each year — $3,140 based on the assumed average house cost — were deemed to be at ""high risk"" of becoming effectively uninsurable. Because extreme weather events happen with a degree of random probability, jumps in insurance premiums can be difficult to predict. However, Dr Mallon says that, in general, insurance companies and banks have been underestimating the growing risk of climate change. ""Unfortunately, we think it's not going to be a smooth curve from here over the next five years,"" he said. ""We think there's going to be some bumpy corrections."" What people need to understand, he said, is that while a 1 or 2 per cent chance of an extreme weather event might sound low to the property owner, to an insurer, that could be an unacceptable risk and cause for boosting premiums. ""Everyone is saying, 'What's the statistical probability of an extreme weather event?'"" Dr Mallon said. ""If I was a home owner, I'm more worried about what the insurers and banks are going to do, than what is the possibility of an event coming through.""

A spokesperson for the Insurance Council of Australia says climate change is ""worsening extreme weather events, which has implications for affordability and availability of insurance"". ""At present there is no area of Australia that is uninsurable, although there are some locations where there are clearly affordability and availability concerns,"" the spokesperson said. ""Insurance [assesses] risk, and that means that for those in flood-prone or cyclone-prone locations, cover can be costly.

77,analysis: A reckoning is coming for Australia's largest river system,environment," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes A reckoning is coming for the Murray-Darling Basin and its $13 billion management plan. Very few people believe water will be found in time The lakes and dams are full, the crops bountiful, and birds and fish are returning, but a reckoning is coming for Australia's largest river system. Delivery of the $13 billion Murray-Darling Basin Plan, arguably one of the country's largest and most ambitious environmental reforms, hangs in the balance with just two years to go before major water-saving deadlines must be met. Very few people who have been paying attention believe the water will be found in time. What happens then has all sides of politics divided. For too long, too much water was taken out of the rivers and the environment suffered. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has remained controversial ever since its introduction back in 2012. So, why is it back on the agenda? In 2012 a new way of doing business was legislated – with bipartisan support — and a plan was set about how much water could be withdrawn from the Murray-Darling Basin. The plan says 2,750 gigalitres, more than five Sydney Harbours worth of water, must be given back to the rivers. Plus, an additional 450GL should be recovered through what is called efficiency projects. South Australia, at the bottom of the system, said it would only sign on to the plan if the 450GL was included. The deadline for both targets is set for June 2024. In 2018, the federal and state water ministers agreed to set a strict criteria about how the 450GL could be recovered. They'd essentially decided that too many regional communities were suffering because there was less water, less money and fewer people in the towns where the water use had changed. The ministers agreed no water could be put toward the 450GL target unless it could be done in a way that met their criteria to ensure no socio-economic harm to communities. It's unclear how legally-binding that criteria is. So far just 2GL has been recovered toward the target. Now federal Labor says it would ensure delivery of the 450GL for the environment if it is elected later this month. And it hasn't ruled out buying the water back from farmers — a prospect that outrages the Victorian Labor Water Minister Lisa Neville. Ms Neville was one of those who led the charge to have the water ministers agree to the criteria by which the 450GL could be recovered. She vehemently opposes buybacks. The Nationals agree. Last year, backbench Nationals used debate in the federal parliament to break from cabinet and attempt to legislate to axe the 450GL, outlaw any more Commonwealth buybacks and extend the deadline for water-saving projects beyond 2024. Look back at how the 2022 Australian federal election unfolded It failed and spectacularly embarrassed Coalition partners the Liberals, whose South Australian senators promptly issued a statement re-instating their support to deliver the legislated Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full, and on time. This is how it looks so far. Victorian Labor and the federal Nationals are in lockstep. The Nationals and Liberals are at odds with each other. And federal Labor is promising to deliver more water for the environment by ignoring the state water minister's criteria but ""working with the states"". All allegiances are being tested, but for now, the federal Water Minister Keith Pitt, who was returned to cabinet in return for the Nationals' support for Australia's net zero by 2050 target, is resolute the Coalition government policy is not to buy back water from farmers to meet the water savings deadlines. ""It is the government's position that there'll be no more buybacks. From the Prime Minister down we have that commitment,"" Mr Pitt told the ABC earlier this year. In the same interview, Mr Pitt said there would be some water savings projects that would not be completed on time; another sentiment not shared by his Liberal colleagues. Away from the 450GL, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan states that 605GL must be recovered for the environment from water-saving projects managed by the state governments. The idea is that by re-engineering weirs or removing silt from lakes more water savings would be made. The Millennium drought didn't just expose river beds — it also exposed deep tensions between environmental and economic sustainability. This too will need a miracle if it is to occur by the middle of 2024, progress on some of the projects is so slow it is almost non-existent. One project, at the Menindee Lakes, was to recover 106GL but has been delayed and re-scoped. Last October, then NSW water minister Melinda Pavey warned the overhauled project would not make 106GL in water savings, nor would it be completed on time. If the project does go ahead it would likely recover significantly less water, with one insider suggesting 40GL at best. Ms Pavey has since been dumped from the NSW water portfolio and the community is yet to be convinced of the latest approach. Another project, known as 'constraints management' would see water flow through low-lying areas and requires almost 4000 landholder agreements to be reached. A decade into the Plan and so far not one landholder agreement has been signed. That's zip, zero, zilch, nada. If not for the return of healthy rains in recent years you might expect a riot over the uncertainty in the communities that depend upon and enjoy the rivers. Last month, Australia's Agriculture Minister David Littleproud, also a National, said if the Plan's water-saving deadlines needed to be extended, they should be. But with South Australian Liberals opposed to NSW and Victorian Nationals it is unclear how the Coalition would reach consensus within its own ranks. The matter could very well be a consideration when the Coalition agreement is re-negotiated, post-election. From here, it looks like hell is more likely to freeze over before Victorian Water Minister Lisa Neville and federal Shadow Water Minister Terri Butler see eye-to-eye on basin policy and the path to consensus for Labor is just as murky. The challenge for either a federal Coalition or Labor government to convince state water ministers – who haven't met for more than a year – about the best way forward seems almost insurmountable. All the while climate change projections see less water flowing into the rivers. Australia's largest river system is home to more than 2 million people, including those from more than 40 First Nations. It provides drinking water for more than 3.5 million people, is home to 16 internationally recognised wetlands and produces more than $30 billion in agriculture and tourism each year. The Murray-Darling Basin is for all Australians to share. How that is done won't be a major issue in this year's federal election, but perhaps it should be.

78,Shearwater shock: Dozens of dead birds found in coastal town for fourth straight year,environment,"  Dozens of dead shearwaters found in Port Fairy for fourth year in a row Dozens of dead juvenile short-tailed shearwaters have been found strewn across a lawn outside a popular tourist attraction in south-west Victoria for a fourth straight year. The short-tailed shearwater, or mutton bird, is one of Australia's most common and hardy birds. Each year the birds clock up more than 32,000 kilometres, following the warm weather between the northern and southern hemispheres as they chase an ""eternal summer"". About 50 juvenile short-tailed shearwaters were this week found strewn across a lawn near a popular breeding ground at Griffiths Island in Port Fairy, three-and-a-half hours west from Melbourne. The cause of death remains unknown, and Victoria's Department of Environment and Moyne Shire Council have been notified. Port Fairy's short-tailed shearwater population has endured a horror run over the past four years. Alarm bells were raised in 2019 when the 40,000-strong colony was uncharacteristically late to arrive to its south-west home. A significant number of shearwater deaths were recorded that summer and again in 2020. Things were looking brighter last year, with colony numbers bouncing back before this weekend's latest kill. It is understood the juvenile birds were expected to leave the island this week to follow their parents north to Alaska for the summer. The Moyne Shire Council sent staff to collect the birds on Sunday. ""It’s understood artificial light may have an impact on the fledglings,"" a council spokesperson said. ""As such, council has taken steps to reduce artificial light in the area around Griffiths Island. ""The light in the rotunda at the entrance to the island causeway will be switched off until after the fledglings have migrated."" The council is also investigating if other lighting in the area can be lowered or switched off during fledging, while still ensuring safety of the public. The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said its investigations remained ongoing. ""The cause of the deaths isn’t known. DELWP officers have collected a sample of the birds for assessment,” a spokesperson said.

79,They suck your electricity while you sleep. What you need to know about vampire appliances,environment,"  They suck your electricity and money while you sleep. What you need to know about vampire appliances No, they're not Twilight-themed appliances. However, like Edward Cullen, appliances left on stand-by are a big red flag. Working behind the scenes while you're sleeping, vampire appliances are consuming energy even when they're turned off. So what are they and will turning them off at the wall make any difference to your power bills? Let's find out. These particular appliances enter a stand-by mode rather than fully powering down, meaning they continue to consume energy even while turned off. Essentially, it means you're paying for electricity that you're not even using. According to Canstar Blue's estimates, appliances on stand-by could cost you up to 10 per cent of your electricity bill: That's more than $100 annually. This depends on various factors, including the number of appliances left on stand-by, each appliance's efficiency rating and the rate you pay for electricity. Nevertheless, it's unnecessary power usage that's costing you more. Appliance Hourly standby usage Annual standby cost Gaming console 5.4W $13.14 Washing machine 1 – 6W $2.62 – $14.90 Dishwasher 3W $7.99 Source: Canstar Blue If an appliance has a remote control, LED light, touch-on button or similar function, then it uses stand-by electricity. Another way you can tell is if you can feel heat coming from an appliance that you aren't using, such as your laptop charger when it's not plugged into your laptop. Why do they do this? Because these devices constantly run background functions while on stand-by. Wi-Fi checks, downloading content and continually having to prepare for remote, touch or voice activation all contribute to stand-by electricity usage. While the amount of electricity that feeds into most devices is minuscule, some devices may cost you more than others. In 2021, Canstar Blue examined the stand-by costs of common household appliances. Its findings revealed some of the most expensive appliances and devices were: Yes. The best way to save on stand-by costs is to make a habit of switching appliances and devices off at the power outlet when they're not in use. Phones at 100 per cent battery still plugged into chargers, cordless vacuum cleaners sitting quietly in the corner, your Google Home patiently waiting for your daily ""What's the weather today?"" question — individually, these devices on stand-by draw a small amount of energy. However, Choice's home products expert, Denis Gallagher, says that, if you've got more than a dozen appliances around the house, it's going to start adding up. ""We've seen an average of 15 to 17 connected devices in the home in 2020."" ""In just a few years time, that amount is going to double,"" he said. And let's not forget the bigger cost: Choice says the stand-by energy used across Australia collectively amounts to tonnes of extra greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere. Ultimately, it pays to shop around and check the star rating of appliances. The price of electricity is the cheapest it has been in almost a decade, and average annual household bills are going down. But consumers could be paying even less. Here's how. The Australian Energy Star Rating System is intended to indicate electricity usage running costs. However, it also provides a useful guide to stand-by costs. Essentially, the more energy efficient an appliance is, the less electricity it will use on stand-by. You can modify the settings on some smart televisions and smart consoles to minimise their stand-by functionality. You can do this to stop them from running background functions, such as scanning for Wi-Fi. Some electricity boards can detect when an appliance has entered stand-by mode and will cut its electricity feed entirely. It can also detect when you’re trying to turn the device back on and recommence its feed of electricity.

80,Masked owl habitat concerns fail to stop tailings dam work in Tarkine rainforest,environment,"  Bob Brown Foundation loses federal court bid to stop MMG mine tailing dams in Tarkine over masked owl concerns An environmental group has lost its Federal Court bid to halt preliminary works for a controversial mine tailings dam inside the takayna/Tarkine rainforest in Tasmania's west. The Bob Brown Foundation argued mining company MMG's work would cause ""irreversible damage"" to the habitat of the rare Tasmanian masked owl. But the move was dismissed by Justice Mark Moshinsky, telling the court an injunction restricting the company from undertaking the proposed action altogether ""appears to go too far"". In January, the federal Environment Department found design and assessment work from MMG did not require approval under the Commonwealth's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC). Despite that, the company had to include measures to protect various species, including wedge-tailed eagles and Tasmanian devils, but not the masked owl. Justice Moshinsky told the court it was unnecessary to impose an injunction because MMG had now given an undertaking to protect the masked owl. ""Had MMG not offered to give the undertaking, I would have considered it appropriate to make an order restraining MMG,"" he said. MMG has agreed to apply a 15-metre exclusion zone to trees suitable for masked owl nesting, with the trees to be marked with tape and their GPS coordinates recorded. The foundation's campaign manager, Jenny Weber, said it was ""not a good day"" for threatened species in Tasmania. ""It's a pro-mining decision over the environment,"" she said. ""Compromising any part of nature is just not acceptable. It's so important to us to keep places like takayna/Tarkine intact."" Tasmania's Rosebery mine needs to build a new tailings dam or risk closure, costing 500 jobs. But some are standing against the weight of public opinion and likelihood of arrest to protect the environment. However, Ms Weber said the court decision had put the Chinese-owned company on notice. ""We will be in those forests to monitor the behaviour and activities of MMG and we will be absolutely noting if they go outside their undertakings,"" she said. ""Every time MMG enters into these forests, it is a step towards building this enormous tailings waste dump."" She said it was ""back to the barricades"" for conservationists who would continue protesting. The foundation's bid to overturn federal government approval for the tailings dam will be heard in July. Tasmania's Rosebery mine, which has been operating since the 1930s, produces zinc, copper, and lead concentrates, as well as gold ore. The mine has two existing tailings dams, but a new one is required for the mine to survive past 2024. South Marionoak, across the Pieman River from the Rosebery mine, is where MMG has proposed to build the dam, with a footprint of 285 hectares. In a statement, MMG general manager Steve Scott said he welcomed the decision. ""It confirms that MMG has, at all times, acted legally under the strict terms and conditions set by the federal government,"" he said. ""We are taking specific and conservative steps to avoid impacts on masked owl habitat, including applying an exclusion zone around any potential habitat trees.""

83,'Do not eat' advisory for shellfish in entire Gippsland Lakes region as toxic algal bloom grows,environment,"  Blue-green algae outbreak at Gippsland Lakes grows, with only Lake Wellington safe for swimming A toxic blue-green algae bloom in Victoria's Gippsland Lakes is growing, prompting authorities to upgrade warnings. Lake Wellington is now the only part of the inland waterway network considered safe for direct contact with humans or pets. A ""do not eat"" advisory for shellfish remains in place for the entire system, including for shellfish from Lake Wellington. Fishers have also been told to gut and gill whole fish before eating them. A warning from the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said it was not yet known how long the bloom would last. ""There is no definite length of time that these species of algae will remain in the lakes,"" it stated. Contact with blue-green algae can cause allergic reactions, gastroenteritis and nausea. Monash University biochemistry professor Perran Cook said the current outbreak was not the worst the system had seen. ""While significant, this is considered a medium outbreak,"" he said. ""In East Gippsland we experienced a far worse outbreak in 1992."" Professor Cook said current water temperature, salinity and nutrient levels were ideal for algal growth. ""Algal blooms are a naturally occurring phenomenon and occurred prior to colonisation,"" he said. Since the artificial opening of the lakes to the ocean at Lakes Entrance in the late 19th century, many have questioned its effect on algal blooms. ""It's also likely the permanent opening of the entrance has had a mitigating affect overall,"" Professor Cook said.

84,"Chinese resort developer Freesoul fined $650,000 for damaging Fijian mangroves and reef",environment,"  Chinese resort developer Freesoul fined $650,000 for damaging Fijian mangroves and reef A Chinese company that dug a channel through mangroves and a coral reef to provide access to a multi-million-dollar resort and casino development on a Fijian island has been fined $FJ1 million ($650,000) by the High Court in Suva. In the landmark judgment handed down on Thursday, Justice Daniel Goundar also ordered Freesoul Real Estate Development to pay a $FJ1.4 million bond, refundable once the damage had been remediated. The company was found guilty in April last year of two counts of undertaking unauthorised development on Malolo, a tourist island in Fiji's west, where it removed mangrove trees and destroyed extensive parts of a reef to create the boat channel. Justice Goundar said the company had ""caused substantial harm to the environment"" and the sentence reflected the ""community's disapproval for the offender's lack of respect for the environment"". He added there was ""no comparable case in Fiji"" for sentencing purposes. ""The offender had no regard for the marine life and corals that existed in the area where the channel was dug,"" he said. ""The structural damage done to the area is irreversible."" While the affected areas could not be restored to their natural states, he said the damage could be mitigated with works with an estimated cost of about $FJ1.3 million. Freesoul's lawyer David Toganivalu told the ABC the company had not yet decided whether it would appeal the judgment. ""Definitely they want to start the project again,"" Mr Toganivalu said. ""They will need to work with the Department of Environment to see how to rehabilitate the place again."" ""The fine was a bit too high, but that was to be expected,"" he added. Local media quoted Environment Minister Mahendra Reddy as saying the case would serve as a deterrent to other developers failing to comply with environment laws. Navrin Fox, an Australian who has a long-term lease on land neighbouring the development site and who had raised concerns about Freesoul, said he was ""surprised and happy"" the fine was substantial. ""It's good to see the Fijian government and the court system standing up for what's right,"" he said. ""I think that they could go one step further and cancel Freesoul's lease, because they have shown negligence. ""To dig that much reef out and to dump it in front of our lease land and do that without any authority to do it is just pure negligence, and they knew what they were doing."" Fiji's Prime Minister apologises for the arrests, saying ""rogue"" police officers were to blame, and praising media for exposing a Chinese company's ""illegal environmental destruction"". Wildlife Conservation Society Melanesia director Stacy Jupiter also welcomed the sentence but she too said the fine did not go far enough. ""This bond of $FJ1.4 million isn't going to be nearly enough to cover the restoration,"" she said. ""You'll never be able to get back the value of services that has been lost because this channel has been created. ""It takes reefs hundreds to thousands of years to be able to build structures of the size and scale of which they've destroyed and so you can't rehabilitate this. ""No amount of money can rehabilitate what's been taken away."" The story was brought to national and international attention in 2019 when three New Zealand journalists were arrested after being denied an interview with the director of the company Freesoul at its offices in the capital, Suva. They spent the night on the floor of a Fijian police station before being released the following day with the Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama apologising for their treatment.

85,"Landfill the size of 50 football fields burns in Delhi, engulfing city in acrid smoke amid heatwave",environment,"  Delhi engulfed in smoke as landfill blaze rages amid heatwave Acrid smoke hung over New Delhi for a second day after a massive landfill caught fire during a scorching heat wave, forcing informal waste workers to endure hazardous conditions. The landfill in northern Delhi's Bhalswa is taller than a 17-storey building and covers an area bigger than 50 football fields. Waste workers who live in nearby homes had emptied onto the streets on Tuesday evening (local time). However, by Wednesday morning, the thousands of people who live and work at the landfill had begun the dangerous process of trying to salvage garbage from the fire. ""There's a fire every year. It is not new. There is risk to life and livelihood, but what do we do?"" asked Bhairo Raj, 31, an informal waste worker who lives next to the landfill. He said that his children studied there and he could not afford to leave. The Indian capital, like the rest of South Asia, is in the midst of a record-shattering heatwave that, experts said, was a catalyst for the landfill fire. Three other landfills around the Indian capital have also caught fire in recent weeks. The landfill in the latest fire was planned for closure more than a decade ago, but more than 2,300 tons of the city's garbage is still dumped there every day. The organic waste in the landfill decays, resulting in a build-up of highly combustible methane gas. ""With high temperatures, this spontaneous combustion will take place,"" said Ravi Agarwal, the director of Toxics Link, a New Delhi-based advocacy group that focuses on waste management. Several fire engines rushed to the landfill to try to douse the fire. At night, the landfill resembled a burning mountain and it smouldered until early morning. March was the hottest month in India in more than a century and April has been similarly scorching. Temperatures crossed 43 degrees Celsius in several cities and forecasters expect them to continue rising. ""India's current heatwave has been made hotter by climate change,"" said Dr Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute in Imperial College London. She said that, unless the world stops adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, such heatwaves would become even more common.

86,North-west gets eco-tourism boost as state allocates $500k for adventure trail,environment,"  $500,000 Victorian government funding to plan, design Kerang-Koondrook Rail Trail What was once an important supply chain for early colonialists living on the Victorian-New South Wales border is set to become a popular outdoor adventure attraction for the Gannawarra Shire. The Victorian government has handed over $500,000 to start the planning and design work for a 22-kilometre cycling and walking trail between Kerang and Koondrook. The trail will follow parts of the former Kerang-Koondrook Tramways route, which delivered supplies to Kerang from the Koondrook Wharf, transported downriver by paddle steamer. Built and operated by the Shire of Swan Hill (later the Shire of Kerang) from 1889 until 1952, when Victorian Railways took over, the tramway was privately owned, had no signalling and had rails of lighter construction. Gannawarra Shire Mayor Charlie Gillingham remembers the tramways running when he was a child. ""When I was young, going to school, students used to travel on the tramway to Kerang."" Victorian Railways operated passenger services on the line until 1976, and freight services ended in 1978. The Koondrook Wharf was dismantled by the Marine Board in the late 50s, and in 1975 the rail turntable was removed, but a replica steam train is located at the old Koondrook station, just across the road from the wharf today. In recent years, redevelopment of the wharf and an emphasis on eco-tourism and outdoor adventure along the Murray River have created new opportunities for the region. ""We do focus a lot on nature-based tourism, and with the new wharf in Koondrook, glamping and the new all-abilities playground, Koondrook and the Gannawarra are going places,"" Cr Gillingham said. The Kerang and Koondrook Rail Trail will eventually extend from Kerang out to the Ramsar-listed Lake Charm and Reedy Lake. It will form part of the wider Murray River Adventure Trail — a multi-sport adventure trail that runs the length of the Murray River from Lake Hume, near Albury-Wodonga in the east to Mildura and Wentworth in the west. That trail takes in river red gum forests and major sites along the Murray, providing visitors the opportunity to experience the iconic river in its natural environment through active recreation. The land-based trail is about 1,040 km, while the water-based trail (for kayakers and other craft) is 1,390 km. State MP Mark Gepp said it was a real asset for northern Victoria and would turn the Murray River into a ""magnificent"" tourist opportunity. ""Tourism doesn't start and stop at a border. The Murray River doesn't recognise a postcode"", Mr Gepp said. ""It's about connecting all these different projects, these different amenities and infrastructure in the Gannawarra, which aren't done in isolation with each other but are designed to connect up to all the wonderful things going on here."" Loddon Murray Cycling Club president Brent McKnight said that once completed, the Kerang-Koondrook Rail Trail would be great for local cyclists and tourists alike. ""A lot of our members do, when they go off and visit different areas, take on the rail trails,"" he said. ""But unfortunately, we've got to travel a fair way to do that, so this will be new for us. It'll be fantastic."" He said it should be a good way to connect people who might not be avid riders, with the 22-kilometre length easily achievable in a little over an hour ""depending on which way the wind is blowing"". ""Most rail trails are not so much a sealed surface but made of a compacted gravel which does make it difficult to use a proper road bike, "" Mr McKnight said. ""However, the introduction of a lot of mountain bikes and what we call gravel bikes, which is a bit of hybrid bike, is ideally suited to a rail trail. ""The biggest thing we see about a rail trail like this is it's all off-road, which means it's much, much safer, especially for young families to take on because the road here can be quite busy with a lot of trucks."" Gannawarra Shire Council's chief executive Tom O'Reilly also has high hopes for the project. ""Once completed, this project will drive economic growth to the region through increased visitation and expenditure, while enhancing community wellbeing and livability, and employment opportunities for local trades and indigenous workforce through construction and new product development,"" he said. The state government has fast tracked the funding for the project to support recovery in the Gannawarra shire and northern border region, which was heavily impacted by travel restrictions during the first two years of the pandemic.

87,Freezing turtle hatchlings mistake Gold Coast homes for ocean,environment,"  Loggerhead turtles rescued from Palm Beach after mistaking homes for horizon Dozens of turtle hatchlings are lucky to be alive after they were found in a ""sorry state"" on a sand dune at a popular Gold Coast beach. The 40 loggerhead turtles were found near a nest in the beachside suburb of Palm Beach on Sunday. The underweight babies were disorientated by nearby house lights, according to turtle rehabilitator and Turtle Watch Gold Coast head Siobhán Houlihan. Ms Houlihan is urging people to turn their lights off during nesting season, and wants to see more done to dim construction lights. She said without volunteer groups, the entire clutch would have died. The turtles were transferred to Sea World to ""warm up"" before being released on Monday. Four of the babies died, but Ms Houlihan said the number could have been much higher. ""Honestly, if we hadn't intervened and nobody had found them, they would have just perished upon the journey,"" she said. ""Most of them were cold-stunned, weak and lethargic — most of them were on their back, they were stuck in the in the dune grass … going towards the street lights."" She said the turtles weighed about 20 grams and that a healthy weight was about 24 grams. ""They were in a pretty sorry state when we when we did find them,"" she said. It is the third nest found by Turtle Watch volunteers on the Gold Coast this season. Another loggerhead nest was found at Main Beach, as well as a green sea turtle clutch at Palm Beach. The Gold Coast's residential population is expected to swell to one million over the next two decades and construction is booming to keep pace. Ms Houlihan said it was common for turtles to get confused when they hatched near popular beachside suburbs. ""When they come out of a nest, they're looking for the lowest light horizon, which is normally the ocean — they know that the moon reflects off it,"" she said. ""But then obviously they're seeing these bright lights, so they can't actually see … the ocean. ""So they're going towards the house lights."" Turtles face a number of obstacles on Australia's coast, including construction, weather, plastic pollution and shark nets. Ms Houlihan said the Turtle Watch program was helping, but education and practical changes were crucial. ""There's a slogan … 'Reduce the glow to help the turtles go,'"" she said. ""If we can educate the locals that live on Palm Beach there, that during nesting and hatching seasons in the evening, close your curtains or turn lights off that you don't need. ""It would be great if we could see some more environmentally friendly lighting along those along those beaches. ""Having [hatching] events like this help to have those conversations and we can definitely have the conversations with the relevant people that can make those decisions."" In a statement, a Gold Coast City Council spokesperson said ecological assessments were undertaken ""as part of the design process for all city beachside projects that require lighting, such as along our oceanways."" Ms Houlihan said there was always more people could do. ""We can look at reducing our impact as best we can, just in all things in life,"" she said. ""We hope to help the animals that we share our environment with.""

88,Major Kakadu tourist attraction to remain closed as sacred sites fallout continues,environment,"  Gunlom Falls in Kakadu to remain closed into NT's peak tourism season One of the most popular attractions in Kakadu National Park will again remain closed as the Northern Territory moves into its peak tourism season, as the fallout from a lengthy sacred sites dispute continues. The ongoing issues mean parts of Gunlom Falls — whose natural infinity pool became world-famous with the help of social media — could be off-limits to visitors for a total of three years. Tour operators who once relied on the star attraction say the rolling closures have damaged the park's reputation. ""It's had a major impact on our business. It's had a major impact on visitation to the park,"" tour operator Greig Taylor said. ""As a result, we've not taken any bookings for May this year as we normally would, because we're not able to build a [tourism] program without Gunlom."" The popular waterfall was first closed in 2019 as the sacred sites watchdog, the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (AAPA), investigated whether the construction of a new walking track had impacted a nearby sacred site. The matter then became a long-running court battle, with AAPA prosecuting the park's joint management body, Parks Australia, for allegedly constructing the track close to a key feature of the restricted site, against the wishes of traditional custodians. The case is now before the Northern Territory Supreme Court, which is adjudicating on constitutional issues. A section of the walkway in question was removed late last year, and traditional owners have asked that the entire Gunlom area remain closed until construction of a replacement track is complete, according to a Parks Australia spokesperson. ""Parks Australia aims to have the walking track completed later this year, however timing will depend on the availability of contractors and materials, and site access,"" they said. ""The decision to re-open the area and the walking track will be made in consultation with Traditional Owners and the Northern Land Council."" A certificate authorising the remedial work was issued in late August 2020, according to an AAPA spokeswoman. A Northern Land Council spokesman said delays since then had been caused by the Omicron COVID variant, isolation and the need for on-site meetings. ""Everyone is being careful, mindful of past experiences and Parks Australia's record of poor consultation in the past, however, traditional owners appreciate that Parks is now engaging in good faith,"" he said. At a time when tourism operators are banking on a boom in the domestic market, Australia's biggest national park is falling into disrepair as a bitter dispute over management rages. ""Traditional owners and the Northern Land Council are cautiously optimistic of a satisfactory outcome."" The Supreme Court was last month told the federal government is immune to prosecution under the NT's sacred sites legislation, and is expected to rule on that matter in the coming months. The sacred sites dispute has been one chapter in the larger story of a deteriorating relationship between Parks Australia and the traditional owners who jointly manage the park, who aired their concerns in a 2021 episode of Four Corners. An advisory group established to repair relationships across three jointly managed parks recently found traditional owners had an ""almost complete lack of trust in Parks Australia"" and made a swathe of recommendations.

89,Singapore and The Netherlands have turned to nature to minimise flood damage. Could it work here?,environment," Science Nature-based solutions, and how countries like Singapore and The Netherlands are using them to fight floods Caroline Sullivan has both a personal and professional connection to the recent devastating floods in eastern Australia. She recently headed up a flood research centre based at Southern Cross University in Lismore, and has a house up the hill from the city's centre. The floods didn't reach Dr Sullivan's place, but she still sees the pain they caused all around her. ""An awful lot of my friends lost every single thing they have in the world,"" she says. ""It's just heartbreaking."" There is now much soul-searching about the best long-term responses to disasters like this, and many face the agonising question of whether to stay or move. After two major floods in little more than a month, Lismore is facing an existential crisis. Should residents stay or go — and where? The community as a whole needs to be involved in ""redesigning"" the town so it has long-term resilience against such disasters, says Dr Sullivan, whose main affiliation is now as an adjunct professor at the UNSW Water Research Centre. Part of that redesign could involve relocating those most at risk. To some extent, she says, it's about letting nature run its course, an approach pioneered by countries like The Netherlands. As part of a program that literally made ""room for the river"", the low-lying country bought back many farms for the flood plain. ""Instead of trying to control the river into channels and make it do what we say, the Dutch said, 'We know rivers are dynamic and therefore we must leave room for them to move'."" But there's so much more that could be done to work with nature to reduce the risk of flooding, Dr Sullivan adds. Restoring river and wetland ecosystems, covering more of our towns in vegetation, and keeping our catchments forested could all help reduce the impact of floods. They're interventions inspired by the processes and functioning of nature. The tropical island state of Singapore — which gets a lot of rain — has already embraced such nature-based solutions. ""Singapore used to have very large concrete drains to reduce flooding, but this is ugly and doesn't have any ecological or social benefits,"" says urban sustainability expert, Perrine Hamel of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. But over a decade ago it launched a water management program that included ""naturalising"" the city's river by greening its banks and surrounding it with beautiful, biodiverse parklands. Urban areas are particularly prone to flash flooding because impermeable surfaces like concrete and asphalt cause water to run off and accumulate in low-lying areas. The park around the river is not only a great place for people to gather when it's dry, but provides an area where excess water can soak into the ground and cause less havoc. Other nature-based flood mitigation initiatives in Singapore include using swales — vegetated drains on slopes, which slow down water run-off, reducing its destructive potential; and wetlands on the lowest-lying areas, which help protect the city from coastal flooding. Dr Hamel says traditional engineering solutions (sometimes called ""grey infrastructure"") like dams and levees are still important, but have their limitations. ""They have a huge carbon footprint, and they can fail."" And, she adds, they also displace the problem downstream. ""If you are getting rid of the water as fast as possible, this water still goes somewhere, and it can lead to flooding downstream."" And dams can be controversial. Jason Byrne from the University of Tasmania studies climate change adaptation and says Australia has a long way to catch up to places like Singapore. ""They are deploying nature-based solutions right across the city state … they're light years ahead of us."" Professor Byrne says some ""green infrastructure"" techniques to reduce run-off, like green roofs, have been trialed in cities like Melbourne. Other options include permeable pavements that soak up water, and street trees that do the same, and can have the added benefit of cooling cities. But evidence suggests the specific benefits of urban greening will depend on local conditions. A recent modelling study, for example, found that in most cities of the world, greening was unlikely to both cool the city and reduce flooding at the same time. ""Urban greening is not a panacea or silver bullet solution,"" Professor Byrne says. Experts say it will also be important to manage other issues that can occur with more nature in urban areas — things like bushfire risk or mosquitoes — and to avoid varieties of trees that suck up too much water, leaving little for the rest of the environment. ""It really will be about making a complex set of trade-offs,"" Professor Byrne says. ""Planting the right tree in the right place will be critically important."" Having a bushfire-smart garden is not just about what you plant and where, but how well you look after it too. If greenspace helps soak up water into the landscape, this could not only help guard against flooding, but save more groundwater to feed rivers in the dry times — something that's important for water security. The deep roots of trees are particularly good at helping water infiltrate into the soil, which has led to studies of how deforestation can make flooding worse in downstream towns. ""If we deforest those catchments for agricultural purposes, it means there's less vegetation around to catch that rainfall and evaporate it back out into the atmosphere,"" Professor Byrne says. But nature will always have the capacity to surprise us with large floods, especially in a changing climate, and there are limits to how much forests can absorb. If there is too much rain, a catchment gets soaked and can't absorb any more, which is why we need to have land downstream set aside that can be flooded without causing too many problems. Despite these limits, Dr Hamel and colleagues argued in a recent paper that models often underestimated the impacts of nature-based solutions like forests. Even small reductions in flood peak and flow could make a big difference to how badly communities are affected, they say. And since smaller floods are more frequent, their impacts add up. Putting exact figures on the benefits of nature-based solutions can be tricky and models have to be specific for individual catchments, Dr Hamel says. Commemorate World Environment Day on June 5 by going on a ""virtual field trip"" to an Australian town that's been designed around the impacts of climate change and disaster preparedness. Still, momentum is growing in support of nature-based solutions, likely in part because they can have a multitude of benefits. The World Bank's Global Program on Nature-Based Solutions for Climate Resilience is funding projects all over the world. And there's even talk about getting the insurance industry to invest in nature-based solutions to save money in the long run. Back in Australia, Dr Sullivan, who knows the Lismore community well, is among a group of researchers who wants to look more at the potential of this approach. Unfortunately, the interdisciplinary national flood research centre she headed closed not long after it was opened, due to lack of funding But this hasn't stopped her applying for federal grants to study how nature-based solutions might contribute to mitigating floods in the Richmond catchment, which includes Lismore. This is something the local community itself has said it wants to explore. Dr Sullivan is aware of the challenges. ""Nature-based solutions feel a bit intangible because it's lots of little things, not one single big thing like a dam wall that everyone can focus on."" More farmers are choosing to combine conservation with agriculture and the benefits are paying off. And research will need to look at the best way of getting the community to work together to benefit the whole catchment. This might require removing economic and regulatory disincentives, she says, citing the example of a farmer who had to pay extra rates after establishing a wetland on their property — because it was classed as a farm dam. ""Why would a farmer want to do that if they have to pay more money,"" Dr Sullivan says. ""It's much broader than just hydrological modeling. It's a whole system issue, so we have to take a wholistic approach."" Dr Sullivan says she's aware of skepticism about nature-based solutions, but thinks it's imperative we add them to our toolkit of flood responses. ""Rather than trying to hold nature back, we need to work with nature, and let nature work for us."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

90,"If waste coal seam gas salt needs 'active management forever', who's going to pay for it?",environment," ABC Rural Queensland's coal seam gas industry still has a big salt problem A leading environmental engineer says the issue of waste salt from the coal seam gas industry has been underestimated and the ""preferred"" industry plan ""needs active management forever"". The Queensland government has just released the latest draft of its Coal Seam Gas Brine Management Action Plan. It was estimated that over the next 20 to 30 years up to six million tonnes of waste salt would be produced by the Queensland coal seam gas industry (CSG), a significant reduction from the previously estimated 15 million tonnes. But environmental engineer Professor Stuart Khan from the University Of New South Wales said it was still ""really very significant"". ""I think when people first start thinking about this problem they think about a truckload of salt, perhaps, that might be shipped out and disposed of somewhere safely,"" he said. ""But actually, we're talking about thousands of truckloads of salt."" The Queensland government's plan for managing waste salt is based on analysis by the University of Queensland's Centre for Natural Gas which is partly funded by three of the largest gas companies operating in the state — Arrow Energy, Santos, and APLNG. The information UQ has analysed was provided by the peak body for the petroleum and gas industry, The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA). To release coal seam gas, groundwater is pumped to the surface and separated. A lot of this water is very salty and cannot be used without being processed. The salt is removed from the groundwater by either reverse osmosis plants or through plastic-lined evaporation ponds, and both processes create waste brine or salt. Currently the ""preferred"" method of long term storage of the waste salt is to bury it in sealed landfill sites, which is called salt encapsulation. ""The problem is that sort of salt encapsulation requires ongoing management,"" Professor Khan said. ""There will be leachate when it rains, that leachate needs to be managed, treated, salt probably replaced back into the landfill. It needs active management forever."" A spokesperson for the Queensland Department of Environment and Science (DES) said it continued to work with the industry, landholders, and environmental groups on a plan for the long-term storage of waste CSG salt. Ian Hayllor's neighbours oppose coal seam gas and he himself was once a sceptic — so why is he now supporting the industry? The DES did not specifically address questions about the long-term cost of managing waste CSG salt and who would pay. ""While encapsulation of salt has been identified as the most viable long-term solution, salt encapsulation facilities are not currently used by the industry,"" the DES spokesperson said. ""Any proposed encapsulation facility would be subject to a rigorous assessment process … including consideration for land rehabilitation and long-term management measures."" Third-generation cattle farmer Glen Beasley lives close to the We Kando waste facility near Chinchilla in southern Queensland, which has approvals to hold CSG salt. He said he was worried because it was on the Condamine River catchment. ""The possibility of contamination from either overfill of the ponds or leakage into the water table, the potential there is serious,"" Mr Beasley said. ""This is a legacy that future generations are going to have to deal with."" The ABC has contacted We Kando and understands it currently has no CSG waste salt on-site, and it has no short to medium-term plans to take any CSG waste salt. Shay Dougall, a Chinchilla local who advocates for landholders dealing with coal seam gas development, said the biggest ongoing problem for many was the lack of transparency. ""I don't believe this has been publicly dealt with properly, I don't think enough information is been made available,"" she said. ""And if it was, the information that's been made available today shows that this is going to be a long-term problem that has no real solution to it.""

94,Mullet cook-up a feast of ideas for the future of Northern Rivers' catchments,environment,"  NSW North Coast fishers host a mullet cook-up for flood-affected Clarence Valley About 100 kilograms of mullet has being cooked for a community gathering in NSW's North Coast, where the future of the region's waterways was a hot topic in the wake of recent flooding. It is the region's mullet run season, with the species traditionally prominent around Easter through to July, although the local commercial seafood industry was expecting numbers to be down following wet weather. This has not stopped Clarence River fisher Graeme Loy from catching a major haul and frying 600 fillets at McLachlan Park in Maclean today. ""The community needs a bit of a lift at the moment [as] there's been a few things going on, as we know, "" he said. ""That's nature [and] we'll bounce back from that."" The event was hosted by the Clarence River and Ballina fishermen's co-ops, the Yaegl Local Aboriginal Land Council, the NSW Department of Primary Industries and OzFish Unlimited, with funds raised going to the Yamba Lions Club to assist flood-affected areas. But it was also used as an opportunity to discuss how how the local industry should navigate natural disasters into the future. For Mr Loy, more effort is needed to help rehabilitate the local rivers. ""The river is a little bit crook from the things we do do it, but we need to at least acknowledge that we can do something to fix it,"" he said. ""There's a lot of area of the Clarence where we can put back riparian trees and try to give the river back its lungs. ""It's a complicated issue, but if we don't address it and don't talk about it, nothing's ever going to happen."" Local fishers on the Northern Rivers experienced a major blow last month following the floods, with mass fish kills detected in the Richmond and Clarence rivers. The widespread fish kills were due to a lack of oxygen in the water. OzFish Unlimited chief executive officer Craig Copeland said both rivers catchments were still recovering, but fish had returned to some parts. ""Around the bottom end of the rivers, it's just starting to improve so we're starting to get some cleaner water coming back in from the ocean,"" he said. ""But upstream it's full of sediment with low-levels of oxygen and it's very sub-optimal."" Along with riparian trees, Mr Copeland said restoration of degraded wetlands and shellfish reefs would help the overall health of the river, as well as its ability to recover following a future flooding event. But he said greater awareness of the issue was also required. ""For commercial fishers, fish is a big industry in the Clarence,  and it's hugely important for residents, recreational fishers and tourists,""  he said. ""We need to look after the fish in the river … improve the fish population, and we can do that by putting the habitat back.""

95,Poisonous mushroom warning issued for Victorians and their pets,environment,"  Department of Health issues poisonous mushroom warning for Victorians and their pets All Victorians are being urged to check their properties for wild mushrooms, which can put humans and their pets at risk of serious illness or even death. They might look like something straight from the pages of a Little Golden Book fairy tale, but there is nothing dainty about death cap (Amanita phalloides) or yellow-staining (Agaricus xanthodermus) mushrooms. The latter can cause nausea and vomiting, while the death cap is aptly named; eating just one can kill an adult. The department's advisory said cooking, peeling or drying the mushrooms would not remove or inactivate the poison. Both species are among the poisonous mushrooms cropping up across the state, according to the Department of Health's recent health advisory. Humans have been told to avoid collecting and consuming any wild mushrooms of unknown species and have been urged to keep their animals away from them. ""Pets can develop a range of illnesses from eating wild mushrooms, including gastroenteritis-type syndrome to severe life-threatening disease and death,"" Deputy Chief Health Officer Angie Bone said in a statement. RSPCA Victoria senior vet Christina Tee told ABC News dogs were more likely than cats to eat poisonous mushrooms. ""Just because dogs are more likely to sniff around, pet owners taking them out for a walk … it's more uncommon for cats to go out on a walk,"" Dr Tee said. There is added risk for working dogs operating on vast rural properties. ""The best thing to do is walk around your property and see if there are any wild mushrooms growing."" Dr Tee said if you located any mushrooms on your property, it was important to remove them carefully. ""It's hard to know what's poisonous and what's not. The only way to avoid your pet ingesting them is to remove the mushroom,"" she said. ""Wear gloves and avoid touching it, wash your hands after removing them, and make sure you put them in a plastic bag. ""Dispose of them safely, so your pets can't get to them afterwards."" The Department of Health said if people suspected the had eaten a poisonous mushroom, they should urgently attend an emergency department. If you believe your pet might have eaten one, contact your local vet immediately. In both circumstances, bringing the mushroom with you for identification purposes is recommended.

96,Prawn-like species sparks anti-corruption referral of gas-rich Beetaloo Basin contract ,environment,"  NT government referred to ICAC over its handling of fracking research contract in Beetaloo Basin The Northern Territory government has been referred to the anti-corruption watchdog over its handling of a research contract examining environmental risks of fracking in the Beetaloo Basin. Located about 500 kilometres south-east of Darwin, the Beetaloo Basin is a large shale gas field that has formed a critical part of the federal government's post-COVID ""gas-led recovery"". Before fracking begins in the region, baseline studies of the local environment are required to take place. But a NT government-appointed official has questioned the integrity of the tender process surrounding a research contract worth up to $287,991. ""The integrity of the procurement activity, and those involved in it, relies on properly documented defensible decision making, and its absence therefore leaves the outcome... open to question,"" Buy Local Advocate Denys Stedman wrote. In his referral to the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (ICAC), Mr Stedman said the NT's Environment Department approached researchers at Charles Darwin University (CDU) in 2020 to investigate shrimp-like ecosystems in the gas-rich region. After about one year of ""advanced"" discussions, a draft contract was allegedly signed by CDU, before the project was awarded to an interstate company for nearly double the price, the referral claims. Mr Stedman also claimed in the referral that one CDU scientist suspected the decision could be related to media coverage of a previous study that ""perhaps did not support the NT government's position on fracking"". At the time of the negotiations with the NT government, the CDU team, together with the CSIRO, had published findings that showed groundwater samples in the area contained at least 11 new species of rare shrimp-like invertebrates known as stygofauna. Politicians, environmentalists, traditional owners and gas company representatives have arrived in Darwin for a public hearing into the Beetaloo Basin. ""The discovery of these new NT species has implications for all extractive industries affecting groundwater,"" the researchers wrote in The Conversation in February last year. ""It shows the importance of thorough assessment and monitoring before work begins, to ensure damage to groundwater and associated ecosystems is detected and mitigated."" Despite the preliminary work conducted by CDU, the NT government announced in September last year that it had awarded the contract for further stygofauna assessment to WA company Biota Environmental Sciences. According to Mr Stedman's referral, the Environment Department decided against the $149,600 contract with CDU in favour of Biota for nearly double the price, at $287,991. Mr Stedman wrote that a CDU researcher had spent ""considerable intellectual property, time and energy"" helping to develop the scope of the contract. He said they believed they would be awarded the work under the CDU partnership agreement ""only to have the job cancelled at the last minute and awarded to someone from outside the NT at twice the price"". Mr Stedman wrote that he had a statutory obligation to refer to the ICAC matters of ""unsatisfactory conduct"", including conduct that results in ""the inappropriate or inefficient use of public resources"". A spokesperson for the NT's Environment Department said it would not comment publicly given the matter had been referred to ICAC. Independent Commissioner Against Corruption, Michael Riches, also would not comment publicly on the referral. Graeme Sawyer from anti-fracking group, Protect Country Alliance, called the decision to award an interstate company with a contract at a higher price an ""absolute farce"". ""When you look at this in the context of the broader issues of an MOU (memorandum of understanding) to try and build the research capacity in the Northern Territory… it just smacks of a really crass attitude,"" he said.

Huggins is one of a growing number of Australian farmers opting to combine conservation with agriculture, and dedicating a portion of their land to save Australia's threatened biodiversity. Savernake Station is renowned for its pastoral history, but also for its large white cypress pines and other old trees. These provide habitat for about 80 species of birds, including vulnerable species such as the diamond firetail and dusky wood swallow. The woodland survives because previous generations of her family, the Sloane family, fenced off part of the property in the early 1900s. They appreciated the bushland and understood that the sandy soils of this section of the property made it less suitable for grazing. ""We wouldn't have had any sheep or cattle here for over 100 years. So [we're grateful for] the foresight of my previous generations to have locked this area up. ""They were conservationists before their time, especially my father, who put into all his children that we looked after the country and the country looked after you,"" Huggins says. She took his words to heart. In 2018, she signed a conservation agreement with the New South Wales Biodiversity Conservation Trust to protect her portion of Savernake Station. She has registered the protection of 355 hectares on the property's title, setting the arrangement in place forever. The agreement with the trust requires the land be preserved as woodland, and weeds and feral animals like rabbits and foxes must be controlled. In return, Huggins receives an annual indexed payment. Her current home, Woodpark, is 90 kilometres away from Savernake Station. In 2018, she and husband Owen introduced a similar, in-perpetuity arrangement on their merino stud. They've fenced off a quarter of their 7,600-hectare property for conservation and the results are impressive. Saltbush, butterbush, boree trees and river red gums are regenerating, and the calls of the critically endangered plains-wanderer have been heard on Woodpark. A devastating bushfire in January 1987 marked a turning point for the couple and their approach to farming on the property. ""A lot of the stock were removed. We had no real rain till June that year. As late as May, there was still clouds of black, swirling dust and loose sand. Rain eventually came and what we began to see was how the land could recover if we let it,"" Owen Huggins says. After thinking deeply about how a conservation agreement and lower stock numbers may impact the income and land value of Woodpark, they agreed that the benefits outweighed any reservations. The environmental benefits have flow-on effects — the merino wool produced on Woodpark has just been given sustainable certification by New Zealand Merino and will be sold into the premium market. They also receive a premium price for their beef cattle. The ANU's Professor David Lindenmayer is a leading expert on forest ecology and conservation science. He supports paying farmers who are willing to protect habitat on their property, provided there's strong monitoring and transparency about what's happening on the ground. ""Approximately 55 per cent of Australia's land mass is private land that's used for agriculture and grazing. Those areas have enormous opportunities to restore the vegetation cover in part [and] better balance agricultural production [with] biodiversity,"" he says. There are also opportunities for carbon capture and storage, he adds. Professor Lindenmayer cites Australia's stark record on biodiversity loss as a reason for trying new approaches. There have been 34 mammal extinctions since colonisation and there are big declines in frogs and reptiles. One in six Australian birds are now threatened. ""And beyond that, some species are occupying only a tiny part of their former range, like the greater bilby which once lived across vast areas of Australia,"" he says. Recent research led by a University of Queensland team has found that 48 per cent of Australia's threatened species' distributions occur on private freehold land – and that conservation on farmland is critical to threatened species' recovery. Professor Lindenmayer says it's paradoxical that there is so much emphasis on putting trees and shrubs back into the landscape, while legislation still allows large amounts of land clearing, especially in New South Wales and Queensland. ""Most people don't realize that there's still an enormous amount of land clearing going on in Australia. Land clearing directly removes habitat [and] animals can't survive without access to habitat."" Improving and protecting habitat on privately owned land in Australia's farming districts is essential and he says there are increasing benefits for farmers. ""There's an understanding that the loss of biodiversity is as equally serious as rapid changes in climate and that they go together. ""People are starting to talk about what we call nature-based solutions to the climate problem that have co-benefits. That's conserving biodiversity, storing more carbon, reducing carbon emissions. So these things go hand-in-glove,"" he says. Brendan Fletcher frowns as he checks the weed growth in the paddocks of Thornhill Station. Fletcher is an Indigenous ranger for the Gidarjil Development Corporation in Southern Queensland. The Indigenous group owns three former cattle stations all about an hour's drive inland from Bundaberg, near Gin Gin and Bulburin National Park. All three properties have been returned to the traditional owners, the Meeroni people. But the upfront costs of revegetation are a major barrier to restoring land, says Gidargil's business development manager Angela Huston. So Gidarjil is taking part in the pilot of an agricultural stewardship scheme that opens new revenue sources for farmers interested in conservation. The stewardship scheme, designed in part by Professor Lindenmayer and his ANU colleague Professor Andrew Macintosh, includes a carbon and biodiversity pilot program. And under the pilot program, Gidarjil received an upfront payment of just over $200,000 from the federal government to revegetate part of one of their properties, Thornhill Station. This funding, along with income from other sources, has allowed them to remove cattle from the properties and the group no longer needs to rely on revenue from cattle agistment. “The vision now is to continue to restore the open paddocks to forest,” Huston says. Fletcher, who is also a traditional owner, will do a cool winter burn on Thornhill Station to get rid of weeds and prepare the small but significant site for tree planting. Because each project in the pilot is registered under Australia's Emissions Reduction Fund, the trees will earn Gidarjil carbon credits. These should increase as the trees grow. Carbon credits are units representing carbon reduction that are bought and sold like stocks. Companies like airlines buy them to offset their carbon footprint. The ANU's Professor Andrew Macintosh, who recently exposed the rorts in Australia's carbon market, says the Gidarjil project is best practice – it's how carbon farming should work. ""[The tree planting] is likely to generate positive benefits for biodiversity because the plantings must be established and managed in accordance with biodiversity planting protocols,"" Macintosh says. Huston says the opportunity to earn money from carbon farming and habitat creation shifts the dial for Indigenous landholders. ""It changes dramatically. It allows our people to be on country doing what we do best, looking after country, making it healthier. That in itself is a reward. ""But to be able to gain an ongoing revenue stream from that is important, it means that there's less reliance on any government funding."" Fletcher can't wait to start planting out a diverse range of species to create extra habitat for locally threatened species such as the long-nosed potoroo and the silver-headed antechinus. He'll also continue working to control feral pigs. ""I love getting up in the morning coming to work. It is what I do. It's my drive, it's my passion to manage country."" Greg Rummery farms dryland crops on the flat, clay floodplains of the Namoi River near Walgett in north-western NSW. His 1,000-hectare farm is small by local standards, but in 2019 he decided to retain about a quarter of his property for conservation. The fenced-off area forms a corridor of green along the banks of the river, with a mix of older trees and newer regrowth. The river red gums and coolabah trees still bear the high-water marks from the 2021 floods. Rummery says a common practice in his district would be to farm crops like wheat or lentils on the flat floodplain and run beef cattle along the river, providing farmers with two sources of income. ""But rather than trying to generate a dollar out of that by running stock in there and having them graze down to the waterline on the river and using the river as the boundary, I thought there's got to be a better way."" When the Biodiversity Conservation Trust called for expressions of interest from landholders in the Walgett district in 2018, Rummery says it struck a chord. ""Maybe there's a better use for [that land] than trying to farm it or trying to flog it with stock. You know, that's the bit that needs incentivising,"" he says. Rummery's annual payment of just over $20,000 requires him to allow regrowth to continue, control weeds and keep on top of fox and wild pig numbers. The agreement runs for 15 years. After extreme drought conditions between 2013-15 and again from 2017-19, Rummery says the benefits of diversifying income became clear. Meet the farmers like Helen, Greg, Brendan and Angela who are setting aside a portion of their land for conservation. ""Effectively, in those drought years, we didn't have any farm income. So the income from the biodiversity agreement was valuable. It's only a small contribution, though."" The idea is catching on, Rummery says. He also works as a consultant agronomist and he has helped six other landholders sign similar conservation deals. ""It was a bit left field when I first signed up. There was a bit of scepticism. Let's move beyond that. And let's encourage all private landholders to look at their landholding and go, 'You know what, that bit down there is interesting or important.'"" ""It's putting a dollar value on conservation. It's saying conservation is a real land use."" There's a new focus on the role of private land conservation — the federal Threatened Species Strategy Action Plan for 2021-26 promotes working with land managers and includes targets such as increasing the area managed for conservation by 50 million hectares. And key players in the on-the-ground conservation sector, including Bush Heritage, Landcare and Australian Wildlife Conservancy, have recently formed the Australian Land Conservation Alliance. One of the Alliance's aims is to encourage commercial models that fund conservation and land restoration. Whether these goals will be enough to stop ongoing habitat loss and Australia's growing list of threatened and endangered species remains to be seen. But their future hangs in the balance.

98,Lyra was being hassled at school for catching bugs and frogs. So her mum emailed Dr Ann Jones,environment," Science Why women scientists are rallying around six-year-old bug and frog lover Lyra Six-year-old Lyra loves catching frogs in her backyard in summer. ""We have lots of [frogs] in the summer, they have a secret hiding spot at the back of the pond,"" says Lyra, who lives in Ontario, Canada. ""We just put a bucket in and try and scoop up the frogs."" Lyra has loved frogs, bugs and spiders since she was very young, says her mum Julie. ""Lyra's been picking up spiders since she was 11 months old, I can't get her to stop. ""She was just crawling and I stepped into the other room and I came back and she was holding something and giggling up a storm. ""She had a wolf spider crawling all over her."" But when Lyra started coming home from school saying, ""girls shouldn't like catching frogs"" or ""catching bugs is only for boys"", Julie became concerned. ""You can't help think that it's coming from her peers as her teacher is really trying to support her love of science,"" she says. ""I'm a mum in Canada that has very limited people that know about science. ""How do I help a six-year-old?"" So Julie emailed Dr Ann Jones, presenter of ABC Science's What the Duck?! podcast, asking for some encouraging words and inspiration for her young daughter. Dr Jones contacted women scientists around the world to share their stories about their love of bugs, frogs and spiders, and how they broke through barriers and carved out successful careers in science. Here's what they'd like Lyra and other children to know. Jodi Rowley is often knee deep in mud in jungles studying frogs and runs a whole department at the Australian Museum. The amphibian biologist, who grew up in the city, says there's no ""type"" of person who can become a scientist. ""It wasn't instilled in me that I should be outdoors and exploring, but I managed to get there eventually,"" Dr Rowley says. ""I am uncoordinated, I used to climb trees and get stuck. I'm allergic to bees and ants. I'm probably not a natural person to be out in the field."" She wants Lyra to know that she's not alone. ""There are people across the world who are passionate about spiders, snakes, and all types of things … we need more people with passion and care. ""You will find your people and you will find your place, and the world will be better off for it."" Amber Beavis is one of those people who just loves staring at spiders up close. While she now works in science policy in the office of Australia's chief veterinary officer, she says her fascination for spiders won't ever go away after a career working as an academic and spider scientist at the Western Australian Museum. Dr Beavis's mother was a geologist in a typically male field, so she grew up with strong messages about girls going into science, yet she still experienced academic theft and glass ceilings in her career. ""I was a little bit of a 'goth' when I was in my 20s, I had bright pink hair and Doc Martens."" Australia is the land of the fair go and yet we have fewer women in sciences than many developing countries. Dr Beavis said an older male academic told her she didn't ""look how a scientist should look"". She said it was important not to compromise on the need to be herself. ""If folks aren't comfortable with that, then it says more about them than it does about you. "" Dr Beavis said she was incredibly sad to hear Lyra's story. ""Lyra, if you are interested in bugs and creepy crawlies and have that talent for observation, then just get to it. ""Enjoy it, ask questions, and be curious."" Maydianne Andrade also loves spiders. Her lab at the University of Toronto has around 1,500 deadly black widows. That might sound scary, but Dr Andrade says spiders are the least of her worries as a female scientist and woman of colour. ""I did my field research on redback spiders, which are neurotoxic, by myself overnight and people would say 'weren't you terrified?' ""I rode my bike to and from the field site and I was scared of humans. If people drove by then I would hide in the bushes. ""It is a really sad statement that I was in this population of like 100 neurotoxic spiders and what I was afraid of was the people who might not expect to see me in the field."" Dr Andrade says young women are sometimes treated differently to men so they need to stay confident. ""[Being treated differently to men] can erode your self-esteem and your confidence because it often involves questioning you much more than someone else would be questioned; questioning your ideas and not in a good scientific, rigorous way, but in just an 'I don't respect your intellect' way."" Entomologist Tanya Latty loves all sorts of insects and is at home exploring the world and its strange bugs and creatures. She said she'd hoped we'd moved past assumptions around women in science by now. ""I hope that [Lyra] learns that she shouldn't care what people say. ""I'd like [Lyra] to be able to go forward and be who she is, love her tadpoles and not worry about what the rest of the world thinks,"" she says. Dr Latty, who works at the University of Sydney, says she plays up her nerdiness with clipboards and shirts with insects on them so that other people don't think she's doing anything illegal while working in the field. ""When you're a non-white biologist in the field, [you're] very aware that people will see you creeping around and just make assumptions about what you are actually doing there."" Other women from Australia and Canada also wanted to encourage Lyra, and sent in videos. Julie and Lyra joined Dr Jones in an online chat from Canada and shared their excitement about the videos made just for them by scientists from around the world. ""That's just amazing. If this is something she truly does love, then we are going to do what we can to make that happen for her,"" Julie says. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

99,Microplastic prevention 'long overdue' after study finds particles in SA mussels,environment,"  Microplastics found in mussels along South Australian beaches, study reveals Wild blue mussels in South Australia are eating about three and a half pieces of microplastics – a much larger meal of unwanted waste than researchers initially expected, a study shows. Flinders University has measured the presence of microplastics along South Australia's coastline for the first time Microplastics were found at every beach examined They say wild blue mussels are swallowing microplastic At every beach sampled by Flinders University researchers, microplastic fibres and fragments were found in either the water or the sand including at Ceduna, Coffin Bay, Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Robe and Adelaide. It's the first time the presence of microplastics along South Australia's coastline has been measured. Biodiversity and conservation expert Karen Burke da Silva said researchers were surprised to find as much pollution as they did. ""We thought that Coffin Bay would be one of the lowest as it's such a clean area and not a high industry area, but we found a lot of microplastics there – much of it fishing line,"" Professor Burke de Silva said. Researchers found fibres came from people's clothing and fishing line, while fragments came from bigger chunks of plastic floating in the ocean. They believe while the pieces are microscopic in size, microplastics could be taking a toll on the environment, marine life, and potentially humans. ""We eat mussels and a variety of other seafoods, whatever health effects the microplastics are having on the seafood then it'll have a run-on effect to humans,"" Professor Burke da Silva said. She said there was a potential for microplastics to find their way into human food supplies sourced from South Australian waters. ""We know it causes inflammatory responses in mussels, it can affect their reproduction and digestive season. ""If these marine organisms are having a negative health reaction to microplastics then humans presumably will too."" Professor Burke de Silva said it was important the study led to a change in local waste management. ""Each area needs to think about what specifically is being added to the ocean from their sites. ""We want to ensure that councils are looking into some industries that are adding microplastics to the water. ""We don't want it to get worse. We do know it's coming from South Australia — it's unlikely it's drifting in from other parts of the world."" She also said the aquaculture industry might also need to assess where they were farming. ""I think it's also very important that we look at where mussels and other seafood is being farmed because if you want to avoid any kind of accumulation of microplastics then you want it in areas with low levels of pollution."" Microplastics were found to be more abundant in mussel samples near larger towns and cities, with levels four times higher at Semaphore Beach compared to the more remote Ceduna on Eyre Peninsula. But Professor Burke da Silva said other sites tested, while not as high in microplastic samples, have greater ecological significance. ""Whyalla, for example, is a breeding ground of the great cuttlefish in the Northern Spencer Gulf and [there are] marine ecosystems more diverse than the Great Barrier Reef [that] live in the waters of Coffin Bay. ""So clean-up and prevention measures are long overdue."" Eyre Peninsula Seafoods chief executive Mark Andrews said any type of non-natural waste in water was a cause for concern, but farmed seafood, such as mussels, was monitored closely. ""These types of wastes accumulate over many years along the shoreline. This research paper has assessed mussels that are along the shoreline, only in intertidal water zones,"" he said. ""These particular mussels would have been there for 20 years or more, the growth in any intertidal zone is 100 per cent slower than in a subtidal zone where all farmed mussels in Australia are grown. ""All mussel harvesting zones in Australia are kilometres from the shoreline, where the mussels are grown 2 metres below the surface and are harvested within 12 months. ""The pristine waters of South Australia are monitored and managed by PIRSA's Aquaculture and the South Australian Shellfish Quality Assurance Program."" Mr Andrews said there has never been any evidence of microplastics in farmed mussels. He said the industry was finding ways to fight pollution. ""Each company is allocated kilometres of shoreline where four times a year we walk and collect all waste which is weighed and recorded.""

100,Plans to build 'world's largest solar project' in northern Australia reach new milestone,environment,"  Environmental impact statement released for Sun Cable's $30 billion solar energy project Plans to build a massive solar energy project would result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in northern Australia but could also cause adverse effects, an environmental impact assessment (EIS) has found. Sun Cable intends to spend more than $30 billion on its Australia-Asia PowerLink, which would harness solar energy in the Northern Territory and transmit the power to Singapore via undersea cables. The company said it would be the world's largest solar energy infrastructure project. The project would have several ""potentially transformational"" positive impacts, including a 10 per cent reduction in the NT's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the EIS. It would also have the capacity to supply up to 15 per cent of Singapore's energy needs. Sun Cable hopes to begin construction in 2024 and expects the first phase to generate 1,750 jobs, as well as another 350 ongoing jobs across the project's 70-year lifespan. ""The lodgement of the EIS to the NT [Environment Protection Authority] is a significant milestone for the AAPowerLink,"" Sun Cable chief executive David Griffin said. The project includes several major elements, including a huge ""solar precinct"" near Elliott in the NT's Barkly region, where photovoltaic solar arrays would be installed on 12,000 hectares of land to generate up to 20 gigawatts of power, some of which would be stored in batteries. Sun Cable dramatically upscales plans to build a $30 billion solar farm in the NT, as Indonesia greenlights an undersea cable to Singapore. About 3.2 gigawatts of renewable energy would then be transmitted along 788 kilometres of overhead transmission lines, largely following the railway corridor to Darwin. A converter site would be set up on the coastline at Murrumujuk, 31 kilometres east of Darwin, where about 800 megawatts of power would be channelled into Darwin's electricity supply — almost double the region's current demand. The remaining power would then be transferred to undersea cables at the nearby Gunn Point beach where a subsea system involving three separate cables would run 4,200 kilometres to a converter station in Singapore. The EIS identified a range of potentially negative environmental impacts, which were categorised as minor to moderate risks. They included possible impacts on vulnerable plant species, including Darwin Cycads, near the converter site at Murrumujuk and nearby Gunn Point. Almost seven per cent of another threatened plant species known as Typhonium praetermissum would also be removed from the area. However, the EIS said the project was unlikely to affect fauna, including the Greater Bilby, the Yellow-spotted Monitor and eight threatened species of migratory shorebirds. It noted the undersea cables would pass through areas where several threatened and migratory marine animals occur, including turtles, dugongs, pygmy blue whales and whale sharks. But it found any impacts associated with extra noise and light from vessels, or electromagnetic fields from the cables, were minor. Sun Cable said it was conducting further surveys of threatened species to address any knowledge gaps. The EIS also noted that weeds could spread as a result of land clearing in the project areas. Among several other potentially negative impacts, Sun Cable flagged the prospect of reduced housing affordability and availability due to the influx of a large workforce. It also noted the possibility of increased COVID-19 outbreaks as a result of transient workers. The company said it was working closely with traditional owners to negotiate Indigenous Land Use Agreements. It said it also required approvals from the NT's Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority to ensure sacred sites would not be impacted. Sun Cable said the 800 megawatts of renewable energy it hopes to provide to the Darwin region ""will unlock new green industries including hydrogen and manufacturing."" Sun Cable is yet to secure contracts to supply renewable energy to Singapore, however it is understood commercial discussions are continuing with potential customers. In March, the company announced it had secured $210 million from existing shareholders, including Australian billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, to fund the development of the project. Last September, Sun Cable said it had received support from the Indonesian government for the project's electricity cables to travel through its waters. The EIS is open for public submissions until July 15.

101,"David Speirs stands by Murray-Darling Basin decisions, says 'heavy lifting' sits with other states",environment," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes David Speirs stands by water record despite Murray-Darling Basin criticisms New South Australian Liberal leader David Speirs says past criticism of his Murray-Darling Basin dealings will not affect his vote in areas that rely on a healthy Murray River. Mr Speirs was elected leader on Tuesday, but his conduct while negotiating basin policy came under fire while he was water minister in the former Marshall government. The 2019 royal commission into the basin's management found Mr Speirs had ""capitulated to the Commonwealth, Victorian and New South Wales governments when negotiating the return of environmental water to the basin. In the aftermath of the commission, he survived the then-Labor opposition's vote of no confidence to retain his position. Speaking after gaining the leadership, Mr Speirs said the commission's findings were ""vindictive"" and he stood by his decisions while water minister. ""Riverland voters know that river inside out and I always felt they completely supported every decision I made with regard to the River Murray,"" he said. ""They [Riverland voters] understood the decisions I made in a much better way than the commentators in Adelaide."" Look back at how the 2022 Australian federal election unfolded He added the state ""needed to be careful that the extremist views of that politically based royal commission never come to pass"". ""We have to remember that [the] royal commission was comprised of several former Labor party staffers, ripping the credibility out of it from day one,"" Mr Speirs said. ""The Riverland is better off for it. The Riverland has got more environmental flows, the projects that are delivering water towards that 450 gigalitre, that water's coming down the river. It's slower than I'd like but it's getting there. ""Those projects are coming on board for one reason because I was able to keep other states at the table."" Liberal Member for Chaffey Tim Whetstone agreed the royal commision's findings of Mr Speirs were influenced by Labor. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Riverland's weekly email newsletter. ""I don't agree with the commissioner. I think he was way off the mark and he became political in telling people that the then-minister Speirs had capitulated,"" Mr Whetstone said. ""They were Labor's words, they would not be findings of the basin states and I think we just need to put that into context."" New water minister and deputy premier Susan Close had a different view of the 2019 royal commission, saying there had been no evidence Mr Speirs' deal had delivered more environmental water for SA. ""We've had two gigalitres of the 450GL and none of it came under David Speirs' time as minister,"" she said. ""Although he says 'I know better than everyone, I'll do a deal with them and it'll be fine', in fact we've only seen everything go backwards since that capitulation. ""There is nowhere near enough projects that will give us the 450GL and there's no political appetite from Canberra."" Water policy is set to feature as a key issue to basin voters during the upcoming federal election, with Labor guaranteeing South Australia will receive the environmental water promised to it in the basin plan if it wins government. Labor has not ruled out using water buybacks to achieve this though, something opposed by the Coalition, particularly Barker MP Tony Pasin. Last year, the Nationals attempted to move a motion in the Senate which would have drastically lowered the amount of environmental water SA would receive, but it was defeated by both major parties and the Greens. Mr Speirs backed having water buybacks as a last-resort option for water recovery but said he wanted other initiatives to be used first. ""There's many other efficiency projects and infrastructure projects that can manage the Murray-Darling Basin before you get to buybacks,"" he said. ""But you shouldn't chuck buybacks out of the toolkit because those buybacks go to action, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales. ""South Australia has contributed most of the water that it can through efficiency measures and the heavy lifting now sits in the other jurisdictions.""

102,International financier halts loan for multi-billion dollar NT gas project ,environment,"  South Korean financier pauses loan for multi-billion dollar Barossa gas project Environmentalists and traditional owners in the Northern Territory have claimed a win in their bid to derail one of the biggest recent projects in the nation's oil and gas sector. Larrakia and Tiwi Islander traditional owners, along with an international coalition of anti-gas groups, are targeting plans for a $4.7 billion Barossa gas development, to be built and operated by Santos, in waters about 300 kilometres north of Darwin. In legal action filed in a South Korean court last month, traditional owners sought to prevent two of that country's export credit agencies from funding the offshore gasfield with almost $1 billion in loans. Some elders say they do not support a pipeline, which is proposed to run through a habitat protection zone, as part of the project. One of the agencies in the legal action, the government-backed Export-Import Bank of Korea or KEXIM, has now delayed a decision on whether to invest in Santos's South Korean joint venture partner, energy company SK E&S. ""Projects like Barossa often need that type of public money in order for private financiers to come in and support the project,"" Dina Rui from Jubilee Australia, one of three groups campaigning against the project, said. ""Without that type of public money from South Korea, it could very well mean that the future of Barossa is on shaky ground. The size of the loan being considered by KEXIM, alongside the reasons a decision was delayed, are not known. But environmental groups suspect the pause is linked to environmental concerns they have been raising with South Korean stakeholders. South Korean campaign group Solutions for our Climate said it was ""very rare"" for a project to be considered by a KEXIM committee and not be approved. ""Given that KEXIM's credit expansion committee includes the President of the bank and is conservative with its decision-making, the investment delay indicates that KEXIM views this project as significantly risky — although they are not being upfront about this concern with the public,"" climate finance researcher Dongjae Oh wrote in response to questions over email. The plans for the Barossa development include building a floating production facility, underwater production wells, and a gas pipeline linking the Timor Sea to an LNG processing facility on Darwin Harbour. The project has been linked to Australia's gas-led recovery from COVID-19 and has been anticipated to provide about 350 ongoing jobs once production begins in 2025. Mr Oh said two other investors had already approved their financing for the project, so KEXIM's decision was ""directly linked to the future of the Barossa project"". ""Currently, South Korea's K-SURE and Japan's JBIC have approved their financing, so the project's financing hinges on KEXIM,"" he wrote. Tibby Quall, a Larrakia elder from Darwin, said his family was never consulted about the project. ""It's a huge development and I have a lot of concerns for the harbour and the pristine areas of our country,"" he said. ""We've only got a small harbour, but we want to keep everything pristine for everybody."" Santos declined to comment while the matter was before the courts. The resources giant is the lead company and has a 50 per cent stake in the Barossa project, which reached a final investment decision last year, but is not involved in the legal action. Contacted after lawyers acting on behalf of traditional owners filed for an injunction in March, the company said it had ""all the necessary approvals in place."" But gas industry regulator National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA) said further approvals were required before the project could move to production. The company has previously said it had consulted with stakeholders. ""As is the case for all of our projects, we undertake consultation with all key stakeholders where they receive detailed information about the project,"" a spokesperson previously told the ABC. Santos has previously said it planned to investigate options for carbon-neutral LNG production through processes such as carbon capture and storage and carbon credits.

104,The goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C is slipping from our grasp. Here's what 2C means,environment," Science 1.5 vs 2C: What difference can a lousy half a degree of global warming make? What started as quiet concern is growing much louder among climate scientists: without a very radical change of course within the next few years, we're not going to stop the world from passing 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. At the rate we're going, we've got around 10 years until we hit 1.5C. In terms of the numbers: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) finds that limiting warming to 1.5C requires global emissions to be slashed by 45 per cent by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. Research published in Nature forecasts 2030 CO2 emissions to be between 6 -10 per cent higher than 2010 levels. ""It's exceedingly unlikely that we will manage to limit warming to below 1.5C without overshoot,"" according to climate scientist Zeke Hausfather from Berkeley Earth and the Breakthrough Institute, who co-authored a commentary on the research in Nature, but wasn't associated with the study. ""Avoiding 1.5C with no or little overshoot requires cutting all global emissions in half in the next eight years."" The Nature research shows that even if — and it's a big if — every signatory country meets their 2030 emissions reduction commitments and net-zero commitments, which were agreed to at or since last year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, warming could flatten out at between 1.9C and 2C by the end of the century. Previous analysis has put us on track to hit at least 2.1C, and as much as 3.9C, by the end of the century. However, there have been some changes to commitments since then. But what's the big deal about 1.5C anyway? Why is that the number that scientists focus on, and how much does it matter if we overshoot 1.5C and instead limit warming to around 2C? These are some of the differences that half a degree will make. ""1.5 to stay alive"" is a movement spearheaded by many low-lying island nations, including our Pacific neighbours, who see any breach of 1.5C as literally that bleak. A report by Carbon Brief, which analysed 70 research papers comparing 1.5C and 2C, found that globally we can expect an average of about 56 centimetres of sea level rise this century at 2C — but up to 96cm in the worst-case scenario. That's about 10cm more, on average, when compared to 1.5C. That extra 10cm, according to the IPCC, is expected to impact an extra 10.4 million people, either directly through inundation of coastal homes or through crippling of food-growing lands and livelihoods. Many of those 10.4 million, including residents of some of the low-lying islands of our Pacific region, are expected to become climate refugees. Sea-level rise doesn't happen equally around the globe. One variable is what is called gravitational self-attraction. Things with mass have gravity, and things with huge mass like the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have enough gravity that they pull the oceans towards them. As their mass is reduced, the seas will settle out towards the lower latitudes, causing more substantial rises around the tropics and sub-tropics, which includes the Australian coastline and our Pacific neighbours. One research paper published in Nature Climate Change in 2020 forecast that at 70cm of sea-level rise, around 12,000 kilometres of Australia's coastline — around 40 per cent of our beaches —  will recede by more than 100 metres. At 1.5C, the Northern Hemisphere can also expect an ice-free Arctic summer around every once in 33 years, rising to around once every seven years at 2C (and nearly two in every three years at 3C). An extra 1.5 to 2.5 million square kilometres of permafrost will also melt at 2C by 2300. Though weather varies regionally, on average we can expect longer, more intense droughts, longer, hotter heatwaves and fewer but more extreme rainfall events at both 1.5C and 2C. According to the Carbon Brief report, globally we can expect a 16 per cent increase in hot days each year at 1.5C, and a 25 per cent increase or 35 more hot days each year at 2C. Just over a seventh of the world's population will face a severe heat wave at least once in five years at 1.5C, but that jumps to more than a third at 2C, and the frequency of warm extremes jumps by 343 per cent at 2C. An extra 62 million people will be exposed to drought each year if we reach 2C, compared to 1.5C. Tropical cyclones are expected to become less frequent, but extreme cyclones are predicted to be more intense when they do hit. At 2C, an extra 12 million people are expected to be flooded in coastal areas each year compared to at 1.5C. In Australia, the frequency of warm extremes is forecast to jump more than 400 per cent in the north at 2C, and 234 per cent in southern regions. Cold extremes will become less frequent nationwide, but extreme rainfall events will increase. The length of droughts is also expected to marginally increase, while as many as 1 million people in northern Australia could face water scarcity at 2C. It's worth pointing out here that if we breach 1.5C, the next target doesn't automatically default to 2C. Every nth-of-a-degree is crucial, according to Kathryn Bowen, deputy director of Melbourne Climate Futures at the University of Melbourne. ""Everything we know about the impacts of climate change and health is going to be made worse if we miss 1.5 degrees,"" Professor Bowen said. ""We want to aim for 1.5C, but 2C isn't the backstop — every single point between 1.5C and 2C is going to bring challenges."" In many developing countries, the biggest health threats posed by climate change involve nutrition and water. ""Globally, the biggest threat is coming from food and water insecurity and human health,"" Professor Bowen said. In northern Africa, for instance, the average drought is predicted to be 7 months longer at 1.5C versus 20 months longer at 2C (at 3C, it's 60 months longer). In East Africa, 6 million more people are expected to suffer water scarcity at 1.5C. At 2C, that rises to 22 million more people. But Australia faces different challenges. ""In Australia it's mainly around heat, and extreme weather events — fire, droughts, floods."" At 2C of warming, the IPCC predicts extreme temperatures will reach 50C or more in Melbourne and Sydney. And annual heat-related deaths in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane could average 600 per year between 2031 and 2081, up from the current average 142. But almost every climate impact is intertwined with health — both directly and indirectly — and the closer we get to 2C, the greater the risks become. The obvious ones are deaths during heatwaves or floods, bushfires or cyclones. But others are less visible. Longer droughts or intense floods threaten food availability and nutrition; extreme weather events can damage medical infrastructure and cut access to medicine and treatment in the aftermath; lingering flood waters can carry disease; lost income means families may be less able to afford medical care. And then there's the compounding trauma of suffering extreme weather events in succession, such as we've seen recently with flooding in northern New South Wales. Although there is no research yet to quantify the potential jump in negative mental health outcomes between 1.5C and 2C,  extreme weather events can be triggers for disorders like PTSD, anxiety and depression. ""There's a lot more research pointing to the negative impacts of health and climate,"" Professor Bowen said. ""We could expect that the mental health impacts, like other health issues, would be amplified."" Eco-anxiety and ""solastalgia"" — the distress of seeing natural environments that are important to us being harmed — are already on the rise. ""The eco-anxiety stuff is particularly linked with [climate change] and it's particularly coming out in young people,"" Professor Bowen said. ""It's an issue of intergenerational justice really — it's impacting on women's decision to have children."" We don't have to look far to see the early impacts of climate change on animals and ecosystems. ""The Great Barrier Reef is the canary in the coal mine,"" according to Malte Meinshausen, University of Melbourne climate scientist and co-author of the Nature paper. ""The main tourist advice is to see the Great Barrier Reef while it's there [because] it won't be with us for too long."" He said we could have saved most of the reef if we'd acted decisively 20 years ago, and that today we're faced with a similar choice. ""What we have in our hands is whether we put other ecosystems though the same fate as the Great Barrier Reef or we limit warming to as close to 1.5C as possible."" Between 70 and 90 per cent of tropical corals will disappear at 1.5C, rising to more than 99 per cent at 2C, according to the IPCC. In the Daintree rainforest in tropical far north Queensland, ecologists say they are already recording the decline of a number of bird and mammal species. Some are being pushed further up mountains as the lowlands warm, and others are suffering in longer heatwaves. ""The lowland species are moving into the midlands, the midlands species are declining,"" Steven Williams from James Cook University told the ABC earlier this year. ""A lot of the endemic [bird] species … most of them have already declined by up to 30 per cent, some to 60 per cent."" It's a trend that is going to get worse in many ecosystems across the planet. At 1.5C, 4 per cent of mammals will lose more than half their natural range. At 2C, that doubles to 8 per cent. For insects, those numbers are 6 per cent at 1.5 degrees and 18 per cent at 2C (at 4.5C it jumps to 67 per cent). Many species already living in reduced habitat and facing other pressures, like deforestation, are likely to go extinct. But predicting exactly which species are going to be driven to extinction is difficult, according to Lesley Hughes from the Climate Council and a biologist at Macquarie University. ""It's often those relatively rare, but getting less rare, extreme events that absolutely have a transformational impact in a very short time span,"" Professor Hughes said. We've already seen bushfires pushing into Gondwanan rainforest in Tasmania and sub-tropical rainforest in Queensland — habitat that should not burn and which will need thousands of years to recover. From the arid woodlands of central Australia to mangrove forests in the Gulf of Carpentaria, a damning report has found that 19 of the 20 Australian ecosystems studied are heading toward collapse if we don't intervene. And there are plenty more ecosystems in Australia already on the decline. ""We know that there are at least 19 significant ecosystems in Australia that are collapsing in their range right now,"" Professor Hughes said. ""This has happened in some cases quite quickly and in others it's happened over decades. ""It doesn't take an ecologist to say that if this is happening at 1.3 degrees, well 1.4C in Australia ... let's imagine Black Summers occurring twice as often, floods occurring twice as often, bleaching occurring twice as often, then it's pretty easy to say its going to be worse."" Tipping points are the great unknowns of climate change. A tipping point is a threshold which, when crossed, sets off an unstoppable cascade toward a complete change in the state of a system. The Amazon rainforest is believed to be approaching a tipping point which could see it transform to savanna and grassland over decades. There are also warning signs of the collapse of the Gulf Stream — a warm Atlantic current which helps moderate the climate of the eastern United States and western Europe. And then there are the tipping points for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. ""If the whole Greenland ice sheet goes, over centuries it will add seven metres [to sea levels],"" Dr Meinshausen said. ""We don't know where the tipping point for the Greenland ice sheet to melt irreversibly is — it may be at 1.5 degrees, it may be at 3C — we don't know, but we keep our chances best if we limit warming to 1.5 degrees."" So what can possibly be the good news in all of this? Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. The good news is, we have the ability to stop it — to limit warming to as close to 1.5C as possible and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The technology exists and the know-how exists. If political leaders act with an immediate urgency to drive a global overhaul of energy, transport, agriculture and industry, the very rapid replacement of coal, oil and gas with renewables, and to plug the emissions gaps with scientifically validated offsets and drawdown — it can still happen. At this point what is missing is the political will, according to Dr Meinshausen. ""To be as close as possible to 1.5 degrees, there needs to be accelerated action to 2030,"" he said. ""Most countries updated their 2030 [emissions reduction] targets. Australia is one of the few who didn't. ""The world still has a chance to avoid catastrophic climate change.""

105,The waters have gone down and now this whole town is wrestling with one question,environment,"  After the floods, Lismore residents grapple with the question: to stay or to go? After two major floods in little more than a month, Lismore is facing an existential crisis. Should residents stay or go — and where? Joel North is sitting on a steep staircase like a ladder that takes you up to the bridge where a captain would steer the wheel of a ship. But this is no sea-going vessel — it's the house Joel and his wife Anita have been building since 2012, bit by bit on the Wilsons River in North Lismore. Their dream was to make their home flood-proof. ""So we re-pitched the roof and then put a level in there and had a deck so we could get out if we ever had to,"" says Joel. He climbs the ladder to a very special room built a full 14 metres above sea level — roughly the height of a semi-trailer standing end on end — and six metres off the ground. This room in the roof cavity is the family's ""flood refuge room"". ""If there was a big flood in the house, then we could get up and sleep here."" That's not the only modification. ""We've got bookshelves up high, pretty much at the ceiling. We have hooks in the ceiling, so our lounges, our mattresses can all be suspended."" Joel and Anita bought this place for just $170,000 and have worked on it ever since, says Anita. ""We've spent 10 years sort of crafting and sanding and building and dreaming, and it's like this running joke with everybody when they come to our house — ‘Is there a new deck now … or like, another room?'"" In 2017, when a huge flood did come through Lismore, their hard work paid off. ""It totally works. Yeah, we saved everything. We didn't lose a thing that flood, not one thing,"" says Joel. Background Briefing is daring narrative journalism — Australian investigations with impact. Listen for free on the ABC Listen app, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, or your favourite podcast app. But in 2019, their idyllic life by the river was shattered. And not by a natural disaster. One day while Anita was pregnant with their little boy Heath, Joel had a sudden seizure. He was diagnosed with brain cancer. Doctors gave him two years to live. That was three years ago. Surgeons removed a golf-ball sized tumour from his head. The procedure temporarily paralysed the left side of Joel's body and left him with a limp. That limp was with him when in late February this year, storms upon storms saw the Wilson river rising quickly again. It was Sunday the 27th when Anita and Heath moved to higher ground and Joel began moving things higher up in the house. ""We have phases in our flood strategy,"" explains Anita. ""Phase one: water over the slab under the house — OK, lift it above that. Phase two: water above the factory space — we also work from home — lift it above that."" Joel kept moving things up, just as they'd planned. ""We kept getting more and more updates, and it was like 10 metres, then 11 metres, 12 metres …"" ""It must've been like two o'clock [am] … it said 13 metres. And I was just so exhausted and started stacking things higher, but the water was already in the house. My stack started falling over and I was just like, I'm going to sleep, came up here, slept for maybe an hour."" Joel woke and realised he too was about to go underwater. He called Anita, and she told him it was time to leave. ""He called me and I said, 'Honey, whatever you've saved is enough.' And he just went quiet on the other end of the line. And then he started crying and he said, 'I haven't saved anything, it's all underwater.' And I could picture him there and how exhausted he was."" Joel was standing in a foot of water, in his flood refuge room, in the house they thought was flood-proof. He mentally froze. ""I had to talk him through putting a life jacket on because he was having such a panic attack,"" says Anita. ""Put your phone in your bag, paddle our canoe from the roof of our house to our neighbour's house. Get to people."" Joel had recently bought a lightweight kayak that he'd stashed in his flood-proof room. He'd even built a small gate on the side of his uppermost deck. He opened it, kicked a floating fridge out of the way, put his kayak in the water and paddled away. Joel, Anita and two-year-old Heath are now staying in a house in Ballina lent to them by friends. The one thing they know for certain is they can no longer live in their Lismore home, says Anita. ""Now I'm sort of dreaming up more like a buyback situation where possibly the government is able to buy back these places and we can use those funds to try and start somewhere else."" Something similar happened in the tiny south-east Queensland town, Grantham — the government offered residents blocks on high ground after the devastating 2011 floods. So far, Lismore's mayor has rejected calls to relocate the town's CBD to higher ground. Whatever happens, the fracturing of the community adds another layer of loss for its residents. ""That's what's broken my heart, really,"" says Anita. ""It's not the destruction of stuff in my home, which is replaceable. What's broken my heart is that I have to find somewhere else to live, which isn't just as simple as finding another roof over our heads. ""It's like, my dad lives around the corner from us, our closest friends on the land next to us — we have a hobby farm together. ""I birthed my baby at home. It's rich and it's deep. ""[But] I feel like it's going to flood again like that. I don't want to live with that fear every time it rains heavily and every time the water comes up."" Bright sunlight shines through the stripped walls of Peter Speeding's home in South Lismore. He and his childhood mate Gary Browning are bare chested and sweaty, feverishly ripping the sodden gyprock sheets off the bare bones of his house. It's three weeks since February's record-breaking deluge, but Peter's unflinching in his determination to rebuild the place he's lived in for 22 years. ""I could sell up. But then that money would squiggle away on rent."" ""Look at rent today — you're looking at $400 to $500 for a room. I get this house back in order, I could rent this for $500 a week. But where do I go? Around Australia I think, in a caravan."" Like many of South Lismore's people, Peter was not insured for flood. ""I've had house and contents insurance for the last 22 years. But when it comes to flood, it's an extra $15–20,000 [per year]."" Peter's back living in his house on an inflatable mattress on the upstairs floor. Outside the window is a massive pile of debris — just about every house in South Lismore has one. It's like the rotting innards of a once-living home have been coughed up to stink up the street in the humidity and heat. ""A lot of memories in that pile, all my photos. I've lost the whole lot. Everything. It's all out there in a pile of rubble."" A video camera was all he saved. ""That's got the kids growing up. Got me grandson on it. But I haven't got a TV to play it on because I lost my TV too."" Peter was rescued after punching a hole through a tiny skylight, squeezing through and waiting on the roof. He says the only thing that might break his determination to rebuild is if his house flooded again before he'd fixed it up. Exactly one week later, it does. ""Water come up again, flood,"" Peter says over the phone. ""I got rescued by the SES. More than likely the water will be gone into the house again."" The resilient and determined bloke of a week earlier seems gone, too. ""I had a fair bit of stuff in there still — stuff I'd got over the last month. Bedding, food, stuff to cook with."" ""Back to square one."" ""Just bloody shocking. All that garbage, that they didn't take initially. That'll all be flooded around the yard. So that's another thing that I'm going to contend with."" Peter says he's not eligible for the $20,000 grant NSW is offering to uninsured home owners and renters because he's waiting on the results of his application for a Disaster Relief Grant, which will take time to be approved. ""If I had a genie give me a million dollars, I'd sell and go to higher ground today."" ""Not much bloody positivity coming out of these sorts of situations. I've not got too much to say after that, mate."" Cheryl Thomson stands in shorts and gumboots with a high-pressure hose in one of her rubber-gloved hands. She's in front of a flood-ruined rented house, scrubbing the grime out of a bird cage — not so that she can use it again, but so she can sell it and make a few dollars. Stacked and crumpled along the side of the house is a graveyard of other cages in which birds were bred. Cheryl's visibly shaking and emotional well before she says a word. ""Lost all my birds, lost everything we own. I've got a disabled son, lost half of his childhood."" Cheryl's a bird breeder. Or at least, she was. ""Yeah — had birds spread all over the place after the 2017 flood and I've lost them. I have nine… nine birds left."" ""These aren't just birds. These are my pets. They're my babies, hand-raised, they used to talk. Cockatoos, Major Mitchells, galahs, ringnecks, lorikeets — you name it, I had it."" All but a handful drowned. This is her partner's place. After 2017's flood, she moved to East Lismore where she was told it would never flood. But in February, it did. ""[The flood] got two houses away from us where they said it'd never, ever, ever, ever flood. ""My nerves are through the roof at the moment."" On the street is Cheryl's car. It has a wire mesh barrier separating the front seats from the back. Cheryl's 16-year-old son has a disability and his behaviour can be challenging. She says the barrier is there to prevent him from hitting her or one of his carers while they're driving. ""He's looked after by the carers a lot, and he just doesn't understand what's happened here. He has no idea. ""He just realised that I'd lost the birds the other day and he just broke down, came over to me and gave me a hug. Yeah, he just … he doesn't understand."" Cheryl is still too rattled to consider what the future holds. She knows government relief grants are available but hasn't applied for them yet. ""I'd like to stay here, but we'll just see what happens over the next few months … I don't know what I'm gonna do now. ""I think it's broken a lot of people around here."" It's fair to say that Daryl Reeve's life was pretty broken already, before the big flood drowned the caravan park by the river that he called his Lismore home. ""I came straight from Melbourne to Lismore and straight to the caravan park. ""I'll be honest with you, I got straight out of jail. Straight out of prison."" In Melbourne, Daryl had been writing to a friend in Lismore, Jen. He now calls her his fiancee. She's been helping him clean up and salvage his few possessions. Jen's letting him stay briefly with her at her son's place, but the arrangement can't last long. ""We live there because we're homeless and [there's] a lot of homeless people out here and some people take advantage of it … As of Friday, I'm living in me car again. ""Lovely town, but I don't think we'll ever get back to what it was. ""It's got me buggered how this town or the people are going to come back. ""It's going to take a long, long, long time."" Kaye McDonnell stands in the doorway of her former shop singing to herself as she scrubs river grime out of a brand new Weber barbecue. The floor behind is strewn with other Webers waiting to be meticulously cleaned up. Her shop, The Kitchen Shelf, provides kitchen, barbecue and catering gear to the whole Northern Rivers region. ""They just pour in from everywhere to Lismore. So it's hard to give that up."" Her livelihood and retirement dreams rely on Lismore's CBD getting back on its feet. ""We've been in the business for 17 years and just grown and grown it. And yeah, so anyway …"" Kaye laughs nervously, clearly trying to hold tears back. The decision to clean up and reopen hasn't been an easy one. ""The day after the flood, we weren't going to. But now, now we've had time to think about it … we'll come back. ""Your heart and soul goes into your business. As my husband said, it's like a child. ""It's very hard to walk away and wonderful to have so many people helping. You couldn't walk away when they put so much effort into … helping us as well."" Kaye and her husband had plans to semi-retire soon and spend more time travelling in their caravan. As uninsured small business owners without much super, those plans are now indefinitely on hold. Kaye knows that the decision to reopen is not just about her future, but the future of Lismore itself. ""We can spend all this time cleaning it up and the money that you have to put into it again. [But] are people going to come, you know? ""If there's not enough places open up, if there's not supermarkets, there's not petrol stations … people leave. That's the scary part. ""But you know, we'll be here and see how it goes."" And she's tackling that uncertainty in the doorway of her shop, one Weber at a time. This story comes from ABC RN's Background Briefing program.

106,Vaughan and Yvonne's home is crawling with acid-spitting crazy ants. And they're spreading to other parts of northern Australia,environment,"  Yellow crazy ants spread into Townsville and parts of north-east Australia, as councils plead for funding When Samantha Cocuzza plays with her two kids in their Townsville backyard, most of the time she has to hold her youngest off the ground. It's not the prickles, or even the heat — it's something far more sinister. As soon as her kids put their feet back on the grass, they're covered in an acid-spitting invasive ant species called yellow crazy ants. ""It's now at the point where they play outside in the yard, head in for a bath, and sometimes there are ants in the bath that come off the kids,"" Ms Cocuzza said. The ants are categorised as one of the worst invasive species in the world, capable of completely destroying ecosystems and making outdoor areas virtually unusable. The ants don't bite, but instead throw acid, which can burn the eyes and skin of people, and can blind and kill insects and small animals. While one or two of the ants are rarely a problem, the species tends to congregate in incredible numbers. They hold the world record for population density, with scientists recording 2000 of them per square metre. In Townsville, where Samantha and her family live, an outbreak has been growing for years, and it finally made its way to her backyard in November last year. She now has to spray the verandah regularly and sweep the ants away every day. ""And they've just multiplied,"" she said. ""I think we've gone from a couple to millions."" The ants are not just a nuisance. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, they are among the 100 worst invasive species in the world. On Christmas Island, off the coast of Western Australia, the ants have completely transformed the forest and decimated its famous red crab population. It's not known exactly where they came from, but it's thought either Africa or Asia. They were first detected in Australia in 1980 at Arnhem Land, although they were likely here much earlier. In 2001, they were found in Cairns, a few hundred kilometres north of Townsville. About $30 million of state and federal money has been thrown at righting the infestation in Cairns — with eradication possibly in sight. But so far, virtually no state or federal funding has been spent fighting the outbreak in Townsville. The job of repelling the tiny invaders is the responsibility of the Townsville City Council, and the two technical officers who work there. Yet their job also involves dealing with every other invasive species in the area including plants, pigs and deer. Councillor Maurie Soars said the city was at a crucial juncture. ""We're at the tipping [point] now,"" he said. ""Our experts here [are] telling us that we've really got to address it now. ""And if we do [that] we can have some serious impact on the spread."" The council said it wouldn't be able to stop the infestation, or even know exactly the full extent of the infestation, without significant funding from the state and federal governments. ""We are hoping that upper levels of government will start looking at it more seriously and then bring it in because if we don't stop it here, where are you going to stop it?"" Mr Soars said. Environmental charity The Invasive Species Council has assessed the situation in Townsville and is proposing a $27.6 million plan, which it thinks should be able to eradicate the ants. So far, the ants have been found at about seven locations in Townsville, covering an area of hundreds of hectares — but the council doesn't have the resources to determine exactly how big the spread is. A spokesman for federal environment minister Sussan Ley said the Morrison government has spent millions helping to control the outbreak near Cairns, but beyond that, it was the job of the state government and the council. A spokesman for the Queensland agriculture minister Mark Furner said councils have received money from the state government to help with the control efforts. ""The ants are a declared pest, so landholders have a general biosecurity obligation to manage such pests on their land,"" the spokesperson said. At Alligator Creek in Townsville, where Samantha lives, the ants are just 5km from Bowling Green National Park, where unique species such as the Mount Elliot crayfish and the Mount Elliot nursery frog live — species only found in this part of the world. In the right location, Ben Hoffman said the ants could completely transform an ecosystem. On Christmas Island, as well as killing millions of its famous red crabs, they also ate all the insects that fed on young plants, turning its sparse understorey into a dense bush. ""The transformation [there] is just so dramatic, it's unbelievable,"" Dr Hoffman said. ""You might as well be looking at two different island ecosystems where the ants are present in high abundance and where they're not."" He said there were a few elements that make them such incredible invaders. Firstly, while most ant species have separate colonies, each with one breeding ant called the queen, there's no limit to how many queens a yellow crazy ant nest can have — with all the queens making babies. ""There was one log I'm aware of where they just stopped counting after 1000 queens,"" Dr Hoffman said. And while different colonies of many ant species compete and even fight, yellow crazy ant colonies cooperate and combine. ""They basically cooperate as one massive nest that can cover tens to even hundreds of hectares,"" he said. ""It's almost the perfect storm of a species."" Once the infestation gets too big, eradicating it will be nearly impossible, according to Dr Hoffman. From that point, the Townsville infestation will almost certainly lead to outbreaks elsewhere around the country. That's no idle concern. Already, outbreaks in Darwin and on Hamilton Island are thought to have been seeded by the Townsville infestation. Just up the road from Samantha live Vaughan and Yvonne Benn, both in their 80s. They are too frail to fight the ants at the perimeter of their home, like Samantha does, and as a result, their home is crawling with yellow crazy ants. ""They crawl all over you,"" he says. ""You wouldn't think a little thing like that would have much acid to squirt out but apparently they do."" As they watch TV, the couple say they have to brush the ants off their arms. And they worry about what the ants will do to the environment around their home. ""They kill off the frogs and I believe they kill snakes,"" Vaughan said. In their old age, the pair are planning to move towards town where they can access more care. But they're worried they won't be able to sell their home. ""You'd hate a prospective buyer to come out and say 'oh what's all these ants,' you know? You don't want that."" So Vaughan and Yvonne need the ants gone. With the Townsville City Council now stretched beyond capacity fighting the infestation, local residents — with the help of environmental charity the Invasive Species Council — are taking matters into their own hands. On a Sunday afternoon, more than 20 local residents meet at the property of Ian and Frances Cotrell, who are also facing a severe infestation. The meeting is led by Bev Job from the Invasive Species Council, who is handing out supplies of bait, paid for by the charity, and explaining to the residents how to use it. But she is frank about the likelihood of getting much done without assistance from the state and federal governments. ""Unfortunately, it's been left too long,"" she said. ""Now it's been left up to the point where there are not enough resources in the Townsville City Council."" The residents are taken around Ian and Frances' backyard, and shown what the ants look like, and where to find them — which is not difficult, as they're everywhere. And according to Ben Hoffmann from the CSIRO, the infestation that's visible from the surface is just the ""tip of the iceberg"". ""The yellow crazy ant can be absolutely anywhere there's a cavity. ""So it's a hole in the ground, or it could be at the top of a coconut palm, for example. There's a lot of ants that you don't see. ""We don't really know the full extent of what issues will arise from yellow crazy ants. ""We only discover this when the ant gets into new locations [and] my personal preference is that we don't get to that stage.""

107,'Part of something bigger': Women slow-stitch river's biodiversity into quilt with a message ,environment,"  Adelaide River's biodiversity slow-stitched into a community quilt by more than 80 women Local artists Meng Hoeschle and Pam Hefner met at night school in the 1980s and have been friends ever since. The pair work together in Darwin's rural region and are among more than 80 women who have spent months slow-stitching a community quilt with a message. ""Neither of us are quilters,"" Ms Hefner said. ""The actual technique, slow-stitching, you don't have to have a lot of skills to do it well."" ""There's no rules, which I love."" The quilt depicts the animals, plants and biodiversity found in the Northern Territory's iconic Adelaide River system, which is best known for its crocodiles. The river is almost 240 kilometres long and flows through several Top End regions, including floodplains on Limilngan-Wulna land. Before the stitching began, each participant was given a list of plant, fish and animal species along with several pieces of recycled calico dyed with indigo to represent water. In her quilt piece, Ms Hoeschle used beads to stitch a native fig tree, popular with birds, and incorporated an old fishing net and bones she had collected. ""On the river there was a piece of fishing net I picked up many, many years ago when I was working at Wadeye."" ""There are lots of bones in the river if you do dredge it, so that's what I was trying to do."" ""Learning about the river is amazing, how beautiful it is – I never knew the Adelaide River was that long, I never knew about the wildlife and especially the habitat."" Behind the scenes has been local artist Jasmine Jan, who has created this community art project and others for the Territory Wildlife Park, where the quilt now hangs. ""A lot of these projects we do with some sort of conservation message or some sort of educational purpose and this one was raising awareness about the Adelaide River system,"" she said. ""It's not just about crocodiles."" ""We like the idea that we're building a community of crafters but also crafters with a purpose."" The final quilt was recently launched to a huge crowd of women, who inspected their contributions stitched together for the first time. ""I knew they would be blown away by it,"" Ms Jan said. ""I like the idea that a quilt is something you use to keep you warm and it's a comforting thing, and I like the idea that everybody's put a little piece of themselves into this quilt."" The project began in October last year and many of the pieces have been stitched in isolation at people's homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It's almost like a cyber community I think – you might not be physically all together but you're all emotionally going on this journey together, being part of something bigger,"" Ms Jan said. Barbara Williams is a building surveyor and her technical drawing skills also happen to be perfect for quilting. She was responsible for planning out and constructing the quilt. ""This is my drafting skills going way back, so actually putting quilts together and that sort of thing is natural to me,"" Ms Williams said. ""Throughout all this, every single piece I looked at was a masterpiece."" ""What people have produced at the end of the day has blown us away completely."" Ms Williams lives at Bee's Creek, a region in Darwin's rural outskirts. ""This is a large river that's in our backyard and most people only know it for the crocodile jumping or the Adelaide River township,"" she said. ""It has an amazing wetlands during the wet season, which blends with the Mary River and is amazing for birdlife."" She said working with such a diverse group of women across Darwin's rural and urban regions – some who had never produced an art piece before – was personally rewarding. ""It's just knowing people's stories and the reason why they've come to do the art and craft work,"" Ms Williams said. ""There's a lot of healing done while working in an art space as well."" ""Each one of these little pieces that make up this quilt is a journey."" Ms Jan said Ms William's elaborate plan for the quilt took her by surprise. ""She whips out this big plan, which has got all the quilt sketched up and all the dimensions and she's worked out how big the blocks have got to be,"" she said. ""I'm just sitting there gobsmacked, thinking oh my goodness she's done all that technical construction work for me."" ""It's amazing working with Barbara, because she has that ability not only in the construction industry but also in crafts."" The quilt was also given a special metal vine hanger with a kingfisher sculpture, constructed and designed by local artists Peter Jettner and Troya Bywaters. Ms Jan said sewing skills had not previously been among her artistic talents but she now also enjoyed slow-stitching. ""I might come home from work when I'm really stressed, I just get my slow stitch and I just sit there and start stitching and it actually is quite meditative,"" she said. ""You actually relax and I think it's quite a stress release.""

108,'This disaster is part of climate change': At least 306 killed in catastrophic flooding in South Africa,environment,"  At least 306 killed in catastrophic flooding in Durban, South Africa's President calls it a climate change disaster Flooding in South Africa's Durban area has killed at least 306 people and is a ""catastrophe of enormous proportions,"" President Cyril Ramaphosa says. ""This disaster is part of climate change. It is telling us that climate change is serious, it is here,"" Mr Ramaphosa said as he visited flooded areas of Durban and the surrounding eThekwini metropolitan area. ""You're not alone … We'll do everything in our power to see how we can help. Even though your hearts are in pain, we're here for you,"" he added. ""We no longer can postpone what we need to do, and the measures we need to take to deal with climate change."" The death toll is expected to continue rising as search and rescue operations continue in KwaZulu-Natal province, officials said. Mr Ramaphosa said the whole province would be declared a disaster area. ""The bridges have collapsed, the roads have collapsed, people have died and people are injured,"" he said. He said one family had lost 10 members. Residents were forced to flee as homes were swept away, buildings collapsed and roads were torn up. Durban port was flooded and shipping containers were swept away into a jumbled heap. Authorities were also seeking to restore electricity to large parts of the province after heavy flooding at various power stations. Rescue efforts by the South African National Defence Force were delayed as the military's air wing was also affected by the floods, General Rudzani Maphwanya said. The military was able to deploy personnel and helicopters around the province on Wednesday, he said. Some areas recorded daily rainfall totals in excess of 160 millimetres, the country's weather bureau said. Forecasters warned of continued wind and rain and the risk of continued flooding in Kwazulu-Natal and other provinces over the upcoming Easter weekend. South Africa's Eastern Cape, Free State and North West provinces could be affected, it said. Africa's south-eastern coast is on the front line of seaborne weather systems that scientists believe are being intensified by global warming. South Africa's northern neighbour Mozambique has suffered a series of devastating floods over the past decade, including one last month that killed more than 50 people.

109,Liquid gold: This cafe has a creative solution to beat rising fuel prices. And it smells like hot chips,environment,"  Outback cafe’s creative solution to fuel crisis is served with chips on the side One outback Queensland town has tongues wagging with an inventive solution to combat high fuel prices — and it smells like hot chips. At the back of the Red Door Cafe in Cloncurry, in the state's north-west, dozens of barrels of deep fryer oil sit next to a set of industrial vehicles. The cafe is a social enterprise that trains and employs young people at its restaurant and adjoining warehouse. Running the organisation isn't cheap, there's forklifts to fill with diesel and generators to power. So managers did some research and discovered that the deep fryer oil they used in the cafe kitchen could be transformed into their version of liquid gold — biodiesel. ""We had some of the oil from the cafe leftover and we weren't sure what to do with it,"" Red Door's Paul Bashford said. ""It took us a period of trial and error for six months or so."" Eventually, the team set up a system to convert the canola oil into biofuel. ""Essentially we're just filtering all of the solids out of the oil and then we're de-watering it,"" Mr Bashford said. ""We've set up quite a lot of settling tanks so that process can happen naturally and then at the end we treat it to make sure there's nothing organic growing in there."" As the biofuel is thicker than average diesel and petrol products, the team runs it in their equipment at a 50:50 ratio combined with diesel fuel. Mr Bashford estimated the set-up, and the trial-and-error phase, cost the business a few thousand dollars. But the money they're saving as a result is well worth it. ""At the moment, with the price of diesel, [we're] probably [saving] a fair bit,"" he said. ""We've saved at least 50 per cent of our fuel bill and we do have other people who are interested in purchasing the finished product off us."" The biofuel isn't just cutting costs for the Red Door. Businesses around town now have somewhere to dump their oil waste instead of paying to have it trucked away. Cloncurry's Central Hotel owner Lors Chandler used to freight the hotel's 40 litres of oil waste 120 kilometres to Mount Isa each week. ""Any used cooking oil is regulated waste so we had a lot of problems trying to dispose of that,"" she said. ""In Cloncurry, there is nowhere, I know for a long time, people were taking it to the dump, which is just an environmental hazard. ""It's a big expense and it's a big inconvenience, pods of oil sitting around, you don't have the space for it. ""Any expense at the moment is a burden … ultimately you'd have to pass that on in some way to your customer,"" she said. In Australia, 32 billion litres of diesel is used annually. With just three biofuel refineries across the country, holding a combined 100 million litres of the product, the current industry is barely making a dent on consumption. The industry wants to see investment from federal and state governments to grow the sector. Future Fuels manager said Simon Roycroft said Australia was missing out on an opportunity to easily generate low-carbon power. ""Look at North America, particularly the United States — that industry has flourished, it has a number of government policies in place, incentives, subsidies, to be able to assist that industry growth,"" Mr Roycroft said. The European Union biofuel market routinely purchases Australian canola oil to transform into biofuels. ""While we acknowledge electrical vehicles and hydrogen absolutely have a role to play [in decarbonisation], and we're excited for that, they're still a long way off from full commercialisation and it's very expensive to make these transitions."" For Mr Bashford at the Red Door Cafe, the demand for biofuel is only getting hotter. ""We've had interest from other businesses wanting to purchase the final product,"" he said. ""We're currently looking at options to grow the capacity here for us to produce more.""

110,Desalination plant a step closer for Eyre Peninsula after years of debate and community backlash,environment,"  Eyre Peninsula desalination plant moves a step closer as potential sites chosen After years of deliberation and community backlash, four possible sites for a proposed desalination plant on the Eyre Peninsula have been selected. The Site Selection Committee, an independent group of 20 local leaders and industry figures, has shortlisted Sleaford West, Point Boston, Shoal Point and the site originally chosen in 2020 at Sleaford Bay. A detailed assessment of each site will now be undertaken, however, this does not mean Billy Lights Point, the site originally chosen that caused controversy, has been taken off the table altogether. SA Water had initially selected Billy Lights Point in Boston Bay as the site for its planned desalination plant to reduce pressure on the Uley Basin, and to ensure future long-term water security for the region. But the location caused community uproar, particularly among environmental groups and the local seafood industry. The Site Selection Committee has expressed hope it can make an impact and its chair, former state Liberal MP Peter Treloar, said he was confident the group was on track to deliver a water security outcome for the Eyre Peninsula. ""We need to stay away from existing sanctuary zones, and stay wary about native veg issues and cultural issues,"" Mr Treloar said. ""Paramount to all of this we need to make our proposal go into the SA water reticulation network. ""Ultimately it's a decision of SA water and the government of the day, but I feel really quite pleased that we have an opportunity as a community to have a significant say on the outcome."" Mr Treloar was hopeful that a single site would be selected by the end of July. Mark Andrews, chief executive of Eyre Peninsula Seafoods and member of the Hands-Off Boston Bay group, said members of the new committee were working well together. ""They've got a really good spread of people there across the whole peninsula, a lot of good feedback and they're asking the right questions,"" he said. But he said he was worried about Point Boston being shortlisted, because it is an aquaculture zone. Mr Andrews said he also had concerns that Billy Lights Point could still be on the table despite community outrage against it. Even though the site was not shortlisted, it could still be on the table as the ultimate decision of the whereabouts of the desalination plant will come down to SA Water, not the committees selections. ""At the end of the day I can only fight science with science. There's been nothing more done at Billy Lights Point and until such time when more work is done on it, I will counter or assess what documentation they do put forward."" The committee and SA Water will hold consultation sessions in towns around the peninsula over the coming months to gather feedback. Subject to required approvals, construction of a new desalination plant is expected to begin in 2023, with first water expected to delivered by the end of 2024.

111,Water in this remote NT community comes out brown. Here's how locals are coping,environment,"  Water in Nauiyu comes out brown. Here's how remote NT residents are coping In the remote community of Nauiyu, about 225 kilometres south of Darwin, the water comes out brown. That is mainly because there is a high level of iron in the ground. There are no proven health risks of drinking the water, but residents in the area say there is only one way they can make it work. ""I have been turning on the taps … and letting it run for half an hour [until it clears up],"" resident Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr-Baumann said. Cathy Laudenbach from Merepeen Arts Centre said that was extremely wasteful and very costly. ""What we do is leave the water running until it goes clean and then we start cleaning up,"" she said. ""The immediate impact is cost because we are accountable for the water we use."" The Arts Centre uses a lot of water for their work and to clean up. Dr Laudenbach also buys water for her staff to drink, but she said that for many, that is not an option. ""A lot of people here are living on benefits and cannot afford it,"" she said. Long-term residents have reported that the water has been this way for most of their lives. With no improvement on the horizon, Nauiyu's private school installed tanks and filters on school grounds and at school housing. Laramba resident Stanley Fletcher is worried that long-term exposure to the community's drinking water is making people sick. Here's why. The town water gets diverted into the installed tanks which aerates the water and drops out a lot of the iron. It then gets pumped through the pre-filter, which cleanses water before pumping it through the taps. Cynthia Page, a teacher at the school, said it means children can at least have clean water during the day. ""It has made a big difference in the water quality,"" she said. ""You can actually have a cup of water in a glass, and it be clear."" Ms Page said it has made a massive difference to the school, however it comes at a cost. ""Because the water is still coming from the tanks you have to replace the filters every couple of months,"" she said. It is a cost the school can afford, but most residents cannot. Dr Laudenbach supports the idea, but said it would need to be properly funded. ""Not everyone can afford it,"" she said. ""I think it would be one step towards fixing the problem."" Ms Page said the filters worked at the school and would work around the community as well. ""From what I understand water is a basic human need,"" she said. ""It is not a privilege it is a need, and it should not be expensive.""

112,'Not on our watch': The young family living in the middle of nowhere to help bring our animals back from the brink,environment,"  The young couple restoring the lost treasures of Australia's desert Meet the young couple living in one of the most remote areas in Australia, all in the name of helping to bring our endangered animals back from the brink of extinction. The Fort Grey homestead sits in one of the most remote corners of New South Wales. From the air, it is a tiny speck of human habitation in a vast, open landscape of rolling red sand dunes and rocky terrain. Red earth runs for thousands of kilometres. From the homestead, the Strzelecki desert stretches as far as the eye can see. They call this Corner Country, tucked up where the state's borders with South Australia and Queensland meet. It's six hours' drive north from Broken Hill and the nearest neighbours are 30km away. Four-year-old Isla and nine-month-old Zac might be the most remote children in New South Wales. To see other children once a month at playgroup means a 300km round trip. An excursion to the supermarket is a 12-hour journey there and back. It's hard to imagine a tougher, more unforgiving place to work and live, but Isla and Zac's parents have grown to love it. Dr Rebecca West and her husband, Dr Reece Pedler, are both ecologists on an urgent mission to push back against the extinction crisis. To set up a home here, Rebecca and Reece have had to sacrifice proximity to their families back in Adelaide and the ordinary luxury of a coffee shop or a meal out. But for Reece, the ""dead heart"" of Australia is very much alive: ""There is excitement. There's just so much incredible history."" Their home, Fort Grey, was the explorer Charles Sturt's exploration depot in the 1840s. When Rebecca first came to corner country, she remembers: ""The bit that interested me the most was that you couldn't see a tree on the horizon. I found that fascinating."" As an extrovert, she wondered how she would cope with the isolation. When she first walked into the homestead, it was full of dust. ""I remember thinking, hmm, am I going to be able to live here?"" But they came for a higher purpose: To put something back that had vanished and bring the desert country back to health by reintroducing locally extinct mammals that had not been seen here for more than a century. ""There are species that have gone extinct on our watch and we need to make sure that doesn't happen again,"" Rebecca says. Australia is ""extinction central"",  zoo manager Dr Chris West says. ""More mammals have died out in Australia over the last 200 years than anywhere else in the world."" For Richard Kingsford, professor of environmental science at UNSW Sydney: ""Our extinction crisis is basically 30 seconds to midnight. We've lost about 100 native species and 34 mammal species."" Fort Grey, formerly a sheep and cattle property, is now part of Sturt National Park and is the research headquarters for the Wild Deserts project lead by Professor Kingsford. The 10-year project is a partnership between National Parks and Wildlife, Ecological Horizons and UNSW Sydney. It has the backing of legendary conservationist and family friend Jane Goodall, who says it: ""Aims to repopulate the remote and beautiful Sturt Desert with native animals that once roamed free but are now rare and endangered."" This game-changing venture, she adds, ""is a ray of hope"" in a race against time. Traditional owner Leroy Johnson explains that, before European settlement, the Sturt National Park would have been ""exploding with life"". ""My people would have been burning off some country, the hills would have been lush with vegetation and we would have had all types of animals,"" he tells Australian Story. The Malyangapa and Wongkumara were just two local tribes who lived sustainably off the land. ""More mammals have died out in Australia over the last 200 years than anywhere else in the world."" Overgrazing by early settlers moving into the area with sheep and cattle caused the land to decline and was catastrophic for the native animals. Settlers introduced rabbits that decimated everything in their path and predators such as cats and foxes wiped out the smaller mammals. ""Cats and foxes eat things that are bite-size,"" Professor Kingsford explains, ""and so many of our middle-sized marsupials were really lunch, breakfast [and] dinner for these animals. ""We need these native animals back because they dig huge burrows for their food, so they're turning over all of that soil, restoring the desert. ""We'll never really get this landscape to function the way it's meant to be until we get these animals back."" Animals were always a big part of Rebecca West's childhood in the UK. When she was 12, her father took on the job as director of Chester Zoo, near Liverpool. Chris West would bring his five children to work some days. ""They helped wash the elephants. They cleaned out giraffes. They saw animals being born. They fed the snakes,"" he recalls. ""Becky was in an attic bedroom and that became full of giant moths, scorpions, millipedes. And the crowning glory for her was a leaf-cutter ant colony."" Her childhood experiences made her want to work with animals and she completed a zoology degree in the UK. The rest of her family moved to Australia for Chris to take on the chief executive role of the Adelaide Zoo. On a visit out to see her parents, Rebecca was offered a PhD studying the reintroduction of rock wallabies into the fenced reserves of the APY lands below Alice Springs. ""I swapped green, grey and rainy England for red dust, dry, outback Australia. I felt like I was at home, even though I was very far from home,"" Rebecca says. Reece Pedler grew up on his family's farm in the mid-north of South Australia and was also introduced to the ways of animals by his parents. Both were strongly involved in conservation: His dad, Lynn Pedler, is one of the country's top ornithologists and his mother, Janet, has devoted her life to conservation and land management. ""My sister and I used to spend a lot of time out in the bush on scientific surveys with my parents."" When he graduated from university, he took a job in the South Australian outback at Roxby Downs on various ecology projects, where he became fascinated with waterbirds. Reece did his PhD on banded stilts, tracking them across the inland salt lakes that form after rainfall. Rebecca and Reece first met at a mammal society conference in 2012. When she arrived to take a job at Roxby Downs in 2014, he offered her a spare room in his house while she looked for a place to live. ""I moved in,"" Rebecca recalls, ""and then a month later, I just moved rooms and we never moved out."" They married in 2017. ""She had fallen in love, not just with an Australian, but with the landscape, the nature, that spirit of the country and its ancient echoes,"" her dad says. The couple heard the Wild Deserts project was on the cards and decided to sell themselves as a double act, Reece the project coordinator and Rebecca the project's ecologist. They signed on in 2016, said goodbye to their families and moved to Fort Grey a year later. The first part of the project involved building two huge 20-square-kilometre paddocks they call ""exclosures"" — special 2-metre-high fences with a floppy wire overhang to stop feral cats and foxes from climbing in. Reece and his sheepdog, Peg, also tracked and removed every rabbit. That completed, they were ""ready and raring"" to reintroduce seven species of native mammals into the exclosures. But, as Rebecca would discover, ""the outback has a harsh side and a beautiful side"". The drought that descended towards the end of 2017 meant there was nothing for the animals to eat. It would become one of the worst droughts in Australia's history and make the couple wonder if they could keep going. They couldn't bring the animals into a dust bowl where there was no food or water for them. The existing animals were dying. Over the next three years, Rebecca says, ""It just got progressively drier and drier until it looked like we were almost living on Mars"". ""Watching everything just slowly die around you — the birds in the garden, the kangaroos, it got pretty hard for a while,"" she recalls. ""I thought I was going to have this baby in the middle of a sand dune!"" In addition to a phone line and satellite internet that frequently drops out, temperatures in summer can sit at 45 degrees Celsius, making it impossible to work outside beyond the early morning. When things break, there is not much chance of getting an electrician or a plumber out there. The couple were always using YouTube and working things out on their own. Four months after moving to ""the middle of nowhere"", Rebecca became pregnant. ""As a first-time pregnancy, there was quite a bit of concern about where we were and what might happen if something went wrong,"" she recalls. Ultrasounds were a 900km round trip to Broken Hill. ""Bec was quite nervous at times about some things,"" Reece says. ""And I was trying to reassure her when I wasn't really very sure myself."" She had her first contractions during a rabbit eradication. ""I thought I was going to have this baby in the middle of a sand dune."" When they brought newborn Isla home, there was a heatwave, with weeks of temperatures in the 40s. They were struggling. The drought stretched on through 2018 and 2019. Dust storms made it impossible to get things done. ""You have to retreat back to the house and watch everything just being obliterated,"" Reece remembers. If it had gone on much longer, they might have had to abandon the project. Reece recalls the tap water was so hot, ""we'd run the bath in the morning and leave it to sit for 8 or 9 hours so that the little temperature sensor that we put in there said it was cool enough for the baby to be in"". ""We felt sort of trapped here,"" he says. Rebecca was overwhelmed: ""Oh my goodness, 'What are we doing with such a small child in such a remote place?' ""It really exacerbated that feeling of being remote and isolated and only having each other. I really wished my mum was closer."" But then came some relief. The drought finally broke in March 2020 with drenching rains. They ran outside and jumped in the puddles. Isla was two years old and it was the first time she had ever seen rain. ""She started crying because it was a big thunderstorm and there was heavy rain. I think it was a bit too much for her,"" Rebecca remembers. The desert was transformed. ""You just get everything breeding, everything flowering, the smell of the plants flowering and the noise of the birds can be deafening,"" says Associate Professor Katherine Moseby, an ecologist and UNSW research scientist working on the project. Professor Kingsford agrees: ""The place is just bursting, everything is going off. The birds come from everywhere, the budgies sort of descend, clouds of them. And reptiles and small mammals just start taking off in these huge numbers."" Now that food could grow, the time had finally come to restore the native animals to the desert. The first 10 bilbies arrived in their own charter flight from Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo. Attaching transmitters to the animals so they could track them later, Rebecca felt like a worried mother. ""Had we set up everything ready for them? Were they going to survive? I had a sort of stress and nervous tummy."" National Parks manager and traditional owner Leroy Johnson did a smoking ceremony. He was shaking with emotion when he released the first bilby. ""It was very magical,"" he says, ""took my breath away and, for me, [it] means the land is healing itself."" For Rebecca and Reece, releasing the animals was a peak in their careers and time for a high five. This moment had seemed so far away for so long. The first three of seven animals have now been released: the greater bilby, the crest-tailed mulgaras and the Shark Bay bandicoots. All the animals were chosen, Rebecca says, not just because they were locally extinct, but also because they have really important roles to play in the desert ecosystem. ""We actually call them ecosystem engineers,"" she explains. ""The bilbies and bandicoots dig and turn over the soil, creating burrows where rain can infiltrate and seeds can find a safe germinating spot."" There are now small mammal tracks in the sand dunes that might not have been seen for 150 years. All the animals are healthy and putting on weight. The females have babies in their pouches. ""Suddenly we had the next generation of bilbies and the first wild desert bilbies, which was unimaginably exciting,"" says Tom Hunt, a field ecologist on the project. After releasing the first ones, Leroy likes to think of them as his grandchildren. Rebecca and Reece have also had a second baby of their own. Both Isla, and now baby Zac, accompany their parents on fieldwork. ""The program is working. The population is growing. The project so far in the first five years has been an enormous success,"" Rebecca says. But the reality is, the Wild Deserts team can't fence off the whole of Australia. ""Trying to get animals beyond fences is really like the holy grail of threatened species conservation in Australia,"" ecologist Professor Moseby says. ""This landscape won't function the way it's meant to until we get these animals back."" To this end, they have created The Wild Training Zone, a 100-square-kilometre area where they are training the animals to live alongside low densities of cats and foxes. It's hoped the native species can be ""trained up"" to be wary of the predators and develop strategies to protect themselves. ""We need to equip them with the skills to live with cats and foxes in the landscape. Hopefully, we can find ways to get our animals beyond the fences and back across the whole Strzelecki Desert and beyond."" Rebecca often feels ""mother guilt"" about raising Isla and Zac in such a remote place. ""But then I think, 'Wow, what a childhood'. They are one of the few children [who] would know what a lot of these Australian native species are that are really important to our biodiversity."" Through all the adversity and the hardship of running a huge project, Rebecca says she and Reece have grown together and as parents. ""I reckon that both of us would be able to run something like the Olympics Opening Ceremony or run an airport,"" Rebecca laughs. ""But when conflict arises, you can't just go and have a wine with your girlfriends and unload. ""It builds and strengthens a relationship because you can't have those moments where you walk away and come back a bit later. You have actually got to face it and deal with it."" ""When you sit in the Wild Deserts paddock late at night and you let a bandicoot out of a bag, you think, 'I've put something back that wasn't here. This species is now going to be surviving in this area because that's what we've done as a team and as a project'."" The team have four more species to introduce: the golden bandicoot, the stick-nest rat, burrowing bettongs and a formidable carnivore, the western quoll. They hope to have them all populating the desert by 2026. As a custodian of the land, Leroy Johnson is overjoyed that the species that once thrived here are now back. ""It is very important that our land is healthy,"" he says. ""We're just custodians of the land and what's on the land. We won't be here for long. So it's important we leave them for our next generation."" Watch Australian Story's 'Into the Wild' on iview and Youtube.

113,Mass fish-kill event strikes popular tourist beaches on Ningaloo Coast ,environment,"  Mass fish kill hits popular Coral Bay beaches on WA's Ningaloo Coast As holiday makers enjoy the crystal blue water at Bill's Bay, in the WA tourist town of Coral Bay, fish skeletons lie scattered among the seaweed. It's a stark reminder of Western Australia's largest fish-kill event in more than a decade and the epic effort locals made to save the beach before the peak tourist season began. On March 27, the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD), launched an investigation into the fish kill after an estimated 16,000 dead fish were counted along affected beaches on the Ningaloo Coast, including Turquoise Bay, Bill's Bay and Yardie Creek. Bill's Bay, Coral Bay's most popular swimming beach, was the most severely impacted. During this time, DPIRD warned people not the enter into or fish from the putrid water, which contained high levels of bacteria. The analysis of water samples from Bill's Bay indicated no harmful algae were present, DPIRD said, but ammonia, nitrates and phosphates were detected, likely the result of decaying coral spawn and fish. Marion Massam, from DPIRD, said the department believed the mass fish-kill event was caused by coral spawning. ""Coral spawn itself can use up oxygen in the water and when it breaks down, more oxygen is used up as part of the breakdown process,"" Ms Massam said. ""That reduces oxygen in the water for the fish. They can end up dying as a result."" Coral spawning is an annual event, which typically occurs following the March full moon, after corals are stimulated by the seasonal rise in water temperatures. DPIRD said another factor which could have contributed was local marine heatwave conditions that occurred along the Ningaloo coastline in late March. The department said the coral-spawn slicks could drift towards the shore and when trapped close to the coast, could create low oxygen conditions made worse by a low tide and swell. The Ningaloo Coast is no stranger to fish-kill events. Authorities said the last fish kill of this magnitude was 12 years ago. If you're travelling to Coral Bay these Easter school holidays, you can thank John Farne for the improved state of the beaches. With a couple of trucks, a bobcat and a loader, John, his mates and the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) took to the beach to clean up the dead fish, which were taken to the local tip. ""It was as bad as it gets and every year the coral spawns and you walk out and you go — sniff — 'Oh the coral is spawning' and that's the end of it. There's very little. But this year was the exception,"" he said. ""But as locals, we want to have it clean. We can't do much about the water but that's now freshened up. It's lovely out there so Easter school holidays, we're good to go."" On April 8, DPIRD removed the fish-kill alert for Turquoise Bay, Yardie Creek, Point Billie and Jane's Bay. Sallyann Gudge, from the DBCA, said a survey of dead fish showed they were all reef-associated species and the ecosystem should recover soon. ""Fingers crossed that all those things fall into place and those fish numbers can come back. A lot of those fish species do recruit pretty quickly,"" Ms Gudge said. Authorities say they will continue to keep a close eye on the Ningaloo Coast and the fish population. DPIRD has reminded visitors to exercise caution in the area and not to enter or fish from any water that appears smelly and putrid, as it could contain high levels of bacteria. They urge people to report any further fish kills to Fishwatch at fish.wa.gov.au or on 1800 815 507.

114,New South Australian government scraps pastoral land reforms,environment,"  Plans to shake up Pastoral Act scrapped as government shifts focus to conservation Proposed changes to the management of South Australia's outback — an area covering nearly half of the state — have been scrapped by the newly elected Labor government. Labor is moving the government's Pastoral Unit out of the Primary Industries portfolio and back to the Environment Department, promising more money to ensure sheep and cattle stations are not damaging the fragile country. The former Liberal government had big plans for South Australia's arid rangelands, that make up 42 per cent of the state, which is primarily leased for sheep and cattle grazing. It was trying to pass a new Pastoral Act, updating the 1989 legislation, that would have granted graziers a lot more power, but did not get it through parliament before the election. ""The previous government, the Liberals, wanted to remove stocking rates, to have extremely long leases — up to 100-year leases — and also to not do on-ground assessment of the quality and condition of the land. All of that stops now,"" new Environment Minister Susan Close told the ABC. Ms Close said an extra $1 million dollars would be allocated to make sure the Pastoral Unit could carry out overdue condition assessments of grazing land in a ""timely way"". ""These are lands that are precious, they're fragile and they are capable of primary production as long as they're looked after,"" she said. ""We'll work with pastoralists to make sure that happen."" The government will also confirm that pastoral land can be used for conservation purposes, something challenged under the Liberals. ""The last government raised a question mark about that. I don't think it is an issue, but I will find out and, if necessary, make some tweaks to ensure that's the case,"" Ms Close said. ""Otherwise, we need to work with pastoralists. We need to support the land that pastoralists depend on."" Under the former state government's plans, existing leases would have been changed from 42 years to 100 years and a legislated maximum rate of stock that could be run on each lease would have been removed. It also wanted land to be inspected remotely, primarily by satellite, instead of in-person. Nature Conservation Society of South Australia president Patrick O""Connor welcomed the change in direction. ""The new government putting conservation first as the priority and sustainability of outback South Australia as the priority is really important,"" he said. ""It's only from that basis that setting the grazing rights, and the ability for community to use that land, can fit in over a long time, so it's a really great result that the government wants to make that sustainability the priority."" Mr O'Connor said the lapse in inspections had been a ""real problem"" for pastoralists and for conservation. ""The inspections are so important and making that relationship with the landholders around the condition of those assets is really important to sustain them, to give those landholders confidence about their investments,"" he said. Labor's funding injection equates to a 25 per cent increase in the Pastoral Unit's budget. ""The initial amount promised is a really good start to get back on track and then looking at the emerging technologies and the possibilities of what investment is required,"" Mr O'Connor said. ""I think really looking at how the investment in information about the outback can actually pay off in other ways, in improving tourism, in improving the sustainability and improving access to emerging markets in biodiversity and carbon."" President of Livestock SA Joe Keynes said it was crucial pastoralism was supported. ""We definitely feel that pastoralism is the key and dominant industry in the rangelands, and it will continue to be, even though we recognise there are other alternative uses,"" he said. ""[The Pastoral Act] needs to support a profitable and sustainable pastoral industry."" Mr Keynes said the funding injection would help address the backlog of land assessments but called on the government to consider other ways of monitoring the condition of the leases. ""Can we modernise the whole system? Can we actually use remote sensing? Can we use some new technologies that weren't even considered when the Pastoral Act was last reviewed?"" Mr Keynes asked. ""We could do it in a much more effective and efficient way. ""I think [that], if we spent some of that million dollars on looking at and investigating some of those opportunities, then … that would be welcomed by the pastoral industry."" The government has promised to look at other monitoring methods in the future.

115,Everything you need to know about Tasmania's new container recycling scheme,environment,"  Tasmania is getting a container refund scheme. Here's how it will work Nearly 50 years after South Australians were able to receive a partial refund for recycling bottles and cans, Tasmania is finally catching up. Previously promised to be introduced in 2022, Tasmania's container refund scheme is now set to come in during the first half of 2023. Drink containers are one of the most commonly littered items in Tasmania, with a survey conducted in 2018 finding they made up about 45 per cent of litter in the state, by volume. The state government hopes the incoming container refund scheme will reduce that. Tasmania's scheme will look very similar to other states' schemes, as the aim is for a nationally consistent approach. Consumers will receive a 10-cent refund for every eligible container they recycle through a refund point. The most-commonly littered beverage containers will be accepted, including cans, glass and PET bottles, cartons, juice boxes and poppers, typically between 150 ml and 3 litres. Wine and spirit bottles will not be eligible, but Tasmania is involved in national talks about possibly changing that. Circular economy consultant Helen Millicer said container refund schemes reduced emissions and landfill. ""The benefits of a container refund scheme are, principally, that you end up with a really good stream of clean, high-quality material that can go back into product again and replace virgin material,"" Ms Millicer said. ""There are other benefits as well, in the increased number of jobs in the local economy, as well as significant environmental benefits."" Ms Millicer said container refund schemes created a circular system. ""We are truly reducing our emissions, reducing our waste that ends up in landfill, and we are really improving the way we live on this planet."" It has not yet been decided where the refund points will be set up. The state government says there would be more than 40 around the state, including on King and Flinders Islands. Environment Minister Roger Jaensch said the exact makeup of the refund point network would become clear through a tender process. ""We are likely to see a range of different refund point types,"" he said. ""This may include reverse-vending machines, large depots and over-the-counter services in existing shops. ""We are likely to see refund points around supermarkets and shopping centres, and at local retail shops. These will have minimum opening hours to ensure convenience for Tasmanians."" Containers will go from those points to an approved recycler. The beverage industry will fund the Tasmanian Container Refund Scheme through a fee system and the cost per beverage container for customers will likely increase slightly. While consumers can pocket the 10-cent refund, they can opt to directly donate it, instead, to a charity, sport club or community group. Those organisations can also raise money by collecting containers or operating a refund point. Adrienne Picone from the Tasmanian Council of Social Service said its members felt there would be real opportunities and benefits from being involved in the scheme. ""We work with a number of members across the community services industry and they work with individuals [who] are experiencing vulnerability and disadvantage, and they're very much looking forward to participating in the container refund scheme,"" she said. In South Australia — where a similar scheme began 45 years ago — container recycling is providing the bulk of scouts' funding. SA Scouts runs 10 depots across the state, with 160 employees. The organisation's head of development, Steve Hastwell, said families brought cans and bottles, along with scrap metal and other recyclables to the depots to receive their refunds. ""We pay them 10 cents, then we receive a handling fee from the super collectors, the beverage companies, that gives us income,"" he said. ""The income through our businesses — and not just the depots, but also collecting from hotels, clubs, community groups and events — the revenue's about $2 million. That goes back into scouting each year."" Mr Hastwell said the funds raised were spent on local programs. ""We can buy great adventure equipment — [such as] aeroplanes, climbing walls, dive boats — to really enhance our programs.""

117,Greens accuse Tasmanian govt of 'decades of illegal logging' after flaw in law revealed,environment,"  Tasmanian government accused of attempting to 'retrospectively' change law to 'legalise' logging The Bob Brown Foundation has said an issue with a decades-old piece of legislation means the Tasmanian government has been illegally logging forests in the state for years. The government has denied the issue rendered past logging operations ""illegal"", however Resources Minister Guy Barnett said he intended to introduce legislation that would remove doubt. ""A highly technical administrative matter relating to the issuing of a delegation made under the Forest Practices Act 1985 has recently been identified,"" he said in a statement. ""To provide certainty for our industry and to remove doubt, the government intends to introduce validating legislation, when Parliament resumes, to resolve this technical issue at law."" While the exact nature of that administrative matter hasn't been disclosed, the Bob Brown Foundation (BBF) believes it has to do with the ability of the state government to delegate the issuing of logging permits to the independent Forest Practices Authority. The BBF said any attempt to ""retrospectively legalise"" logging operations was outrageous. ""The law is the law, and no ordinary citizen can retrospectively change the law's technicalities to claim ignorance, to rescue themselves from prosecution or imprisonment,"" BBF spokesperson Jenny Weber said. ""So, the minister is proposing to back date laws to cover up criminal behaviour… and this is truly shocking."" The issue with the Forest Practices Act was identified late last month during legal proceedings against four BBF members, including Bob Brown himself, who were charged with trespassing for protesting against logging in the Eastern Tiers near Swansea back in 2020. The group said those charges were suddenly dropped without explanation. ""I heard the police prosecutor say that the solicitor-general would be preparing validating legislation, and we realised something was amiss,"" Ms Weber said. ""This is the revelation that we needed from the minister to prove that the [logging of] wildlife-rich forest across Tasmania for decades has been illegal."" Greens leader Cassy O'Connor released a statement, calling for all logging in the state to be immediately halted. ""Guy Barnett has admitted his government has broken the law by logging forests in breach of the Forest Practices Act 1985,"" she said. ""It is unacceptable for a Minister of the Crown to sign off, with no authority, on illegal logging for at least the next two months."" However, the ABC understands the Forest Practices Authority will continue to issue permits, and no such cessation of logging activity will take place. ""The independent Forest Practices Authority has undertaken measures to ensure that the system continues to remain robust,"" Mr Barnett said. ""It is no secret that the radical Bob Brown Foundation and their parliamentary allies in the Greens will take any opportunity in their ongoing attempts to shut down our sustainable native forestry sector. ""In stark contrast, we make no apology for standing up for the thousands of Tasmanians, many in regional areas, who work in our sustainable native forestry industry."" Mr Barnett said criticism from the Greens was hypocritical. ""I am advised that similar delegations have been issued since the commencement of the Act in the mid-1980s, including under both Labor and Labor-Green governments."" The BBF has not ruled out taking legal action against the government to force a suspension of operations. ""We are known for our legal tactics,"" Ms Weber said. ""So, we will be looking at that."" Regardless, the dropping of charges against their members on this ""technicality"" has emboldened the BBF, which plans on increasing its demonstrations across the state from today. ""Instead of sending the police in to arrest the protesters, why don't the government just put their hands up and halt the logging?"" Ms Weber said. ""Because It's far too risky for logging to continue under such a bungled mess. ""All protesters who have been arrested while upholding the Tasmanian laws… need to have their charges dropped, and they need to be compensated."" Environmental Defenders Office managing lawyer Claire Bookless said the Tasmanian public deserved more details on the error. ""Large areas of Tasmania's old growth and native forest have been logged in the past 40 years. This is habitat for many threatened species including the critically endangered swift parrot, Tasmanian devil and many more,"" Ms Bookless said. ""We really need to understand the nature of the error that's led to this situation; it's not enough for the Government to simply say this is an administrative error."" She said the fact the government said it would pass retrospective legislation to correct the issue was concerning. ""It certainly would suggest that it is concerned that this logging has been illegal over this time... it does raise questions around whether there have been other issues and regulations within the Forest Practices Act that have been similarly overlooked.""

118,"Woodside ticks off final approvals for controversial Scarborough gas project, despite climate concerns",environment,"  Woodside's controversial Scarborough LNG project gets final approval amid climate warnings Woodside has ticked all the major regulatory boxes for its $16.5 billion Scarborough liquefied natural gas project, meaning work on Australia's biggest oil and gas project in a decade can kick into top gear. A spokeswoman for the Perth-based company said the WA government's approval of a pipeline licence was the last primary state and commonwealth approval required for Scarborough. But while the project has cleared its domestic regulatory hurdles, it has some global issues to contend with. Earlier this week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a new report which said the world needed to dramatically cut emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure to avoid the catastrophic effects of global warming. While the $16.5 billion gas development has been labelled by some as Australia's last big gas project, others predict the insatiable demand for energy in Asia will ensure fossil fuels are a long way from dead. It followed a report by International Energy Agency (IEA) last year, which called for no more investment in new oil, gas and coal projects if net zero emissions were to be achieved by 2050. The Scarborough project involves piping gas from the Scarborough gas fields, about 375 kilometres off the coast of WA, to an expanded Pluto processing facility near Karratha. It is expected to emit millions of tonnes of carbon over its lifetime. But the IPCC report's modelling showed that gas usage would need to be reduced by 15 per cent on 2019 levels to limit global warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2050. The report prompted a strong response from UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, who called investment in new fossil fuel infrastructure ""moral and economic madness"". Climate scientist Bill Hare, who was the lead author on a previous IPCC report, said the report showed that there was no room globally for a new gas project like Scarborough. ""Adding more gas to the system via Scarborough and other projects is actually going backwards because it's actually increasing emissions, not decreasing emissions,"" he said. ""In other words, it's making the situation worse, it's causing longer term lock-in of carbon intensive energy, it's really completely the wrong direction."" In a climate plan released last month, Woodside commited to net zero emissions by 2050 and a 30 per cent reduction by 2030. Traditional owners in the Pilbara have raised concerns a $16.5b gas project could damage ancient petroglyphs and the ""pristine"" natural environment. It said it would spend $5 billion on low-carbon projects that included current solar energy projects and investigating carbon capture and storage. Wood Mackenzie LNG analyst Daniel Toleman said high-level reports like that by the IEA were affecting investment and made it more challenging for companies to develop these projects. But he said he believed the demand for LNG would grow, particularly in South-East Asia and South Asia, and it would be needed as a backup for renewable energy sources. ""We still see LNG growing throughout both the 2020s, 2030s and well into the 2040s,"" he said. The invasion of Ukraine has also disrupted LNG projects in Russia, affecting investment and supply. Mr Toleman said some LNG projects under construction in Russia had been delayed, including the Baltic LNG project by the Russian state-owned company Gazprom. Australia's oil and gas champion Woodside was seemingly a company without much of a future. Until this week. Other projects at an earlier stage of development were also now in jeopardy. ""They now look unlikely with western companies pulling out, they're not going to finance those projects and so they need to be replaced by others,"" he said. ""But it does take quite a long time for LNG projects to move forward so ones that are already going forward are advantaged."" Woodside aims to send its first shipload of liquefied natural gas processed through Pluto Train 2 to north Asian customers in 2026. By this time, Mr Toleman said Scarborough was expected to produce about 9 million tonnes of LNG a year.

119,Does 'hypermiling' really reduce your petrol bill?,environment,"  What is 'hypermiling' and can it help you save money on fuel? Some motorists have been changing their driving habits after petrol prices soared above $2.20 last month. The ""hypermiling"" phenomenon has seen commuters turning off their air conditioners and keeping their feet off their accelerators in a bid to get more kilometres out of each tank of fuel. So what is hypermiling, and can it help you save money on your fuel bill? The term covers a range of techniques, including: Hypermilers share other tips and tricks (like planning journeys to take advantage of tailwinds) and shots of their fuel consumption figures online. But a word of warning: techniques like drafting or slip-streaming the vehicle ahead should be avoided, as they are highly dangerous. University of Southern Queensland researcher and mechanical engineering expert Ray Malpress says hypermiling has the potential to reduce fuel consumption by around 10 per cent. ""Anything more than that would take a lot of extra thinking and planning to reduce how much fuel you use,"" he cautions. ""It would be an extreme thing to get to 20 per cent, a 30 per cent improvement would require fairly unconventional behaviour on the roads."" Two things which will save you fuel are accelerating smoothly away from the lights, and braking smoothly and gradually when coming to a halt. Harsh acceleration and sudden heavy braking both increase fuel consumption, Dr Malpress says. There is a ""modest awareness of the phenomenon"" and anyone can incorporate these techniques into their driving, but there are some things to consider, Dr Malpress says. ""Of course you can’t just crawl around because you’re just going to upset everyone else on the road. But there are ways you can be conscious of reducing the rate that you accelerate."" Hypermiling can be difficult in instances where there's lots of traffic or someone is in a rush. ""If you had a family in the morning and you had to drop kids to school and get to work then there’s a limit to how much time you’ve got, and accelerating up to the speed limits quickly will use more fuel."" Remember, always drive to the road conditions and obey the law. The best way to reduce fuel is simple — drive less. Walking, riding a bike or catching public transport are great ways to avoid high fuel prices and be environmentally savvy at the same time. While it may not be in everyone's budget, Dr Malpress says having a hybrid car goes a lot further in terms of fuel efficiency than hypermiling.

121,Landcare moves to bring its vision for Imperial Lake recreational site and sustainability hub to life,environment,"  Landcare a step closer to transforming Broken Hill's Imperial Lake into recreational site Imperial Lake near Broken Hill has remained dormant for more than 40 years but that could change with a proposed plan to transform the site gaining traction. Landcare Broken Hill president Simon Molesworth pitched the group's idea for a recreational site and sustainability hub to the NSW Environment Minister James Griffin in Sydney last week. Essential Water began decommissioning the lake's dam wall in January this year because it was deemed ""high risk"" by the Dam Safety Committee and would cost up to $20 million to repair. Works were expected to be completed by the end of this month and Mr Molesworth said Mr Griffin was ""enthusiastic"" about the lake's future. ""We looked at the potential of the lake site itself for walking trails, for bicycle riding, for an arboretum, and then we looked at spots where we would transpose the sustainability hub. ""With the luxury of space, we're probably going to quadruple what we were thinking of doing at the Jubilee Oval. ""We'll have far more greenhouses, far more community garden beds, green waste recycling … and hopefully a wonderful cafe looking out on the lakes,"" he said. Before Imperial Lake was closed and used as an emergency water supply for the Silver City, locals would frequent the area to swim, fish and picnic. Mr Molesworth says it could be some time before the site is able to be enjoyed by the public again, with extensive planning and legal processes ahead. ""We have to have expectations this is not going to happen overnight. ""We want to make sure that there's something for everyone. ""We'll be managing the site so that we don't kill the goose that laid the golden egg … we really have to look after this,"" he said. Broken Hill City Council was one of the parties that expressed interest in purchasing the lake so it could be used for recreational activities. However, Mayor Tom Kennedy said the council would support Landcare taking control of the area. ""I think it's fantastic,"" he said. ""A better outcome for the community was if the council could support an organisation to operate Imperial Lake to reduce the expenditure to the community. ""Landcare has a lot of volunteers … it means that Imperial Lake will be able to be kept to a high standard at very little cost to the community."" Landcare Broken Hill has engaged a legal firm and will discuss management and corporate structures for the site this week.

122,Barkly locals frustrated as critical weather station is delayed another year,environment,"  Tennant Creek's long-awaited new weather radar delayed until mid-2023 as BOM blames COVID-19 Residents of the Northern Territory's Barkly region have been without a weather radar since 2015 but will now have to wait more than a year until a new radar is operational. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said COVID-19 travel restrictions had caused the original delivery date of late 2022 to be pushed back to mid-2023. The Doppler radar — which tracks rain and wind — is being built in Germany and is expected to arrive in the NT by mid-2022. Mike Nash, a Tennant Creek electrician who has been campaigning for a new radar since the old one was turned off, said he was disappointed by the latest delay. ""It's not good because we've been hoping like hell it was going to be built before Christmas this year and, all of a sudden, we have another six months,"" he said. ""Everyone used to look at it. ""[We] needed to know where the big rains fill, what roads are capable of handling traffic, what roads were totally not. ""It's got a hell of an impact on all the local people around the area."" The closure of Tennant Creek's previous radar in 2015 was met with anger by Barkly locals and the region's cattle producers. In 2019, the federal and NT governments committed nearly $18 million to the construction of a new radar. Northern Territory's Cattleman's Association chief executive Will Evans said it was not an option to go without a modern weather radar. ""In the 21st century, it is simply unacceptable that thousands of square kilometres of Australia's landmass have no accurate localised weather records"" he said. Mr Evans said delays due to COVID-19 were ""well understood by the pastoral sector"" but hoped the project was more than a ""footnote in the budget"". ""We've been fighting over this radar station for a decade,"" he said. ""The government needs to get this built and restore some faith that there's regional investment beyond the Berrimah Line."" Barkly Regional Council mayor Geoff McLaughlin said there had been some ""scepticism"" over the project in the community. ""But this is a huge thing for the Barkly considering it's going to be the best weather radar in Australia,"" he said. The Bureau of Meteorology's Bryan Hodge said the new radar, once completed, would enable industries and businesses such as farmers and tourism companies to make better decisions when preparing for severe weather. But he said the most complex stage of the project was selecting the right site to build the radar. ""We need to consider year-round site access, current and future lines of site … land ownership, and other local sensitivities,"" Mr Hodge said. ""In close consultation with local stakeholders, we have identified a number of sites that could be suitable. ""These sites require further investigation, including conducting appropriate consultation with traditional owners."" According to Mr McLaughlin and the Bureau of Meteorology, the project needed to be located on high ground in order to extend its range. ""The higher it is, the further it can go, so it can go up to like 300 kilometres out,"" Mr McLaughlin said.

123,'Wild dogs' in controversial photograph taken in outback Queensland identified as 'pure' dingoes,environment,"  'Wild dogs' in controversial photograph taken in outback Queensland identified as 'pure' dingoes It was a striking, and for some, uncomfortable, image. The term ""wild dog"" collectively refers to dingoes, feral domestic dogs and their hybrids A researcher says the majority of ""wild dogs"" in western Queensland are native dingoes Golden ""wild dogs"" strung from trees off the side of a tourist road in outback Queensland. DNA testing has revealed those so-called wild dogs were in fact ""pure"" dingoes. ""They were like 99.9 per cent, which is the highest value that you can get from the DNA testing that we do,"" genetic researcher Kylie Cairns said. ""It confirmed what we already knew from previous work in and around western Queensland, that the dingoes in that area are pure dingoes. ""We've previously tested hundreds of samples out of Queensland, and overwhelmingly, the animals test as being pure dingoes, particularly if you're in remote or more central Queensland."" Dr Cairns, from the University of New South Wales, says hybridisation between native dingoes and feral dogs is much less common than previously thought. ""Largely, I think the community, including livestock graziers, would be unaware that when you're talking about wild dogs that that means dingoes,"" Dr Cairns said. ""I think the term wild dog is confusing to a lot of people because they do not realise that term includes dingoes. They think that wild dogs and dingoes are different things. ""A lot of people believe because there's been this myth going around for decades, that there's no pure dingoes left in the wild … we know that's not true. … there's very, very little hybridisation."" But National Wild Dog Management coordinator at the Centre for Invasive Species Solutions Greg Mifsud said previous research has shown there are plenty of hybrids in outback Queensland. For decades, the dominant approach to ""wild dog"" management has involved trying to wipe them out. But a new group argues learning to co-exist with dingoes could benefit both landholders and the environment. ""It's very difficult to know unless you go and DNA every one of them,"" Mr Mifsud said. ""In previous work done in 2011, out of 357 samples that were analysed, only 20 per cent of those could be considered dingo, and the majority of those were crossbreeds. ""The difficulty in giving something a single name depending on what they are and where you're located is very difficult with these animals because they crossbreed with domestic dogs very readily."" Mr Mifsud said it would have been very easy for one of the pure dingoes strung from the tree to have mated with a domestic dog. ""If one of those bitches mates with someone's kelpie then automatically they're crossbreed,"" he said. Mr Misfud disagreed with claims graziers did not know they were dealing with pure dingoes. While he discourages hanging dead animals from trees, he said native dingoes, hybrids and feral dogs all had to be managed. ""From a management perspective, it is futile because we'll manage the impacts of dogs, whether they're dingoes or crossbreeds or wild dogs, whatever you want to term them, we manage for their impact,"" Mr Misfud said. Woolgrower Andrew Martin said attacks on livestock by wild dogs, including pure dingoes, could have devastating impacts on graziers. ""You can call it a wild dog, a dingo, a wolverine, a werewolf, a scribbly widget, I don't care what you want to call it, they're an uncontrolled vertebrate pest to my domestic animals,"" Mr Martin said. ""The original reason for calling them wild dogs was purely political correctness. ""People had a wild objection about 30 years ago to things being called dingoes and us wanting to advocate for the destruction of some, so we called them wild dogs and everyone settled down."" Central west Queensland grazier Angus Emmott, who took the image of the dingoes hanging from the tree last year, thinks the semantics are important. ""By calling them wild dogs it allows us on the land to bait the whole landscape and justify it, but they're not wild dogs,"" Mr Emmott said. ""We need to accept number one that they're dingoes, Australian native animal, and number two to look at how we're going to manage them. ""We need to sit down with the best evidence and representatives from agriculture and we need to work out a better and more nuanced approach.""

124,'We've reached a tipping point': A growing number of studies have found markers of emotions in animals,environment," Science Do insects, octopus and other invertebrates feel emotions? Evidence is building that they can Up until the mid-1980s, human babies didn't feel pain. Of course that's not actually true, but due to research conducted in the 18th and early 19th centuries, it was an attitude that still lingered among a small minority of scientists and medical professionals. So much so that some infant surgery was still conducted without, or with very little, anaesthesia in the US into the '80s. Today, the question of physical and emotional experience has moved beyond humans to animals, including invertebrates like insects, crabs and octopus. And it's not just the feeling of pain that is being debated, but the whole spectrum of emotional experience: stress, joy, apprehension, even pleasure. ""Given the growing number of studies finding markers of emotions in animals, we've reached a tipping point,"" philosopher Kristin Andrews tells the ABC. ""Science is generating more and more reasons to accept animals' emotions, without finding any new reasons to deny them."" Australia is full of weird plants and animals. And Dr Ann Jones is on speaking terms with most of them! Professor Andrews is a research chair in animal minds at the University of York in Canada. Alongside biologist and primate behaviour expert Frans der Waal, Professor Andrews argues in a recent issue of Science that the weight of evidence says many invertebrates experience what we might call emotions, and that this morally matters. ""If they can no longer be considered immune to pain, invertebrate experiences will need to become part of our species' moral landscape,"" they wrote. So what is some of the evidence that points to invertebrate sentience? And if we accept that some invertebrates experience emotions and pain, how should this change how we interact with them? Similar to the example of babies and pain, scientifically quantifying the emotional experience of animals is difficult because they can't tell us what they feel. But we may be able to infer the emotional state of animals by how they respond to things. In humans, negative emotions are correlated with ""pessimistic cognitive biases"" — basically when we're in a bad frame of mind, we tend to expect things to not go well for us. An experiment where honey bees were shaken for 60 seconds to simulate a predatory attack found the bees' equivalent of blood — called haemolymph — was lower in dopamine and serotonin after shaking, compared with bees that weren't shaken. Both dopamine and serotonin are involved in mood regulation in humans. But more than that, the shaken bees seemed to be less optimistic about their chance of getting a treat. At the beginning of the experiment, the bees were conditioned to recognise a reward — a sugary liquid — and a punishment in the form of a bitter quinine solution. There's long been debate over the use of whips when it comes to horse racing, but a scientific paper published today shows that horses are capable of feeling just as much pain from a whip as we would. After shaking, the bees were then offered mixtures made of different ratios of quinine and sugar liquid, including a half-half mix. The bees that hadn't been shaken were significantly more likely to extend their proboscis to taste the half-half mix than those that had. The inference was that ""negative cognitive bias"" in the shaken bees meant they were more likely to presume the borderline mixture was the punishment mixture, whereas the unshaken bees presumed the opposite. The bees' behaviour has ""more in common with that of vertebrates than previously thought"", the authors of that study wrote at the time. If a similar response was measured in humans, we'd have no doubt that emotions were involved, Professors Andrews and der Waal argue. ""In any mammal, a pessimistic behavioural response associated with physiological indications of stress would be taken as a sign of negative emotions,"" they say. ""The same logic should be applied to insects."" Similar studies in birds and mammals have also produced the same kind of responses. And though not invertebrates, research into rodents has found a whole host of behaviours that point to emotions beyond simple reflexive responses. A 2016 study found prairie voles display ""consolation behaviour"" — increased grooming of partners suffering distress — but that they don't elicit the same behaviour for unfamiliar voles in distress. And research from the 1990s found rats at play emitted distinctive chirping at a frequency of around 50 kilohertz, which scientist Jaak Panksepp argued was a primitive form of laughter. Even more so than when playing, the researchers found the rats would chirp when subjected to ""heterospecific cross-species handplay"" — otherwise known as tickling. This is some of the evidence that Professor Andrews says convinced her of broader animal sentience. ""I was struck by the late Jaak Panksepp's work on rat joy and laughter,"" she says. ""Rats solicit tickles from preferred researchers."" In addition to soliciting tickles, subsequent research found tickled rats showed behaviour patterns consistent with their having a more optimistic outlook than non-tickled rats. Having also previously studied rat behaviour, US-based marine biologist and physiologist Robyn Crook has also been studying pain responses in octopus. Last year, Dr Crook published research showing that octopus experience long-term pain, rather than just a simple reflexive withdrawal from damaging stimuli. Her research also suggested an emotional component to their experience of pain. Octopus in multi-chambered tanks were injected in one arm with a dilute acid. Following injection, they showed a significant and ongoing avoidance of the chamber in which they had been injected. They also tended to the arm long after the acid was administered. Those given analgesic drugs to numb the pain then showed a preference for the chamber where they were given the drug. What the science says about fish, crustaceans, cephalopods and their experience of pain and other feelings. The argument is that there must be an emotional experience that goes along with the feeling of pain in order to produce long-term behavioural changes. Without that experience to trigger the negative connotation between, in this case, the chamber and pain, there is no reason for the octopus to avoid the offending space in future. Dr Crook's research also showed extensive grooming of the painful site, and she demonstrated a physical pathway for pain to be processed by octopus. According to philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith from the University of Sydney, whose research interests include the origins of consciousness, Dr Crook's paper has given us the best demonstration so far of pain in cephalopods. ""I think that's the best paper on octopus pain ever — there are so many lines of evidence that point to pain in there,"" Professor Godfrey-Smith says. In terms of pain alone, late last year the evidence was deemed strong enough by the UK parliament that some invertebrates are now recognised as sentient, with rights to humane treatment under their Animal Welfare Bill. A large scientific review to inform the Bill conducted by researchers from the London School of Economics overwhelmingly found that the literature points to cephalopod molluscs — like octopus, cuttlefish and squid — and decapod crustaceans — lobsters, crabs, prawns and the like — being capable in varying degrees of experiencing pain and pleasure. The researchers scored the animals against eight criteria to come up with their findings. These included the possession of receptors (nociceptors) sensitive to a noxious stimulus, integrative brain regions capable of processing that sensory information, neural pathways to connect those nociceptors to the critical brain regions, and response to analgesic or anaesthetic. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they found the strongest evidence for sentience in octopus, but crabs, crayfish and cuttlefish also scored highly. Professor Godfrey-Smith says those animals were the right place to start in terms of broadening the scope of sentience. ""They chose cephalopods and crustaceans as the central cases to think about, and I think that was the right move,"" he says. So what about other invertebrates? They were beyond the scope of the parliament's commissioned study, but Professor Andrews says studying pain tends to be where research into emotion begins. ""We need more research on positive emotions in invertebrates,"" she says. ""It seems that the research starts with pain, and once pain is established, it opens the door to study other emotions."" It's worth stating first off that this issue is not entirely settled and there's still a lot of room for scientific debate, Professor Godfrey-Smith says. ""None of this is for sure,"" he says. ""There are plenty of people who would disagree; there are qualified people who still don't think fish feel pain."" But if we do get to a point where we recognise that invertebrates are capable of emotional experiences, how, if at all, should that change our behaviour and laws? First, it would mean that our own animal welfare laws, which already include vertebrates, would need broadening. But the specifics are up for debate. In the UK for instance, it was a recommendation of the review into the sentience of crustaceans and cephalopods that ""boiling alive, slowly raising the temperature of water, tailing (separation of the abdomen from the thorax, or separation of the head from the thorax), any other form of live dismemberment, and freshwater immersion (osmotic shock)"" be banned where other more humane killing methods are available. But what about their treatment before being dispatched? Is it ethical to keep sentient creatures in small tanks, for example? There are no blanket rules, according to Professor Andrews. ""We should be including invertebrates in animal protection schemes,"" she says. ""This doesn't mean that we would treat worms like we treat ravens, though."" Instead, these things will have to evolve as the science continues to catch up. ""Until we know more about animal emotions, we don't know what their interests are,"" Professor Andrews says. ""Even once we know that, we can't automatically infer anything about how to treat animals. ""The specific ethical conclusions about how to treat animals will come from a collaboration between scientists and philosophers."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. And what about our own interactions? Does this mean we should think twice before squashing a mosquito, for instance? Professor Godfrey-Smith says once we get beyond cephalopods and crustaceans, things start to get a bit murky. ""It would be so massive a shift to think that all the countless insects that are subject to pest control are sentient,"" he says. ""I don't think the case is nearly as strong for changing our behaviour toward them as octopus and crustaceans."" Professor Andrews also doesn't think considering a few more animals sentient will have life-changing implications for most of us. ""It's interesting to me that so many journalists are assuming (or think readers are assuming) that if we decide an animal is sentient, then we can't kill that animal,"" she says. ""The laws are about how to house sentient animals in a way that respects their needs, and to kill them humanely."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

125,Future of mega 'Mangrove Mountain dump' still uncertain despite court ruling,environment,"  Central Coast Council loses legal fight over mega landfill but environmentalists say it's far from over A new court ruling has backed a 2014 approval for the expansion of a massive landfill site that sits within the water catchment on the NSW Central Coast, but local opponents say it is not a green light. The ""Mangrove Mountain dump"", as it is known to locals, morphed from a simple golf course redevelopment more than two decades ago. As a huge dirt mound, large crater and leachate ponds emerged over the years, community concern also began to grow about the development's potential impact on the environment, especially the local water supply that feeds the entire region. In 2014, the Land and Environment Court gave the landfill operator, Verde Terra, approval to dump an extra 1.3 million cubic metres of waste at the site over 10 years – 25 times the original approval. Eight years later, the same court has now reaffirmed that decision after the Central Coast Council tried to have it overturned. But dump opponents such as the Community Environment Network (CEN) described the ruling as a ""mixed bag"" and insisted there was still a long way to go before the future of the development was known. ""If you sit down and read the 136 pages of documentation, it's not over by a long shot,"" CEN chairperson Gary Chestnut said. Central Coast Council kicked off the legal action in 2019 in a bid to challenge the validity of the landfill operation. The NSW Environment Protection Authority and Verde Terra, which has been affiliated with waste management company BINGO Industries, were also involved. The long-running matter involved two sets of proceedings and was described by the Commissioner as an ""increasing[ly] complex dispute"". The court has ""on balance"" accepted the operator's submissions including that it would suffer financially and that there was the no alternative remediation proposed by the council, if the 2014 consent order was not upheld. But the Commissioner also warned against any risk of future environmental contamination. ""In circumstances where, as the council highlighted, there is the potential for pollution to escape from the waste on the land adversely impacting the environment and neighbouring properties, this is unsatisfactory,"" the judgement said. The dump has faced staunch community opposition for years, with loud calls for it to be closed and the site remediated. The Mountain Districts Association led the charge, prompting independent reviews, public meetings as well as an unsuccessful campaign for the project to be examined by a commission of inquiry. The Mangrove Mountain landfill was further thrust into the national spotlight by the ABC's Four Corners program on illegal dumping in 2017. The court has settled some issues but Mr Chestnut maintains ""the way forward is actually complex"" and ""it hasn't exactly addressed what happens tomorrow."" While the latest judgement upheld the court order of 2014, it also ruled it can't be implemented in its current form because it was based on outdated environmental controls. According to Mr Chestnut, the operator needs to either get a new consent or have the court order modified, ""and that requires a lot of debate on how to go forward"". All parties have 33 days to consider the judgement and whether there may be any grounds for appeal. As the fight continues over the future of the operation, opponents have expressed fear about what impact it was already having on the region. ""There is 900 cubic metres of waste on site today, well in excess of the original approval and 80 per cent of it is not lined,"" Mr Chestnut said. ""Having that sort of volume of waste, without being contained is a real problem."" Both Central Coast Council and the EPA were considering the judgement.

126,"Scientists caught off guard by massive ice shelf collapse in 'coldest, driest' part of Antarctica",environment," Science Antarctic ice shelf the size of New York City finally crumbles after heatwave A massive ice shelf the size of New York City or Rome has completely collapsed in East Antarctica. Satellite images posted to social media late last week show the 1,200-square-kilometre Conger ice shelf collapsed on or around March 15. The collapse seems to have coincided with an extreme heatwave that saw parts of Antarctica experience temperatures 40 degrees Celsius above their monthly averages and records broken at several locations earlier this month. NASA earth scientist Catherine Colello Walker tweeted images of the collapse on March 25, and said it was one of the most significant events in Antarctica since the Larsen B ice shelf collapsed in 2002. The Larsen B ice shelf off the Antarctic Peninsula in West Antarctica covered around 3,250 square kilometres. ""[It's] possible it hit its tipping point following the Antarctic atmospheric river and heatwave too?"" Dr Colello Walker said alongside the post. More research will be needed to determine whether the recent heatwave was directly related to the collapse, but Matt King, who is the director of the Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science at the University of Tasmania, says it could have been one factor. ""We don't know [what impact the heatwave had] and that's something to dig into further,"" Professor King said. ""What is clear is that this area had been retreating since the 1970s. ""Whether that heatwave was the straw that broke the camel's back, it's certainly plausible."" Attached to land ice sheets and glaciers, ice shelves are the floating protrusion of ice that extends seaward from the coast. The collapse of ice shelves themselves has little direct impact in terms of sea-level rise, Professor King said. ""[Ice shelves] are already floating, so their break-up doesn't do anything much other than cool the ocean down,"" he said. But it's the destabilisation of land ice following a collapse where scientists focus their attention. Ice shelves are described as the ""safety belts"" on the oceanic margins of Antarctica. They work to hold back the advance of glaciers toward the ocean, according to Ben Galton-Fenzi, a glaciologist and senior scientist with the Australian Antarctic Division. ""Ice shelves play what's called a buttressing role,"" Dr Galton-Fenzi said. After returning from Antarctic voyages without a single krill to study, scientists had a daring idea: to flood an icebreaker and bring the krill to them. ""What that means is that there's friction between the glacier and the side walls, and the glacier and the bed."" When an ice shelf goes, that can act like releasing the handbrake on that land ice, allowing it to accelerate towards the ocean. ""The Larsen ice shelf is a classic example [where] there was a 4 per cent increase in sea level rise in the year after it collapsed,"" Dr Galton-Fenzi said. Sea level rise will not be as much of an issue if the Conger ice shelf collapses, Professor King said. ""That's not as big a deal here because there's not as much ice sitting behind it on the land,"" he said. ""It will still be scientifically interesting to watch and we'll learn new things from it, but it's not going to flood New York City any time soon."" But the event is a worrying sign as East Antarctica is considered the ""highest, driest, coldest region"" on the continent, glaciologist and climate scientist Peter Neff explained in a video posted to TikTok. ""We really did not anticipate seeing ice shelf collapse here,"" he said. The event is a reminder of the unknowns in predicting how fast sea-level may rise in future, according to Professor King. Large punctuated events like this, especially if they happen in parts of Antarctica where an ice shelf is helping hold back large amounts of ice, can throw out projections. ""This is the first time we've seen an [East Antarctic] ice shelf disintegrate away,"" he said. ""It's a good reminder that the East Antarctic could change dramatically and quickly, and there are key areas we need to understand better."" One of those factors is called gravitational self-attraction, according to Dr Galton-Fenzi. In short, everything with mass has gravity, and the greater the mass, the greater the gravitational force. The shrinking of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets will see their masses greatly diminished. ""When they start to shrink, they don't pull the water up to them as much as they did before,"" Dr Galton-Fenzi said. Instead, that sea-level rise will push further away from the poles, he said. ""The estimated sea-level rise in the latest IPCC report is [as much as 1.1 metres] by 2100, but we'd expect double that around Australia and the Pacific islands.""

128,'We'd never touch it if we knew': Farmer locked in carbon credit scheme backs inquiry into 'rort',environment," ABC Rural Grazier backs inquiry into carbon credits 'rort' A grazier locked into Australia's carbon offset scheme has backed calls for an independent inquiry into allegations the market is ""a rort"", saying the numbers on his property have never added up. A 7.30 investigation, which aired earlier this week, sent shock waves through the industry and federal government, as former head of the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee Andrew Macintosh alleged the schemes had degenerated to become a rort. ""Payments are being made to people to not chop down forests that were never going to be chopped down, to grow forests that are already there, to grow forests in places that will never sustain permanent forests,"" Professor Macintosh told 7.30. Grazier Jesse Moody said there had been little benefit on his property in south-west Queensland, near Cunnamulla, since beginning the project six years ago. The land was previously used for grazing. ""We'd never touch it if we knew what we were getting ourselves into,"" Mr Moody said. The grazier and 2022 Nuffield Scholar noticed improvements in the land for the first three years following destocking, but it then deteriorated quickly. ""You start seeing the country going backwards at quite a rate,"" he said. Mr Moody said he was was guaranteed more carbon credits than have ever eventuated. ""In our project we're estimated considerably more than what we've been able to deliver, which just highlights how much of a rort the scheme is,"" he said. ""We're in a very arid environment and we're not going to see those carbon sequestration levels that they're predicting in our environment, it's just not possible. ""What we're doing is actually going to be more destructive to the battle against climate change by making a market out of this in such an arid environment."" Mr Moody said the scheme needed to be performed in an environment that was more conducive to carbon sequestration. ""If you're going to fudge the facts, it's going to hurt us in the long term,"" he said. Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor told 7.30 Australia's carbon credits scheme is seen as one of the best ""in the world"". ""I have great confidence in the strength of this program,"" he said. The Clean Energy Regulator, which assists individuals and organisations undertaking projects to reduce emissions, said in a statement that the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) was a ""robust offsets scheme with a high degree of integrity"". ""All [human induced regeneration] projects must undergo at least three audits, which also check abatement claims and [include] regular regeneration checks,"" the regulator said. ""If trees are not growing according to modelled growth paths, crediting can be suspended until tree growth catches up. ""In extreme circumstances inadequate tree growth can result in [Australian Carbon Credit Units] being relinquished — but this has never occurred."" But others, including ANU professor Mark Howden and Greens leader Adam Bandt, have called for an inquiry into Australia's Emissions Reduction Fund. While it might end up hurting Mr Moody financially, the second-generation grazier said he supported an independent inquiry into the scheme. The implications could have big impacts in his district. At the end of 2020, there were 37 carbon farming projects in the Paroo Shire, which had earned more than $40 million. Over the next decade, $230 million is expected to be paid out to ERFs, or carbon farms, across the country. ""I think it's a wake up call that it desperately needs, yeah it might hurt us financially, but I think it's something that's needed not just for our sake, but for the sake of our district and the environment in a larger way,"" Mr Moody said.

129,Alex 'couldn't let go' of his uni project … and now it's been exhibited at MoMA ,environment,"  Design, climate change, and the 'eco-engineering' tools to help our oceans adapt All it takes is one line ... And then a bunch more … And then a lot more still … ... to create this. What you're looking at is a tool that could aid our coral ecosystems. (And it's made with 3D printing …) Human hands have brought our oceans to a crisis point, but these same hands have the power to change that, bit by bit … with a little bit of help from 3D printing. One of these tools made it to the Maldives in 2018. Near the coast of Summer Island to be specific. Officially called the Modular Artificial Reef Structure (MARS), these lattice-like structures sit on the sea floor. This is what they look like once they're installed. Think of them like Lego blocks — Lego for the tropics. The MARS units are the brainchild of Alex Goad. He's the founder of industrial design studio, Reef Design Lab (RDL). ""It was actually my graduate project from uni, so I'm just that person who could never let his graduate project go,"" Goad told ABC RN's Blueprint For Living. He said the units are designed to attract the growth of new coral, to ""act as a permanent coral farming device"". Of course, coral farming's success is dependent on keeping ocean temperatures from rising to such an extent that coral can no longer survive. And in recent weeks, new climate reports and a widespread bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef have demonstrated how much of a precipice coral reefs are on. RDL's MARS units are made with incredibly complex surface geometry — mimicking the crevices, gaps, and indents of natural coral environments to foster new coral growth. Some of the MARS units are installed with transplanted corals, or coral ""frags"" — think of these as starter kits for a new coral colony. These are grown in a coral nursery then returned to their natural habitat. Goad wanted to eliminate the need for heavy machinery during installation. Instead, his MARS units can be installed with divers and a dinghy. These units have to survive the extremely corrosive environment under the sea. So, Goad took some inspiration from the Ancient Romans to inform his decidedly modern invention. ""If you think about the ceramic amphora [vases] that they still find in the Mediterranean Sea after thousands of years, we clearly know ceramic is a great material for longevity underwater,"" he told RN Blueprint. ""We use a combination of 3D-printed moulds and slip casting to create the ceramic exterior. ""We then fill that with marine concrete and take the units individually underwater to start building these lattice structures."" Beneath the surface, divers gather coral frags … … which are installed on the MARS unit. And if all goes well… new coral begins to take shape. In time, the structures may become shelter for local fish. This one's attracted a moray eel. When it was installed in 2018, the MARS reef took the Guinness World Record for being the world’s largest 3D-printed ceramic reef. What started as Goad’s 2013 uni project has since been exhibited at New York's Museum of Modern Art, the Milan Triennale, Helsinki's Design Museum, and the National Gallery of Victoria. A weekly rummage through the essential cultural ingredients for a good life. ""[MARS] was the catalyst for starting the lab and continuing down a path of digital fabrication for marine restoration projects,"" Goad told RN Blueprint. The lab’s work all hinges on 3D printing’s ability to create incredibly intricate objects that traditional manufacturing can’t. While traditional manufacturing cuts away from a lump of raw material, 3D printing builds an object layer by layer. Designers can print objects with a multitude of materials simultaneously, with exceptionally fine detail — even replicating things like skin and organ tissue. So, when it comes to mimicking the complexity of the natural world, 3D printing is one of the best tools out there. ""If we were to use any other fabrication method, it's just harder and much more expensive for us to make the organic geometry that we really want to test,"" Goad told RN Blueprint. ""It's very affordable to have a 3D-printing farm like what we have here… ""… to test out all these different ideas so easily."" As Goad points out, his artificial reef blocks are ""only one of a million different restoration tools being used at the moment"". So what else has the lab been working on? If you're reading this in Australia, chances are you live within 50 kilometres of the ocean, like around 85 per cent of Australians. Australian coasts are at risk of being ""loved to death"", because urban sprawl isn't just a phenomenon that happens on land. ""We're very aware of habitat loss that's happening on land. We can see when we're removing a forest — the same things are actually happening underwater… we just don't see it,"" Maria Vozzo, a marine ecologist and research fellow at the CSIRO, told Blueprint for Living. In many urban areas, coasts are partly — and in some cases completely — artificial, neatly bordered by seawalls, jetties and building platforms. Sydney Harbour, for example, has 50 per cent of its coast wrapped up in artificial structures. The platform that holds up the Sydney Opera House is one obvious example. While these structures protect our built environment from inundation, they interrupt the habitats beneath the surface. And that's why the Sydney Institute of Marine Science (SIMS) has created these. Known as ""living seawalls"", they're tiles made of marine concrete, cast from 3D-printed moulds – all designed by Reef Design Lab. They're attached, Lego-like, to artificial structures to mimic the ""architecture"" of the coastlines they're placed in. And, with time, many marine creatures call the tiles' nooks and crannies home. Until recently, Dr Vozzo was manager of SIMS's Living Seawall program, an example of the emerging discipline of ""eco-engineering"", where environmental science and remedial design collide. To test variations in their tile designs, SIMS and Reef Design Lab collaborate on custom 3D-printed moulds. Prior to 3D printing, SIMS researchers had to contend with rudimentary experiments, like cutting flower pots in half and attaching them to seawalls to mimic rockpools. ""As researchers, we tend to go to Bunnings and see what we can find to try and retrofit something,"" Dr Vozzo said. ""Getting to that fine scale of modifying designs — like [seeing] what would happen if [tiles] had 45 and 55 degree angles — was something we couldn't do before."" Dr Vozzo told Blueprint she hopes that greater diversity in tile design brings greater biodiversity to Sydney Harbour. ""Designs that either retain water during low tide, or provide shade and moisture to keep the habitat cooler, have been really beneficial,"" she said. ""We tend to see really high [species] diversity and abundance in those types of features."" Further south, the Reef Design Lab has been working with the University of Melbourne to create custom planters to support mangrove seedlings. And on the other side of the Earth in the North Sea, RDL has a project with WWF Netherlands, using 3D-printed reefs to bring back biodiversity to one of the world's busiest seas. But do these objects actually work? No feat of eco-engineering can ever be an equal substitute for an existing natural environment. So, developers should only turn to it as a last resort. ""Something that we're always very cautious of is greenwashing — an excuse for developers to build a really damaging seawall in an ecologically important area,"" says Goad. ""We would never want a whole mangrove forest to be destroyed and have a Living Seawall put in its place."" It's a sentiment shared by Dr Vozzo. ""[SIMS] has been approached by different companies wanting to develop or modify natural shorelines [using] the Living Seawalls as an offset, when in our opinion, the development or modification wasn't needed — it was just a way for the project to get over the line,"" she told Blueprint  for Living. ""There's plenty of work going into living shorelines, where you use oyster reefs, salt marsh, mangroves or a combination of those to protect shorelines rather than build a hard structure. We want those options explored first."" But where hard underwater structures already exist, living seawall tiles can help mitigate the damage, Dr Vozzo said. As eco-engineering is a relatively new field, there isn't a heap of peer-reviewed research into how well it works. Louise Firth, a marine biologist at the UK's University of Plymouth, co-authored a summary of the research on eco-engineered marine structures. The upshot? ""The evidence is often pointing in the right direction that you can do interventions to improve the biodiversity and functioning of these environments,"" said Dr Firth. ""But it doesn't always work."" Much of the research about the Reef Design Lab's work specifically is still underway. It's also important to note that this research — while peer-reviewed — involves institutes that have directly commissioned the lab's work. This includes a SIMS-led study released in October 2020. That study analysed the results of their World Harbour Project, a simultaneous global experiment to see whether geometrically complex seawall tiles cast from RDL's 3D-printed moulds could increase biodiversity everywhere they were installed. Spanning 14 intertidal locations around the globe, the study found designs with greater surface complexity did support more species and higher populations of marine life. But this wasn't universal, with only 10 out of 14 locations recording positive effects when complex tiles were introduced. Tropical locations seemed to fare better than temperate ones, and the takeaway was that tiles need to be tailored to their local environment. ""Costly eco-engineering interventions may have negligible benefit at some locations and may even negatively influence some if applied blindly,"" the study authors concluded. Another study investigated whether complex Living Seawall tiles could have multiple functions. It looked at whether tiles could boost biodiversity and also lead to greater water filtration from species like oysters and mussels around Sydney Harbour. The researchers observed complex tiles, as well as other tiles that came seeded with native oysters. Greater complexity improved biodiversity and abundance, but there was a catch. Seeding was weaker on more complex tiles, although still more effective than with flat or unseeded tiles. Another SIMS study currently being peer-reviewed suggests different tile designs support different marine species. ""By having a mosaic of them on a seawall, you can support little communities within this broader living seawall,"" Dr Vozzo said. For Dr Vozzo, what's promising is the speed at which biodiversity takes to eco-engineered seawalls. ""The existing community — like oysters — on a flat seawall have been there for decades, if not longer,"" she said. ""After six months, the diversity [on living seawall tiles] already matches that of a decades-old community on an [unmodified] seawall, and after just two years, we've actually exceeded that diversity. ""Different designs or geometries do support distinct communities, and by [doing] this, you're further increasing the diversity over a stretch of seawall."" Eco-engineering seems like a tantalising prospect in a world reaching for technological convenience, while facing rapid warming. But eco-engineering alone isn't going to be the silver bullet that some want it to be. ""We get a lot of people saying, ‘We have mass coral bleaching in our area, can you bring some MARS units in?’"" Goad said. ""Even with a farming process, if you get really bad heat waves, everything is going to bleach anyway."" Still, eco-engineering is a tool to combat an existential threat that requires a plethora of responses. In RDL's case, while their tools are seductive — they've caught the eye of the art and design establishment, and even the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge — the hype can flatten the complexities of their work. ""Our work is so visually stimulating, and it makes for an interesting story — but it's not always told properly,"" Goad told Blueprint for Living. ""The most complex part of this business is working out how we communicate all of this work effectively, and how we do projects that won't just be used for greenwashing."" With the research still evolving, RDL's work, and work like it, remains largely experimental — which is why Goad tries to always work alongside marine scientists. ""Why would we want to be producing something that isn't beneficial?"" he said. It's a sentiment echoed by researchers including Dr Firth, who has previously warned against letting our desire for convenience allow eco-engineering to be used as a ""trojan horse"" for greenwashing. ""People are not looking for something that has to be bespoke. They want it to be easy… and who wouldn't?"" she told Blueprint for Living. ""In reality, the knowledge base is increasingly telling us that it's not that simple, it's far more nuanced, and the local environmental conditions can ultimately determine whether you get a successful result or not. ""One size does not always fit all.""

131,Some snakes can swallow colossal meals without choking. Now we know how,environment," Science How do snakes like boa constrictors breathe with a mouthful of food? Scientists have the answer If you've ever choked on a big mouthful of food, you might have some insight into the challenges of feasting and breathing simultaneously. But what if you couldn't chew your food, and you were the type to eat meals greater than your own body mass in a single sitting? And what if before swallowing your giant meal, you also had to squeeze it to death? Without any arms? Scientists have previously described many of the clever tricks different snakes use to breathe and swallow food at the same time. But for the first time, researchers have published an empirical study in the Journal of Experimental Biology today, that shows how some snakes manage to squeeze their prey to death and push it past their own lungs without suffocating themselves in the process. Unlike humans and other mammals, snakes don't possess a diaphragm to assist with their breathing. Instead, they use their ribs. In between each rib are muscles — primarily the levator costa muscles — which help the ribs contract the lungs, forcing air in, and then letting air out when the ribs relax. So the question for biologists has been, how do snakes like the boa constrictor continue using their ribs to pump their lungs with a massive meal in the way, or when they're constricting a future meal? The answer, according to today's research, is modular lung ventilation. But to get an idea of what that means, we've first got to step back a bit and cover off some basic snake anatomy. Because of their stretched out, elongated form, snakes' lungs aren't located side to side like ours. Instead, they've evolved one shorter and one very long lung in series. The longer lung occupies around 30 per cent of the body length in boas, and as much as 80 per cent of the body length in some colubrids and elapids, according to the study's lead author John Capano from Brown University in the United States. Colubrids and elapids are rear-fanged and front-fanged snake families respectively, and most Australian snakes fall into one of these two families. In many snakes, the smaller left lung is basically vestigial — it's evolved to a point where it has little to no purpose, and all gas exchange happens with the longer lung. ""These long lungs are also interesting in that only the front regions do gas exchange,"" Dr Capano said. ""The back sections are avascular or 'saccular', much like a simple balloon, and are used primarily for ventilation and moving air."" In other words, the front part of the lungs behave like ours, where oxygen and other gases can enter and exit the bloodstream, while the rear of the lungs are more like a pump to get air moving around. The ""pump"" can also be used to help snakes hiss, but that's another story. So scientists applied blood-pressure cuffs — the type of inflatable cuff that doctors use to take our blood pressure — to restrict movement along body sections of boa constrictors. They then used a combination of X-ray, videography, and other scanning methods to study the rib movement of the snakes, and in particular where that rib movement was facilitating breathing. ""We found that boa constrictors were able to activate very discrete sets of ribs,"" Dr Capano said. ""[They] could effectively turn off one set [of ribs], and turn on another at will throughout the body."" What that means is that when their lungs are partially impeded by a meal, boa constrictors are able to use just a couple of ribs to compress their lungs. And when their lungs are completely obstructed, they're able to engage the pump region of the lung to move air around. Given that a snake's ribs run almost the entire length of the body, it makes sense they would conserve energy by not using all the ribs to inflate their lungs. Even so, researchers couldn't assume that was the case, according to reptile evolutionary biologist Alessandro Palci from the University of Adelaide. ""We didn't know until we checked,"" said Dr Palci, who wasn't involved with this study. ""If you look at other animals, even us, we breathe with the whole rib cage."" The researchers think that the levator costa muscles are integral to snakes' ability to selectively engage ribs, and that this likely developed very early in snake evolution. ""We think modular lung ventilation preceded or evolved in concert with constriction and large prey ingestion,"" Dr Capano said. ""[Constriction and large prey ingestion] could not evolve to the exaggerated levels we see today without the ability to breath during both the killing of prey with constriction, and the ingestion of large prey items."" There are more than 3,700 species of snakes (Serpentes), and they're found in every continent except Antarctica, and across an array of habitats from rainforest to deserts. Christina and her husband have been bitten by snakes five times between them — and they're snake-handling professionals. Here's their inside knowledge about how to survive being bitten by a venomous snake. The researchers hypothesise that the early development of modular lung ventilation allowed for snakes to become so diverse. ""This then allowed snakes to take advantage of a much larger range of resources than other elongate limbless animals (most of which eat primarily small insects) and therefore diversify into many different niches,"" Dr Capano said. But Dr Palci isn't so sure. He says there are a number of other animals with elongated body forms, including the elapid and colubrid snakes, that don't use constriction or consume oversized prey. ""It's probably necessary to have levator muscles to be able to do what snakes do,"" he said. ""But if this levator muscle is key to this localised lung ventilation, then [why don't we] see constriction and large prey ingestion in other animals?""

133,Willem Dafoe narrates the story of the world’s rivers in this stunning new Australian documentary,environment,"  River: Australian documentary narrated by Willem Dafoe highlights the importance and precarity of rivers worldwide Willem Dafoe was filming Spider-Man: No Way Home in Atlanta in 2021 when he used a day off to record narration for an independent Australian documentary, titled River. River (co-produced by ABC) is a follow-up to 2017's Mountain, which broke Australian box office records as the highest-grossing homegrown non-IMAX documentary — and was also narrated by Dafoe. Like Mountain, it blends cinema essay with documentary, to tell the story of one of Earth's formative features: how they shaped first the planet and then human civilisation — before humans learned how, in turn, to shape them. It was filmed in 39 locations, and features NASA time-lapse imagery and aerial shots captured by an informal global network of drone cinematographers. Like Mountain, it features music performed by the Australian Chamber Orchestra (Mountain was in fact instigated by ACO's artistic director Richard Tognetti, as a live concert film) and a poetic text by British nature writer Robert Macfarlane. ""River somehow seems more political [than Mountain],"" says Dafoe. ""They're both meditations on civilisation's relationship to nature. But this one charts a little clearer the history and the degradation of [the environment]."" The environmental message appealed to him, though he didn't want the film to feel like a lecture. ""I guess I feel like this film is an awareness raiser. And then people, as they get more information, and they reflect on how they have to change their behaviour, hopefully there will be a more positive result,"" he says. For Dafoe, narrating Mountain and River are relatively small jobs in a career that spans from Marvel movies to art-house films like The Lighthouse. (His narration for River is just under 1400 words). He signed on for Mountain after documentary-maker Jennifer Peedom approached him. ""I checked her out, I looked at her films that she'd made — particularly Solo, that she made with David Michôd, and also Sherpa. And then I think she sent me a link to the film and the text,"" Dafoe says, on Zoom from Italy, where he lives in a place outside Rome. ""I liked how she approached me, I liked the material, and I liked the idea that it would be touring with an orchestra; that's kind of a nice change for a movie. So I signed on to that."" He enjoyed that project so much that when Peedom asked him to narrate River, it was a no-brainer — despite the fact that he was her 'back-up' choice this time. ""She said, 'I'm thinking about a female voice for it. But if I can't find the right voice, would you be waiting in the wings?' And I said, sure,"" he smiles. ""She was so clear about that, that I was happy to say 'Yes — find what you need. And if you need me to do the voice, I will.'"" Dafoe describes the process of working on both films as a kind of ""call and response"" between him and Peedom, as they tried to weave the narration with jaw-dropping imagery and the soundtrack (which ranges from Vivaldi to Radiohead to an improvisation by Aboriginal Australian composer, singer and multi-instrumentalist William Barton). Tops Arts & Culture headlines. ""She kind of leads things, you know — directs me to go against things; to go with it; to explore different ways of doing it. Sometimes very objectively, sometimes more subjectively. It's a fun game between an actor and a director,"" Dafoe says. ""There's something fluid and you don't feel yourself; you hop on a train, and it takes you somewhere … And I like that feeling."" Mountain covered terrain close to Jennifer Peedom's heart: she was a long-time climber herself, and had discovered later in life that she had a natural affinity for high altitudes — which made her the perfect fit for filming expeditions. When the Australian Chamber Orchestra approached her with the concept for Mountain (conceived as a follow-up to an ACO concert film called The Reef), she was already plotting her 2016 documentary Sherpa, shot on Mount Everest with cinematographer Renan Ozturk. In downtime, the two discussed what Mountain might be. Mountain was also largely shaped by the writing of Robert Macfarlane — specifically, his 2003 book Mountains of the Mind, about the powerful lure of these landscapes. He ended up joining the team, writing the poetic text for the film. Both Sherpa and Mountain were hits at the Australian box office (taking roughly $1.27 million and $2 million, respectively), making a follow-up seem less like a daydream and more like a smart move. ""[Rivers] became the next logical step when we started to talk about what we wanted to do next,"" Peedom says. ""Obviously the climate is something that's at the front of all of our minds … [and] there did seem to be a need to ask, gently, some more urgent questions — like, are we thinking about those downstream of us? And about what it means to be a good ancestor."" The narrative arc of River takes in the formation of the planet and the rise of civilisation at the water's edge — and the shift towards humans seeing rivers less as gods and more as resources, to be harnessed. A significant slice of the film's 75 minutes is devoted to the damming and diversion of rivers — a path paved with good intentions (and many positive outcomes), but with disastrous environmental consequences that flow downstream in place and time. (Cue scenes of eco-horror — including the Darling-Barka river thick with blue-green algae and dead fish.) The film makes a clear statement: the fate of humans and rivers are fundamentally intertwined. Peedom thought carefully about the tone and narrative arc of the film — ""the balance between hope and despair and urgency"" — and went a step further: she tested it with audiences. ""The first test that we did was with a bunch of the film students who were close to where we were editing, at film school. And, you know, I think the first pass [edit of the film] was a little too heavy — certainly one of our producers felt that,"" she recalls. ""And then we're going to the film school, and all these young people, they said, 'No, you're not going nearly hard enough, you need to go harder.' And so the tone did shift in the editing process."" By coincidence, the first day of pre-production on River was also the first day of lockdown in Australia — March 16, 2020. For a film with a global scope, it was bad news. ""Needless to say, we had intended to travel and shoot more,"" says Peedom. ""[But] we never intended to shoot absolutely everything, because you just can't — this film was shot in 39 countries. And so we were always going to be drawing on the cinematography of [other] people, like we had on Mountain."" Some of the most incredible shots in the film were supplied by drone cinematographers from across the world. ""We had to connect into all of those networks that we'd established with Mountain, but further extend them,"" says Peedom. She and her co-director, Joseph Nizeti (who was tasked with developing and tapping into this network), were pleasantly surprised to discover that the technology and quality of drone cinematography had rocketed in the years between films. ""And so there was this amazing array of these young drone cinematographers,"" says Peedom — name-checking Dutch drone pilot Ralph Hogenbirk (whose proximity shots of a Norwegian glacier come early in the film) and Australian filmmaker Rory McLeod (whose shots of the Murray-Darling basin were taken while shooting his own documentary). ""The happy discovery was also that a lot of them had seen and loved Mountain, so they were really keen to be involved,"" says Peedom, ""I think it's partly why the film is the way that it is. And it is a truly global perspective of like-minded people who care about the planet, but also care specifically about rivers."" River is in cinemas from March 24.

134,Katherine council says toxic tyre fire clean-up complete,environment,"  Katherine council says toxic tyre fire clean-up complete, but government still needs to assess final reports Almost three years after an illegal wall of tyres erupted into flames, sending toxic black smoke into the sky over homes in Katherine and chemicals deep into the ground, the local council says it has completed its remediation. Toxic chemicals leached into the ground in the aftermath and contaminated soil had to be disposed of in Darwin The Department of Environment, Parks and Water Security still needs to review reports and make an assessment The discovery of the illegal stockpile of about 300 tonnes of old tyres following the fire in Katherine South in July 2019, prompted an investigation into the council by the Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority. The blaze also forced Territory Day events to be moved to another venue. As emergency services and volunteers fought to control the flames, unprecedented health warnings were issued to residents to close their windows and shut down their air conditioners as smoke lingered in the sky. The long, laborious process of returning the public land back to its former state started almost immediately after the EPA ordered the council to remove the waste. But chemicals from the tyres leaked into the ground for months, according to council documents, as the stack smouldered under a pile of dirt. While the Katherine Town Council on Tuesday night unanimously voted to officially inform the EPA the clean-up had been concluded, the Department of Environment, Parks and Water Security still needs to make final assessments. Katherine Mayor Elisabeth Clark said remnants of the tyre fire had been an ongoing issue for the council, but years of hard work had paid off. ""We have kicked all the goals we needed to and we've finally rehabilitated the site,"" she said. According to council documents, the tyres plus almost 750 tonnes of contaminated soil had to be trucked hundreds of kilometres north to Darwin's Shoal Bay Waste Management Facility for disposal. The EPA's investigation found the Katherine Town Council was not licensed to store or dispose of the tyres at the site and had potentially committed several offences under the Waste Management and Pollution Control Act 1998. Council then entered a performance agreement to avoid a costly prosecution. It agreed to establish a new air monitoring station for the town – built at the cricket oval – and implement a waste management strategy. Adelaide-based consultancy firm Esher Environmental Services carried out the independent review of soil assessments earlier this year and found ""no further remediation of the site is required for ongoing recreational land use"". The Department of Environment, Parks and Water Security said it was working on its response to the council's claims the site has been remediated.

136,Fines issued during opening days of Victoria's duck hunting season,environment,"  Duck shooters accused of inhumane activity during season's opening weekend Allegations shooters have exceeded bag limits and inhumanely dispatched birds during the first week of the Victorian duck season have been reported to authorities. Coalition Against Duck Shooting member Craig Davey told ABC Central Victoria that animal rescuers found a pit of 23 dead whole birds buried at Lake Bael Bael, north-west of Kerang. Under Victorian law, shot birds must be harvested and taken away. ""A duck shooter can shoot four birds per day, but we've witnessed many times that they're shooting above this and just leaving them in the wetlands,"" Mr Davey said. ""The Game Management Authority (GMA) was onsite, so all this has happened in front of the Game Management Authority on one wetland."" Mr Davey said the Coalition Against Duck Shooting had reported several illegal activities to the GMA over many years. GMA chief executive Graham Ford said the authority had already issued ""a number of infringement notices"" since the beginning of the duck hunting season on March 16. ""We are investigating a number of briefs, interviewing a number of hunters and protesters who have breached some of the public safety laws,"" Mr Ford said. ""We are making a number of inquiries around a range of matters."" Animal activist and Trentham resident Helen Round called into ABC Central Victoria Breakfast and said she had reported a hunter exceeded the bag limit and swung a duck around their head to the GMA during the first weekend of the season. ""This is a vile and disgusting sport,"" Ms Round said. ""I was there on Wednesday, and I was there for the opening weekend, and what I saw has left me traumatised. ""I was up at Kerang and I went to Bael Bael and Murphy's swamps … seeing flapping birds being held by the head and swung around like windmills to kill them was just abhorrent."" Mr Ford said while the actions of some shooters may seem inhumane, they may not be against the law. ""What looks like an offence on a wetland may not be an offence in a court of law,"" he said. ""[Swinging a duck in the air by the neck is] not our recommendation. But then whether that breaches the threshold of being a cruelty offence is a different matter."" Ms Round said when she radioed the incidents into the GMA, she was told they would not be conducting further investigations and she needed to move or risk being fined. Mr Ford said if Ms Round was within 10 metres of the shooter, then she was at risk of a fine. But he could not comment on individual incidents. Want more local news?

Police from Gannawarra said in supporting the GMA, officers had issued two people with infringements for entering a hunting area without a permit and issued ban notices for the rest of the season. The unit also said a hunter received an infringement for shooting a protected species and had his firearm confiscated. Mr Ford said the GMA would follow up every report it received but had no reason to recommend the duck hunting season be shut down. ""Our role is not to manage areas that are designated for hunting,"" he said. ""We will recommend where we have a role to play where we see congregations of threatened species and that they need to be protected that we will recommend closing that down. ""The future of hunting is very much in the hands of the hunting community, they need to make sure that they are doing the right thing."" Victoria's duck hunting season will end on June 13.

137,Traditional owners target international financiers in legal bid to block billion-dollar gas project,environment,"  NT traditional owners take legal action over Santos's Barossa gas project north of Darwin Traditional owners in the Northern Territory say they have launched international legal action to try to block one of the biggest projects announced in the Australian oil and gas sector for almost a decade. Last year, Santos signed off on the $4.7 billion Barossa offshore development, which includes a pipeline from a gas field in the Timor Sea to an existing LNG facility on Darwin Harbour. But some Tiwi Islander and Larrakia elders fear the project will have detrimental impacts on their sea country and marine life. They say they do not support the pipeline, which is proposed to run through a habitat protection zone near the Tiwi Islands, north of Darwin. Lawyers acting on their behalf have filed for an injunction in a Seoul court to try to prevent South Korean export agencies providing almost $1 billion in loans for the Barossa project. One of the plaintiffs in the case, Jikilaruwu Tiwi clan leader Daniel Munkara, said his people had not been given enough information about the development. ""By taking the South Korean government to court to stop this gas project, we are protecting our family and our land,"" Mr Munkara said in a statement released by an international alliance known as the Stop Barossa Gas Campaign. Another Jikilaruwu Tiwi clan leader, Francisco Babui, said the proposed route of the pipeline was too close to the western tip of Bathurst Island. ""There is a reef there with lots of turtles and dugongs,"" Mr Babui said. ""The turtles lay their eggs on that beach and we go hunting in that area."" Kevin ""Tibby"" Quall, a Dangalaba Larrakia elder, said he was concerned about potential impacts in the Darwin region. ""The Barossa project is devastating for us and our future,"" Mr Quall said. ""It means massive industrialisation on Dangalaba and Larrakia country."" In a statement to the ABC, Santos said the Barossa project ""has all the necessary approvals in place"". ""As is the case for all of our projects, we undertake consultation with all key stakeholders where they receive detailed information about the project."" US gas giant ConocoPhillips previously held the rights to the Barossa project before it was sold to Santos in 2020. When Santos announced its final investment decision last year, it said it had partnered with private South Korean firm SK E&S in a joint venture. The legal action in South Korea specifically targets two export credit agencies said to be funding loans for part of the project: the Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) and the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (K-SURE). Santos is not part of the legal action. ""We hope that we win this case and that no one will want to give any more money to Santos,"" Mr Babui said. In addition to the pipeline, the Barossa project includes a floating production vessel as well as subsea wells and other infrastructure. Gas production is expected to begin in 2025. Santos estimates the project will create 600 jobs during construction as well as 350 ongoing jobs in Darwin over the next two decades. The Stop Barossa Gas Campaign is an alliance made up of the Environment Centre NT, Jubilee Australia Research Centre and a South Korean-based organisation called Solutions for Our Climate. The Environment Centre NT said it was concerned the Barossa project will generate millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year. Santos has previously said it planned to investigate options for carbon-neutral LNG production through processes such as carbon capture and storage and carbon credits.

138,Plant-based protein and cultivated meat offer food for thought for producers,environment," ABC Rural Non-traditional protein farming offers food for thought, CSIRO report suggests Changing diet trends, a fast-growing population and international trade opportunities could help Australia become ""a global delicatessen"" for protein, according to national science agency CSIRO. The report titled Protein: A roadmap for unlocking technology-led growth opportunities for Australia found a $13 billion market opportunity for a variety of proteins on the global market, and outlined how investing in this sector could create up to 10,000 jobs. Future Protein Mission lead Professor Michelle Colgrave said Australia's strong history and global reputation in agriculture and food presented a big opportunity for future growth. ""We are seeing a growing global population and an emerging middle class in regions like Asia, but in Australia we are also seeing changing consumer preferences,"" she said. ""Up to a third of Australians are now either seeking flexitarian or reducetarian diets. ""This means they still consume products like red meat or seafood, but they're doing so less frequently or having a reduced portion size and in doing so they're seeking alternatives."" Investment in new technology to create plant-based proteins, better-tasting legume crops, cultivated meat and edible insects are just some of the market growth opportunities available, Professor Colgrave said. ""We already export about 70 per cent of the food we produce, and now we're looking at new industries for Australia. ""We're also looking at the environmental benefits that can come from diversifying our protein offerings - we can reduce our footprint for some of our systems."" Professor Colgrave said scaling up industries already present in Australia would also aid the nation's food security, as it was expected there would be an extra 2 billion people on the planet to feed by 2050. ""In the case of our aquaculture, we have a white-flesh fish industry that is relatively small but we've got the opportunity to grow it in three to five years,"" she said. ""We'll be able to reduce the reliance on imported white-flesh fish products, which we currently import around 90 per cent (of), so we've got an opportunity to change that right now."" But developments in the plant protein space could take more time and investment, Professor Colgrave said. ""We need to scale up the infrastructure to really be able to on-shore some of our manufacturing,"" she said. ""We grow all the crops here, but now we need to be able to turn those crops into ingredients that can go into food manufacturing - that's a critical part. ""It will take a little bit of time to establish that."" Professor Colgrave said the road map highlighted how protein demand could only be met by bringing together animal, plant and non-traditional protein production systems. ""There is a seat at the table for everyone, no one is going to miss out."" she said. ""Protein demand is going to exceed what we can currently possibly produce, it's just a question of how do we access those additional export markets. ""There are opportunities to value-add red meat - for example, using the lesser cuts to produce protein powders and nutraceuticals.""

139,‘Left behind’: Senior custodian raises concerns about future of sacred sites amid Supreme Court hearing,environment,"  Senior custodian raises concerns about future of NT sacred sites amid Kakadu Supreme Court hearing A Kakadu senior custodian has raised concerns that a pending Supreme Court decision over alleged sacred site damage could water down protections for other sacred grounds. The Northern Territory's sacred sites watchdog, the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (AAPA), alleges federal government body Parks Australia illegally built a walking track to the top pools of Gunlom Falls, one of Kakadu National Park's most picturesque locations. The walking track is near a sacred men's site which, under Aboriginal law and custom, should not be viewed by women and children. The fight reached the NT Supreme Court on Monday after the federal government argued Parks Australia could not be prosecuted under the Northern Territory's Sacred Sites Act, kickstarting a complex constitutional debate over the culpability of Commonwealth bodies under territory law. In the second day of submissions, AAPA lawyers argued Parks Australia should be able to be tried for criminal charges under territory legislation. At a time when tourism operators are banking on a boom in the domestic market, Australia's biggest national park is falling into disrepair as a bitter dispute over management rages. Speaking outside the Supreme Court, Senior male Bolmo custodian Joe Markham said he was worried the future of other sacred sites won't be secure if the federal government successfully argued it couldn't be held culpable for allegedly disturbing a sensitive location. ""I'm hoping this court case will put something down in stone to allow these sorts of things not to happen in the future,"" he said. ""We don't want a new management team coming and going back to this issue again."" Mr Markham said he felt the legal battle was now far removed from the initial concerns of potential damage to a sacred site. ""There's a lot of legal jargon back and forth between the lawyers,"" Mr Markham said. ""We're just concerned that the site at Gunlom has been left behind, it's not the issue in the courtroom. ""The Jawoyn people want our sites to be protected, we don't want to open the area to tourists at the cost of our sacred sites."" Parks Australia said in a statement that it was commitment to improving its damaged relationship with Kakadu's traditional owners. ""Parks Australia reiterates its commitment to continue working with traditional owners of KNP (Kakadu National Park) so that we can move forward together, acknowledging the matters before the court are now outside of our control,"" it said in a statement. ""Parks Australia has committed to obtain an Authority Certificate where there is a potential impact on a sacred site in the KNP, regardless of the outcome of this present court case."" Mr Markham said while the relationship with Parks Australia had improved after an overhaul of Parks Australia's management, he was still concerned about the future of sacred sites. ""The current management team has worked well with the traditional owners to rectify the situation,"" he said. The Supreme Court justices are expected to hand down a decision in the coming months. If they find Parks Australia can be tried under the Sacred Sites Act, the matter will return to the Local Court. Parks Australia has previously apologised to traditional owners for any distress caused by the walking track and agreed to realign it.

140,Temperatures hit 'unthinkable' highs at both of Earth's poles on the weekend. Climate scientists are trying to find out why,environment," Science Antarctic and Arctic heat records have been smashed. What's going on? Antarctic and Arctic temperature records were sent tumbling over the weekend. Parts of eastern Antarctica were reportedly around 40 degrees Celsius above average, with Concordia weather station at 3,234 metres above sea level recording its highest ever temperature of -11.5 degrees Celsius, according to tweets from meteorologist Etienne Kapikian from France-Meteo. The March temperature record at Antarctica's Vostok station was broken by almost 15C and the Terra Nova Base on the Antarctic coast hit +7C, according to tweets by extreme weather tracker Maximiliano Herrera. Meanwhile, at the other end of the planet, parts of the Arctic were reported to be experiencing extremes pushing 30C above the monthly average. Heat records were broken in Norway and extreme highs were recorded in Greenland. Climate change forecasts all predict increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. So is this what we're witnessing? First of all, it's unlikely that the simultaneous occurrence of these two events is related to the same weather pattern, according to Simon Alexander, an atmospheric scientist from the Australian Antarctic Program. ""It probably is [coincidental], but the scientists will have to carefully figure that out to confirm that it's a coincidence,"" Dr Alexander said. In terms of the event in the southern hemisphere, a very large high-pressure system drove warm moist air from the Southern Ocean down across Antarctica. ""There was a massive high pressure system south-east of Australia over the Southern Ocean,"" Dr Alexander said. ""It directed some really moist air downward to Antarctica where it was warm enough [to] actually fall as rain on the coast."" He said there was also a possibility that rain records may have been broken in Antarctica, where precipitation typically falls as snow, but it's too early to say. Antarctica occasionally experiences these type of events where unseasonal temperatures are recorded, but this was an especially extreme example. ""Periodically we get these atmospheric rivers, if you think of it like a stream of water in the sky coming from low latitudes,"" Dr Alexander said. ""This one that we're talking about now seems to be a really big event given the amount of moisture and the temperatures we're seeing."" What makes this event even more unusual is the timing. Antarctica's days are rapidly growing shorter at this time of year and temperatures should be much colder. At the same time, the Arctic should still be emerging from winter. The fact that both are experiencing simultaneous heat events has been described as ""unthinkable"" and ""stunning"" by some scientists. ""They are opposite seasons. You don't see the north and the south (poles) both melting at the same time,"" National Snow and Ice Data Centre scientist Walt Meier told US media. So can we attribute these events to climate change,  La Niña, both or neither? Climate forecasts predict a long-term trend of warming in Antarctica and the Arctic. They also predict an increase in intensity and frequency of more extreme events — both hot and potentially cold. According to the IPCC, extreme heat events have increased in the Arctic since 1979, and we're likely to see ice-free summers once a decade on average in the Arctic at 2C of warming. In the Antarctic Peninsula, a strong warming trend has been observed since the 1950s, and the IPCC forecasts the Antarctic Peninsula, West Antarctic and parts of the East Antarctic will continue to warm at above average rates throughout this century. At sustained warming of between 2C and 3C the West Antarctic ice shelf is predicted to disappear completely over several millennia, releasing enough water to lift sea levels more than 3 metres. But while this current extreme event is consistent with climate forecasts, and we're likely to see more extreme events like this in Antarctica and the Arctic in the near future, it's too early to scientifically conclude that the driver of this particular event is climate change. Which is a very different thing to saying it's not. To find out whether climate change or weather patterns such as  La Niña are contributing factors, scientists will need to conduct specific research, Dr Alexander said. ""To attribute this type of event to La Niña or climate change, scientists have to do what are called attribution studies,"" he said. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Attributions studies usually use models to compare different scenarios — one where anthropogenic emissions aren't a factor and one where they are. In that way, they can try to tease out the likelihood of such an extreme event occurring in the absence of human-caused climate change. But it's likely to be many months or years until we see that peer-reviewed data. In the meantime, Dr Alexander said if the weather returns to normal, it's unlikely that this event alone will greatly disturb long-term melting trends.

141,Commonwealth fronts Supreme Court over alleged Kakadu sacred site disturbance,environment,"  Commonwealth argues it can't be prosecuted for alleged Kakadu sacred site damage, as NT Supreme Court hearing begins A years-long battle over alleged sacred site damage in Kakadu National Park has reached the Supreme Court, with the federal government arguing it can't be held liable because the relevant law doesn't apply to it. The Northern Territory's sacred sites watchdog, the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (AAPA), alleges the federal government organisation Parks Australia illegally built a walking track to the top pools of Gunlom Falls, one of Kakadu's most picturesque locations. Traditional owners in 2020 raised concerns over the walking track, constructed adjacent to a sacred men's site, which under Aboriginal law and custom was not allowed to be viewed by women and children. Lawyers for the government argued Parks Australia cannot be prosecuted under the Northern Territory's Sacred Sites Act due to Commonwealth immunity from territory legislation. Defence barrister Brendan Lim told the court the government body, and its Director, was immune because it was a functioning part of the government and therefore not covered by Northern Territory law. He said the role of Parks Australia was to act as part of the Commonwealth and was therefore covered by Commonwealth law instead. ""The Director (of Parks Australia) has management and stewardship of the park … what the Director is doing here is exercising a governmental function of management and stewardship,"" he said. In the first of a two-day hearing, lawyers for the AAPA argued Parks Australia, as a distinct organisation, was not automatically immune from Northern Territory law. AAPA's lawyers conceded Parks Australia was, in a broad sense, exercising Commonwealth functions, but argued that did not give it immunity when undertaking specific works. Monday's hearing is the latest step in a lengthy saga that has exacerbated the deterioration of the government's relationship with Kakadu traditional owners. The court battle has also left part of one of the park's most popular tourist locations closed as works continue on remediating the walkway. Parks Australia has previously apologised to traditional owners for any distress caused by the walking track and agreed to realign it, but has pleaded not guilty to the charge. The matter will continue in the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

142,'Frankly irresponsible': Battle brews over gas exploration in Beetaloo Basin,environment,"  NT cattle station owners take on fight against gas company Sweetpea Petroleum over Beetaloo Basin fracking concerns A legal fight is brewing between cattle producers and a mining company that is looking to explore for gas in the Northern Territory's Beetaloo Basin. The gas-rich basin, located about 750km southeast of Darwin, has become the centre of a heated contest between gas companies with fracking aspirations and environmental groups, locals and Traditional Owners. The federal government has attempted to speed up the development of the gas field, with a $50 million grants program to encourage exploration. However, the most recent company approved for a $7.5 million grant, Sweetpea Petroleum, does not have permission to enter the property where it wants to drill, and the dispute over access has ended up in the NT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NTCAT). Sweetpea, a subsidiary of Tamboran Resources, has an exploration permit that covers portions of Tanumbirini and Beetaloo Stations but is yet to negotiate a land access agreement with either of the properties. This means it cannot enter the properties to proceed with its exploration activities until the issue is settled and its Environment Management Plan (EMP) is approved by the NT Environment Minister Eva Lawler. The cattle station owners are opposed to fracking on their properties, and after the parties could not reach an agreement, the matter was taken to the NTCAT. NTCAT ordered the two parties to come to an agreement about a minimum compensation for wells to be drilled on the properties. The dispute has now reached the NT Supreme Court, with the station owners appealing the tribunal's reasons behind its decision, further delaying a land access agreement being settled. On Thursday, Sweetpea withdrew its EMP application for proposed well drilling and fracking on Tanumbirini and Beetaloo Stations, citing a need for more stakeholder engagement. ""Based on feedback from important stakeholders, Tamboran has voluntarily withdrawn an EMP that was submitted in January to allow further stakeholder engagement,"" a Tamboran spokesperson said. Environment Centre NT co-director Kirsty Howey has slammed the federal government's decision to award more taxpayer money to gas companies. ""To be funnelling money into fracking the Beetaloo instead of mitigating and adapting to climate change is frankly irresponsible on a grand and epic scale,"" she said. If fracking goes ahead in the Beetaloo sub-basin, Ms Howey said Australia's carbon emissions could shoot up by 22 per cent, according to the federal government's own estimates. ""It's irresponsible to be proceeding with this industry, with so many questions unanswered about how these emissions are going to be offset,"" Ms Howey said. A Tamboran spokesperson said the company's ""ambition is to become a net-zero gas producer, for its equity share Scope 1 and 2 emissions"". ""In the near-term, accredited offsets will be used to achieve net-zero emissions,"" the spokesperson said. ""Other long-term solutions like carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and integration of renewables will be incorporated as part of Tamboran's future developments."" None of the gas companies exploring the Beetaloo Basin are required to help offset any carbon emissions produced by fracking, nor is the federal government. The NT government is yet to reveal how it will meet all 135 recommendations of a major inquiry in 2020 that outlined how to mitigate the environmental risks of fracking. A key commitment, Recommendation 9.8, states that both the NT and Australian governments must seek to ensure there is no net increase in the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions emitted in Australia from any onshore shale gas produced in the NT. Last month, Mr Pitt reissued millions of dollars in grants to Imperial Oil & Gas, a subsidiary of Empire Energy, just months after a federal judge ruled the grants invalid. Justice John Griffiths declared the grants ""legally unreasonable"" because the federal government discreetly awarded the money to Imperial Oil & Gas while a court challenge was underway. The new grants reissued by Mr Pitt last month are worth a combined $19.4 million, and will support Imperial Oil & Gas to continue drilling the same three petroleum exploration wells previously in contention. Speaking to the ABC in Darwin, Mr Pitt said he wanted Imperial Oil & Gas and Sweetpea Petroleum to explore as many wells as possible in the upcoming dry season. ""We must ensure Australia's national energy security,"" he said. ""The gas-led recovery is a big part of that, but of course it will be hand in hand with our agreements around the Paris Agreement.""

Flood-affected Lismore residents have driven a truckload of muddy wreckage to Kirribilli, where they are demonstrating outside the Prime Minister's home. Police stopped the truck from entering Kirribilli Avenue, so the flood victims dragged the damaged furniture and artwork down the street. ""I want him (Scott Morrison) to understand the level of loss our community has been through,"" Lismore resident Kate Stroud said. “Imagine piles 50 times this size outside every house.” The group wants action to halt climate change and a meeting with Mr Morrison. Koudra Falla said they were angry they could not meet with him when he visited Lismore.

Another resident Melveena Martin said: ""To think that our Prime Minister came to our town and wouldn't even speak to us and hid from us is absolutely deplorable."" The federal government has today launched a new Australian Federal Police facility in NSW, dedicated to combating online crime. With $89 million in funding, the Joint Policing Cybercrime Coordination Centre (JPC3) will be based in the AFP’s headquarters on Goulburn Street in Sydney. Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said the new facility would become an essential part of the National Plan to Combat Cybercrime. “During the pandemic, cybercrime became one of the fastest-growing and most prolific forms of crime committed against Australians,” Ms Andrews said. “Using far-reaching Commonwealth legislation and high-end technical capabilities, the AFP’s new cybercrime centre will aggressively target cyber threats, shut them down, and bring offenders to justice.” The paramedics union and NSW Ambulance will return to the negotiating table today, ahead of planned industrial action. A meeting in the Industrial Relations Commission, between union representatives and NSW Ambulance, has been set for this morning. That meeting comes as the two parties remain at loggerheads over staffing and conditions. The union said paramedics were being overworked during COVID-19, with not enough staff to cover all stations. But the ambulance service insists investment in operations is at record levels and 750 additional staff have been recruited during the past four years. Emergency calls will still be answered today, the union said. The current upswing in COVID-19 cases is seeing more teachers absent from schools, the NSW Teachers Federation says. According to the state's education department, out of more than 2,000 public schools, two returned to home learning last week and 10 had some year groups online. Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos said it was worsening the shortage of teachers in some schools. ""These changes in operations are due to the effect of infection rates and absenteeism,"" he said. ""But, in addition to that, the teacher shortage in some schools before COVID, during COVID and even now, they start each day with three or four teachers down."" Police are searching for a gunman after a man was shot and seriously injured at Hebersham in Western Sydney yesterday afternoon.

144,"Surprise government decision crashes carbon market, making polluting cheaper",environment,"  Carbon credit companies to cash in on multi-billion-dollar windfall from the government Private companies have been gifted a multi-billion-dollar windfall, after being allowed to break long-standing government supply contracts to cash in on a booming market. In a surprise move, Energy Minister Angus Taylor said companies contracted to supply Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) – equalling one tonne of carbon emissions reduced or avoided – to the government could instead trade them on the open market. While the government pays $12 a tonne, the market has surged 200 per cent in just over a year and been as high as $55 a tonne. ""It's a very bad deal,"" said Professor Bruce Mountain from the Victoria Energy Policy Centre at Victoria University. ""Ministerial intervention, in a market he created, has completely up-ended that market. ""Taxpayers are being slugged for gains that the carbon sellers are getting. It's a loss to the taxpayer, and a needless loss to the taxpayer."" Professor Mountain blamed the situation on what he called the government's ""half-hearted"" policies around abating carbon emissions. That has now been topped with this surprise policy shift, allowing companies to get out of enforceable contracts. ""They created a 'get out of jail' clause … which the minister is making it ever more possible to exercise. ""This creates a windfall profit for the carbon firms and higher cost abatement charged to taxpayers than otherwise would occur. It's an economic loss for the Australian people."" Professor Mountain has no links to companies affected by this announcement. The biggest shock could still be coming. What governments will pay in future is likely to be the market price, which could make sourcing credits to abate emissions vastly more expensive. ""They're not going to source them at 12 bucks, they'll source under a much higher price,"" Professor Mountain said. ""This is a chaotic mess."" The changes are substantial. In a press release, Minister Taylor said the moves would ""increase liquidity, allow project proponents to take advantage of higher private market prices and ensure equitable treatment"". The last point is about the fact that, since March 2020, the Clean Energy Regulator devised ""optional delivery contracts"" where people who created ACCUs could sell them to the government's Emissions Reduction Fund but did not have to. Previously, anyone undertaking carbon credit projects had to sign up to a fixed contract with the Commonwealth to deliver carbon credits for a period of up to 10 years before they could sell on the open market. But prices on the open, or spot, market have rocketed since the government signed up to a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the COP26 conference. Since the electricity sector became enmeshed in the rapidly escalating battle over climate change, it has turned into an ideological battleground, writes business editor Ian Verrender. A lack of units and a surge in interest saw the price hit $55, creating an increasingly large gap between the $12 fixed price offered by the government and the market. The Clean Energy Regulator said the gap was so large that contracted companies might void their deals, pay a damages bill and still make big money. ""If a widespread disorderly exit from fixed delivery contracts occurred, this would cause a large volume of ACCUs to become available to the carbon market, leading to price volatility and investment uncertainty,"" the regulator said in making the announcement on March 4. Minister Taylor did not respond to the ABC's requests for comment. ""Net zero by 2050 makes carbon emission credits scarce and hence valuable,"" Professor Mountain said. ""Policy makers need to get real on how they expect markets to transact that scarcity in the public interest."" The sudden rule change meant a flood of carbon credits could now enter the open market. The market price cratered, plunging more than 30 per cent. Speaking on Wednesday, agriculture minister David Littleproud was asked about the decision by the energy minister – and how it had crashed the market. ""It's about making sure we get the market mechanisms right, and we'll be making some further announcements very soon around carbon farming, making sure we get that balance right and what that should look like, and giving certainty because it is evolving and we're world-leading,"" he said. Carbon Market Institute chief executive John Connor runs an industry body that includes farmers, carbon project developers, banks and industries affected by the shift to net zero emissions. He described his members as ""half delighted, half livid"". Many would have bought units when they were at or near $55, before the government's intervention flooded the market and depressed the price, while others have been released from having to sell their contracts to the government for $12. There was no formal public consultation about the change, and it comes after recent government interventions, including a proposed additional veto power for the Agriculture Minister on certain carbon projects, and new requirements about buying units with specific certifications. ""We are concerned that continuing arbitrary changes in Australia's carbon market will challenge investor as well as community confidence in supporting carbon reduction or removal activities credited by the Government with ACCUs,"" Mr Connor said in response. Companies breaking their $12-a-unit contracts will have to pay some damages and an exit fee to the government. The fee will be used for emissions reduction projects. Not only have companies been given the green light to break contracts, it was even mooted that companies could break the contracts without penalty, something confirmed by a Clean Energy Regulator spokesperson in response to questions from the ABC. ""A range of options were considered, including a 'no break fee' approach, but that would have amounted to a substantive change in legal rights,"" they said. ""The government did not undertake consultation on different approaches because it was market sensitive. Discussions on the merits of different approaches were only internal to government."" The regulator said the growing gap between the $12-a-tonne contracted price and the open market was ""unsustainable"", because some companies were mulling breaking their deals. If that occurred, the Commonwealth would have been obliged to pursue the debt, potentially including legal action. ""A disorderly exit of this nature would inevitably lead to disputes over damages arrangements for each failed delivery,"" the spokesperson said. Given the substantial windfall gifted to private companies by the shift, the ABC asked the regulator: ""Why was the threat of breaking contracts given in to?"" ""It wasn’t 'given in to'.  It was a deliberate policy choice.,"" the spokesperson said. ""As far as we are aware, no proposal was put to the government by market participants to use the approach that was adopted."" For James Shultz, the shift was a surprise but not a shock. ""We didn't see the particular announcement coming,"" he said. ""But we'd certainly been talking, along with many people in the industry … about a need to address this issue. What we had was no insight into the actual policy that was announced."" Mr Shultz is the chief executive of GreenCollar, a company that works with landowners to develop and manage projects that abate carbon – like growing trees. It describes itself as Australia's largest environmental markets investor and its boss was increasingly concerned about the widening gap between the price of a contracted unit and a market price more than four times higher. ""As the market's maturing, you sort of get these kinds of stresses,"" he said. ""Ultimately, though, where we've landed is a pretty good thing. ""We've got so much more demand and supply in this market. Trying to (make) moves that increase the liquidity of the supply out there in the market. It's ultimately a good thing."" Mr Shultz does not describe what has happened as a ""windfall gain"" even though it offers the potential for greater profits for landowners and companies like his that create units. ""The regulator is receiving a penalty payment, plus they're saving the money that they would have otherwise spent to procure the credit,"" he argued. ""So the taxpayer is actually well ahead, and that's a lot more money in the public coffers."" Companies have two ways to reduce their carbon emissions to net zero. They can change what they do or buy credits to cover what they cannot or will not change. Forcing down the price of credits means there is less incentive to spend money to cut processes or products that pollute, as it becomes cheaper to offset the emissions on the market. Polly Hemming, an advisor on climate and energy with think-tank The Australia Institute, said that is why a high carbon credit price works to actually reduce emissions. ""Because the idea is that you make reductions, systemic reductions, within your operating model that are going to reduce emissions,"" she explained. ""And then, as a means of last resort, you purchase carbon credits, because you simply can't reduce your emissions any further."" But massively expanding the amount of credits available makes it cheaper to buy them. ""So it completely 'dis-incentivises' the idea that people are going to be reducing their emissions first. ""It will simply be cheaper for businesses like (gas producer) Woodside to offset their emissions than actually change their entire business model.""

145,Beachgoers race to save young false killer whale in rare juvenile stranding ,environment,"  Beachgoers race to save young false killer whale stranded at Casuarina on the Tweed coast A day at the beach turned into a rescue mission for members of the public who rallied to save a young false killer washed ashore on a beach at Casuarina in northern New South Wales early on Sunday. Beachgoers raised the alarm with authorities at about 7am and attempted to re-float the young whale three times, but it stranded itself again further north on Salt Beach at Kingscliff. By around 9am bystanders had thrown up a tarp over the distressed female and begun working with volunteers from the Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia (ORRCA) and surf lifesavers to keep her cool and moist. What followed was a three-and-a-half hour effort to keep the 1.7 metre mammal alive while rescuers looked for the rest of her pod off shore. Surf lifesavers took a boat out while a Sea World chopper searched from above, but the pod could not be found. False killer whales are found in waters around Australia and generally travel in pods of up to 20 whales. Females grow as long as up to 4.5 metres, while calves are generally half that length. The stranded juvenile was likely to have just finished weaning, a Sea World spokesperson said. False killer whales are typically weaned around 18 to 24 months. Surf lifesaver and local councillor James Owen was on patrol when he heard about the rescue mission and began helping the group of about 20 people who were trying to save the whale. ""People were marching up and down the beach with buckets of water and pouring them over the whale as it lay there,"" Mr Owen said. ""A channel was dug so that the water and waves could lap up around it to keep it cool."" Wayne Phillips, the Head of Marine Sciences at Sea World, also answered calls for help and joined rescuers on the beach with a veterinarian and a marine rehabilitation officer. He said the mammal survived thanks to the efforts of the volunteers and community groups. ""There were lots and lots of different people that were helping us out throughout the day. The Australian group ORRCA, Dolphin Research Australia, the surf lifesavers were amazing,"" Mr Phillips said. ""The Tweed-Byron local Aboriginal Land Council were also there as well as the police and the water police."" Mr Phillips said it was ""unusual"" to see a juvenile false killer whale wash up by itself. ""We suspected that it was a Risso's dolphin and then we thought it might have been a melon-headed dolphin which are quite common stranders, but we were quite surprised when we arrived and found that it was a juvenile false killer whale,"" he said. ""They're more of an offshore species — so a Pelagic species — so we don't see them often this close to shore,"" he said. ""The false killer whale is a species that does strand en masse, so we were lucky that there was only a single individual in this case."" He said Sea World was looking into the effects of the recent floods on the whole marine ecosystem, including marine mammals like the false killer whale. After failing to find her pod, Mr Phillips and his team transported the whale to Sea World around midday. They plan to rehabilitate the whale so it can join a new pod. ""The only tricky part is to try and find an appropriate pod for her to join and we'll have to consider that as we move forward,"" he said. ""We'd like to think that it would be a positive outcome if we can find a pod of the species."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Jools Farrell, vice president of ORRCA, said the volunteer organisation had responded to five other whale strandings on the NSW coast in the past month – not all were false killer whales — but they all died. ""We are on alert at the moment in regards to whales stranding because it is unusual to have five strand in a matter of weeks,"" Ms Farrell said. Ms Farrell advised beachgoers against attempting to re-float beached whales. ""We understand that people are passionate and want to try and help, but that's the worst thing you can do,"" she said. ""Especially by grabbing it by the tail and dragging it down the beach on the sand you could break its back, break its tail."" ""Their skin is like tissue paper, so it's like running it over rocks…and you're doing more harm than good."" ""The best thing to do is call ORRCA on our rescue line number — (02) 9415 3333 — which is manned 24/7 by our volunteers.""

146,Energy analysts back plans to replace ageing Hunter Valley coal-fired power station with huge battery,environment,"  Grid-scale battery 'really exciting' option as AGL Liddell power station site winds down — analysts One of Australia's leading energy analysts says a 500-megawatt battery is an ideal way to begin the replacement of the Liddell power station near Muswellbrook in the NSW Hunter Valley, which will shut next year. Tony Wood is the program director for energy and climate change at the Grattan Institute. He's keen to stress that AGL's battery is not a simple replacement for a power station. ""Liddell is still a large, coal-fired power station and obviously a battery doesn't produce electricity,"" he said. ""What the battery does is store electricity very effectively and then can release it when it is needed. ""What it does is it helps balance the system. The battery will then be able to get the electricity from the grid and put it back into the grid when we need it."" The NSW government has given planning approval for the battery at AGL's Liddell station, which will be retired next year. The first unit at the power station is due to close next month. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Newcastle's weekly email newsletter. Tony Wood says batteries like AGL's are needed for when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. ""It doesn't solve everything but it makes a big difference, as we move from a system that's overwhelmingly fossil-fuel coal and gas-based to one that's going to be wind and solar-based,"" Mr Wood said. ""Balancing reliability is where these batteries fit in and so we'll see these big grid batteries probably get even bigger and we'll also see a proliferation of smaller batteries at the local level and that's the way the system's going to develop."" Independent think tank Beyond Zero Emissions has applauded approval for the battery. Sam Mella, project manager and Hunter diversification lead at Beyond Zero Emissions, says it's a great move given the amount of expertise in energy storage already in the Hunter Valley. ""What we've seen today is really exciting,"" she said. ""It's a step in the development of the Hunter Renewable Energy Zone and the diversification of energy generation and storage in the Hunter. ""And the Liddell site is obviously fantastic as it has a lot of existing infrastructure, so it makes a lot of sense for a large-scale battery to be there. The Liddell battery is part of AGL's plan to have 850MW of grid-scale batteries across Australia. The state government says the project is expected to create up to 100 construction jobs and attract more than $750 million in capital investment.

147,"Threatened species list lengthens despite recovery from fires and drought, report finds",environment,"  Threatened species list grows despite improvement in state of environment, annual report finds Is Australia's environment really in a better condition now than it was after the most recent devastating bushfires and drought? According to Australia's Environment 2021 Report, when compared to 2020 — a time when parts of the nation were a combination of charcoal and dust — things are faring well. From a score out of 10 the environmental condition jumped four points from the previous year, receiving a 6.9 in 2021. Conservationists warn against complacency as the recovery of the Australian landscape has been mostly put down to high widespread rainfall and cooler temperatures. These conditions are likely to be short-lived with the Bureau of Meteorology expecting rainfall conditions to normalise with the peak of the La Nina being reached. ""This wet spell is just a shot of Red Bull and doesn't address underlying issues facing the environment,"" said James Tremain from the Nature Conservation Council. The study led by the Australian National University shed light on some deeply troubling trends. ""It's clear the general trend is going in the wrong direction, and it's quite a steep trend,"" Mr Tremain said. Ecologist Shoshana Rapley helped conduct the annual analysis using vast amounts of satellites and field stations to measure the state of the environment. It found that in 2021 the oceans were storing 6.5 per cent more heat year-on-year, and we experienced the sixth warmest year on record. Ms Rapley said one of the biggest concerns highlighted was the continual and rapid decline of animal and plant species, a major indicator of where things are at. In the last five years, 34 new species have become threatened including eight bird, four frog, and two fish species. No animals have been removed from the threatened species list. ""There's just this ever marching forward of the number of precious Australian species that are threatened with extinction and no real decline in the numbers that are being listed,"" Ms Rapley said. Koalas are now considered endangered, along with the gang-gang cockatoo. The Nature Conservation Council said there remains a lack of political will to address the dire reality. ""The government spends $50 million on improving koala habitat and $2 billion on diesel fuel subsidies,"" Mr Tremain said. ""They're not serious about the problem."" Despite above-average rainfall and runoff across eastern Australia, waterbirds also continued to decline in numbers. Ms Rapley warned the reprieve from dry conditions may not actually benefit species. ""Even though we have this small amount of respite it's not enough to give animals a break and built back those numbers in meaningful terms,"" she said. She said the conditions would need to stick around for a lot longer for Australia's biodiversity at large to recover from an increasingly challenging climate. Vegetation growth has been well above average, with improved conditions in all major cropping regions except for South Australia. Amid the clean-up after what are likely to be the costliest floods in Australian history, insurers warn things are set to get worse, especially along the east coast. National river inflows were almost 30 per cent higher than the last two decades, but wetland flooding was still well below average. Tree cover has recovered after losses from bushfires in south-east Australia and along the coast of south-west WA. But Ms Rapley said that would simply provide more fuel for fire in coming seasons as drier conditions return. The snapshot, she hoped, would provide a catalyst for policy makers and the public to make meaningful change. ""We can use this window of opportunity for social change to really ask 'what is the future we want to build?'"" Ms Rapley said.

148,"These scientists say de-extinction is a matter of when, not if",environment," Science De-extinction: Is it really possible to bring extinct animals back from the dead? Scientists in several countries are engaged in dedicated projects to bring extinct animals back from the dead — from the thylacine to the woolly mammoth, the passenger pigeon to the gastric-brooding frog. So far, no team has managed to pull it off. Research groups like California-based biotech and conservation company Revive and Restore have been working for years to de-extinct the mammoth and passenger pigeon, without yet realising their goal. In Australia, thylacine de-extinction research has started and stopped, and recently started again with a $5 million philanthropic investment for the University of Melbourne. Are ""de-extinction"" projects throwing money at science fiction, or is there genuine hope of being able to see animals like the thylacine once again roaming the wild? There are broadly three approaches to de-extinction — genetic engineering, cloning, and back-breeding. For cloning to work, you need a preserved cell or full set of chromosomes from the extinct animal, so that's no good for things like the mammoth and thylacine. Back-breeding is essentially selective breeding like we have done with dogs, where you mate animals to produce certain characteristics — in this case, the characteristics of the extinct animal. That's only an option where you have a living species that is very similar to the extinct one, so again no good. Which leaves us with genetic engineering. The first step in the genetic engineering approach is to sequence the genome of the extinct animal — that means working out the order of the ""base pairs"", the building blocks of its DNA. For the thylacine, this was done in 2017 by a team of scientists including Andrew Pask from the University of Melbourne. ""We had one of the [thylacine] babies from the Melbourne Museum that was a baby taken from a mother's pouch and dropped straight into alcohol,"" Professor Pask says. When Professor Pask's team sequenced the genome in 2017, it was the most intact genome ever obtained for an extinct species — thanks to the swift preservation of the baby thylacine. So does that mean we're ready for de-extinction? Not so fast. Australia is full of weird plants and animals. And Dr Ann Jones is on speaking terms with most of them! When animals die, their DNA becomes fragmented, or broken up, into shorter strands. The more deteriorated an animal's DNA, the more likely it is to be in many pieces. Genomics researcher Tom Gilbert from the University of Copenhagen explains it as similar to a book that's been put through a shredder. Your goal is to put the book back together, but you don't have any reference for what it's supposed to look like when you're done. ""Let's say that before I give you the [book] I put it through a shredder and all you have are fragments of maybe three to 30 words long,"" Professor Gilbert says. ""And [then] I ask you to tell me what's going on."" You know the order of the words in the fragments, but not the order of the fragments in the book. Researchers think they can use the complete genome of a closely related living species as a kind of template to figure out how the pieces of the extinct genome fit together. In the case of the thylacine, that living species is the numbat. It's estimated that 95 per cent of the numbat's DNA is the same as the thylacine, and earlier this year a group called DNA Zoo Australia, based at the University of Western Australia, completed a ""chromosome-length 3D genome map"" of the numbat's genome. ""We have been trying to build the base which will enable the genetic rescue of existing species,"" DNA Zoo Australia director Parwinder Kaur says. ""But it also makes it possible to bring back the extinct thylacine."" The idea is that they can first line up the matching 95 per cent of the two species' DNA, and then try to work out where the remaining 5 per cent of the thylacine DNA fits into the puzzle. Some of this can be done by finding short lengths of matching base pair sequences, which might indicate a starting point where a longer fragment that has varied through evolution can slot in. If they can map the complete thylacine genome, CRISPR technology can be used to alter the DNA in a numbat cell, to code for thylacine. The process is already underway with the mammoth. American geneticist George Church is heading a team that has identified more than 1,600 protein-coding genes that differ between the extinct woolly mammoth and living Asian elephant. They've identified the genes they believe define the most significant mammoth traits — like long hair and raised forehead — and have begun the process of alteration. Last year, they launched a new company with millions of dollars in private backing, and say they plan to birth a mammoth-elephant hybrid by 2027. Similarly, the Revive and Restore group has set the ambitious target of 2025 to ""hatch the first new generation of passenger pigeons"". In the 1800s, passenger pigeons were one of the world's most abundant birds, with flocks in the millions said to have blackened North American skies. But hunting and habitat loss sent the species crashing. The last bird died in captivity in 1914. If successful, these will be hybrids though, and critics say while they may look similar, they'll lack the functional traits that made their extinct counterparts valuable to their respective ecosystems. Professor Gilbert's team published research earlier this month looking at the potential to use the Norway brown rat to de-extinct the Christmas Island rat, which diverged about 2.6 million years ago. However, they ran into two key issues. Firstly, current gene-editing technology is only able to introduce up to a few hundred edits per cycle. In the Norway brown rat and the Christmas Island rat, there were more than 128 million base pairs (the building blocks of DNA) that differed. If the idea is to edit every single differing base pair, it would take a prohibitively long period of time with current technology to make all the modifications necessary — tens or even hundreds of years. The second problem is much harder to overcome, Dr Gilbert says. When the researchers tried to map the Christmas Island rat genome to the Norway brown rat, they found more than 4 per cent of the genome didn't line up. Basically, where they had very short strands of the extinct rat's DNA, and it had significantly changed via evolution from the living rat's DNA, there were no common reference points to figure out where things went. ""When we sequence all the short fragments, and computationally compare them to the modern rat genome, we can match [95 per cent] and thus work out what is going on,"" Professor Gilbert said. ""But another 5 per cent is just so divergent we can't place it on the modern rat genome."" One option would be to simply leave the missing pieces as Norway brown rat genes, and only change the genes that we know are Christmas Island rat genes. The problem there, according to Professor Gilbert, is the missing pieces are likely to be some of the genes that make the Christmas Island rat unique. ""I would suspect that the parts of the genome that are most divergent, [and] thus have been under the most evolutionary pressure, are those most critical to how it adapted to live on Christmas Island,"" he says. ""So I would argue that the bits we miss are probably the most important if the end goal is to create the thing that was able to exist in the natural environment on Christmas Island."" Like Professor Gilbert's shredded book analogy, Professor Pask likens trying to piece together the genome to doing a puzzle without having a picture on the box as a reference. But he says the thylacine de-extinction program has a big advantage over the Christmas Island rat research. ""We're different from the Christmas Island rat example because they had very fragmented DNA,"" he says. ""[The thylacine] has DNA fragments much longer than the Christmas island rat example. ""So that takes it from a million-piece puzzle down to a few thousand [pieces]."" And it's not being done manually. Machine learning can help speed up the process. If they can successfully map the thylacine genome, the process from there is basically cloning. Of course that's been done already with sheep, but it's more complicated using a different species as a surrogate to carry the embryo. Still, Professor Pask says as technology improves, it's a matter of when, not if, we'll see thylacine de-extinction succeed. ""At the moment we're looking to understand the scope of all the edits we'd have to make for our surrogate animals,"" he says. ""I'm fully confident that we will get there. ""We definitely have all the technology at hand, it's just that it would take a very long time to do it at the moment."" Dr Kaur is similarly upbeat about the prospects for de-extinction. ""[It's] going to become a very routine thing in the next decade or so,"" she says. ""I can see around me the technology on de-extinction is advancing so fast."" But there are plenty of scientists more sceptical about the chances of success, and less enthusiastic about spending money on bringing back species when we're still driving others to extinction. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. Professor Gilbert thinks researchers should refer to his work on the Christmas Island rat before they start pouring money into a project, but he's not against the idea in theory. ""I love the idea technically,"" Professor Gilbert says. ""But if there was only one pot of money and it had to go to either conservation or de-extinction, I'd go conservation."" Professor Pask says de-extinction research can be used to provide resilience against diseases like the Tasmanian devil facial tumour, and can help ensure no living species ever goes extinct again. ""One of the main reasons I really love this project is because everything we're developing to bring back the Tassie tiger we can use to benefit marsupials now."" Dr Kaur agrees, but says funding for de-extinction needs to come from the private sector, and we can't lose sight of the bigger conservation picture. ""We need to find a balance where we're not just going down the de-extinction path, but also saving things that are in hand."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

149,Great Barrier Reef hit with widespread and severe bleaching event,environment,"  Great Barrier Reef facing another severe bleaching event ahead of UN delegation visit The Great Barrier Reef is being hit with a widespread and severe bleaching event, just three days before a United Nations delegation is due to arrive to assess the health of the world heritage area. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) confirmed the bleaching is widespread in both the far north and the central sections of the reef, with the bleaching in the central parts rated as ""severe"". Surveys are still underway to assess the full extent of the damage. The last serious bleaching event on the reef occurred just two years ago. The Reef Authority's chief scientist, David Wachenfeld, said the situation was ""concerning"". ""In the areas of central Great Barrier Reef where heat stress has been the worst over this summer, we are starting to see some coral mortality,"" Professor Wachenfeld said. Widespread serious bleaching was not seen until 1998, but with soaring greenhouse gas emissions heating the globe, it appears to now be a common occurrence. Mass bleaching was again seen in 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020. Professor Wachenfeld told the ABC the GBRMPA would not officially declare a ""mass bleaching event"" until they were able to examine all the data. ""There certainly is a risk that we are seeing a mass bleaching event,"" he said. Bleaching occurs when the water is too warm, for too long. The coral expels the algae living inside it, leaving it colourless. The algae also provides the coral with most of its energy. If temperatures don't return to normal, the coral dies. Reefs can recover from bleaching, but it takes years. If bleaching occurs regularly, the reef ecosystem can collapse. Environmental groups have again called on the federal government to increase its ambitions for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with a warming trajectory that is consistent with the reef surviving. This bleaching is occurring in the midst of a La Niña weather pattern, which usually brings cooler temperatures, as well as cloud and rain, which protects the reef from bleaching. ""Corals on the Great Barrier Reef are not supposed to bleach in cooler La Niña summers,"" James Cook University's Professor Terry Hughes said on Twitter. ""2022 is a first, thanks to anthropogenic heating. It's been a mere 24 years since the first 1998 mass bleaching occurred during an El Niño heatwave."" Lissa Schindler from the Australian Marine Conservation Society agreed. ""It shows the consistent pressure our Reef is now under from global heating,"" Dr Schindler said. ""A healthy reef can recover from coral bleaching but it needs time. Regular marine heatwaves caused by the burning of coal and gas means it is not getting this time."" Richard Leck from World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Australia said the sixth significant bleaching event showed the reef was in grave danger. ""That's four times since 2016. The reef is now suffering widespread bleaching damage at the rate of more than once every two years,"" Mr Leck said. Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au A spokesperson for Environment Minister Sussan Ley said: ""Any time we see bleaching it is a concern and it is why we are investing an additional $1 billion in the reef, to strengthen its resilience in the face of these challenges. ""This is the best-managed reef in the world and as a result of our collaborations with scientists, reef managers, traditional owners, farmers and local communities it is also the most closely monitored."" The official announcement from GBRMPA comes just days before the UN World Heritage Centre's monitoring mission arrives in Australia to assess whether the reef should be added to the list of World Heritage In Danger. The monitoring mission, which arrives on Sunday, was established after Ms Ley complained that UNESCO's recommendation to add the reef to the in-danger list occurred without such a mission taking place. Ms Ley's office has not confirmed whether the mission will be taken to see any of the bleaching, or whether they will only see unbleached coral. When asked, a spokesperson said: ""The mission will have access to all aspects of the reef it requires to complete its work."" When UNESCO last year recommended the Great Barrier Reef be put on the list of World Heritage In Danger, one of the key issues was Australia's weak emissions reductions targets. It warned ""accelerated action at all possible levels is required to address the threat from climate change in accordance with the Paris Agreement"". In the recommendation, UNESCO said it ""strongly invites"" Australia to take action on climate change that was consistent with protecting the Great Barrier Reef. It also noted, specifically, that keeping warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels would significantly reduce the risks of climate change to the reef. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, even if the world follows a low-emissions pathway, we are likely to see bleaching conditions on the reef every year by the middle of the century. ""We really need the strongest and fastest possible global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to secure a better future for the the Great Barrier Reef,"" Professor Wachenfeld said. Richard Leck from WWF was an official observer to the World Heritage Committee when it made the decision not to immediately list the reef as in-danger. ""Coral bleaching is directly attributable to climate change caused by rising global emissions. Reducing Australia's domestic and exported emissions fast, this decade, is the main solution within our control,"" he said. WWF-Australia commissioned an analysis by two leading climate scientists from the University of Melbourne, examining the gap between Australia's targets and a pathway consistent with stopping warming at 1.5C. It found Australia's targets meant we would emit more than twice as much greenhouse gas as is possible for Australia to remain consistent with the 1.5C pathway. ""There is a clear gap between the emissions reduction consistent with limiting warming to 1.5C and Australia's emissions targets,"" said Professor Malte Meinshausen, one of the authors on the report.

The Yawuru Karajarri woman worked for much of the year on the plains, monitoring native mammals and grazing impacts and weed management, and protecting precious habitat. Ms Edgar has noticed the country, covering more than 250,000 hectares 30 kilometres east of Broome, change during the year's six Yawuru seasons. ""I really like the wildflowers at the moment, and all the happy animals, because the ground is happy. It's good for your Lyian [spirit]."" The flood plain doesn't always fill up — heavy rains were required in the catchment further east, near Mount Jowlaenga, at the base of the Dampier Peninsula. There were 190 species of bird that live on the plains through the year, and many are drawn specifically to the ephemeral wetland. ""It's amazing! There are vast numbers of waterbirds, egrets, herons, magpie geese, grebes and swans,"" Adrian Boyle, from Environs Kimberley, said. ""Where do they come from and how do they know that it's a flooded place? If they flew over in the dry season it's dry and dusty."" The birds use the short window of time the plains are flooded to feed and breed, even building nests on small islands or floating vegetation. Mr Boyle is also a frog tracker. ""There are 14 species of frog in the Broome region. I'm often out at all kinds of hours tracking frogs,"" he said. ""Everyone notices the frogs, they're right across the road, particularly the cyclorana species, the burrowing frogs."" It was not known how much water flows across the plains towards Roebuck Bay, but there were strong currents in places and the flow could sometimes cut National Highway One for several days, causing headaches for freight trucks and subsequent road repair crews. But the flow towards the ocean was an essential part of the ecosystem. ""It brings nutrients all the way down and helps carry extra seeds and plants that need to restock in certain areas,"" Ms Edgar said. Barramundi and estuarine crocodiles also used the new waterway. ""There are vast amounts of food and nutrients coming off the plains and that's why Roebuck Bay is an amazing place because there's so much food for fish and shorebirds,"" Mr Boyle, who is also a keen birdwatcher, said. ""The water coming off the plains is just so vital to Roebuck Bay. It's all tied together.""

151,"Ancient flatback turtle 'Old Man', estimated to be 100 years old, takes first nosedive to freedom",environment,"  Flatback turtle 'Old Man' released into ocean near Darwin after long illness An ancient flatback turtle known as ""Old Man"" has been released back into the ocean after a long recovery from illness. Old Man is estimated to be about 100 years old and has been returned to Kenbi sea country, west of Darwin. A team of rangers, researchers and a local tour operator spotted him struggling to dive in October last year while conducting dolphin surveys beyond Darwin Harbour. A bird had perched on Old Man's shell, which made him easier to find. Larrakia Nation land and sea ranger Sarah Rolland was among the group that jumped into the ocean to retrieve him five months ago. ""As we got closer, we thought the turtle would usually dive under but he couldn't, he kept floating on top of the water,"" she said. ""That's when we realised something was wrong."" ""I'm so stoked that we can come out here and release him to his natural habitat."" Charles Darwin University dolphin researcher Carol Palmer jumped in with Ms Rolland to retrieve Old Man. ""He had some kind of blockage. He was very unwell and I think all of us thought he would pass away,"" Dr Palmer said. ""So we're so happy to be at this point right now. ""I don't think he's going to miss us at all. I think he's going to be so happy being back in his world."" After the team hauled the 75-kilogram turtle out of the water in October, the rangers rushed him to a vet. Wildlife carer Andrea Ruske was among those who nursed and fed Old Man in his tank at the veterinary clinic The Ark. ""He was pretty sick, so the first couple of weeks it was just tube feeding and he was not even lifting his head,"" Ms Ruske said. ""So seeing him make a full recovery is just great."" The team do not know exactly what caused Old Man's intestinal blockage. Flatback turtles are found in Australia's tropical coastal waters, along with several other turtle species. Their nesting sites can be found around the Top End coastline and even on Darwin's city beaches. Dr Palmer said the team was keen to gather more information about male turtles, who do not usually leave the ocean after making it there as youngsters. ""Part of our marine megafauna project is to focus as much as we can on male turtles because certainly in the Northern Territory it's a whole new area for us,"" she said.

152,The Black Summer fires were so large they altered the ozone layer — something never seen before,environment," Science Black Summer bushfire smoke altered ozone-depleting chemicals in atmosphere, study finds As they circled the globe, massive plumes of smoke from the devastating Black Summer fires kickstarted changes in the atmosphere that may have caused a drop in ozone levels, a new study suggests. A team of researchers, led by Peter Bernath of the University of Waterloo, found smoke from the 2019-2020 fires caused extreme changes in a number of ozone-depleting gases at mid-latitude locations. The changes were beyond anything that had been measured in the previous 15 years, they report today in the journal Science. ""We've seen smoke before, but we've never seen this type of effect on the stratosphere,"" Professor Bernath said. The Black Summer fires produced huge weather systems known as pyrocumulonimbus clouds, which pumped record-breaking amounts of smoke and aerosols directly into the stratosphere between 10 and 30 kilometres above Earth. The smoke plume from the 2019-2020 fires circled the mid-latitude regions of the southern hemisphere at least twice. The researchers speculate that as fires become more intense with climate change, the impact of smoke from large events may delay the recovery of the ozone layer. Independent experts said the changes detected in the atmosphere were exciting, but questioned the significance of ozone declines reported in the study. Ozone gas in the stratosphere provides essential protection against the effects of UV radiation. But ozone is destroyed by chlorine- or bromine-based gases produced by the breakdown of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) products in the atmosphere. Although CFCs were banned in 1987 under the Montreal Protocol, vast quantities of these long-lasting gases are predicted to linger in the atmosphere and not return to pre-1980 levels until sometime after 2052 at the earliest. Ozone holes appear in late winter over Antarctica (and sometimes the Arctic) as temperatures plummet and chemicals on the surface of ice crystals react with chlorine gases, producing more potent ozone-depleting substances. The new study suggests something similar might be happening on the surface of smoke particles at mid-latitudes. ""We can look at the changes in the entire suite of stratospheric molecules, and we see unusual changes in all kinds of gases,"" Professor Bernath said. The Montreal Protocol is a shining example of a global climate agreement that actually succeeded. Professor Bernath and colleagues analysed 15 years of data collected by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment satellite (ACE). Their analysis of data from mid-latitude regions showed increases in average concentrations of formaldehyde, chlorine nitrate, chlorine monoxide, and hypochlorous acid, and decreases in nitrogen dioxide, hydrochloric acid and ozone in 2020 compared with previous years' averages. That suggests compounds like hydrochloric acid were being converted into more potent ozone destroyers such as chlorine nitrate, hypochlorus acid, and chlorine monoxide. Paul Fraser, an atmospheric scientist at CSIRO who was not involved in the study, said the shift in chemistry showed something was stimulating the CFC ozone depletion mechanism. ""These are very similar profiles to what we see in Antarctica,"" Dr Fraser said. Professor Bernath said while the process looked similar to what happens in Antarctica, the concentrations of the various gases were different. ""That's no surprise because obviously smoke particles are different to polar stratospheric clouds."" Ozone levels can fluctuate from year to year and month to month. Mid-latitude ozone levels detected by ACE began to decline in April 2020  and remained low until December. While some years had lower levels than 2020 in certain months, no other year in the 15-year period exhibited low levels for such a long time, the researchers reported. ""In the mid-latitudes, the variability is typically a few per cent going up and down, but this decline [averaged over 2020] is more like 10 or 15 per cent,"" Professor Bernath said. ""So it's a statistically significant decrease outside normal variability."" Commemorate World Environment Day on June 5 by going on a ""virtual field trip"" to an Australian town that's been designed around the impacts of climate change and disaster preparedness. Robyn Schofield, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Melbourne, said there appeared to be a slight decrease in ozone levels in December only. While she said the changes in chlorine-based gases were significant, the ozone figures may have been due to the breakdown of the hole over Antarctica. ""We know that the 2020 Antarctic ozone hole was really strong, it was one of the strongest we've seen,"" Dr Schofield said. ""I think that it's too early to say it's all this chlorine chemistry happening."" Dr Fraser agreed that the decline in ozone detected by ACE, ""looked significant around December, but maybe not for the whole year."" Dr Fraser said the idea that smoke could be a catalyst for ozone-depleting reactions like those seen in Antarctica was ""not a bad assumption"". ""[But] what they haven't done yet is tested it in the lab, like we have for the ozone hole processes in Antarctica."" The forests of the NSW south coast are shooting green new leaves — but local residents face a dangerous, expensive and uncertain future. Professor Bernath said the team had speculated about what chemical reactions might be happening and agreed they needed to be confirmed in laboratory experiments. ""What we see is the effects of the smoke, but we don't actually measure the chemical reactions as they take place on smoke,"" Professor Bernath said. ""Nobody knows the chemistry on smoke. ""Which also means the atmospheric models don't work because you can't put the smoke chemistry in the model, because you don't know what the smoke chemistry is."" This is not the first study to suggest that smoke can destroy ozone, and that more frequent fires with climate change could slow the recovery of the ozone deficit back to pre-1980 levels. Professor Bernath said this point was still ""very speculative"". ""We're not really in the business of predicting the future, but if pyrocumulonimbus clouds continue to be more frequent on average … then obviously it will take longer to get back."" Dr Schofield said if smoke did affect ozone, it could have more impact if fires were more intense, or further towards the polar regions. ""The stratosphere is actually closer to the surface as you head toward the poles, so it's easier to punch into the stratosphere,"" Dr Schofield said. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Dr Fraser said fires would need to be very frequent to make a difference to the long-term global ozone levels. ""If you don't have a fire every year, then this ozone deficit won't come back every year,"" he said. While climate change would increase fire intensity, he said it was unlikely that Australia would see another fire of the Black Summer scale for at least another 10 to 20 years. ""What you also have to remember is how big the Australian fires were."" He said the conditions have also got to be right for injecting material into the stratosphere to have an effect on ozone levels. ""Since [ozone depletion is] barely detectable in this massive fire, it's probably not detectable in smaller fires."" Professor Bernath said while the impact of smoke from smaller fires such as the 2009 Black Saturday fires or Californian wildfire had not been studied, it could still have some impact on the atmosphere. ""This type of chemistry is going to take place, it's just that the Black Summer fires were so dramatic you could see the effect very easily."" He said the team would look at other firestorm events to see if there were any effects, as well as study the impact of particles in the atmosphere more closely.

153,"'Double whammy' of cats and foxes driving Australian animals to extinction, experts say",environment," Science Foxes and cats are knocking out Australia's wildlife with a devastating one-two punch The combination of feral cats and foxes is inflicting a staggering annual death toll on Australia's native wildlife. Their ability to take down different prey, and their capacity to flourish in different habitats, means they are putting immense pressure on the survival of a number of native animals across a large portion of the country. And where their diets and range overlap, they're delivering a one-two punch to some of our most vulnerable species. They're some of the key lessons from new research published in the journal Diversity and Distributions today and supported by the Threatened Species Recovery Hub. According to the findings, cats and foxes collectively kill in Australia each year: The findings highlight the urgent need for greater control of invasive species in order to curb Australia's worrying decline in native wildlife, the authors said. ""We need to deal with this problem of foxes and cats,"" said lead author Alyson Stobo-Wilson from Charles Darwin University. ""People think that a couple of cats and foxes aren't having an impact, but it adds up."" The researchers also mapped where the pests are found, and in what numbers, across Australia. Join nature journalist Ann Jones on an urban safari through Melbourne to discover the hidden world of the city’s feathery friends Cats, which range right over the expanse of the Australian mainland, are able to thrive with very little water as they can get most of their needs via the blood of their prey. This means that, unlike foxes, they can survive in the desert. Foxes, on the other hand, prefer cooler climates and dominate across the unmodified temperate and forested areas of southern Australia, and some peri-urban fringes. ""We've got cats going crazy in the arid zone and then foxes are impacting those forest regions in southern Australia,"" Dr Stobo-Wilson said. Overall, foxes kill fewer vertebrates than cats do. But foxes are capable of taking down larger prey like possums and macropods like wallabies. The prey species that fall within the size range and diet of both cats and foxes — things like bettongs and quolls, some birds and reptiles — are getting hit from both sides, according to study co-author Sarah Legge from the Australian National University. ""They've got different size preferences that overlap and the poor buggers in the middle are getting a double whammy,"" Professor Legge said. The researchers estimate that foxes kill around 367 million mammals each year, with about 29 per cent of those being native. That's about half the 815 million mammals estimated to be killed by feral cats each year. When killing by pet cats is included, that number jumps to over 1 billion mammals. In the fox diet, possums and gliders were the most common native mammal found. Foxes also had a high incidence of macropods and potoroids in their diet. Foxes also kill an estimated 38 million livestock animals such as lambs each year, and non-natives like rabbits. The authors say while Australia already does a good job on pest control, their research highlights the need for an even greater effort, and they hope their findings can help to streamline control programs. Australia is full of weird plants and animals. And Dr Ann Jones is on speaking terms with most of them! Without it, a number of species are threatened with extinction, Professor Legge said. ""The central rock rat, that's at risk from cats,"" she said. ""Without any cat control, it's got a pretty good chance of going extinct in the next 20 years. ""Another example is the eastern barred bandicoot — that's threatened by foxes on the mainland. It now exists only in fenced enclosures."" Others under extreme threat include things like the Gilbert's potoroo, eastern quoll, rufous-hare wallaby, and the burrowing bettong. While there's no ""silver bullet"" for controlling cat and fox numbers, ecologist John Read from the University of Adelaide, who wasn't involved in this study, says there are some things that work well. One key approach is for councils to enforce measures to keep domestic cats contained. ""Management of domestic cats is a huge issue,"" Dr Read said. ""Keeping cats contained helps prevent those environmental and health impacts and stops them getting out and breeding more feral cats."" Baiting with 1080 works quite well for foxes, and there have already been some fairly large and productive fox-baiting programs in southern and western Australia. ""Baiting is largely successful with foxes and there's been some strong conservation success stories with the numbat and black-footed and yellow-footed rock wallabies,"" Dr Read said. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. But unlike foxes, cats rarely eat carrion, making them harder to bait. Dr Read is the founder of Thylation, which has developed,with support from NGOs and government, the Felixer: a device that is able to recognise cats and fire a dose of poison onto their fur. ""Cats are really fastidious about being clean, so if you spray poison on their fur they'll go away and lick it,"" he said. Cats are also less efficient hunters where the understorey is dense and complex. So preserving the ground layer through cooler mosaic burning, as well as by controlling damage by grazing animals and pests like goats, can also improve the survival of native animals. But the one program that has had the greatest impact on feral cats and foxes in Australia wasn't actually targeting them, Dr Read said. ""The biggest impact we've had on feral cats by a mile was the release of the rabbit calicivirus,"" he said. By wiping out their food source, the calicivirus inadvertently sent pest predator numbers crashing as well. ""The numbers of foxes and cats were absolutely decimated,"" Dr Read said. ""Several threatened mammals such as the mulgara, plains mouse and fawn hopping mouse, that were hanging on in little pockets, were able to rebound 100-fold."" The key point the researchers want to reinforce is that where efforts have been made, from fenced enclosures to culling, they have often proven very successful, according to Dr Stobo-Wilson. ""We need to do better at a landscape scale,"" she said. ""When we do tackle these issues we can have really positive results, such as reintroducing species [that have been lost].""

155,'Appalling' chemical spill in Melbourne's west leaves dead wildlife strewn through waterways,environment,"  'Appalling' chemical spill in Melbourne's west leaves dead wildlife strewn through waterways Residents in Melbourne's west are devastated about a significant chemical spill that has left dead fish through local waterways and may have made it all the way to Port Phillip Bay. The chemical spill occurred last Monday and came from an industrial area in Laverton North after a factory fire. Environmental authorities believe about 12,000 to 13,000 litres of surfactant — a type of chemical often found in detergent or soap — was released into the waterways via stormwater drains. The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has started a formal investigation, probing just how the spill occurred. It does know pollution made its way into Cherry Creek, and then followed the creek's water flows east to Cherry Lake, a large lake used for fishing and recreational activities in Altona. Here, fish and eels have been seen floating dead in large numbers right across the lake's surface for days. Local environmentalist Diana Rice has been monitoring the lake. ""It's an appalling environmental disaster,"" she said. ""It's more than a shame, it's a disaster that it's come to this with so many dead fish."" She was critical of how the spill had been managed, saying it took days for booms to be put in place where the creek's reached the lake to stop the spread of pollution. ""I am surprised there weren't more swift attempts to mitigate the pollutant we were told about,"" she said. She said locals were worried about how much wildlife would be affected. ""We know there are dead eels, which are native,"" she said. ""We know there are also rats, pelicans, there's other invertebrate aquatic life [and] who knows what their fate has been?"" Ms Rice has also been worried about just how far the pollutions has spread. Cherry Creek continues on past the lake, and eventually meets Port Phillip Bay right near the popular Altona dog beach. The EPA's regional manager for the western Melbourne area, Steve Lansdell, told the ABC it had officers out on Monday testing water along that stretch of creek. He said there had been reports of dead fish on the beach. The ABC observed dead fish washed up on the beach on Monday afternoon. ""It's a dynamic situation and it will take some weeks to break down,"" Mr Lansdell said of the spill. Community members are being asked to notify the EPA of any dead fish they see along Cherry Creek or on the beach. Mr Lansdell defended how the spill had been managed, saying Melbourne Water and the EPA had been working together to manage the situation. ""With the incident, we were straight onto it, working with a lot of agencies as we do,"" he said. ""It's been a good team effort."" For now, environmental authorities are asking people not to fish at Cherry Lake or let their dogs swim in the lake. Many residents told the ABC they wanted answers about what caused the spill and what was being done to fix it. Altona resident Tyson Bezzina said the incident had been upsetting for residents. ""It's a disaster really for the area,"" he said. ""It's going to affect the area and it's going to affect how people use the lake."" The EPA estimates it could take weeks for the water to be cleared of the pollution.

156,Why does Hollywood get animals so wrong? And why does it often involve a kookaburra?,environment," Science A koala 'roar' in Jurassic Park? Hollywood filmmakers have made some weird animal sound choices OK, you're deep in what seems to be a steamy tropical jungle — a voyeur on some sort of intrepid safari, judging by the hats. Men are speaking what sounds a bit like Spanish, maybe Portuguese, and you can hear exotic animals calling through the bush. Right, so you must be somewhere in South America. A foreboding mountain peak in the distance would appear to be the destination of your travelling party. Their manner suggests they're in a hurry, on some sort of quest, possibly involving an ark. A kookaburra calls. You're no longer in the jungle. You're back in your lounge room thinking, ""what the hell is a kookaburra doing in South America?"" If you've ever had a movie ruined by something completely incongruous, a glaring oversight that once you notice, you can't unsee (or unhear), you're not alone. But it turns out you're especially at risk of this happening if you have a decent knowledge of animals. You may have already spotted a few yourself, but here, in no particular order, are some of Hollywood's most ridiculous — sometimes justifiably so — faunal flights of fancy. Strap in, we're going to the movies. (And if you're a fan of Jurassic Park and you don't want to have your precious memories of that film sullied ... we're talking audio of a mid-coitus tortoise and an amorous koala just for starters so, you've been warned.) You might have already guessed, but the description above was for 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark — the first in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones series. In that case, ornithologists couldn't even make it past the opening credits without an out-of-place kookaburra spoiling the scene. As you'll hear more about soon, this seems to be a regular occurrence for the kookaburra in Hollywood. But that particular kookaburra was the work of a ""sound guy out of Sydney"", sound recordist and editor James Currie told ABC RN podcast What the Duck?! ""Oh yeah, that's a good one,"" says James, a veteran of more than 40 years in the industry with credits on films like Charlie's Country and The Tracker. ""I was laughing with the sound guy out of Sydney that sent the Americans the kookaburra sound."" A lot of American films are shot ""mute"" and atmospheric sound is added later, James says. ""They wanted something different, something that would excite the American audience — something exotic. So [the sound guy] said 'how about a kookaburra?' And they said 'what's that?'"" ""So he sent them the kookaburra and they put it in."" It wasn't the first or the last film to include the Australian bird though. The Wizard of Oz, Cape Fear and Tarzan are just a few more examples. And there's one more really weird one but you'll have to read to the end for the big reveal. Don't skip ahead. You'll miss heaps of good stuff. Whereas the above example is perhaps sloppiness on behalf of the filmmakers, in other cases there's little choice but for the sound designers to get creative with their audio. Enter scene, Jurassic Park. Lawyer Donald Gennaro has taken refuge in a particularly flimsy dunny, as a rampaging T. rex closes in. Before plucking him from his outhouse, the dinosaur makes a series of grunting sounds. ""One of the sounds that the T. rex makes is a koala sound,"" says Maggie Watson, an ornithologist and conservation biologist at Charles Sturt University. Specifically, it's the mating call of a male koala. ""A lot of [the T. rex's] grunts are alligators and crocodiles. ""But before [the T. rex] roars in that iconic scene where he's about to go and eat the dude in the toilet, that kind of [grunt, grunt] sound is a koala."" In fact, Jurassic Park's sound creators borrowed a whole smorgasbord from nature's audio library to give their prehistoric actors voice. The hiss of the velociraptor, for instance, came from a goose. And its bark? It was actually a male tortoise consummating its relationship, according to Dr Watson. But Jurassic Park's creators deserve a bit of leeway here. It's not like they had access to actual dinosaur audio. Which is more than can be said for many Hollywood producers of the past, who have inadvertently created the modern sound designer's dilemma: the ""coconut effect"". Basically, the coconut effect is a phenomenon where a fake sound — such as the banging together of coconuts for a horse's galloping hooves — has become so ubiquitous that filmmakers have been forced to continue including the fake device, in place of the real one. The absence of, say, the audible splat of a punch landing, or the ringing of an unsheathed sword, can prove jarring to an audience steeped in the language of Hollywood. Anyway, that's the last time we'll let Jurassic Park off the hook because, apart from their island off the coast of Costa Rica also featuring a kookaburra, they went and did this: ""In my humble opinion the most famous mosquito in Hollywood blockbusters is the mosquito that's in Jurassic Park,"" says Cameron Webb, a mosquito researcher from the University of Sydney and NSW Health Pathology. If you're not familiar with the plot, basically a mosquito is discovered with a gutful of dinosaur blood, and preserved perfectly in amber. Scientists extract the blood and use that to harvest dino DNA and — insert science stuff — clone dinosaurs. But ... ""It's really the wrong type of mosquito,"" Dr Webb says. ""The mosquito that is featured in the film is in real life a mosquito whose scientific name is Toxorhynchites. In Australia we have a very similar species."" Toxorhynchites is a genus of usually large mosquitoes, which may explain why it was used in the film — for dramatic effect. ""One of the things about this mosquito is it is kind of a friendly mosquito — it doesn't bite,"" Dr Webb says. ""So that type of mosquito is not one that you'd be extracting blood from."" But even if they'd got the species right, there's still the issue of gender. ""To make matters worse, the mosquito looks like it's a male,"" Dr Webb says. ""Only the female mosquitoes bite. The males live on plant juice and sugars; it's the female that needs the blood to develop her eggs."" For some reason when Hollywood gets their fauna wrong, it often involves birds, which can make movie-going a minefield for people like John Fitzpatrick, emeritus professor at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. His audio nemesis is the oft-misplaced shrill cry of the red-tailed hawk. Join nature journalist Ann Jones on an urban safari through Melbourne to discover the hidden world of the city’s feathery friends It's become a trope to signify wilderness or isolation, and the call is often used alongside vision of the bald eagle (because the bald eagle call is underwhelming). ""Producers that aren't paying attention have their standard sources of sounds,"" Professor Fitzpatrick says. And it's not just movie producers. Televised golf often appears with a dubbed nature track, he says. ""I actually have a life list of golf birds ... it's 131 species of birds I've identified on golf live broadcasts. ""When they get it wrong ... they get inundated with people saying, 'what are you doing? You're playing the wrong birds!'"" If the red-tailed hawk is Professor Fitzpatrick's bugbear, for Dr Watson it's a pelican in the kids' film Finding Nemo. ""They went to ichthyologists, they went to aquariums, and they figured out exactly what fish should be on the Great Barrier Reef,"" Dr Watson says. ""They got all of that perfectly right. And they didn't bother with the bird?"" The bird she's referring to is Nigel, a pelican with an Australian brogue and a penchant for dentistry. ""It's a pelican, and so [the animators] looked out of their window and they saw brown pelicans in southern California and they're like, 'oh yeah, whatever, pelican, it's the same,'"" Dr Watson says. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. ""No it's not! They're very different looking. You don't have brown pelicans, you have Australian pelicans, in Australia."" The other thing we don't have in Australia is dolphins that talk like kookaburras.

The wilderness is nature's own art gallery and Queensland Museum photographer Gary Cranitch is one of the very few to have seen the exhibition firsthand. He might have seen more of Queensland than any other person — much of it through a viewfinder. Since 2019, Mr Cranitch has single-handedly been collecting images of rarely seen, remote and beautiful parts of the state as part of a mammoth project recording Queensland's wetlands. Mr Cranitch has crisscrossed Queensland eight times in tiny two-seater planes, helicopters and a four-wheel drive vehicle. ""I probably flew about 75,000 kilometres and drove somewhere in the vicinity of 50,000,"" he said. He got to see remote parts of the state in drought and flood. ""During 2019, Queensland was extremely dry — one of the driest years on record — and then in early 2020 we got a huge influx of rain,"" he said. ""I've been lucky enough to see both sides of the coin and they're vastly different from each other. ""You'd swear you're seeing different parts of the country."" He took close to 100,000 photographs. ""I think the key take-out from what I saw is just how diverse Queensland is and how huge it is, and how there are many locations throughout Queensland that you can't see unless you look at them from the air,"" he said. Mr Cranitch said the recent rain and flooding event in south-east Queensland is an example of the boom and bust cycle of wetlands and shows the extraordinary impact of water on the environment. ""It's an ongoing story — how things change in a just a few weeks and how they evolve constantly."" ""I'm hoping to continue with this work, there are some more opportunities."" His photos will be used in a book on Queensland's wetlands, due to be published mid-year. Department of Environment and Science wetlands manager Mike Ronan said Queensland has ""the greatest diversity of wetlands in Australia"". ""Wetlands are really anything that gets wet — so rivers, creeks, swamp, lakes — they're all wetlands,"" he said. ""They are some of the most important parts of our landscape, but you don't often get to celebrate how wonderful they are."" Mr Ronan has helped bring the project into life with research and logistics, as well as writing the text and helping to choose photos for the book. ""It's one thing to see the mapping, it's quite another thing to see the photographs — and some of the areas are really quite spectacular,"" he said. In addition to wetlands, Mr Cranitch captured images of birds flocking to inland seas, emus dancing on grass recently sprouted after floodwaters pushed through deserts. There are pictures of farmland — rich red and verdant green — as well as enormous feeding lots for cattle across vast properties. ""We would plan meticulously where Gary would go,"" Mr Ronan said. ""A lot of work went in beforehand because roads might have been cut off and you might not be able to get into areas, so you always had to have a backup plan."" There were quite a few changes of plan when dust storms, rain squalls or extreme wind gusts made their presence known. ""I suppose when you are taking pictures you concentrate on the job, but we hit a few air pockets, dodged some storms,"" Mr Cranitch said. ""We had to land a few times to dodge those sorts of things because they're not nice to fly through. ""I worked with some terrific pilots who know the country well, but you're always happy to land."" Mr Cranitch, whose 38-year career had already taken him across much of the state, witnessed colours, textures and patterns in places he had only previously heard about. ""I didn't know they were as vast or sometimes as empty — places like the southern Gulf, for example. Those flood plains exist for 45, 50, 60 kilometres of dead flat country."" While most of the images were taken from the sky, he said he never used drones. ""A drone is fantastic for doing things that are close to you but they have a limited range. I was covering vast areas,"" he said. For the most part, he relied on just one camera body and three or four lenses. When he could, Mr Cranitch would also drive off-road to capture wetlands at ground level. ""Often to get in amongst a wetland, it means getting into a location that's full of a few things that may or may not bite you,"" he said. Fortunately there were no run-ins with snakes or crocodiles, although he did look under the water for photo opportunities as well. One image, taken near the town of Innot Hot Springs in the north Queensland tablelands, looks like an alien landscape with bulbous green life forms — algae growing in a hot spring. ""You're never disappointed and you're always inspired by what's around you,"" Mr Cranitch said. Images that do not make the cut for the book — the ones of dust storms, cattle, mountain ranges and railway lines — will be used for research and exhibitions. Despite his epic journey, there are still places in Queensland on the photographer's bucket list. ""There's always somewhere new to visit — I'm not finished with it yet,"" he said.

158,NSW's Darling River is experiencing an outbreak of algae. Here are the warnings in place for nearby residents ,environment,"  WaterNSW alerts towns on NSW's Darling River over potentially toxic blue-green algae People living along the Darling River at Wilcannia and Caulpaulin in far western NSW have been over dangerous levels of blue-green algae detected in the water system. High concentrations of bacteria prompted a red alert for the areas from WaterNSW, with an amber alert for Louth, Tilpa and Trevallyn. Concerns about blue-green algal blooms in the region were first raised in the summer of 2018/19 when up to a million dead fish were found at Menindee. So far this year, WaterNSW has managed releases in and out of water systems after flooding from unusually heavy rain. The water supplier has warned people not to come into direct contact with the affected water or use it for domestic purposes such as showering. The algae can cause skin and eye irritations and even affect the nervous system of humans and animals. According to WaterNSW, satellite imagery showed the algae heading into the Menindee lakes system. Describing it as a ""slug of algae"", the organisation said it would likely be flushed down the system. WaterNSW has recommended water users downstream from Wilcannia and to Menindee find alternative water supplies. Some landholders south of Tilpa and around Menindee said they had not seen any signs of an algal bloom yet. The ABC has contacted WaterNSW for comment.

159,'Off the charts': Making sense of eastern Australia's seemingly endless rain,environment,"  Understanding the rare weather event that's flooded eastern Australia As the scenes of devastation from the floods across eastern Australia continue to emerge it's clear already the event will be one of Australia's worst-ever natural disasters. More than twenty people have died, and the damage bill from the past three weeks of destruction is expected to top at least $2 billion. The destruction is hardly surprising given what experts say is an unprecedented rain event. ""The amount of rain that's fallen in Sydney, for example, this year so far is completely off the charts,"" says Dr Chiara Holgate, a hydro-climatologist at ANU. ""It's the largest amount of rainfall year to date that we've had since records began in the 1800s."" While the most serious flooding began in late February, scientists say the causes of the disaster are complex and stretch back to late last year when the east coast experienced its wettest November on record. A key factor Dr Holgate says is the run of consecutive La Niña weather systems — an event that occurs when water in the Pacific Ocean close to Australia heats up, drawing in moist air from the eastern Pacific near South America. ""We've had back-to-back La Niña's now and La Niña, as we know, typically leads to above-average rainfall in eastern Australia."" On top of this scientists point to another climatic influence known as the Southern Annular Mode which pushes strong westerly winds north from the Southern Ocean. ""The combination that caused the most extreme wet conditions in eastern Australia was when La Niña occurred with the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode,"" Dr Holgate said. ""When these two phases combine, we get a lot of extra moisture being funnelled into Eastern Australia, and it's much easier for that moisture to fall as rain when it arrives."" According to the Bureau of Meteorology, this pushed NSW's ""area average"" rainfall last year up to 720mm, 30 per cent higher than the long-term average. ""With all that rain that fell in November and subsequent months, all of the catchments were filling up,"" says Dr Holgate, who compares the situation to a flower pot being watered. ""If you've put water on it slowly, it can soak it up, but only to a point."" ""Once that dirt is full, it can't hold any more water and so any extra water on top just flows off … it's prime conditions for a flood."" With catchments and dams saturated, the tipping point for the recent floods came in late February in the form of a slow-moving trough off the Queensland coast. ""What this trough did was pull moisture in from the Coral Sea and dump it on Southern Queensland and Northern NSW, "" said Dr Nina Ridder, a research associate at the University of NSW Climate Change Research Centre. ""This trough moved southwards and hit NSW and an east coast low developed, hitting the affected area again."" The result was some of the worst floodings in living memory. While scientists are certain human-induced climate change is making these kinds of events worse, the exact impact is harder to determine. Dr Nandini Ramesh is a chief investigator at the University of Sydney's ARC Centre for Data Analytics for Resources and the Environment. She says the fact that we've already warmed the earth by around 1 degree Celsius since the pre-industrial era does have an impact on the intensity and frequency of rain events. ""Warm air holds more water, and when it does form a storm that means there's more water in the air to rain out,"" she said. ""You can't generally say that this particular storm was because of climate change, but we do know for a fact that the atmosphere is carrying more moisture, so when it does rain there will be more water to fall."" Dr Ritter agrees that with a warmer atmosphere there will be a higher number of extreme rainfall events and those that do occur will be more intense. ""For each degree of warming, the air can hold an extra 7 per cent extra water,"" she said. ""We also see that the oceans are warming and the more that occurs the more moisture will end up in the air. ""What we don't know is if the slow-moving trough is more likely due to climate change, or if the combination of the trough and the persistent east coast low is going to become more frequent."" While many parts of the state are experiencing a reprieve from the rain, scientists are warning that more wet weather could be on the way. Dr Chiara Holgate says the models are predicting the La Niña system will dissipate in the coming months, but that won't necessarily mean the end of the rain. ""The El Nino Southern Oscillation isn't the only thing that drives our weather here in eastern Australia — lots of other factors at [are] play. ""All those things combined, the prediction is for above-average rainfall in the next few months. ""I don't think the show is over yet."" Dr Nandini Ramesh agrees, pointing out that even if La Niña eases off, the east coast will still have to deal with the rain that typically hits the region over the winter months. ""It'll probably keep raining for a while, we have to be prepared for that."" Listen to the full episode of this story on the ABC News Daily podcast here.

160,Farmers are helping stop the Sunshine Coast's major water source filling with silt,environment," ABC Rural Farmers are helping stop the Sunshine Coast's major water source filling with silt Collaborations with Maleny farmers such as Barry Gartshore and Sally Keyes are helping to prevent the Sunshine Coast's major source of drinking water becoming filled with silt. More than $10 million has been spent fencing cattle out of creeks, building concrete creek crossings, providing off-stream water sources, tackling landslips and erosion and planting and maintaining tens of thousands of trees. Built in 1989, Baroon Pocket Dam, also known as Lake Baroon, holds up to 61,000 megalitres and supplies water to 75 per cent of the Sunshine Coast. It is one of most reliable water sources in the South East Queensland Water Grid - a $6.9 billion drought-resilience project that allows drinking water to be moved through more than 600 kilometres of pipes that are joined to 12 dams, 35 treatment plants, 28 reservoirs, 22 pump stations and a desalination plant. But the longevity of the dam on Obi Obi Creek relies on keeping silt out of it. ""Sediment's one of the biggest risks because it's a pocket dam,"" Lake Baroon Catchment Care Group president Peter Stevens said. ""Pocket dams by their nature are small and so if they fill with sediment, their useful life is reduced considerably, apart from all the other associated problems of algal blooms."" Mr Stevens, who has volunteered as group president for the past 20 years, said Maleny was known for being steep, with significant numbers of landslips, very high rainfall and intense storms. ""There are very real risks that very large amounts of sediment can enter the dam and that causes significant problems for water quality and for producing drinkable water, but also reduces the capacity of the dam."" Seqwater is the Queensland government bulk water supply authority responsible for providing safe, reliable drinking water. It, along with the Sunshine Coast Regional Council, helps fund Lake Baroon Catchment Care Group which now works with hundreds of landholders, on a cost-sharing basis. Maleny Springs Farm, which combines running Droughtmaster cattle with upmarket farmstay accommodation, has become a model of what can be achieved in the 74-square-kilometre catchment. ""Baroon Catchment Care have done a wonderful project on our property fencing off the creek to keep the livestock out of the creek. They have put in off-stream water troughs and four concrete creek crossings,"" Ms Keyes said. ""It's been an absolute win for a landowner and they're a great bunch that have planted hundreds and hundreds of rainforest trees along the creek as well, which is wonderful, and there's this continual ongoing job of assisting maintaining the property and controlling the weeds."" Mr Stevens said it was crucial to facilitate an affordable system of maintaining the water source. Of $1.8 million dollars worth of projects carried out last year, landholders contributed half a million dollars in either in-kind or cash contributions. ""That is quite a significant amount of money in an area where farms are small and often derive very small incomes that don't cover the cost of production. ""And the fact is it is a water catchment, there are revenues associated with that, and Seqwater has a vested interest in cleaning up the water quality.""

161,How a rescued bird of prey's TV antenna mishap could soon help ensure the survival of the species,environment,"  Bid to use satellite to track rescued bird of prey caught in TV antenna Bird enthusiasts are hoping to get approval to fit a satellite tracker to a rare adult eastern osprey that was trapped in the tower of a television antenna in South Australia. Port Lincoln Osprey volunteers are monitoring the bird and expect to release it back to the Louth Bay area at the end of the week after it was rescued on Friday and treated for a leg wound. There are estimated to be about 40 breeding pairs of the birds left in South Australia. Louth Bay resident Des Fauser said the osprey and its mate roosted a couple of times a week on the antenna tower on a neighbouring property. He said his wife Lorraine noticed early Friday morning one of the birds was stuck about halfway down the tower, suspended upside down by one foot. National Parks and Wildlife Service SA district ranger Peter Wilkins retrieved the male osprey and it was treated at a veterinary clinic, where an X-ray ruled out broken bones. Raptor consultant Ian Falkenberg said the bird was recovering from the wound to its leg and also bruising on its wings that would impact its flying. ""It's just one of those very freak accidents that would have brought this bird unstuck and ultimately it would have died very quickly if it wasn't for the parks staff and other members of the public,"" Mr Falkenberg said. ""When birds are caught by a leg and they are hung upside down, raptors generally don't live very long at all, no more than a couple of hours at the most."" Mr Falkenberg said the quick actions of locals saved the raptor, one of an estimated 40 pairs surviving in South Australia. ""Yesterday it was starting to preen itself, its feathers, it's sitting on both legs, it's feeding,"" Mr Falkenberg said. Port Lincoln Osprey monitors a pair of the raptors nesting on a barge at Port Lincoln using CCTV vision, which is fed live onto YouTube. The group has co-ordinated banding of chicks from the nest and in the past two years, satellite trackers have been placed on five chicks. Mr Falkenberg said he was hopeful a permit would be granted to fit a satellite tracker to the bird rescued from Louth Bay. It would be the first time an adult bird had been tagged with a tracker. He said the data gained from the satellite tags had helped rewrite the book on osprey knowledge. A bird tagged in 2020, called Solly, had travelled 300 kilometres from Port Lincoln, defying expectations that the birds only moved 40 kilometres from their nest. Solly died last year after being electrocuted on a power pole at Streaky Bay. A chick tagged at Thistle Island, south-east of Port Lincoln, last November had flown 400 kilometres and briefly spent time inland in the Flinders Ranges. Mr Falkenberg said tagging an adult bird would provide key information about the species and help manage its survival. ""This does present a golden opportunity to learn more about adult birds,"" Mr Falkenberg said.

162,Volunteer divers clean up hidden trash to help end strain on sea life,environment,"  Volunteer divers find more than 100kg of rubbish and debris hidden along Busselton Jetty A shopping trolley, a vape and beer bottles. These items weren't found at the local supermarket. They were discovered by a group of avid divers in the water at the longest timber jetty in the Southern Hemisphere. On Sunday, 31 divers from Perth, the South West and overseas came together for a massive underwater clean-up of the 1.8-kilometre structure in Busselton. In less than two hours, they pulled out more than 100 kilograms of rubbish and debris. Event coordinator Jacquie Bullard said this was the biggest clean-up she and the crew at non-profit Busselton Jetty Incorporated had ever organised, and it was done in collaboration with Clean Up Australia. Ms Bullard said they wanted to figure out what exactly was under the iconic structure, especially in areas not frequented by divers or swimmers. ""The end of the jetty is heavily dived. It's the sanctuary zone, and a lot of the divers will pick up rubbish,"" she said. ""The middle section, not a lot of people will dive for a couple of reasons — it's not that deep … and fishing."" Event collaborator Tania Douthwaite said it was interesting to see the different types of rubbish divers found in these areas. ""There was some pottery, there was a vape, there was a really big, large pole with an octopus hiding in it and lots of fishing gear,"" Ms Douthwaite said. The Perth-based free diving instructor said she would like to see more events like this happen in years to come. ""This could grow,"" she said. The rubbish discovered will be entered into the Tangaroa Blue Marine Debris Database. A number of Perth-based divers from Taiwan to China drove down to Busselton to help clean up the jetty. Chinese national Olivier Xu Rin used to be a free dive instructor in the Philippines. While he was shocked to find such a low amount of plastic waste under the jetty, he said more could be done. ""I really hope the people here also try to stop using plastic bottles and plastic bags,"" he said. Perth-based teacher Aneta Ward frequently visited the Busselton Jetty. She said it was one of her favourite ecosystems in the world to explore as a diver. ""It is abundant in sea life,"" Ms Ward said. ""It's nice to come along and give back and help the many volunteers who work to keep it clean."" Ms Ward said she often spotted fish and stingrays caught on hooks and fishing lines when she dived in the area. ""It's very hard to see animals swimming past with three, four metres of fishing line dragging behind them,"" she said. 'Over time, that fishing line gathers up debris and seaweed, and it puts a lot of strain on the animals … and eventually they do pass away. ""We really need to look after it. I cannot stress enough how important this treasure is here for the South West."" Perth-based resident Rong Zhong has visited the Busselton Jetty a number of times, but she usually does so to fish. On Sunday, she decided to dive in for the first time and find out what was there. Ms Zhong said the underwater area had been well-maintained by volunteers but seeing rubbish like beer bottles and fishing line showed how careful people had to be. Ms Zhong said she had a close call recently when she almost lost a crab net but luckily managed to hold onto it when it got caught on one of her hooks. For extra safety, she now double checks everything is tied up properly before dropping the net. ""Otherwise, I can't get rid of the guilt,"" she said. ""The ocean can't deal with it.

163,analysis: It's the elephant in our flooded east coast — and now's the time to talk about it,environment," Science NSW and Queensland flooded the same week a major climate report was released. We need to talk about it As the rain bucketed down 10 days ago, residents of a nearby house in our neighbourhood in the outskirts of Brisbane were woken by a loud cracking. Their newly built home had begun slipping down the hill. Commemorate World Environment Day on June 5 by going on a ""virtual field trip"" to an Australian town that's been designed around the impacts of climate change and disaster preparedness. The phenomenal amount of rain that had already fallen had caused a landslip that had destabilised the foundations, forcing them to evacuate in the darkness to a shed on flatter ground. It took two days to be able to make out the carnage — the white and cream home usually in clear view across the valley from our back verandah was obscured by the blinding rain. When it finally eased, we could see the front stairs were gone, the front house-poles splayed down the hill, and the right-hand side of the house was slumped awkwardly, peering over the steep incline. No doubt they'll need to pull the house down and start again. Mt Glorious just to the north of Brisbane received more than 700 millimetres in 24 hours. Further north, Maryborough endured its second major flood in as many months. Gympie, used to semi-regular flooding, was under more water than it had been in more than 100 years. The Mary River, which intersects both towns, was at its highest peak in Gympie since 1893. In Brisbane, bridges and causeways were flooded. Then entire streets. Nervous residents watched as the river pushed into more houses with each high tide. Residents of Brookfield in Brisbane's west reported emptying more than 1,000 mm of water from rain gauges between Thursday and Sunday. As the system tracked south, some Lismore locals thought they'd be safe taking shelter on, or in, their roof spaces. But the floodwaters didn't stop rising – 1974's record flood markers throughout the town were eclipsed by the swelling brown water. Volunteers in tinnies and on jet-skis were going rooftop to rooftop, ferrying residents to higher ground. In some cases they had to cut people out from inside roof spaces. At the time of writing, 16 people had died in Queensland and New South Wales, with that figure likely to rise. This is the second ""one-in-100-year"" flood in 11 years in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. Two years ago, these regions were in the grips of bushfire. Descriptors like ""rain bomb"" are being bandied about as politicians and reporters search for new adjectives to describe the system that dumped more rain on parts of the south-east than the fabled 1974 floods. Just like in 2011, the word unprecedented has been thrown around a lot. The highly unusual combination of two consecutive weather events that ""act like a boiling pot of water"" is to blame for the devastating floods and storms that have hit the east coast, an expert says. It may well be unprecedented. But it's not unexpected. This is the new precedent; the new present. And yes, weather systems are variable, rainfall especially. Of course a one-in-100 year event doesn't guarantee it'll only happen once every 100 years. And yes, it's a La Niña year when rainfall totals are expected to be higher. And yes, we've always had extreme weather. It will take time for scientists to determine how much climate change contributed to the devastation, this time. But this is what climate change looks like. Big weather, tumbling records, one extreme following another. And it's going to get worse. Climate forecasts say that warming will cause more intense storm events. A hotter atmosphere is capable of carrying more moisture before it's released. A warmer ocean carries more energy to fuel storm systems. We're only at around 1.1 degree Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels. They had a chance at the Glasgow Climate Summit last year, but politicians both here and internationally won't commit to measures that might keep warming to 2C this century, let alone 1.5C. Right now we're tipped to cross the 1.5C threshold soon after 2030. As the IPCC outlined in its 2018 report, the threat of temperature and rainfall extremes — both negative and positive — will continue to rise sharply between 1.5C and 2C in parts of Australia. Last week the IPCC released its latest report on the impacts of climate change and projected impacts to ecosystems. Increased bushfire area, higher drought-induced tree mortality, longer duration of hot days, lost agricultural productivity are already being measured in Australia, they reported. Some of Australia's iconic and unique natural ecosystems are headed for irreversible damage if we keep emitting carbon at current rates, climate experts warn. But they're not necessarily the ones you might expect. United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres described the report as an ""atlas of human suffering"" and ""a damning indictment of failed climate leadership"". ""This abdication of leadership is criminal. The world's biggest polluters are guilty of arson of our only home,"" he said. Flooding from intense rainfall is already Australia's most expensive disaster. The latest IPCC report warned it's going to get worse. Yet in the midst of it all, the IPCC report has barely rated a mention in Canberra. The IPCC has been releasing these reports now for 32 years, publishing more than 60 major reports to 2022. Since 1990, scientists have warned that there needs to be a radical shift from our dependence on fossil fuels. At that stage we had some, but not much, time up our sleeves. Our politicians back then had a good idea of what was at stake. They were warned about climate change at a CSIRO briefing in 1986. In 1990, then environment minister Ros Kelly under the Hawke government proposed an emissions target to cabinet. But as the years went by, under pressure from the fossil fuel industry and others, commitments wavered and emissions climbed. All the while the IPCC and climate scientists' predictions only got firmer, more refined and more urgent. And now we're starting to live them. Federal Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor has been speaking about carbon capture and storage technology this week as part of the Federal Government's push to overhaul clean energy investment in Australia. But governments around the world, including our own, continue to subsidise fossil fuels and bet heavily on unproven technologies like carbon capture and storage, and continue to finger-point and what-about on their share of global emissions, instead of just doing their very best to get emissions down. It feeds the inertia if we follow the sentiment that ""now's not the time"" to talk about climate change — at times when we've all got our hands full cleaning up its mess. Kicking the can down the road has allowed the status quo to get us where we are today: on borrowed time, with the prospect of overshooting an adaptable 1.5C of warming practically a given. But when we're not in the midst of a bushfire, a flood or a drought, we tend to forget the urgency. Other more immediate problems require our attention. If we're lucky right now, we might get a reprieve: a few years without a major natural disaster, likely exacerbated by a warming world. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. But as climate scientists and the IPCC continue to warn us, the breaks between extreme events are going to get shorter. And when the disasters come, they'll bite harder. Why should we wait for the next one to talk about it? Or the one after that? While images of flooding still fill our news bulletins, it's important to remember that these events aren't happening in a vacuum. Climate change is happening around us, and now is not the time for avoiding the subject. No ducking, no delaying. It's time to take it on. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

164,Hubert flies again! Lost bird's epic ordeal ends on a wing after months of prayers,environment,"  Hubert, the first Eurasian hobby seen in eastern Australia, released after long recovery A migratory bird never before seen in eastern Australia has been safely released after months of treatment for a pair of fractured wings. The hobby, dubbed ""Hubert"", was discovered in November walking around a paddock just outside south-east Victorian town Sale. It was the first time the species had been seen in the east after a handful of sightings in Perth. The birds normally migrate south from northern Europe and Asia into Africa and further south in Asia. It is believed Hubert fractured his wings when he ran into a wire while flying above grass trying to catch insects. He was found by a wildlife carer and taken to Healesville Sanctuary for treatment. Australian Wildlife Health Centre manager Gerry Ross said the treatment took about three months. ""The bird’s wings were immobilised for treatment over several months and the bird responded well,"" she said. The ABC understands some had concerns Hubert would never fly again. Ms Ross said the hobby was returned to Sale to be set free. ""Once the factures had healed, flight training took place to ensure the bird had good fitness levels prior to release in the area where it was found,"" she said. Monash University Ornithologist Rohan Clarke said Hubert's recovery was well-timed. ""March would be good timing, early April at the latest,"" he said. ""He could be heading home to China, and that's probably more likely than Europe.""

165,"Report finds Bridgetown bushfire contamination low, but expert calls for ongoing testing  ",environment,"  Report finds Bridgetown bushfire contamination low, but expert calls for ongoing testing The extent of heavy metal contamination after a devastating bushfire in Bridgetown in WA's South West is not as bad as initially feared, but there are calls for more testing as residents return to their properties. There were concerns about toxic material in Hester after a bushfire burnt through 600 tonnes of chemically treated pine logs at the Timber Treaters plant. The logs were treated with the preservative copper chromium arsenate. Initial screening showed potentially high levels of arsenic and chromium could have been emitted after the fires. However, a report commissioned by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation has since revealed that subsequent field screening of soil on Hester Road and Warner Street did not detect levels of copper, chromium and arsenic above permissible levels. ""Water and soil samples from Hester Dam returned levels within Australian Drinking Water Guidelines,"" it said. ""Elevated levels of chromium were detected at some properties, but further testing ... indicated that the levels were below [levels of detection] for Chromium V1."" Despite the testing, some residents remain worried about the toxic material in Hester. Hayati Gok and his family won't be returning home. ""It leaves us virtually homeless,"" he said ""I think what they would need to do to make us feel a little more secure about it— but I don't think it would still change my mind — would be to go through with a fine tooth in a systematic way and test in a grid format all different areas of the property."" He said they were not making the decision to stay away lightly. ""It took us eight months to find this property, previously, with the property shortage in WA,"" Mr Gok said. Curtin University professor of environmental and occupational health Ben Mullins agreed more testing would be beneficial. ""It might even be worth considering biological monitoring … to make sure that they're not accumulating levels chromium compounds, despite what the monitoring says because the existing monitoring can only test a finite amount of locations, "" he said. ""So I think it would be sensible to have some sort of ongoing monitoring plan, rather than say the clean-up is finished, and that's that."" It's not yet clear what will happen to the timber treatment plant, which was largely destroyed in the blaze. Bridgetown-Greenbushes Shire president John Bookless said the site would need to be closely monitored going forward. ""Obviously, during the clean-up, there is a potential for some of the contamination to escape if it's not treated properly, and if it's not handled in an environmentally sensitive way,"" he said. ""There's still a lot of bad material there. ""It has been contained during the operation itself to stop it from spreading further, and it's just been coated in [sealing agent] BondCrete."" Cr Bookless said it would be OK unless the seal was ""breached"". ""But it will, obviously, in the longer term have to be cleaned up and taken around and disposed of properly,"" he said.

166,'Biggest green deal since Paris': UN panel votes to create treaty to fight plastic pollution,environment," Environment United Nations agrees to create 'historic' global treaty on plastic pollution in landmark agreement The United Nations has approved a landmark agreement to create the world's first global plastic pollution treaty, describing it as the most significant environmental deal since the 2015 Paris climate accord. Member states held talks for more than a week in Nairobi to agree to the outline of a pact to rein in soaring plastic pollution, an environmental crisis that extends from ocean trenches to mountain tops. Government officials cheered and punched the air after the adoption of a resolution to create a legally binding plastic pollution treaty, which is due to be finalised by 2024. ""We're making history today and you should all be proud,"" said Espen Barth Eide, president of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA). ""Plastic pollution has grown into an epidemic. With today's resolution we are officially on track for a cure."" The resolution, which UNEA calls ""the most significant environmental deal since the Paris accord"", is written in broad strokes and an intergovernmental committee is now tasked with negotiating a deal that will have ripple effects on businesses and economies around the world. Any treaty that puts restrictions on plastic production, use or design would affect oil and chemicals companies that make raw plastic, as well as consumer goods giants that sell thousands of products in single-use packaging. It would also affect the economies of major plastic-producing countries, including the United States, China, India, Saudi Arabia and Japan. Although UN officials were united in celebrating the agreement to have a plastic treaty, disagreements remain over what should be included in a final pact, Switzerland's ambassador for the environment Franz Perrez said. ""This is a division between those who are ambitious and want to find a solution and those who don't want to find a solution for whatever reasons,"" he said. Surfing is booming in India, but its new adoptees are coming face to face with the world's ocean plastic pollution crisis. There is overwhelming public support for a UN treaty on plastic pollution, according to an Ipsos poll released this month, and delegates were quick to celebrate what they had achieved in Nairobi. ""This is only the end of the beginning, we have a lot of work ahead of us,"" said a tearful Monica Medina, the head of the US delegation. ""But it is the beginning of the end of the scourge of plastic waste for this planet."" Juliet Kabera, lead negotiator for Rwanda, hailed the resolution as a ""great victory in the global quest to reverse the rapidly worsening impacts of plastic pollution."" If the treaty cannot put the brakes on plastic pollution, there will be widespread envionmental damage over the coming decades, putting some marine species at risk of extinction and destroying sensitive ecosystems such as coral reefs and mangroves, according to a WWF study released this month. ""The habitability of our planet is stake,"" Tim Grabiel, a lawyer with non-profit Environmental Investigation Agency in Nairobi said following the talks. ""Plastic pollution is a planetary crisis on par with climate change and biodiversity loss.""

167,Oil reserves to be tapped to shore up markets over supply fears caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine,environment,"  The International Energy Agency's 31 member countries have agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from their strategic reserves ""to send a strong message to oil markets"" that supplies won't fall short after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The board of the Paris-based IEA made the decision at an extraordinary meeting of energy ministers chaired by US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Half of that will come from the United States and Ms Granholm said President Joe Biden was ready to ""take additional measures"" if needed. The group's ""decision reflects our common commitment to address significant market and supply disruptions related to President Putin's war on Ukraine,"" Ms Granholm said. Russia plays an outsized role in global energy markets as the third-largest oil producer. ""It is the world's largest exporter of oil to global markets and the second-largest crude oil exporter behind Saudi Arabia,"" the IEA said. Catch up on all the news about the Russian invasion of Ukraine Its exports of 5 million barrels of crude per day amount to about 12 per cent of the global oil trade. Some 60 per cent goes to Europe and another 20 per cent to China. So far, US and European sanctions have not barred oil or gas exports and have included exceptions for transactions to pay for oil and gas. Western leaders have been reluctant to restrict Russian oil exports at a time when global energy markets are tight and high prices are fuelling inflation in developed economies. But the invasion has still shaken markets worldwide. On Tuesday, oil prices soared, with US benchmark crude surpassing $US106 ($220) per barrel — the highest price since 2014. ""The situation in energy markets is very serious and demands our full attention,"" IEA executive director Fatih Birol said. ""Global energy security is under threat, putting the world economy at risk during a fragile stage of the recovery."" Last month, the IEA said global demand for oil was 100.2 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2021. Russia is being dealt more financial blows, with Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest pulling back on hydrogen investments there, while oil giant BP and Norway's sovereign wealth fund are also divesting from the country. Demand is expected to grow to an average of 100.6 million barrels a day this year, as restrictions to limit the spread of COVID-19 are eased, the IEA said. Besides the US, other members of the organisation include Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada. IEA members hold emergency stockpiles of 1.5 billion barrels of oil. The release amounts to 4 per cent of stockpiles, or roughly 2 million barrels per day for 30 days. It's only the fourth time in history that the IEA has done a coordinated drawdown since the reserves were established in the wake of the Arab oil embargo in 1974. The price of crude oil determines a big portion of what drivers pay to fill up their cars with petrol. With Australian petrol prices forecast to reach $2.10, it's possible some good could come of the pain wrought by Russia's invasion of Ukraine — including a faster path to net zero emissions. In 2021, the US imported roughly 245 million barrels of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia — a one-year increase of 24 per cent over 2020. Nearly 8 per cent of US imports of crude oil and petroleum products that year came from Russia, based on data from the statistical arm of the US Energy Department. In November, Mr Biden announced a release of 50 million barrels of oil in coordination with other energy-importing countries, but the measure had only a fleeting impact on oil prices, which have continued to rise. Stewart Glickman, an oil analyst for CFRA Research, said the release would only be partially helpful, because most of the reserves are light oil, while the US largely imports a heavier grade of oil from Russia. ""Refiners plan around a certain blend of crudes, so you can't always just swap out one for another easily,"" he said. Ms Granholm stressed the need to invest in renewable energy as a way to reduce dependence on Russian oil and natural gas.

168,These are the ecosystems Australia stands to lose in the next decade,environment," Science IPCC report: Australian coral, kelp, alpine and some forest ecosystems at risk of irreversible damage due to climate change Some of Australia's iconic and unique natural ecosystems may disappear for good if we keep emitting carbon at current rates, climate experts warn. According to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on the effects of and adaptation to climate change, Australia can expect more hotter days, fewer cold ones, more extreme fire weather, and heatwaves on land and in oceans under 1.5 to 2C of global warming above pre-industrial levels. Our changing climate could soon make it harder to get a mortgage on the Queensland coast. We had three properties assessed, with mixed results. The world is currently at an average of about 1C of warming, and, exacerbated by other human actions, this is already modifying Australian ecosystems, says Griffith University climate and environmental scientist Brendan Mackey. ""We know how the climate has changed in the last 100 years in Australia, and we have some evidence now for how ecosystems have been impacted by those changes."" Professor Mackey was a coordinating lead author for the Australasian chapter of the IPCC report, which outlined nine key climate risks for the region. Four of those risks focused on ecosystems at risk of severe damage — or even collapse — under climate pressures. So let's take a tour of the continent and have a look at what's at stake — and they're not necessarily the ecosystems you might expect to see. When we think of alpine regions, often the images that spring to mind might be the snow-covered peaks of Europe or the Himalayas. Though much lower, Australia's alpine regions host some of the most unique biodiversity on the planet — mountain pygmy possums, corroboree frogs, spiny crayfish, snow gums, and myriad plant species. But the short stature of our mountains is their Achilles heel. Many species have adapted to living in the cooler climes found on our mountainsides above 1,000 metres or so. As the climate warms, those animal and plant species are forced to migrate further and further up the mountains to find a suitable, cooler habitat. But there's not very much further for them to go, according to Professor Mackey. ""If you're in New Zealand, as you go up in elevation, they have real mountains with pointy tops. ""In New Zealand, the alpine vegetation can potentially grow uphill a bit, and any plants or animals that are dependent upon that habitat can go with it. ""But in Australia, the top of our alpine zone, there are no peaks above it."" The IPCC singled out Australian alpine regions for special mention in the latest report. There's predicted to be a sharp increase in extinctions in these regions as warming goes beyond 1.5C toward 2C. On the latest predictions, we're forecast to hit 1.5C around 2030. In Australia's tropical north, species have already been observed pushing further up mountains, according to Steven Williams from James Cook University. ""The lowland species are moving into the midlands, the midlands species are declining,"" Professor Williams said. ""A lot of the endemic [bird] species … most of them have already declined by up to 30 per cent, some to 60 per cent."" For mammal species like possums, he said it seemed to be the increase in extremely hot days that had been doing the most damage. ""The ring-tailed possums endemic to the area have already declined by 50 per cent,"" he said. ""Two other species are declining badly. ""The paper that we’re about to bring out on the possum shows that most of the possum species will be in really serious trouble by 2050.4 ""Some of the birds, based on their observed decline so far in the last 10 years, would be in similar deep s*** by 2040-2050."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. But so far Australia's southern alpine regions are yet to feel the real brunt of climate change, according to Ary Hoffman from the University of Melbourne. Mt Buller's mountain pygmy possum population appears to be healthy, for instance. Its key threat today, according to Professor Mackey, is logging. In the southern alpine regions more generally, Professor Hoffman said the biggest threat right now is from weeds and ferals like the wild brumbies. But the changes will come, he said. ""There is no doubt about it. There are plants you only find in snow patches, and they will disappear,"" Professor Hoffman said. ""Animals associated with the wetlands and the bogs will start disappearing; frog species like the corroboree frog and Baw Baw frog, they’ll be in trouble."" But he said it's the unexpected interactions between species that create the most uncertainty. Scientists suspect warmer temperatures and longer drought in the Australian alps are responsible for a boom in longicorn beetles, for instance. The beetles in turn are causing an extensive and sudden dieback in our snow gums — trees a few hundred years old have been dying en masse as they're essentially ringbarked by the beetles. ""That's the problem with climate change — you get these unexpected things happening,"" Professor Hoffman said. Speaking of snow gums, forests of southern and south-west Australia were also singled out as Australian ecosystems at risk of the one-two punch of climate change and human mismanagement. On the highest peaks and plains of the Australian Alps, snow gums are being decimated by a tiny enemy. Can anything save them from being wiped out? But not the eucalypt forests of Victoria and NSW that were decimated in the 2019-20 bushfires … at least not immediately. That's mainly because those trees are known as ""sprouters"", and store tiny buds under trunk and branch bark which are ready to grow out as green shoots should a fire go through the area, Professor Mackey said. ""So most of our native eucalypt forest is well adapted to wildfires."" The forests at risk are of towering jarrah and mountain ash, found in the continent's south-west and south-east corners respectively, as well as gnarled snow gum woodland and Tasmania's pencil pines. And each is affected slightly differently by a warming world. In southern Western Australia, winter rainfall would normally replenish underground reserves of water, which the deep roots of jarrah trees tap into to keep going over summer. But regional winter rainfall has steadily dropped over the past 30 years, and their subterranean reservoirs haven't been topped up as much. On the other side of the country, mountain ash trees are ""seeders"". Older trees can cope with intense bushfires, but seedlings must grow for around 20 years before they can reproduce. ""So if you start getting catastrophic wildfires more than two to three times every 10 years, that's faster than it takes the ash forest to grow,"" Professor Mackey said. ""And if you have a commercial logging regime that's keeping ash forest at a young age — so rather than letting the trees grow to be 400 years old, you're harvesting them between 48 years old and 46 years old — they're younger trees, they're more vulnerable, and they're more likely to be killed by fire. ""The more of these catastrophic fires we have, the more we risk going into a downward spiral."" More fires, more often, affect snow gums in a similar way. These trees resprout from the base, where they keep a stock of starches and sugars for this purpose. ""But if you increase the frequency of catastrophic fire events ... and snow gums get hit too often, they don't have time to replenish the energy stock they use to regenerate,"" Professor Mackey said. And Tasmania's ancient pencil pines haven't had to deal with catastrophic fires — until recently. Bushfires in 2016 razed swathes of pencil pine forest, and even six years on, large areas are not recovering well, Professor Mackey said. ""If it got hit by another extreme wildfire event like that, it's going to be in very serious trouble."" So what would happen if these forests disappeared? They wouldn't leave a barren plain. Rather, a different type of forest would grow in its place. For instance, if snow gums disappeared, they might be replaced by woody shrubs that can regenerate after fire quickly — something that's already happening in parts of the country. And this, Professor Mackey says, results in an overall loss of biodiversity. ""You lose something that was particular to a local environmental condition, and it's replaced by something which is more common elsewhere."" When Gretta Pecl started diving in the kelp forests off the east coast of Tasmania in the mid-1990s, towering stands of giant kelp stretched from seabed to surface. ""By around 2005, I started noticing changes,"" said Professor Pecl, now a marine ecologist at the University of Tasmania and a lead author on the Australasian chapter of the IPCC report. Different and diminutive kelp species started moving in while the long ropey strands of giant kelp dwindled. ""And when you consider the kinds of [kelp] habitats and systems that we had in the late 90s and early 2000s to what we've got now, they actually look like two different ecosystems."" Indeed, the IPCC report states ""less than 10 per cent of giant kelp in Tasmania was remaining by 2011 due to ocean warming"". The loss of kelp forests in southern Australia and south-east New Zealand — highlighted as a key risk — is already severe, Professor Pecl said. ""But it could be reduced substantially by rapid, large-scale and effective mitigation and adaptation strategies"", such as transplanting more heat-tolerant types. So what happened to the once-dominant kelp forests? As a young man, Puck Vaughan would catch fish among the giant underwater kelp forests along Tasmania's south-east coast. He later landed a job in a kelp processing factory, but then the underwater forests began to disappear. Giant kelp is sensitive to temperature and thrives in the cold, nutrient-rich water that laps at the Tasmanian coastline. But on the east coast, this has been replaced by water that's warmer and comparatively devoid of nutrients. This warm water is shuttled down by the East Australian Current, which has moved 350 kilometres south since the middle of last century, Professor Pecl said. ""That extension of the East Australian Current, as shown in the working group 1 IPCC report, is largely driven by warming over the Pacific."" This underlying ocean warming is separate to marine heatwaves — days-long bursts of particularly warm seawater. Kelp must also contend with overgrazing by nibbling fish and sea urchins that are moving southward with the East Australian Current. ""They literally eat kelp out of house and home,"" Professor Pecl said. ""We know that at the global level, around half of plants and animals, including marine species, are moving poleward … and changing where they live now as a function of climate. ""Effectively everything is moving at the same time, but at different rates. ""Connections are being broken apart and new connections are being formed … and the kelp forests around Australia are a victim of that."" By now we've all heard how climate change is going to kill a lot of coral. We've already seen several mass bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef since 2016. According to the latest report, we're expecting to see bleaching conditions on the reef at least once every five years by 2035, even if we aggressively cut emissions from today. That's likely to increase to every year by around 2050. Without long periods in between bleaching events for the coral to recover, mass mortality is a near certainty. At 1.5C of warming, the IPCC predicts we'll lose between 70 to 90 per cent of coral diversity. At 2C, that rises to more than 99 per cent. But the problem is far bigger than losing pretty corals. The corals are merely one part of a massive food web that provides nutrients for marine species well beyond the reef itself, according to Scott Heron from James Cook University. ""Coral reefs cover less than one-tenth of 1 per cent of the ocean floor,"" Dr Heron said. ""But they support more than 25 per cent of oceanic fish species. ""When we talk about punching above weight, corals are really punching above weight."" Losing 90 per cent or more of coral species is going to have a profound effect on fish abundance, including on many of the commercial fish species that we rely on. Then there is the physical buffering that reefs provide our coastlines. Bleaching-free coral reefs are expected to plummet as we head towards 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. Reefs help dissipate wave action, sheltering our coastal communities from the worst impacts of storms and cyclones. ""That's all the more important in an era where we're seeing storm intensity increase,"" Dr Heron said. ""We're not necessarily seeing more tropical cyclones, but we're seeing more severe tropical cyclones."" Despite the dire predictions for our reefs, Dr Heron says he thinks they're still worth fighting for, and that we need to make an equitable and rapid transition from greenhouse-gas-emitting technologies. ""The number of options and ideas that we have available to us are rapidly diminishing,"" he said. ""The question is: what are we doing this decade so that we minimise the impacts?""

170,"It awakened an environmental movement, but could it now be time to drain Lake Pedder?",environment,"  Lake Pedder was flooded 50 years ago for hydro power, but could it now be time to drain it? Lake Pedder is a special place for Melva Truchanas. Lake Pedder was inundated in 1972 in order to create a hydro-electric dam The movement to stop the lake from being flooded is often credited as Tasmania's first environmental struggle There are renewed calls to decommission the dam and restore the lake to its former condition Now in her early 90s, she was once an avid bushwalker, and unlike the vast majority of Tasmanians alive today, she saw the lake before it was flooded when three dams were built. It's also where she met her husband, the late conservationist Olegas Truchanas. ""You didn't have to have done it, or have looked at it, you just had to know that in the heart of Tasmania, you had something beautiful,"" she said. ""But like many things between then and now, things that were beautiful and special weren't treated well, weren't considered to be special, and they'd be destroyed."" Before 1972, Lake Pedder was an alpine lake adorned by a pink quartzite beach, nestled among untouched mountain ranges. For bushwalkers, it was a sight to behold. For the Tasmanian government, which dreamed of Tasmania's dominance as a hydro-electricity powerhouse, it was the perfect spot for a hydro-electric dam. When activists found out the lake, in the middle of a national park, was slated to be flooded, they took to the streets. Of the protesters, then-premier Eric ""Electric"" Recce said: ""These people can be compared to some degree with Dr Frankenstein, who was a very kindly man but he created a monster that he couldn't control."" The protests spurred what is now recognised as the first Green party in the world, and for many, it was a political awakening. It is credited for being the precursor to the successful campaign to stop the damming of the Franklin River. Dick Friend was inbetween courses at university when he decided to find out what the fuss was about. Like others at the time, he decided to take a trip out to the lake, to witness it before it was flooded. ""I didn't intend to be involved at all … but having got into Lake Pedder and seen it I then went to a public meeting in the town hall,"" he said. ""I began to question things a lot more. I became a more inquisitive person, more interested in the direction of society."" As the campaign to save the lake ramped up, Melva's husband Olegas travelled there to take photos. ""He had to do some teaching and bring back more information and make people aware of what they were about to lose,"" she said. ""There was a sort of incredulity that people couldn't possibly touch it because it was a park and therefore protected and therefore it wouldn't be in danger. ""We were very innocent politically back in the 1960s and we learnt the hard way. People who were going to make money and power and prestige from doing something very spectacular with our national park … we didn't believe they could be that brash."" In the end, the campaign failed. Three dams now sit near Lake Pedder: the Edgar, the Serpentine and Scott's Peak dams. Water from the dams flows into the Gordon River dam, feeding the adjoining power station. Combined with Lake Gordon, it is the largest storage of water in Australia and contributes approximately 13 per cent of Tasmania's total power generation. But on the 50th anniversary of the lake's flooding, there are still people who want to see the waters over Pedder drained, and the lake restored. Former federal Greens leader Christine Milne, who is now the convenor of the Restore Lake Pedder Campaign, said the timing was right, amid the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration. ""The average life of a dam is about 50 years. In the US they've pulled down almost 2,000 dams. We don't have a history of that here but it's happening all around the world,"" she said. The Tasmanian government estimates it would take $65 million to maintain the Scott's Peak and Edgars dams over the next 10 years. ""As the years go by and they age even further, there are going to be costs associated with maintaining those dams,"" Ms Milne said. In 2020, the campaign's divers surveyed the lake's floor. They claim the pink quartzite beach and dune system remains in place. ""The asset value to Tasmania of being a world leader in ecosystem restoration is immeasurable,"" Ms Milne said. ""Can you just imagine the global interest in Tasmania as the waters started to recede?"" Lake Pedder makes up about 40 per cent of inflows into the Gordon scheme, and accounts for up to 6 per cent of Hydro Tasmania's revenue. Hydro Tasmania said the long-duration energy that Pedder supplied was essential to fill gaps when wind and solar are unavailable, and to counter variations in rainfall. But according to Evan Franklin, an associate professor of energy and power systems at the University of Tasmania, if the government replaced its role in the system, the system might be able to do without it. Kathleen Petrovsky stood as a candidate for the world's first green party in the famous 1975 Bass by-election in Tasmania. She didn't win, in fact the party never managed to get a candidate elected, but its legacy lives on. He said Lake Pedder made up about 5 per cent of Tasmania's total energy production. ""Certainly from an energy perspective it's possible to drain Lake Pedder without impacting the energy system too greatly,"" he said. ""If you took Lake Pedder away you'd probably be looking to replace the energy with some new renewable generation and you'd also be looking to replace that firming ability and flexibility that the Gordon offers, perhaps with something like a large battery system."" But with the world looking to new renewable electricity generation and storage, draining the lake would be bucking the trend. ""We'd be running a lot less water through the Gordon power station, it would be an under-utilised asset,"" Dr Franklin said. There is also the question of cost. In order to replace the energy lost from Pedder, Dr Franklin estimates it would cost around $500 million, as well as the potential for $50 million per year of lost revenue for Hydro Tasmania. In 1995, the federal government held an inquiry to assess the merit of restoring the lake. At the time it was estimated it could take anywhere between $500 million and $2.5 billion just to revegetate the area after it was drained. Today, the Tasmanian government claims it is 100 per cent net self-sufficient in renewable energy, and says it needs Pedder to get to 200 per cent. ""We don't want to go backwards. [Decommissioning the dam] would be an economic tragedy for Tasmania and an environmental tragedy as well,"" Energy Minister Guy Barnett said. ""Lake Pedder feeds into the Gordon, it's the largest power station for Tasmania. This is incredibly important to our energy credentials in Tasmania. ""Tasmania is poised to be the renewable powerhouse of the country, and Lake Pedder is a vital part of that overall package which will play an important role in Australia's transition to a renewables/net-zero future.'' Andy Szollosi is cycling from Hobart to Canberra to raise money and awareness for the Restore Lake Pedder campaign. Like the vast majority of Tasmanians, he only knows the original lake through photos. ""I was mesmerised, I couldn't stop looking at it. It awakened something in here that I can't describe or explain,"" he said. ""We take so much from nature and I think it's time to return something, not for our own sake, but for the sake of the place, for the sake of the landscape."" Ms Milne believes the lake's restoration would bring hope to young people. ""Giving hope to young people in an age of climate anxiety is critical,"" she said. ""I see this as a project that would lift up Tasmanians, lift us up in terms of self-esteem and leadership … but particularly give young people something to be really passionately involved with.""

171,Humpback whales no longer listed as endangered after major recovery,environment,"  Humpback whales no longer listed as endangered after major recovery Humpback whales will be removed from Australia's threatened-species list, after the government's independent scientific panel on threatened species deemed the mammals had made a major recovery. Whaling drove the species to near extinction. However since the 1980s, when the practice largely ended, the population has substantially grown. But conservationists warn that while their numbers have bounced back, the animals still face major threats, including pollution and climate change. Environment Minister Sussan Ley said the change followed advice she had received from the independent Threatened Species Scientific Committee that the humpback whale population was now strong enough for them to be removed from the list. ""They looked at issues of climate change and they looked at issues of krill fisheries as well as all of the other circumstances of the population trends for the species,"" she said. ""Most of the listings I make are up-listings or introducing species and ecological communities on to the list for the first time. ""So it's really encouraging to see a strong conservation story lead to a species actually coming off that list."" Ms Ley said while the species had been delisted it was still given protection in Australian waters under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act, thanks to its listing as a migratory species and a cetacean. That status makes it an offence to kill, injure, take, trade, keep, move or interfere with a humpback. Marine scientist Vanessa Pirotta from Macquarie University said the delisting could help drive more focus — and funding — to whale species that had not bounced back as strongly post-whaling. ""There's been this momentum to celebrate the conservation of these animals, but then also reassess their listing in terms of the protection,"" Dr Pirotta said. ""Ongoing cautious monitoring will remain for these populations, allowing us to focus our conservation dollars into protecting other species such as the southern right whale."" But Dr Pirotta warned the delisting did not mean authorities could rest on their laurels, with whales facing a number of threats, particularly from climate change. ""Some of the threats that whales face globally include ship strike, entanglement in fishing gear, acoustic pollution, marine pollution and, of course, climate change,"" she said. ""Climate change is a really big one because this influences where these animals might go, where prey distributions are and unfortunately, a reduction in sea ice means a reduction in Antarctic krill habitat which is one of the primary food sources of these humpback whale populations. ""It's a bittersweet situation because you've got a recovering whale population, which is a great thing, but also we should be cautiously optimistic as well as to adhere to monitoring this population in the future."" When the department was considering removing humpback whales from the threatened species list last year, a number of conservationists raised concerns it was too soon. After returning from Antarctic voyages without a single krill to study, scientists had a daring idea: to flood an icebreaker and bring the krill to them. Among them was Humane Society International's campaign lead Nicola Beynon, who warned delisting the whales was short-sighted due to the huge threat posed by climate change. ""The recovery of humpback whales that migrate up and down the coast of Australia is definitely something to celebrate,"" Ms Beynon said. ""And the Australian government has played a leadership role in that recovery, so we understand why the government wants to celebrate, but we are concerned that the celebrations could be short lived. ""Humpback whales are facing the next threat that is coming down the line really seriously, which is climate change, and the predictions are that humpback whale recovery will slow and go into reverse."" Ms Beynon warned there could be steep declines in the population by the end of the century. She said a more precautionary decision would have been better than completely delisting the whales, and the government should consider changing how the listing system operated. ""There's definitely room to improve our environment laws to make them more responsive to threats that species are facing in the future, particularly when they're very well-known threats and well-predicted threats,"" she said. ""The present legislation is a bit clunky in that it's very black and white, and of course, nature is much more complicated than that.""

172,Warnings 'uncontrollable and devastating' wildfires will become annual occurrences in many parts of the world,environment,"  Wildfires getting worse globally with governments unprepared, UN warns A warming planet and changes to land use patterns mean more wildfires will scorch large parts of the globe in coming decades, causing spikes in unhealthy smoke pollution and other problems that governments are ill prepared to confront, according to a UN report. The western United States, northern Siberia, central India, and eastern Australia are already seeing more blazes, and the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires globally could increase by a third by 2050 and more than 50 per cent by the turn of the century, according to the report from the United Nations Environment Program. Areas once considered safe from major fires won't be immune, including the Arctic, which the report said was ""very likely to experience a significant increase in burning"". Tropical forests in Indonesia and the southern Amazon of South America also are likely to see increased wildfires, the report concluded. ""Uncontrollable and devastating wildfires are becoming an expected part of the seasonal calendars in many parts of the world,"" said Andrew Sullivan, with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia, one of the report's authors. The report described a worsening cycle: Climate change brings more drought and higher temperatures that make it easy for fires to start and spread, and in turn those blazes release more climate-changing carbon into the atmosphere as they burn through forests and peatland. Some areas including parts of Africa are seeing decreasing wildfires, in part because more land is being devoted to agriculture, said report co-author Glynis Humphrey from the University of Cape Town. But UN researchers said many nations continue to spend too much time and money fighting fires and not enough trying to prevent them. Land use changes can make the fires worse, such as logging that leaves behind debris that can easily burn and forests that are intentionally ignited to clear land for farming, the report said. Poor communities are often hit hardest by fires, which can degrade water quality, destroy crops and reduce land available to grow food. ""It impacts people's jobs and the economic situation that people are in,"" Ms Humphrey said. ""It's integral that fire be in the same category of disaster management as floods and droughts. It's absolutely essential."" In the United States, officials recently unveiled a $US50 billion ($69 billion) effort to reduce fire risks over the next decade by more aggressively thinning forests around ""hot spots"" where nature and neighbourhoods collide. The UN researchers also called for more awareness of the dangers from wildfire smoke inhalation, which can affect tens of millions of people annually as plumes from major wildfires drift thousands of kilometres across international borders.

173,Saving the environment and keeping more money in your pocket,environment,"  Unanimous Ballarat council vote endorses reusable sanitary products rebate trial Ballarat Council has voted in favour of a six-month rebate trial for reusable sanitary products in a move to prompt citizens think about their environmental impact. The reusable products include cloth nappies and menstrual sanitary products, such as pads. The council has proposed to offer households up to $100 dollars each, with a total budget of $30,000. Ballarat Council says it is estimated that each child uses between 5,000 and 6,000 disposable nappies from birth until toilet training. This is compared to only 30 reusable nappies being required for the same child. The City of Ballarat sends about eight million nappies to landfill each year. According to a federal inquiry into waste and recycling in Australia, 5.6 million disposable nappies are used nationwide each day. Deputy Mayor Amy Johnson said using disposable nappies is utilising ""finite resources"". ""I have loved driving this initiative in the hope that it will encourage more families across Ballarat to start using cloth,"" Ms Johnson said. ""It's important that we reduce the financial barriers to allow families to choose to use reusable products rather than single-use products."" Ms Johnson said she hopes to be able to extend the scheme if the trial is successful. ""We made a slight amendment to the motion last night so it's now $100 per category ... those categories are cloth nappies, reusable sanitary products, and reusable breast pads,"" Ms Johnson added. ""So, potentially a household could claim up to $250 dollars across those three categories."" Speaking to ABC Ballarat Breakfast radio this morning, Mayor Daniel Moloney said the vote was unanimous and modelled after other councils across Victoria adopted similar measures. ""We need to find ways of keeping products out of landfill, ideally, and that comes at a cost to our ratepayers — every time we put something in the ground,"" Mr Moloney said. ""There's now $30,000 put aside in our budget that can be used to compensate people for that purchase — that big, up-front purchase of cloth nappies and sanitary products that can be reused."" ""We will measure the results ... but ultimately what we are hoping for is less landfill."" Clean Up Australia's chief executive, Pip Kiernan, is fully supportive of a rebate and encourages other councils across the nation to adopt similar trials. ""We think this is an outstanding initiative that is to be congratulated,"" Ms Kiernan said. ""[Nappies and pads] are all single-use items that take hundreds of years to break down."" Reusable nappies and pads are becoming more widely available in regular grocery stores, Ms Kiernan is encouraging parents and those that use menstrual items to do some research. ""There's lots of different plastic that goes into that (disposable nappies); there's polyethylene, polypropylene, so they take a long time to break down in landfill. And they also risk contaminating our recycling,"" Ms Kiernan said. ""Thirty per cent of what we put into the recycling bin now, goes to landfill because of contamination.""

174,"Animals are more likely to go extinct if they have these traits, scientists say",environment," Science There are common traits among mammal and bird species facing extinction, scientists say When it comes to animal and plant extinction, humans are the number one cause. Whether directly through habitat destruction and overharvesting, or indirectly through introduced pests and climate change, we're driving what is often described as an extinction crisis. When invertebrates are factored in, some argue that we're in the early phase of the sixth mass extinction — the other five being Earth-altering periods such as the Cretaceous-tertiary (dinosaur) extinction, where more than 70 per cent of species died out. But what if there are traits that make animals more susceptible to being wiped out? Could that help us identify those most at risk? To find out, scientists looked at 74 species of mammals and birds from around the world that also had sufficient data on their phylogenetics, life history traits and conservation status. They found traits that many of those facing extinction have in common. For mammals, the results are probably not too surprising. But for birds, there are some factors that don't seem to follow a simple path of logic. Their findings were published today in PLOS One. For the 43 mammals looked at, the researchers found that generation time — the length of time to turn over from one generation to the next — was positively correlated with how endangered the animal was. In other words, if a mammal lives long and has babies at a later age (plus a few other factors like reproductive rate, survival rate and carrying capacity), it's more likely to be closer to extinction. Australia is full of weird plants and animals. And Dr Ann Jones is on speaking terms with most of them! Which kind of makes sense — a population of animals is going to take longer to recover from an impact like a drought for instance, if they only have a few offspring and it takes longer for them to become sexually mature. It can also affect how quickly a species or population adapts to environmental change. ""[Generation time] can be an indicator of how quickly species can adapt to climate change and other external factors, and therefore can affect extinction risk,"" said Judy Che-Castaldo from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, who was an author on the paper. ""So it is a bit surprising that we only found this in mammals and not other taxa, including birds,"" Dr Che-Castaldo said. Ecologist and threatened species researcher April Reside said body size appeared to be a key factor in whether Australian native mammal species were likely to be threatened with extinction. ""For a number of decades now, we've been able to say that if you're the size of an eastern grey kangaroo, you're fine. If you're the size of an antechinus (small), you're [mostly] fine,"" said Dr Reside from the University of Queensland, who was not involved with the research. ""But it's the sizes in between — the bettongs, bilby, long-footed potoroo — those medium-sized mammals are the most impacted. ""[They're the] mammals within the fox and cat eating-range."" The other predictor for mammal extinction in Australia is whether or not they nest in tree hollows. Tree hollows can take a century or more to form because they occur in large mature trees, or large dead trees that rot from the inside. But swathes of tree hollows in Australia have been wiped out through logging or land clearing. ""We have so few [tree hollows] across the landscape compared to what there used to be,"" Dr Reside said. For the 31 species of birds included in the study, the most important traits affecting their risk of extinction were reproduction and growth rate. And there was an interaction between those two things. Join nature journalist Ann Jones on an urban safari through Melbourne to discover the hidden world of the city’s feathery friends So birds that grow fast and have a lot of offspring were more likely to be toward the endangered or critically endangered end of the conservation spectrum. But surely birds that produce a lot of young would have a greater chance at surviving as a species? The researchers were unsure of why this was not the case, and said the results were ""surprising"". Dr Che-Castaldo hypothesised that poaching may be a factor in the decline of faster-growing birds in the study. ""It is possible that the threats acting on bird species specifically are somehow related to these traits,"" Dr Che-Castaldo said. ""For example, if the species that have high reproductive rates are also more vulnerable to, or desirable for, collection."" Again though, these findings relate specifically to the birds in the study. In Australia, diet is a key predictor of whether birds may be facing extinction. Bird species that eat grass seeds are often declining, or have declined, in Australia. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. In many cases, habitats such as open woodlands or savannah might appear to us to be relatively intact, but cattle grazing and the proliferation of feral grass species mean native grass seed-abundance isn't there. ""It's the altering of the grass layer through grazing and changed fire [regimes],"" Dr Reside said. ""Habitat alteration has impacted Gouldian finch, black-throated finch, squatter pigeon, golden-shouldered parrot, probably buff-breasted button quail, and of course the paradise parrot — the only mainland bird extinction in Australia was a grass-seed-eating parrot."" The researchers hope their work can be used to help us intervene in species at risk of extinction. ""We can use the relationships we found to identify the species that are potentially at risk based on their life history traits,"" Dr Che-Castaldo said. ""We can then focus conservation efforts to better understand those species."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

175,"Fossil fuel projects emitting above estimates, sometimes at triple the rate",environment,"  Coal, oil and gas projects emitting greenhouse gases above estimates given at environmental approval, new study finds One third of major coal, oil and gas projects are emitting more greenhouse gases than estimated at the time of their environmental approval. New research from the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) finds some resources projects are emitting as much as three to four times their original estimate, or tens of millions of tonnes of additional greenhouse gases. The research compared annual emissions data reported to the Clean Energy Regulator with estimates provided in environmental impact statements (EISs) during planning approvals. Discrepancies were common, with one-third having underestimated their emissions and some out by large margins. ""One in five of those fossil fuel companies reporting to the Clean Energy Regulator exceeded the emissions predicted in their environmental impact statement quite significantly,"" said Annica Schoo, ACF's lead environmental investigator. ""The projects that we found that were over-emitting by a significant amount were coal mines in New South Wales, coal mines in Queensland, we had gas projects in Western Australia and gas projects in the Northern Territory."" ""So, we're seeing this is an issue across the board for the fossil fuel industry."" Chevron Australia's Gorgon offshore gas project off the north-west coast of WA is one of the projects cited as having a major discrepancy. The ACF calculated an additional 16 million tonnes of greenhouse gases have been emitted between 2017 and 2020 from the project, noting that changed calculations for accounting of methane may account for some of the difference. Chevron Australia has disputed the research. ""The assumptions underpinning calculations used for the A-C-F report appear to be incorrect,"" a statement from a spokesperson said. Acknowledging delays in starting their carbon capture and storage system has impacted emissions levels, Chevron Australia pointed to its ""commitment to make good on this shortfall."" ""(This includes) the acquisition and surrender of 5.23 million greenhouse gas offsets and a $40 million investment in Western Australian lower carbon projects."" ""Chevron Australia shares and takes seriously the expectations of our community and governments in regard to lowering emissions and addressing the challenge of climate change."" Two of Whitehaven Coal's mines in New South Wales – the Maules Creek open cut coal mine and the Narrabri underground coal mine – were found to have emitted somewhere between 2.5 and 4.5 times the greenhouse gases than estimated during the approval process. Whitehaven Coal has not responded to requests for comment. Most state planning approvals don't have consequences for projects that emit more greenhouse gases than originally estimated. In addition, national environmental laws often don't apply as greenhouse gas emissions are not a ""trigger"" for their application. While some discrepancies can reasonably be explained, for example, by variations in the methane levels across a coal seam, the ACF wants more accountability where there are major increases in emissions. ""It is not that environmental impact statements should be able to predict exactly to the tonne the carbon emissions that will come from a project that is not operational yet,"" explains Ms Schoo. ""We actually want regulators who will be able to say, 'What you are saying you are going to emit, we will hold you to'."" In reporting their emissions annually to the Clean Energy Regulator, major emitters are subject to some regulation under what is known as the ""safeguard mechanism."" This theoretically puts a cap on the emissions of each project and requires them to purchase offsets if they exceed it. Australia could be left with $26 billion of stranded gas pipelines, according to a report that labels the country's investment in costly new assets ""incompatible"" with efforts to wean economies off fossil fuels. But in practice, the federal government has set the caps far above emissions levels so as limit the need for companies to curtail their greenhouse gases. ""The safeguard mechanism is essentially a way for companies to tell the government what their emissions are,"" said Ms Schoo. ""It is not being used effectively as a lever for reducing emissions or even asking for offsets."" Australian National University student Jackson Balme is one of eight students who spent hundreds of hours trawling through planning approval documents to support the research. ""Our government decision-makers don't have the accurate data to be able to make their decisions upon, which I think is incredibly awful,"" he said. ""They can't actually predict what the impact of (fossil fuel projects) is going to be because one in five are going to, mostly likely, massively underestimate what they end up doing."" ""For someone who is so concerned about climate change and its impact on my generation, those figures are unimaginable.""

176,Resources Minister reissues millions in grants to fracking company ,environment,"  Resources Minister reissues millions in 'invalid' grants to fracking company Resources Minister Keith Pitt has reissued millions of dollars in grants to a fracking company searching for gas buried deep in the Beetaloo Basin, just months after a federal judge ruled the grants invalid and ""legally unreasonable"". The Environment Centre NT launched a legal challenge in July last year, questioning the lawfulness of the Minister's decision to grant up to $21 million of taxpayer money to Imperial Oil & Gas, a subsidiary of Empire Energy, while they were the subject of court proceedings. The Minister was forced to withdraw the grants, which were designed to expedite exploration in the basin as part of the Morrison government's gas-led economic recovery. But Federal Court Judge Justice John Griffiths found the Minister did not have to consider the risks of climate change, as the company was only in the exploration phase, and rejected the ECNT's challenge to the validity of the grants program as a whole, which meant the grants could be revisited. The new grants are worth a combined $19.4 million, and will support Imperial Oil & Gas to continue drilling the same three petroleum exploration wells previously in contention. Mr Pitt would not reflect on the court's decision and would not be drawn on what is different about these grants. However, he said the government was issuing the grants ""under what is a valid approval decision under a valid grants program as it's being found by the courts"". ""We're getting on with the job of firming up the resource in the Beetaloo Basin,"" he said. It's important for the Northern Territory's economy, and it's important for Australia's national security and our national interests."" Australia exported 74 per cent of domestic natural gas production and 78 per cent of crude oil production in 2019-20, according to the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources. Mr Pitt said it was important to ensure ""Australia's domestic supply, in particular, is guaranteed"". ""What's very clear right now is that there is an enormous demand, particularly for LNG,"" he said. ""That's the reason there's been billions of dollars worth of investment in Australia. And we need to ensure we maintain not only our domestic suppliers that meet those existing contracts, but also look to support our friends and allies in their time of need."" Environment Centre NT co-director Kirsty Howey said the Minister should expect rigorous scrutiny over the grants and whether they are in accordance with guidelines. ""It's frankly a real slap in the face for Territorians,"" she said. ""The Federal Court findings were absolutely scathing about Minister Pitt's conduct in entering into the contracts last year, the court found that he acted capriciously and unreasonably in entering into these contracts. And they were set aside. ""Territorians in good faith didn't expect them to be signed again. And it's shocking, frankly, that they have been."" Ms Howey reiterated the International Energy Agency's stark warnings last year against new fossil fuel developments if the world wanted to avoid catastrophic climate change, and said she expected to see an increase in court cases challenging the public funding of gas using taxpayer money nationally and overseas. Traditional owner Johnny Wilson, chair of the Nurrdalinji Native Title Aboriginal Corporation, lives within 20 kilometres of the new fracking wells, and recently gave evidence to the Senate Inquiry into oil and gas exploration and production in the Beetaloo Basin. Rebuking the government's decision to subsidise large oil and gas companies, he said the money would be better spent on ""essential services our communities need, like housing, education, health and roads"". ""It is poisoning our water, our animals and upsetting the songlines that run across our land,"" Mr Wilson said. ""Aboriginal households could have [solar power] keeping them and their families cool and lights on at night. Instead they are living in crowded houses as it gets hotter and hotter and they can't even keep medication cool."" The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) questioned whether there would be a market for the gas, should commercial quantities be discovered, given the world's transition to renewables and clean technologies. ""The clear established global trend is towards more renewable power in electricity systems with grid scale batteries, and less gas,"" IEEFA gas analyst Bruce Robertson said in a statement. In a public statement to its shareholders, Imperial said the grant would offset 25 per cent of the cost of its exploration. ""The new grant agreements replace previous grant agreements which became void as a result of a decision of the Federal Court of Australia,"" Imperial said. ""The grant agreements are on materially similar terms to those entered into previously and reported to shareholders on 10 September 2021.""

178,'Just add water and it turns': Stunning views as Lake Eyre fills but more rain still needed,environment,"  Lake Eyre begins filling with water much to the delight of graziers, businesses and tourists Few rivers in the world remain as untamed and free-flowing as those that run through the ancient landscape of the Lake Eyre Basin. Recent generous rainfall over Australia's inland Channel Country is breathing new life into ecosystems and it's getting graziers and businesses excited for a big year ahead. Red dirt country has transformed into lush green expanses, cobbled with patterns of intrinsic river systems. Talia Ellis, a pilot and owner of a scenic aviation tour and hotel accommodation in Birdsville, has been flying over the lake for more than 13 years. ""The country is just a sea of green at the moment, which is obviously pretty incredible for such a dry arid climate,"" Ms Ellis said. ""It can happen quickly, but then we can have years where we experience nothing like it so we're very excited about this year. ""Just add water and it turns."" The rain has also been welcomed by fourth generation grazier Geoff Moreton who needs to feed cattle on his 526,000-hectare property. ""It's rejuvenated the whole place,"" he said. ""The feed, while not abundant, is growing quite well, but battling against the heat at this time of the year. ""All the cattle are in prime condition now, as in against mid to early December they were in very poor condition, and I was selling off at a rate of knots. ""I always say, 'when droughts come and I start selling, I either run out of cattle or it rains' and luckily it rained this time, so I was able to save a good part of the herd."" This year's wet weather quenches the ground after years of prolonged drought. While residents say it's been the best in a decade, more rain is needed before the end of the wet season to flood Queensland's three largest rivers that run into Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre. The Georgina and Diamantina rivers and Cooper Creek are the lifeblood of the Lake Eyre Basin. ""A flood is the ice cream on the sweets because once we get a flood the whole herd can live on the river country for about 18 months,"" Mr Moreton said. Professor Richard Kingsford, a river ecologist and conservation biologist from the University of New South Wales, has studied the lake for more than three decades. He said it was not just a pretty picture, but a globally significant ecosystem. ""It's a flood that's not quite reached the 2010, 2011 level but is getting there,"" Professor Kingsford said. ""You need enough fresh water in there [Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre] to overcome the huge amount of salt so that it's not just a saline lake."" But it's a free-flowing natural phenomenon that's facing increasing pressure from encroaching developers. Last year, the Queensland government quietly granted oil and gas exploration leases in the Channel Country to Origin Energy. Professor Kingsford said the bioregion was a major factor in keeping down the nation's carbon footprint and interference would upset not only the ancient ecosystems, but the economy as a whole. ""We regard the rivers of the Lake Eyre Basin as free-flowing because they don't have many major structures in their way,"" Professor Kingsford said. ""We are seeing more and more structures on flood plains with some of the mining developments."" Ms Ellis has more pressing matters at hand. Her organisation has been run off its feet fielding enquiries and bookings from people near and far wanting to catch a glimpse of the region in bloom. ""I think this is going be one of the biggest flying years that Birdsville's seen probably in over 10 years because of the interest in the lake,"" she said.

179,Floods cut off communities along Darling River for more than a month,environment,"  Darling River communities cut off by flood for more than a month Residents along the Darling River are relying on planes, helicopters and boats to get their food, supplies and mail after once-in-a-decade floods. Some residents have been cut off by the water for more than a month after more than two billion litres of water blanketed properties near Tilpa in far western New South Wales. The flooding event was caused by heavy rain in southern Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales late last year. Geoff ""Dingo"" Davies and his wife Fiona Lander are two of those cut off. ""It's been probably a month all up that we've been boating … we just haven't been able to go anywhere other than by boat by house,"" Ms Lander said. ""Flood is not a dirty word out here at all, it's a good thing … it's rejuvenation, it's replenishment of not just water in the soils, but the replenishment of the soils themselves,"" she said. Mr Davies grew up on the river at Marra Station, and his family have been involved with the property for more than 100 years. The journey to town involves travelling downstream in a tinny to reach their car before driving another 100 kilometres along dirt roads to Wilcannia or even further to Cobar. ""It's two hours a day in a boat to get out and back,"" Mr Davies said. He says he doesn't mind the unusual commute to do the shopping — unless of course the boat springs a leak. ""If the boat breaks down it's a different story, and then it's very inconvenient … I don't particularly like rowing and it's probably about 30 kilometres home."" While the extra time spent navigating swollen paddocks is a moderate inconvenience, the water has brought wildlife back to the region. Dozens of hawks, black swans and rare black cockatoos are enjoying the water's return. Mr Davies even spotted a scorpion at Marra Station for the first time. ""It's everything really. It brings you back, it makes you remember why you enjoy being out here."" It's a stark contrast from as recently as 2019 when the Darling River ran dry near Tilpa. ""I used to exercise my horses on the bed of the river, like that was my sand yard … and I used to give them exercise up and down the river banks because, you know, it was good for them,"" Ms Lander said. ""We just had no feed, we had twice-weekly dust storms rolling in, it was pretty bleak."" For the couple, the water will soak into the earth and provide enough moisture and generate enough feed for their 15,000 head of livestock for the foreseeable future. ""Green grass for a long time, and if we chose to we could be farming it, but we'll have a lot of sub-soil moisture there for a long, long time ... maybe 18 months,"" Ms Lander said. For those without a means of transport, like a boat or plane, the State Emergency Service (SES) are delivering food and mail. ""There was a total close to 200, on average there were roughly eight to 10 people per five-day cycle since August, September last year,"" SES deputy zone commander Mark Coulter said. The tiny Indigenous community located downriver is also experiencing flooding. SES volunteers are in place and will be monitoring the situation there for at least the next two weeks. Central Darling Shire's general manager Greg Hill said the Victory Park Caravan Park, which has been closed since late January, ""will remain closed until the water resides and the ground dries out"". Despite the floodwaters dropping, there's a renewed sense of optimism from residents who live on the Darling. While aware the river will run dry once again, it re-affirms to many the beauty of the region following more than a decade of trying times.

181,How three engineering mates built the most important Australian company you've probably never heard of,environment," Science How Brisbane EV-charger company Tritium made it to the White House, selling 'picks and shovels to the gold rush' It was a White House announcement that came complete with stars, stripes and the US President in a sharp black suit: an Australian company was building a factory in Tennessee. The beginning of an ""American manufacturing comeback"", Joe Biden told reporters on February 8, standing beside the Australian CEO in a rare show of support for a private company. And what was the company at the centre of this announcement? Who had won the ear of the US President? Tritium. Back in Australia, the news created only a sluggish ripple of interest. Tritium? Who the hell is Tritium? As it turns out, Tritium could be the most important Australian company most Australians have never heard of — an example of a successful homegrown business that's exporting a high-tech clean-energy product, rather than shiploads of ore, sheep or gas. Founded by three engineering graduates in Brisbane, it's quietly secured a large chunk of the global EV-charger market. If you ever use an EV in Australia, you'll probably use a Tritium charger. The story of where it came from begins in 1999, with a solar-powered car racing from Sydney to Melbourne. Built by UQ students, the SunShark was one of the world's top solar racers. Teardrop-shaped and three-wheeled, it operated on the power of a two-slice toaster, and could race for thousands of kilometres with a top speed just below the highway's legal limit. In 1999, it took third place at the World Solar Challenge. David Finn was in charge of designing the car's electronics. ""When I finished my undergraduate degree in 2000, I thought, 'There's all this tech that the solar car teams around the world are wanting to buy,'"" he says. ""It was a bit of a cottage industry to start with. We just started selling."" In 2001, he and two other members of the SunShark Team, Paul Sernia and James Kennedy, founded Tritium, a tiny company operating out of a shed in the south Brisbane suburb of Tennyson. ""We became the biggest supplier to the smallest industry in the world,"" says Dr Finn, who has a PhD in electrical engineering. ""About 80 per cent of the the world's solar racing cars were running our motor controller technology."" For the next decade or so, they plugged away in specialised systems, but kept their eye on a bigger prize: mass-market vehicles. In 2008, Tesla built its first Roadster sports car, which was the first all-electric production car to travel more than 320km per charge. The battery technology that would disrupt the car industry and spell the end for the internal-combustion engine was slowly taking shape, but the big car makers weren't listening. ""This whole time we're trying to commercialise the 120kW motor inverter for use in vehicles,"" Dr Finn says. ""But we were three or four guys in Brisbane, trying to sell to the BMWs of the world. ""It was a challenge that was a little bit insurmountable."" Then, in 2012, after years of hard grind, their luck changed. The company's 93rd product (with the first being the solar car motor controllers) proved to be a winner. Alan Finkel, who would later become Australia's Chief Scientist, was working for a Californian EV charging startup. He asked Tritium to make a DC fast charger. DC chargers take the AC (alternating current) mains electricity and convert it to DC (direct current), which is the type of power that EV batteries use. In general, AC chargers are the little boxes many EV owners have in their garages, and DC chargers are the larger, much faster ones for public use. ""He said, 'I've looked around the world, I can't find any DC chargers that I really like,'"" Dr Finn says. ""Three months later, we had a prototype up and running."" Tritium had got into making EV chargers at just the right time. The promise of EVs, which had spluttered along since at least the 1970s, finally roared to life around 2012, and with them came a need for safe, quick and robust charging systems. From nowhere, an entire industry sprang into existence. ""It was a little bit Wild West,"" Dr Finn says. Surveys show Australians want to buy electric vehicles, but they continue to languish at less than 1 per cent of new car sales. What's going on? From 2012 to 2020, global EV sales grew at about 50 per cent each year. In some countries, like Norway, the increase was even steeper, with EVs dominating new car sales by the end of the decade. ""We did well in Norway,"" Dr Finn says. ""In the Christmas of 2014, I was sent our first purchase order for 50 [EV chargers], as a Christmas present."" Tritium has now sold more than 6,700 chargers to 41 countries and is the world's second-largest fast-charging company. It has about 20 per cent of the European charging market, 16 per cent of the US, and 75 per cent of Australia and New Zealand. For Mr Finn, the rise of EVs hasn't been a surprise. Knee-deep in solar-car electronics in 2008, he and others could see the potential — the problem was that not enough other people could. ""People say, 'Isn't it so amazing what's happened?' And I'm like, 'I can't believe it's taken so long.'"" ""That was one of the biggest challenges — I probably underestimated the inertia of the automotive industry."" Not quite, says Jane Hunter, who was appointed CEO of Tritium in 2020. ""We kind of like to describe ourselves as the picks and shovels to the gold rush,"" she says. From 2022-26, Tritium estimates, all these new electric cars, buses and trucks (outside China) will need 120 billion kWh worth of charging. Tritium's projected revenue for that period is $US12 billion. Unlike petrol companies, its customers are not just service stations, but anywhere with the space to host a charger, from burger franchises to shopping centres to local councils. Late last year, Hungry Jacks installed an EV charger in Victoria. The maker? Tritium. That same month, in November, Ms Hunter told an Australian business conference that fuel retailers would soon face their own ""Kodak moment"" — a reference to the camera-film giant that went bankrupt with the switch to digital cameras. Electric vehicles are coming, and they don't need liquid fuel. That spells trouble for service stations. The comments caused a stir, with fuel retailers bristling at the idea chargers would kill the bowser. Ms Hunter says the change is coming, whether they like it or not. Car makers from Volvo to Toyota are rapidly phasing out petrol and diesel models and governments are tightening emissions regulations. ""Everyone believes that [the shift to EVs] might come, or might not come, whereas we're out there saying, 'It's already happened.' ""Whatever you might decide you want to do, the decision has been made without you. It's been made by the vehicle manufacturers and the other governments."" As Tritium has grown, Australia's EV sales have mostly stagnated. During the 2019 federal election, when Tritium's Brisbane factory was filling EV-charger orders from all over the world, Prime Minister Scott Morrison was campaigning against policies to promote EVs, saying they could not tow a boat and would ""end the weekend"". The government's EV strategy, released in November last year, pledged extra money for charging stations, but was criticised by industry groups for not including purchase incentives to boost sales. Australia's EV uptake is lower than in the US, the UK and most European countries, which have generous purchase incentives. Our 2030 sales target (30 per cent of new car sales) is also less ambitious. Australia's low uptake relative to other countries begs the question: Will it be left behind in the shift to EVs? The success of Tritium shows there are economic opportunities in being first and getting ahead of the competition. That's the reason why, on February 8, Mr Biden appeared alongside Ms Hunter to celebrate the announcement of a Tennessee EV charger factory and the creation of 500 local jobs. ""The benefits are going to ripple through thousands of miles in every direction and these jobs will multiply,"" Mr Biden said. Twenty years ago, Australia appeared set to be a global player in the solar panel manufacturing industry. Here's how we lost our head start. Up to now, most of Tritium's chargers have been made in Australia. The US factory will change this — it has at least three times the capacity of the Brisbane plant. There are no plans to build another Australian factory, Ms Hunter says. ""If the Asia-Pacific took off, we would go and take a larger facility immediately. ""Australia has the best sources of wind and solar renewable energy globally ... [and] Australian engineers are top-tier. ""I would hate for us to squander the opportunity that we've got. ""I don't think the opportunity is missed yet. But I do think it could be missed."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

182,"In the early '70s, a surf movie put Bali on the map. Fifty years on, the love affair continues",environment,"  It's consistently ranked as one of the top five surf movies of all time, but Morning of the Earth was once seen as a gamble The year was 1971. The place Bali. Two men stood on a reef, holding their surfboards, facing the ocean. They were about to surf a break no-one had ever surfed before. Its name: Uluwatu. The surf beyond them was a heart-stopping eight to 10 feet and it seemed, at first sight, that the waves just kept coming. The scene, which later graced the movie poster for Morning of the Earth, would become an iconic image for thousands of surfers across the globe. It would also become the calling card for Bali and begin Australia's love affair with the island. As they stood looking seaward, the man on the left, Rusty Miller, recalls that he was captivated, but at the same time aware that he had a much bigger task at hand: ""I was thinking, how do we get out? I mean, I knew how we'd get out, but keep in mind there was no duck-diving and no leg ropes."" To his right stood 15-year-old Stephen Cooney with a board not much bigger than himself at five feet, nine inches. Cooney's head was also full of thoughts, as he explains in his autobiography Unearthed: ""The villagers who gathered on the cliffs made clear their concerns about us going into the waves citing bad spirits and dangerous waters."" But talking to Cooney about the situation, he clearly wasn't going to be put off. ""All I ever wanted to do was surf, that was my whole mantra,"" he says. ""So the idea of paddling out in these conditions was really exciting for me — and Rusty was there, so he was great company, particularly on those bigger days."" He pauses at this point and then goes on: ""In big waves, you're always a little bit edgy. And I'd have to admit on that day, that first big day, I was definitely a little edgy."" There was a lot at play here. Above them on the cliff stood filmmaker Albe Falzon. He was the man who had brought them here. With luck this would form a key segment for the film he was shooting. Why did he choose Bali? ""Bali found me,"" he says, laughing. ""Asia was off my radar. I was a surfer, my focus was on Hawaii. David Elfick [his business partner] ended up with a couple of tickets. ""He'd met a surfer — Russell Hughes — when he'd come back to Australia after a trip through Asia. [Russell] ended up in Bali and what he saw was no surfers and all this surf … next thing, we were on a plane."" It didn't take Falzon long to be converted to Bali. ""Within a day or two, I said, 'This is amazing'. The people, the land, the ocean — It just blew me away."" As Rusty Miller and Stephen Cooney paddled out through the gap in the reef and the breaking waves, Miller was taken by the amount of life in the water. ""The ocean was literally teeming … there was a lot happening,"" he says. ""There were dugongs, sharks and whales and there were all these fishermen. There were Balinese fishermen coming out past us in their boats."" Was Falzon worried about the surf and the two people making their way out? ""No, I was totally exhilarated,"" he says. ""Stephen in his youth was totally capable, and with Rusty, he was in good hands."" For the Balinese standing on the cliffs, this must have seemed like magic. Cooney recalls taking off on a wave and hearing a noise coming from the cliff tops. ""They were very excited,"" he says. ""At times they'd be on the cliff, and when you took off on a wave they'd start yelling and then they'd yell for the period of time you were on the wave and then there was dead silence."" The sequences Falzon captured of the two surfing Uluwatu were coupled with slices of Balinese life onshore. There were fishermen pulling sharks up on the beach at Kuta and locals betting on a cock fight. All of them added to Bali's allure. And what an allure the island had. In 2019, the last year before COVID-19 made it practically impossible to travel internationally, 1.23 million Australians visited Bali. For the past two years, the pandemic has left the Balinese — particularly those who relied on surfing and tourism — in a bad way. Falzon hopes the situation will change when borders reopen and people will have work again. As the 50th anniversary of the movie's release approaches, does he ever have second thoughts about exposing Bali and changing so profoundly the way the people live? ""Ultimately it was going to happen,"" he says. ""It was only a matter of time before it happened. Surfers are travellers. I don't see it in a negative or destructive way, however, I had no idea how expansive it was going to be."" The movie, of course, would focus not just on Bali but also on the north coast of New South Wales and Hawaii. In the words of the film, this was ""a fantasy of surfers living in three unspoiled lands and playing in natures oceans"". Falzon was very clear about the message he wanted the film to convey. ""You'll notice if you look at the movie there are no cars, no power poles, no sense of man-made intrusion,"" he says. ""That was quite deliberate."" In that sense, it was an idea ahead of its time. It focused on the environment and the natural beauty it displayed. It showed surfers to a Garden of Eden, unspoiled by human hand. What you also see is a film without a narrator. For anyone used to American surf films with corny voice overlay and humorous sketches, this was something quite different. The music in the film tells the story. Falzon and Elfick had heard a song produced by G. Wayne Thomas. They went to see him at Warner Brothers Records and asked him to create the music for their film. For what would become one of Australia's best selling soundtrack albums, Thomas enlisted a who's who of Australian and New Zealand artists to celebrate the idea of leaving the city, living simply and surfing. The opening scene depicts a massive rolling wave filmed in slow motion at Winkipop in Victoria as the movie's theme song, Morning of the Earth — sounding like a secular hymn — tells the story of earth's creation: ""The forces of the universe and the elements of space, conjured up your beauty your size, your style, your shape."" How much interaction was there between the filmmaker and the musicians? Well not as much as you might think, says G. Wayne Thomas. ""I saw some of the sequences that were going to be used to open the movie and those sequences inspired the words for the song,"" he says. Of course, back in late 1971, as the movie was being edited and coupled with the songs, there were still questions. How would they get the movie to its imagined audience and how would the audience react? Falzon explains that they went to the major film distributors and offered them the movie. Rejections followed. Instead, they hired the Manly Silver Screen themselves. Then came a major poster campaign to let people know a screening would happen on the night of February 25th. It was a major gamble and on the first night Elfick, Falzon and Thomas held their breath and watched the crowd arrive at the theatre. ""I looked around and I had family, friends and every surfer I knew. It was a pretty amazing moment. The lights were going off but going on at the same time,"" Falzon says, laughing at the memory. ""That was a moment for me about how important film was. I didn't need to stay there. I went outside and G. Wayne was there [smoking], full of anxiety."" Inside the theatre, Cooney was sitting in the aisle. As the movie played he watched spellbound. His eyes, though, were giving him trouble after a day of surfing. He found trying to focus his eyes made him cry. When the credits rolled his friends took one look at him and thought he'd been overcome with emotion. He laughs about it now. ""Watching it, I had absolutely no doubts about the quality and the artistic value of Morning of the Earth,"" he says. ""Before I saw it, I didn't have any doubt whatsoever that it was going to be good."" Looking back at the scene and watching the movie today, it's hard to know how anyone doubted its impact. Surfers enjoy the surfing, but the celebration of being at one with nature has a universal appeal. It consistently ranks in the top five surfing movies of all time. The experience had a profound influence on all the people involved. Rusty Miller, having witnessed the Balinese Hindu spirituality, says it forever changed the way he experiences nature. ""Their Hinduism is animistic — so that trees and animals are alive with a spiritual quality. As a result of Bali, I really do believe in magic,"" he says. Stephen Cooney, who would later become a journalist at Tracks and witness the surf industry become big business, looks back fondly on the film — both then and now. ""I'm flattered to still be involved in the whole exercise. I was just one of the characters in the film. It was a real honour,"" he says. The final word about Morning of the Earth, though, should go to its creator, Falzon. He believes its message is still relevant: ""It is about the earth,"" he says. ""We are at a critical point. The end result is it's about the planet that we live on. We have to tread lightly because it's our home. It's a beautiful planet and I want to keep it that way.""

183,Ghost shark hauled from the depths with a belly full of yolk and an umbilical scar,environment," Science Rarely seen baby ghost shark hauled up from ocean's depths off New Zealand A rarely seen baby ghost shark has been hauled up from the ocean's depths by a team of New Zealand scientists. The ghost shark, which isn't actually a shark but a species of boneless fish called chimaera, was found in around 1.2 kilometres of water in an ocean-floor region called the Chatham Rise, during a research trawl off the South Island. It is believed to have hatched just prior to being caught, according to fisheries scientist Brit Finucci — one of the scientists who made the discovery. ""It sat in the palm of my hand,"" said Dr Finucci, from New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA). ""It was about 10 centimetres long. ""The fact it's got that belly full of yolk ... and an umbilical scar, it's probably only a couple of days old, but it's really hard to tell."" The larger species of ghost shark may reach up to 1.5 metres long, Dr Finucci said. There are several known species of ghost shark, which, like real sharks, have a cartilaginous skeleton. However, they're rarely seen because they typically live in the ocean's twilight zone beyond 200 metres deep. The researchers, who made the discovery while surveying commercial fish stock numbers, have to do more work before they can identify which species they've caught. ""I've got some thoughts on what it might be, but we really won't be able to tell until we do some genetics on it, some analysis,"" Dr Finucci said. Dr Finucci has caught ghost sharks before during survey work, but this is the smallest she's seen. Ghost sharks are thought to have diverged from real sharks about 400 million years ago, and today sit in a class called chondrichthyes with sharks, rays, skates and sawfish. Among a number of unusual features, the males have a tentaculum — a retractable sex organ that protrudes from the head, according to Dr Finucci. ""They've got one that sits on top of the head and a pair that sit on the pelvic fins. ""They have these really sharp, calcified spikes on them and the thought is they use these to grab onto the female when mating."" Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. But there are many things that are still unknown about these animals. Because they're seen so rarely, Dr Finucci says any new discovery offers a chance to learn more about them. ""Every little bit helps us learn at what depths they're found, what they're eating, what eats them,"" he said. ""Really it's just that basic biology that we just don't understand for ghost sharks. So there's a lot to learn."" Some species are known to live well below 2,000 metres deep. Ghost sharks are native to the south-western Pacific, mostly around Australia and New Zealand, and several species are only found here. ""[The waters around] New Zealand and Australia is a global hotspot for ghost sharks. A lot of them are endemic."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

184,Stephen's devoted $100k to putting river blackfish back into Victorian waterways,environment,"  Sending the Victorian river blackfish back home to the Curdies On the banks of healthy, flowing rivers, there's a highly prized catch known to anglers as slipperies, slimies, marble cod or greasies. But to Stephen Mueller, they're river blackfish (Gadopsis marmoratus) and he loves them like a family pet. In fact, the dwindling stock numbers in his local area has consumed him for the past 12 years. ""The blackfish, he's a top predator along with the short finned eel, so he's very important in the ecological make-up of the river,"" Mr Mueller said. ""Without those kinds of predators in the river then you get pest fish and other things getting hold, like mosquitoe fish,"" he said. ""The black fish love mosquitoe fish, but unfortunately the black fish aren't there to eat them."" Mr Mueller and his wife Sherryl have transformed their small property in Cobden into a fish farm in an effort to grow and repopulate river blackfish into the Curdies River. So far it has cost them their life savings and all their spare time. The Muellers believe that they are the first to successfully breed blackfish in captivity. ""These fish are hard to breed there's no two ways about it, but we've managed to breed them for five years,"" he said. ""The fish have low fecundity. They don't have many eggs compared to other fishes, so they battle against that,"" Mr Mueller said. After many years, the Muellers have finally been issued permits to release some of the more mature fish into the wild. ""I've got these 16 fish that fisheries have DNA tested and fin-clipped, and they've said the fish are fine to go back into the river,"" Mr Mueller said. They plan to release the fish in March, into pondage at the Camp Cooriemungle, which was once a prison farm. Stephen Mueller says that in order to catch blackfish in the wild, you have to be prepared to travel to the untouched places that still have good riparian vegetation and excellent river health. ""They're a good-eating fish with beautiful white flesh but you have to get into the most beautiful, pristine country that we have to catch them,"" he said. ""That can be a beautiful experience."" Mr Mueller hopes that one day, the river he grew up along, the Curdies river, will be closer to his memory of a flowing river full of fish and able to host these ecologically sensitive fish. ""I've heard old stories about people catching blackfish in the Curdies and they'd have to start throwing them out because there's too many of them. There must have been thousands and thousands of them back then,"" Mr Mueller said. Mr Mueller believes that the Curdies river is now empty of blackfish. ""Water quality has dropped and they're probably overfished in some ways from earlier on before we had some understanding of them,"" he said. ""My ultimate aim is to get a hatchery here in south-west Victoria for research and breeding here,"" Mr Mueller said.

185,"As temperatures soared to 40C, David slept in the stairwell of his public housing complex to keep cool",environment,"  From sleeping in the stairs to four showers a day, desperate public housing residents try to escape Melbourne's summer heat A couple of years ago, the heat in David Kerry's apartment complex reached unbearable levels. It was the height of summer, meaning it was common for temperatures inside Mr Kerry's place to go beyond 40 degrees Celsius. But this time it was so bad he decided to grab some sheets, walk out the door, and sleep on the concrete stairwell connecting the 11th and 12th floors. He stayed there for more than a week. Mr Kerry isn't alone in taking extreme measures to stay cool in Melbourne's public housing towers, where air conditioning is a luxury few have access to. ""I see people panting, old people coming out of their homes in their underwear, because it's too hot for them to put enough clothes on,"" Mr Kerry said. ""I've actually seen people taken out in ambulances in the peak of that hot season."" Many of the towers, dotted around Melbourne's inner suburbs, were built in the 1960s to house some of the state's most vulnerable. Residents said temperatures in the concrete structures could be well above what is measured outside on hot days. Soaring temperatures in the towers have been a long-running issue. Most apartments do not have air conditioning or ceiling fans, meaning many residents sought refuge in cooled common rooms. Residents say those rooms have been locked for nearly two years during the pandemic, despite density limits being eased across Victoria and a widespread relaxing of COVID-19 restrictions. Some are confused about why shopping centres and entertainment venues are open, but the only place that can provide respite from the heat in their building remains shut. In a statement, a Department of Families, Fairness and Housing spokesman said the rooms had been mostly closed ""so that they can play a crucial part of the public health response to COVID-19, including as vaccination hubs and health concierge services"". ""On days of extreme heat, these rooms are opened for use as cooler places for the purpose of heat relief,"" he said. However this has been rejected by several residents the ABC has spoken to, who live in different towers across Melbourne. They said repeated pleas to building managers to open the rooms had been knocked back over the last two summers. With the common room in her Kensington building closed, Erika Lodge said there was a mass exodus each warm summer morning, with elderly residents spending entire days in local shopping centres or pokies venues. ""Most of them go to the pokies and just sit there and drink coffee, because coffee you can get for nothing. Some spend money, some don't,"" Ms Lodge said. Ms Lodge considers herself one of the lucky ones. Last year, the housing department installed a portable air conditioner in her 12th floor apartment after a doctor wrote a letter saying the prolonged heat was affecting her health. But it was a double-edged sword, with Ms Lodge's quarterly electricity bills jumping from $100 to $500. ""I don't get that much money being on a pension, so like everyone else you've got to make the money stretch,"" she said. Peter Turner lives a few floors down from Ms Lodge, and has been recently diagnosed with chronic lung disease. With no air conditioning and windows that only wind open a few inches, he shuts his blinds and stays in near darkness during summer heatwaves. Even three or four cold showers a day make little difference, he said. ""I won't even dry myself after a shower on some of those hot nights,"" he said. Research published in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction last month found 354 Australians had died during heatwave conditions between 2001 and 2018, with most of those occurring indoors in older housing stock. Older age, socio-economic disadvantage, disabilities and the non-use of air conditioning were some of the factors that increased the risk of death, the study's authors wrote. Katelyn Butterss, the chief executive of the Victorian Public Tenants Association, said air conditioning should be mandated in public housing, bringing it into line with heating. ""If people have an air conditioner, they can make their own decisions about how to use it to manage their electricity bills. They're more than capable of coming to that decision themselves,"" she said. Sweltering Cities, an advocacy group that campaigns for more livable and sustainable cities, does not go as far as wanting air conditioning mandated. However its executive director Emma Bacon said properties needed to be safe and resilient to both hot and cold extremes. ""This problem is only going to get worse year after year,"" Ms Bacon said. ""We need to be looking at the projected temperatures when it comes to building safe housing, not the historical temperatures."" A Department of Families, Fairness and Housing spokesman said about 29 per cent of Victorian public housing had air conditioning installed. The department plans to upgrade energy efficiency in 35,000 properties by mid-2024, which will include installing cooling systems. ""Reverse cycle air conditioning is installed as standard in newly constructed public housing."" the spokesman said. New public homes and apartments will also have six or seven-star energy ratings, he said. ""The new homes will be more cost-effective to live in, minimising energy costs by being cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter,"" he said.

186,"Big four oil companies 'reneging on clean energy promises', with one refusing to invest in solar and wind",environment," Science Big oil all talk, no action on climate change? Researchers say they've got the proof The world's highest-polluting oil companies are promising big but delivering very little on climate change, according to damning new research published today. Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and BP are failing to meet green energy investment pledges and lack consistent transparency in their reporting of investments, the researchers say in science journal PLOS ONE. They say fossil fuel production was maintained or increased by Chevron, Shell and BP between 2009 and 2020, despite committing to, or in Chevron's case ""aspiring to"", net-zero emissions by 2050 or before. To reach these conclusions, researchers from Tohoku and Kyoto University looked at the activities of Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and BP between 2009 and 2020. They focused on these four because they're the highest greenhouse-gas-emitting investor-owned energy companies globally. Specifically, the researchers tallied the frequency that climate change and clean energy-related keywords were referred to in those companies' annual reports during that 2009-2020 period, and what each company pledged to do to decarbonise and invest in clean energy. They then compared that to each companies' actions during the same period — their investments and profits from fossil fuels, and investments in clean energy. Neither of the American companies — ExxonMobil and Chevron — disclosed the size of their clean energy investments for any years during the period, ""despite claims of increasing investments for low-carbon energy and technologies"", the researchers said in the paper. European companies Shell and BP disclosed sporadically, and the researchers took data for all four companies from external sources where it wasn't disclosed. The researchers concluded that accusations of greenwashing against these companies ""appear well founded"". Between 2009 and 2020, none of the four companies generated renewable energy on a scale that would ""indicate a shift away from fossil fuels"", despite all showing a significant increase in references to ""climate change"", ""transition"", ""emissions"" and ""low carbon energy"" in their annual reporting. According to the research, ExxonMobil generated no electricity from clean energy sources between 2009 and 2020. Chevron generated just 65.5 megawatts. Of the four, BP generated the most with around 2,000 megawatts, or ""the equivalent of around two large gas-fired power-plants"", the researchers said. In energy equivalent terms, this pales in comparison to the 2 million or more barrels per day each company produced on average during the study period. It's also at odds with the image these companies are trying to project to the public, the researchers said. ""Over the study period that we looked at — 12 years — there's been a big increase in green rhetoric,"" said study co-author Gregory Trencher from Kyoto University. ""If that was reflected in actions, we would expect in the same period, to see a big surge in green activity. ""That is not the case. For the entire study period … we actually see also an increase in fossil fuel production."" This is despite the websites of BP and Chevron stating that they support the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement; Shell's website says the company's net-zero aim supports the Paris Agreement; and ExxonMobil says it is  ""advancing effective solutions to address climate change"". Among the Paris Agreement's goals are to limit warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and to pursue efforts to keep it below 1.5C. We're currently on track to hit 1.5C in the early 2030s. The two European companies — BP and Shell — had the most ambitious clean energy pledges of the four, which the researchers still described as ""highly conservative"". ""Even with these very conservative indicators, [we] don't see much action, especially in the US,"" Dr Trencher said. ""[With] BP and Shell, it's really only in the last two years that we see meaningful action occurring, but that's obviously far from sufficient, and there are still contradictions."" Both BP and Shell met their targets of investing more than 1 per cent of capital expenditure on clean energy for multiple years throughout the study period. But they failed to meet other targets. Shell's investment of $0.9 billion on clean energy in 2020, for instance, fell short of its pledge of $1 billion-$2 billion annually between 2018-2020. The companies' investment data from 2018 and 2019 was not published, according to the researchers. A spokesperson for BP said that because the study was between the years 2009-2020, it didn't take recent ""developments and [their] progress fully into account"". ""In 2020, BP set out our new net-zero ambition, aims and strategy, and in 2021 completed the largest transformation of the company in our history to deliver these,"" the spokesperson said. In 2020, BP's new chief executive officer Bernard Looney claimed the company could get to net zero. He laid out a raft of measures, which included reducing future production by 40 per cent, or about 1 million barrels, of oil a day, and selling off about $25 billion in fossil fuel assets by 2025. A Shell spokesperson also said they had taken big steps recently that wouldn't have been captured by the study. ""Shell's target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society,"" they said. ""Our short-, medium- and long-term intensity and absolute targets are consistent with the more ambitious 1.5C goal of the Paris Agreement."" If both BP and Shell are to reach their net-zero emissions by 2050, Dr Trencher said it would be ""an amazing challenge"" given their continued interests in fossil fuels. ""How do you bring your fossil fuel products in the form of oil or gas to [net]-zero?"" Investment in ""clean energy"" by the two American companies — Chevron and ExxonMobil — made up less than a quarter of a per cent of their total capital expenditure. But the researchers urged caution even over these modest figures. ""We can have one company claiming that it's invested, you know, X amount of dollars in clean energy, but we don't really know what's meant by clean energy,"" Dr Trencher said. ""There's no industry accepted definition of this."" It could include research and development, business development, and controversial carbon capture and storage technologies, which made up a large proportion of clean energy investment by Chevron, they said. ExxonMobil has made no secret that it lacks interest in some renewable technologies, said study lead author Mei Li from Tohoku University. ""ExxonMobil is the only major [oil company] to refuse to invest in solar and wind. It's quite a surprising thing for me,"" Dr Li said. According to ExxonMobil's website, the company is ""working to be part of the solution"". ""ExxonMobil scientists have been involved in the forefront of climate research for four decades, understanding and working with the world's leading experts on climate,"" the website states. But ExxonMobil has also been accused of funding climate sceptic organisations, and promoting climate disinformation. Back in 2006, the Royal Society slammed the company for promoting ""inaccurate and misleading"" climate information. ExxonMobil said it would stop funding such groups in 2007 after pressure from activists, but was accused of the same thing again in 2009. Last year the City of New York filed a lawsuit against ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and the American Petroleum Institute for ""systematically and intentionally deceiving"" New Yorkers about the impact their products have on climate change. Similar lawsuits have previously failed. And ExxonMobil has been reticent to address climate change in its annual reporting, according to the researchers. ""Only in 2018 did ExxonMobil recognise, indirectly and weakly, the link between fossil fuels and climate change in its annual report,"" they said. ""This position did not carry over into the 2020 version."" But a spokesperson for ExxonMobil said the company had ""new greenhouse-gas emissions reduction plans through 2030 that are consistent with our support for the goals of the Paris Agreement"". ""Our commitment to emissions reduction isn't new; we have supported the Paris Agreement from its inception and made consistent progress on short- and medium-term emissions reduction plans, including meeting our 2025 plans four years early."" The spokesperson also said the company had ""long supported an explicit price on carbon"" and that a range of technological solutions were needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. ""Society is beginning to recognise there is a significant challenge beyond the roles that solar and wind and electric vehicles will play."" But it's not just ExxonMobil that has been accused of attempting to derail climate action. It's an industry-wide practice, according to Polly Hemming from independent think tank The Australia Institute, based in Canberra. She said there were plenty of examples in Australia where companies had campaigned against climate action. ""[In 2019] the Western Australian [Environmental Protection Agency] suggested that all high-carbon activities would be completely offset,"" she said. ""Woodside [Energy] in The West Australian newspaper ran a scare campaign and within a week it was ditched."" A concerted effort by the industry has held back action on climate change in Australia, according to Ms Hemming. ""I would say [fossil fuel lobbyists] have been behind the last 10 years of delay on climate change [in Australia]. ""There's a revolving door of fossil fuel industry executives and employees coming in and out of government."" The fossil fuel industry's assertions that they can continue to produce oil and gas with zero net emissions — described by Ms Hemming as ""a complete fantasy"" — allows governments to continue supporting the industry, she said. ""Our own government's net-zero plan — there's a sentence in there that says that gas and coal production will continue. ""No fossil fuel company is proposing to offset all their emissions. Even if they were, there wouldn't be enough offsets in the world to do that. ""It might work on paper, but in reality, the physics don't work.""

In response to questions from the ABC regarding today's research, a spokesperson for Chevron said it was difficult to respond without first seeing the report, but the company was committed to reaching net-zero in 2050 on its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions — that's emissions from its owned or controlled sources, and indirect emissions from the generation of energy it has purchased. Scope 3 emissions are those produced by burning the fuel by consumers, such as in vehicles. ""Chevron is focused on lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and seeking to grow lower carbon businesses along with our traditional business lines,"" the spokesperson said.

187,Native title holders and environmental group launch legal action over huge NT groundwater licence ,environment,"  Arid Lands Environment Centre and Central Land Council launch legal action over Singleton Station water licence The Northern Territory's largest-ever groundwater licence will be scrutinised by the NT Supreme Court, as native title holders and an environment group serve claims against the NT government and the water licence's proponent. The Central Land Council (CLC) and the Arid Lands Environment Centre (ALEC) have filed papers for a judicial review of Fortune Agribusiness's 40,000-megalitre water licence at a remote cattle station, 400 kilometres north of Alice Springs. The licence permits Fortune Agribusiness to extract 40,000 megalitres of groundwater each year from Singleton Station, an arid cattle property near Tennant Creek. The CLC and the ALEC allege the government was not following its own Water Act when it approved the licence in April last year. The CLC chief executive officer, Les Turner, said the cattle station's Mpwerempwer Traditional Owners hoped to see the licence overturned, either in full or in part. ""The Traditional Owners want the water protected … they want to preserve their cultural habitats,"" he said. ALEC general manager Jade Kudrenko said she hoped the legal action would shine a light on the Northern Territory's water management. ""We're also taking this action in resistance to a system that's broken,"" she said. ""This is an opportunity to shine a light on what is an unprecedented gifting of water in a legislative framework that does not protect ecological and cultural values in the Northern Territory."" Managing lawyer of the freshwater program at the Environmental Defenders Office (EDO), Emma Carmody, has taken the case on for the Arid Lands Environment Centre. Dr Carmody said the licence was the largest she had ever dealt with in her 15 years of practice. ""It's an inordinately large amount of water,"" she said. ""The largest groundwater license that's been approved in New South Wales — which is a very developed state with a lot of irrigation — has been for 15,000 megalitres, so considerably smaller."" Dr Carmody said her client, ALEC, would argue that Environment Minister Eva Lawler made a number of legal errors in approving the licence. The EDO would argue there were three grounds for judicial review of the licence. Dr Carmody said the case would allege Ms Lawler failed to comply with the region's water allocation plan when it approved the licence and ""applied another policy document"" in its place. ""The water allocation plan includes criteria which are designed to protect groundwater-dependent ecosystems,"" Dr Carmody said. The NT has granted its largest ever groundwater extraction licence that will eventually use 40,000ML a year. It has raised questions about the science behind the decision and the effectiveness of water laws. One of these criteria, she said, was that the modelled extraction not cause the water table to drop by more than 15 metres. In its modelling, Fortune Agribusiness's plan said the project could reduce the water table by up to 50 metres in parts. ""The logic behind that is that [in] some groundwater-dependent ecosystems, roots can't reach further into the ground or into the aquifer than 15 meters,"" she said. Dr Carmody said given the NT Water Act said the region's water allocation plan must be complied with, her team would argue the decision was not legally justified. In a statement, a spokesperson for the NT Government said it was developing a new, long-term Strategic Water Plan. ""This matter is subject to legal dispute and therefore we cannot comment any further at this time."" A spokesperson for Fortune Agribusiness said the company ""appreciates the need to follow due process and will be cooperating with all requirements"".

188,The fight to save WA's native forests has finally been won. How did it happen?,environment,"  How the decades-long fight to save WA's old growth forests was finally won For the past 50 years, forest activists have been campaigning to end native logging in one of Australia's most diverse natural environments, Western Australia's native forests. Remarkably, on September 8 2021, the WA State Government responded to activists' pleas. In what's been described as unprecedented in Australian environmental history, the state government announced that a massive change of policy would come into effect by 2024. New and compelling histories from Australia and around the world. ""We're going to stop logging in our native forests ... to preserve these beautiful, magnificent, wonderful areas for future generations of West Australians,"" WA Premier Mark McGowan said. Former WA Greens member Giz Watson says many were stunned by the announcement. So how did the decades' long movement to prevent native logging arrive at this historic moment? Bombings, celebrity protesters, and more than a pinch of passion and danger have all played a part. In the south-west corner of WA, an area roughly 300 kilometres south-west of Perth, there are huge stands of tingle, jarrah, karri, marri, tuart and wandoo forests. These trees don't grow anywhere else on earth. Botanist Joanna Young says the biodiversity in this area is incredibly significant. ""It is one of the most diverse areas on this planet and that's why it's been recognised as an international biodiversity hotspot,"" Dr Young says. But since the mid 1800s, these forests have been radically depleted by logging, clearing and burning. Now, logging will cease. The Premier says this will lead to the preservation of 400,000 hectares of unique native forest. Jess Beckerling, convenor of the WA Forest Alliance, says the decision to end logging after a ""very long fight"" is the result of people joining forces. ""When groups of people come together, we can do extraordinary things,"" she says. ""It takes grit, courage and perseverance."" McGowan's announcement is a bittersweet victory for Beth Schultz, a full-time forest activist since the mid-70s. ""The tragedy is it's taken so long,"" she says. Dr Schultz believes the forests of the south-west have been irreversibly impacted by logging. ""People don't realise we've stripped our forests of keystone species – for paper,"" she says. ""It's an absolute disgrace."" When WA introduced woodchipping as an industry in the late 1960s, it was the catalyst for activists like Dr Schultz to get involved in the state's forest campaign. The Wood Chipping Industry Agreement Act was announced in 1969 and the industry began operations in the mid-70s. The Act was a 15-year commitment to export 750,000 tonnes of woodchips annually from the south-west town of Bunbury to Japan for paper production. Giz Watson was only a teenager when the Act was passed, but she remembers being horrified. ""It put the destruction of the forest into a kind of industrial scale,"" she says. Forest protest groups quickly formed to combat the new agreement. But logging wasn't a new industry to the south-west of WA. For decades, the local mills had been central to the economy of south-west timber towns, employing generations of timber workers. The WA State Government saw the new agreement as an opportunity for further economic development in the region. In July 1976, very early on in the campaign, an extreme form of protest was attempted. Two hooded men drove a car loaded with gelignite to the newly opened Bunbury woodchip terminal. The pair held the terminal's security guard at gunpoint before tying him up in his car. They then attempted to destroy the terminal, although only one of the two bombs exploded, causing minor damage. ""What motivated them, I'll never know,"" Dr Schultz says. ""It was so stupid and incompetent and all that it achieved was a backlash."" The bombing of the Bunbury woodchip terminal was regarded as one of the first examples of eco-terrorism in Australia. The bombers, south-west locals John Chester and Michael Haabjoern, were each sentenced to seven years' jail. Neither of the men were aligned with the forest campaign movement. Despite the backlash the campaign received, Ms Watson says there was one positive that came from that extreme protest. ""It had a very galvanising effect on those of us who were planning further forest campaigning to redouble our efforts to make sure that what we did was non-violent direct action."" This non-violent direct action approach continued to underpin the WA forest protest movement in the decades to follow. A key example is forest blockades. The aim of the blockades are to occupy key areas of forest being logged and to prevent further logging by blocking roads and stopping machinery from accessing forests. In the mid-90s, when she was just 19, Ms Beckerling spent years blockading while living in forest camps in WA's south-west. ""It was three and a half years of an incredibly rich, but also very challenging time in my life,"" she says. Ms Beckerling says this form of protest was highly successful in preventing logging, but living conditions were tough. It often poured with rain and ""we would be … lighting very smoky fires under low tarpaulins"", she recalls. ""We were kids. Most of us didn't even have swags."" Outside the forest, activists in Perth were also playing a vital role, applying for injunctions in the Supreme Court to stop imminent logging operations and lobbying Perth-based community groups for support. The forest protest movement gained momentum in the 90s, when it became known as the Save the Old Growth Forest Campaign. Dr Schultz says a turning point came when high-profile West Australians including West Coast Eagles coach Mick Malthouse latched onto the campaign. ""He stood under this karri looking up … and this photo ends up on the front page of the Australian weekend magazine,"" she says, of one significant moment. ""To have Mick onside, Mick who was the folk hero in Western Australia, [many thought] if he thinks this way, it must be right,"" Dr Schultz says. With growing community support in both the city and country, the WA Forest Alliance gained political representation too. In 1997, Ms Watson was elected to the legislative counsel, alongside fellow WA Greens members Christine Sharpe and Jim Scott. ""You can't underestimate the impact of taking the campaign into the parliament,"" Ms Watson says. ""We could say, this is why you as decision makers … need to understand the public will in terms of protecting forests,"" she says. By the 2001 WA state election, the preservation of old growth forest in the south-west of WA had become one of Labor's key election policies. Just weeks after being elected as the state's new Premier, Geoff Gallop set aside thousands of hectares of old growth forest for protection. ""It was an incredible victory. We secured 230,000 hectares of really precious forest,"" Ms Beckerling says. But the fight wasn't over. The definition of ""old growth forest"" became a major sticking point. According to Ms Beckerling, if there was any evidence of historical logging in a forest, that would disqualify the area. ""What it meant was that old growth forests had largely been protected, but not fully protected,"" she says. The movement had come close to victory, but not close enough, and it was a hard blow for activists. Ms Beckerling laments that the Gallop decision ""set us up for another 20 years of fighting, with the wind completely taken out of our sails"". For the next two decades, forest campaigners lobbied the state government to end logging, more specifically, of all native forest, whether there'd been historical logging or not. Ms Beckerling has dedicated decades of her life to preserving the forests of the south-west of WA, so when the announcement came in September that all logging there would cease, she felt huge relief. ""In just over two years time, native forest logging will finally end in WA … that's an absolutely massive breakthrough, both in terms of policy and in terms of culture,"" she says. But she admits, the recent decision also brings ""a huge complexity of emotional responses"". ""I've seen so many forests obliterated, so many birds lose their homes, nesting hollows crushed under logging machines,"" she says. ""And it's in this time of [logging] finally ending that the grief and that feeling of having failed those areas, all catches up with you.""

189,Controversial cheese company fined over 'nauseating' chemical spill into Melbourne creek,environment,"  Fresh Cheese Company accepts fine for 2018 spill at Broadmeadows factory A dairy company behind a chemical spill that left authorities gagging over the ""putrid, sour and rancid"" smell of rotten cheese in a Melbourne creek has been convicted and fined. The Fresh Cheese Co was today handed an $8,060 fine in the County Court of Victoria after pleading guilty to permitting an environmental hazard at Yuroke Creek in Broadmeadows close to four years ago. The court heard that the alarm was raised by members of the public who noticed a ""nauseating"" smell that resembled sewage or rotting milk while walking on Ripplebrook Drive near the creek. The reports prompted the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) to send an officer who uncovered ""thick white sludge"" near the culvert of Yuroke Creek. The court today heard the odour from the liquid was so powerful that Melbourne Water staff dispatched to the site to clean it up were left gagging. Judge David Brookes said the Fresh Cheese Company had accepted responsibility for the spill. ""In all the circumstances … because of the effects of the pollution, I intend to record a conviction and fine the company the figure of $8,060,"" he said. Today's proceeding was watched by one of the company's directors, Geoffrey Sharpe, who shook his head when the fine was handed down. The company has struggled through the pandemic, exhausting its cash reserves, and next month will lose a multi-million dollar contract with supermarket giant Aldi. After receiving reports of the spill in October 2018, EPA officers visited the company's headquarters at Riggall Street in Broadmeadows and spoke to Mr Sharpe who told them that their equipment had been tampered with during a burglary. He told the officers that a switch which pumped fatty waste liquid from a holding tank was turned off during the break-in, causing it to overflow into a small hole between two slabs of concrete and then into the creek. The court heard that once the hole was discovered, the business immediately repaired it and installed walls to stop future spills, as well as a new security system and flood lights. But Judge Brookes was told that the spill had already reduced water quality in the creek. A freshwater expert also found that there were high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus which would have increased the risk of harmful algae, putting plants at risk. The expert also found that there were high levels of ammonia which could be ""acutely toxic"" to animals. ""In his opinion, there was an imminent state of danger to the environment being the flow of liquid waste into Yuroke Creek, and it had toxic characteristics,"" the judge said. ""Apart from this opinion, no actual measurements of concentrations were placed in evidence before me."" Fresh Cheese Company has a tenuous place in the Broadmeadows community. The court heard a ""small but vocal element"" in the Broadmeadows community do not want the factory in the street and had subjected it to burglaries, graffiti and sabotage over the years, including firing ball bearings at its offices.

190,Rampant plant growth due to  La Niña a mixed blessing for gardeners across NSW ,environment,"  Plants thrive during La Niña, but not without challenges for coastal gardeners In July 2020, Judy Hamilton was ""devastated"" after her garden was destroyed in an extreme weather event on the south coast of New South Wales. Regrowing the garden was challenging due to drought and bushfires over recent years in the area. Then, La Niña came to the rescue. La Niña is a weather event where stronger equatorial trade winds result in increased rainfall across much of Australia. Higher levels of humidity in Mollymook Beach has given Mrs Hamilton's residential garden a new lease of life. ""The rain and warmth from La Niña has meant the growth is amazing,"" Mrs Hamilton said. ""The birds are back and we are starting to obtain a little more shade. ""It's just a different, beautiful garden and we love it again."" The Hamilton garden consists of predominantly native plants, including lilly pilly, bangalow palm, tree fern, birds nest fern and cabbage palm. Mrs Hamilton said recent weather conditions had been favourable for vegetation on her property. ""It is green everywhere and we embrace and appreciate the gift nature has given the garden,"" she said. ""It's good to get the plants established and flourishing in time for the next inevitable drought season"" Liverpool City Council's environment officer Alexi Gilchrist said parklands across his local government area have experienced consistent and significant vegetation growth. ""As a result of the additional rainfall and warm weather conditions, the trees in our parks and along our streetscapes are doing well, while many more native plants have been germinating than expected."" ""The soft, leafy green plants are benefiting the most, including: grasses, groundcovers, herbs such as kikuyu, the native scurvy weed (Commelina cyanea) and the weedy farmer's friends (Bidens pilosa)."" ""The weather is helping newly planted trees establish, resulting in less maintenance for our tree team."" Mrs Hamilton said increased moisture, driven by La Niña had been a ""mixed blessing"" that came with several challenges. ""We work most days in the garden at the moment in an attempt to stop a jungle happening,"" she said. ""The weed growth has also been exponential and difficult to manage. ""Luckily for me this is not really a problem, because after years of working in an office, becoming a gardener has been a dream realised"" Mr Gilchrist said the council's groundkeepers also had mixed feelings about the increased moisture in recent days. ""While the turf in our open spaces is also benefiting from current weather conditions, its vigorous growth however requires more frequent mowing."" ""Broadleaf turf weeds such as bindii, flatweed and clover now require year-round management, compared to around five years ago when management was limited to a period from April to September."" Liverpool has recently witnessed a simultaneous growth of plant and turf pests such as powdery mildew and termites. ""There have been a few instances of insect-induced tree damage, where the trees are weakened and cannot support the increased weight of their foliage from their improved growth."" Heavy rainfall has become more obstructive to the ground crews' maintenance effort. ""Given much of the Liverpool local government area is on clay soils, which have poor drainage, access to sites can be limited for some time even after the rain has stopped."" Below are Mr Gilchrist's recommendations for managing increased growth and moisture in the home garden If you'd like to avoid the use of chemicals in your garden, there are other DIY alternatives to herbicides, such as sugar.

191,"Bidirectional chargers for EVs are finally approved in Australia, and they'll be a game changer",environment," Science EV chargers for V2G and V2H to arrive in Australia within weeks, after long delays A new kind of charger that allows an electric vehicle (EV) to be used as a giant home battery is close to going on sale in Australia, with the first commercial shipment to arrive within weeks. Unlike standard one-way EV chargers, bidirectional chargers can also discharge energy from an EV, which means they can be used to power a home (known as vehicle-to-home or V2H) and its appliances, or to export energy to the grid (vehicle-to-grid or V2G). This may sound simple, but bringing them to Australia has proven difficult. For years, a mix of regulatory and engineering hurdles have repeatedly pushed back the technology's rollout date. Now it appears the date is almost here, with Melbourne-based EV charging company JET Charge expecting a delivery this month, and a second in April. So how does a bidirectional charger compare with a standalone home battery, and when are they likely to be available to EV owners? Bidirectional chargers will cost about $10,000, or a bit less than a standard home battery. JET Charge chief executive officer Tim Washington expects that price will fall by more than half within a few years, as they become more common. EVs have three to four times the capacity of a home battery, so on a cost per storage basis, buying a bidirectional charger is a lot cheaper. Australia's solar boom was driven by generous subsidies. Should batteries be next? The downside, of course, is that when the car isn't home, there's no battery available for powering the dishwasher or storing excess rooftop solar. That said, ABS data shows that most cars spend the majority of the day parked at work or home. On top of this, the average car-owner drives about 35 kilometres per day, or about a 10th the range of an EV. What this means is that EVs should have plenty of time to moonlight as general-purpose batteries for energy storage and dispatch. Interest in the new chargers appears to be high among the small subset of EV owners whose cars are already compatible (more on that below). Some have been directly contacting university-led vehicle-to-grid (V2G) trials, asking ""when can they buy the charger"", said Bjorn Sturmberg, research leader at ANU's Battery Storage and Grid Integration Program. Mr Washington said ""limited quantities"" would be available for homes in April. The first batch, however, will go to major projects, including a trial run by utility company Engie, which will partner with a commercial fleet operator to test V2G charging in Australia V2G is a step beyond using an EV to simply power a home (V2H). Owners of electric vehicles in the UK can get paid for supplying battery storage to the grid. With V2G, the EV also helps stabilise the electricity grid. EVs have very large, powerful batteries, so the combined power of many vehicles is massive. If enough EVs are plugged into the mains with bidirectional chargers, and linked by software in a network known as a virtual power plant (VPP), they can be used like a very large commercial-scale battery. At times of day when there's lots of cheap solar and wind power available, the VPP directs the EVs to charge their batteries and soak up this excess energy. When demand is high, it directs them to export this energy back to the grid. In return, EV owners are paid for making their car's battery available for general energy storage and dispatch. For organisations that own lots of cars, this represents an opportunity to make money from idle engines. ""What we're looking at with V2G is fleets that stay stationary for long periods of time,"" Engie's technical director for green mobility Christopher Munnings said. ""Say we have 100 cars that are used for 9-5, but then after 5 o'clock we leave them parked somewhere and connected to a charging station overnight. ""We can discharge during a peak event and avoid having to turn on a gas turbine — we can just use energy from the car’s battery. ""Then we charge it up overnight when our wind assets are cranking. ""V2G offers the potential to be a very low-cost battery."" Unfortunately, not all EVs are compatible with bidirectional chargers. In fact, if you already own an EV, there's a good chance you won't be able use it for V2G or V2H. But that probably won't be the case for anyone buying an EV in a few years' time. The only cars sold in Australia that offer V2G right now are the Nissan Leaf and the Mitsubishi plug-in hybrids. Volkswagen says the cars it sells this year onwards will be V2G compatible. The Hyundai Ioniq 5, which is being sold in Australia, offers vehicle-to-load (V2L), which allows owners to run 240-volt power tools, appliances and so on directly off the car's battery (handy for camping). Ford's new F-150 Lightning utility vehicle will include V2H, but is not being sold yet in Australia. It's expected V2G will be standard on all new EVs by 2025. A three-year trial of V2G chargers in the UK, completed mid-2021, found that the technology could help EV owners reduce electricity bills by up to 725 pounds ($,1375) per year. That was about three times more than what the owners would have earned using one-way smart charging (i.e. charging the car when power is cheap). But the cost of the bidirectional charger was still too high, the study concluded. In the short space of one year, Annabelle and Alex have slashed the money they spend on electricity, gas and petrol to zero. Here's how they did it. Even after three years, hardware and installation costs still exceeded the energy savings. (Though there are other benefits to having a big home battery, including being able to run the fridge during a blackout.) The Engie trial will work out how much Australian EV owners need to be reimbursed to make them want to take part in V2G, rather than simply doing V2H, Mr Munnings said. ""When looking to sell the business model to customers, you really need the data to determine in dollars and cents what benefit your product will bring,"" he said. ""That's a lot of the trial — getting those details and information and demonstrating the technology."" The process of getting the Spanish-made bidirectional charger certified in Australia was a long and winding one. First, it had to be certified to Australian safety standards. This required a hardware tweak, which meant the charger had to be re-certified with the association that oversees the plug standard. That done, there was a final hurdle. EV owners are crowdfunding a fast charger in the middle of the Nullarbor — and it will run on leftover chip oil from the local roadhouse. The Clean Energy Council (CEC) maintains a database of smart inverters, which is used by distribution networks and other installers as a quick way to determine what's been certified as safe. But the CEC is still deliberating over how to classify the charger and hasn't yet added it to the database, Mr Washington said. JET Charge has decided to sell the charger without CEC approval. A CEC spokesperson confirmed CEC approval was not required for the chargers to be sold in Australia, but added that customers should check with their distribution network before having one installed. Mr Washington says he expects V2G and V2H charging will change the way we think about cars. Right now, EVs are cars that can sometimes double as home batteries, but if they end up spending more time pumping electrons about the grid than clocking kilometres on the road, maybe that'll change. We may end up thinking of EVs primarily as batteries, Mr Washington said. ""A vehicle will become an energy asset first because it's parked 90 per cent of the time,"" he said. Having a big battery that's easily transportable can also be handy, he said. Employees could charge their cars with free electricity at work and then feed the power into their homes in the evening. Multi-storey carparks fitted with thousands of bidirectional chargers would double as energy banks for the grid. ""I have no doubt the market for residential batteries is going to decline quite heavily as they're replaced by cars,"" he said. ""Why do you need a residential battery when you have three times the storage sitting in a vehicle that you've already purchased?"" If all of Australia's 19 million cars were EVs, they would hold energy equivalent to more than 10,000 Tesla Big Batteries, or enough to stabilise the grid and remove the need for large commercial batteries. Half a million EVs taking part in V2G (though not plugged in all at once) would have a ""noticeable effect on the grid"", Mr Munnings said. Given less than 30,000 EVs have been sold in Australia, there's a long way to go. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

192,Mosquitoes biting? Rub a millipede on your skin. That's what monkeys do,environment," Science Chimps have been seen treating wounds with insects. They're not the only animals to practice 'medicine' In a forest in the west African nation of Gabon, a chimp called Suzee plucks an insect from the air with a deft sweep of her hand. She kills the insect, but then rather than discarding it, applies its crushed body to a wound on the foot of Sia, her adolescent son. She's not the only one to do this. The same behaviour — applying a crushed insect to their own and others' wounds — is observed in the chimp group 22 times over 15 months. The researchers who documented the behaviour in Current Biology earlier this week weren't able to capture any of the insects to analyse, but hypothesise they perhaps contain a property that helps with wound recovery. If they're right, this is an example of animals practising a form of self-medication, also known as zoopharmacognosy. And it's not the only case we know about. What would you rather — being bitten by mosquitoes or rubbed all over with a millipede? For capuchin monkeys from South America, it seems the latter. Several studies have found different wild populations of South American capuchin monkeys and captive capuchin monkeys rub themselves with millipedes. The millipedes contain defensive chemicals, including benzoquinones, that have been shown to repel mosquitoes. The monkeys have been recorded applying the millipede treatment more often in the wet season when mosquitoes were more abundant, as well as sharing the same millipede around. In one study, when tissues soaked in benzoquinones were offered to captive monkeys, in the absence of any millipedes, they rubbed their bodies with the tissue and ""drooled profusely"", according to the lead researcher. While the hypothesis is that they use the compounds to repel mosquitoes, the problem, according to Bill Foley, who is an expert in the interactions between poisonous plants and animals, is in how we confirm these observations. ""The problem with understanding medicinal plant usage has always been experimental confirmation,"" said Emeritus Professor Foley from the ANU. He says there is some evidence in easily controlled species like sheep that they can self-medicate, but that wild animals are much harder to study. ""Obviously, there is little chance of experimental manipulations in chimps!"" The only Asian great ape, orangutans have been observed concocting a salve of the leaves of a native plant called Dracaena cantleyi and their own saliva. This forms a ""foamy mixture"", which researchers say the orangutans rub onto specific points on the body. Analysis of Dracaena has found that the leaves contain an anti-inflammatory steroid. Australia is full of weird plants and animals. And Dr Ann Jones is on speaking terms with most of them! When the research was published in 2015, the animals had been seen on 10 occasions to be applying the salve, and nine of those instances involved female orangutans. One explanation offered for the gender skew was that females may experience more arm strain from carrying babies while climbing. And the mixture was most commonly applied to the arms, more so than any other part of the body. However, it's only orangutans from a specific region in the Central Kalimantan province in Indonesia that have been seen doing this. Local indigenous people also reported using the leaves ""for the relief of body pains"". So does this mean the orangutans might have learnt from people? There's some evidence to suggest it's the other way around. Research shows that some indigenous discoveries of medicines have come from observing animals and by extension, Western medicine is also a benefactor of animal experimentation. A number of Native American groups use a medicinal root called chuchupate, or ""bear root"". The root is reported to help with various ailments including an upset stomach, and bears have been seen consuming the root after emerging from hibernation. According to Navajo legend, people learnt of the root's usefulness from bears. But it's not just mammals that are thought to engage in zoopharmacognosy. Red and green macaws are known to ingest clay, seemingly to aid digestion. A research paper in Biology Letters found that sparrows may be lining their nests with cigarette butts to help repel mites. Monarch butterflies — prone to parasitic infection — lay their eggs on anti-parasitic milkweed, wood-ants use an antimicrobial resin in their nests, dogs and cats eat grass to purge, and moths and fruit flies have been known to engage in what could be considered self-medication in their food selection. So if they're all doing it ... Precisely when self-medication evolved is not clear, according to Michelle Langley from Griffith University, who researches the evolution of human cognition. However, there is significant evidence in the fossil record that self-medication has its roots in deep history, she says. Dental calculus — calcified dental plaque — from 49,000-year-old Neanderthal remains in northern Spain showed remains of two plants with medicinal, but no nutritional properties. Extracts of the plants contained anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, and the individual in question was know to be infected with a parasite that caused diarrhoea, and to be suffering tooth abscesses. Bone fractures were also common amongst Neanderthals, and many survived long term after suffering the type of injuries common amongst rodeo riders today, Dr Langley said. Others survived without teeth and with significant disabilities — evidence of ongoing care from others. One of the difficulties in this field of research is that soft-tissued plants typically break down well before they can become fossilised. But if Neanderthals were using chemicals to treat illness, were they also using them for pleasure? While there's no rock-solid evidence of this, if humans are anything to go by, the chances are pretty good. ""There are certain patterns that people see after taking [psychedelic] mushrooms,"" Dr Langley said. Those same geometric patterns have been found in cave art in southern Europe from the Upper Palaeolithic period. Snuff, jimsonweed, betel nut, ayahuasca, alcohol and tobacco, and, in Australia, pituri, all have a deep history of human use as well. In Siberia, both reindeer herders and their reindeer were known to consume the hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria. One theory goes as far as to suggest that this is the origin of the myth of Santa and his ""flying"" reindeer. But eating the mushrooms raw causes nausea and other unpleasant side effects in people. To get around this, Siberian shamans would drink the urine of intoxicated reindeer. The urine would still contain the psychoactive ingredients, but be filtered of muscarine and other poisonous compounds. If Neanderthals weren't self-medicating for pleasure, it would seem they were out of the loop. Back in 2014, the BBC released footage of dolphins appearing to intentionally provoke a pufferfish into releasing its toxins. If facial expression is anything to go by, the result was intoxicated dolphins. At the time, the filmmakers described the unusual behaviour of the animals after playing with the pufferfish, which included looking skyward under the surface of the water, as if ""fascinated by their own reflections"". Again, it's very difficult to verify the effect on the dolphins, or their intent in playing with the pufferfish in the first place. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. But Dr Langley says dolphins share many behavioural traits with humans, including playing, carrying objects and having sex for pleasure, and she wouldn't be surprised if they also dabbled in psychopharmacology. ""Dolphins are pretty intelligent. They have large brains for their body size."" If it's the case that they're using the pufferfish to get high, they're playing a dangerous game. When provoked, pufferfish excrete tetrodotoxin — a potent marine neurotoxin — that is found in a number of aquatic organisms including some algae, and has been implicated in dolphin deaths. Tetrodotoxin is the same poison responsible for about 100 human deaths each year in Japan; an unwelcome side-effect of the local pufferfish delicacy, fugu. None of this discounts the argument that the dolphins are milking the pufferfish for a high, though. Anecdotally, dogs have been seen habitually licking cane toads (Rhinella marina) to a point of intoxication, whilst avoiding the worst effects of the toad's poison. But how much can we anthropomorphise here? Do animals really self-medicate, or is it a case of seeing what we want to see? ""They might not understand the precise mechanisms like we would,"" Dr Langley said. ""But they understand it helps."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

193,Fire-resistant hempcrete blocks bring hope in the wake of Bridgetown bushfire,environment,"  Bridgetown blaze demonstrates bushfire-resistant benefits of building with hemp In the wake of the devastation caused by recent bushfires in the south of Western Australia, a much-maligned green plant has risen from the ashes as an unlikely hero. Hemp, like marijuana, is a product of the cannabis plant but with a key difference — unlike marijuana, hemp has no psychoactive properties. Due to the social stigma surrounding marijuana, hemp is often aligned with guilt by association. It is a ruling that is wholly undeserved. The uses of hemp include, but are not limited to food, oil, fibre for clothing and material, agricultural products, and construction. Iggy Van from WA's South West makes his living working with the plant to produce hempcrete blocks. Given the severity of the fires that roared through the area last week he had no choice but to flee as the brutal bushfire tore through his business. However, once the smoke had settled, Mr Van noticed his stock of cured hemp blocks had been largely unaffected by the flames, indicating they possess considerable fire-resistant qualities. ""The blocks that were made prior to Christmas have not been touched at all,"" Mr Van said. The hempcrete blocks are made from hemp hurd, the woody centre of the hemp stalk, along with a combination of other materials including lime and water, and take around eight weeks to fully cure. Mr Van said the knowledge that hemp-based building materials display resistance to fire was not new, but to have seen it demonstrated in a real bushfire scenario was incredibly encouraging. ""We've got tests that we do where we use a blow torch that we put on the blocks and the blocks don't combust,"" he said. ""They get glowing red, you can put your hand on the other side, they're very well insulated, but the blocks will not burn once they are cured."" Fire-resistance testing of hemp-based industrial products is also being conducted in other countries with promising results. The use of hemp for building dates back centuries, but has not been used until recently in Australia since it was banned early in the 20th century. ""It's starting to come back and it's great to see there is a change happening in the use of sustainable building materials,"" Mr Van said. He said he believed that houses built from hempcrete blocks would have a far greater chance of surviving a bushfire than houses built using other traditional materials. President of the Australian Hemp Council, Tim Schmidt, echoed the sentiments on hempcrete's fire-resistant properties. ""It's a perfect material to be using in bushfire-prone areas,"" he said. Mr Schmidt explained that fire resistance was not the only property that made hempcrete an attractive alternative to conventional building materials. ""There's also its insulation capacity and the fact that it breathes, it won't contain mould, and the acoustics in a hemp house are amazing,"" he said. ""It actually absorbs carbon rather than exudes carbon such as [materials like] concrete."" In Mr Schmidt's opinion, the primary reason why hemp was not regularly used in the building industry is the current cost of production. ""The problem here is the chicken and the egg factor,"" he said. ""There is a requirement of significant investment in infrastructure to be able to make the product more economically accessible."" In the meantime, however, those in the hemp industry say they would continue to sing the praises of the vilified plant that brought hope in a time of significant loss. Reflecting on the fire, Mr Van said ""to actually see this [bushfire resistance] happen was really the silver lining in this incident for us."" ""The pallets have burned but the blocks themselves did not, which is a great story for us,"" he said.

194,SpaceX establishing satellite gateway in Fiji to restore internet access to Tonga,environment,"  Billionaire Elon Musk is helping restore Tonga's internet access after a volcanic eruption and tsunami cut off the South Pacific nation more than three weeks ago, according to officials, with repairs on an undersea cable proving more difficult than first thought. The tsunami triggered by the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'pai volcano severed the sole fibre-optic cable that connects Tonga to the rest of the world and most people remain without reliable connections. But with Mr Musk's involvement, there was hope that better connectivity would be restored soon via a satellite option. A top official in neighbouring Fiji tweeted that a team from Mr Musk's SpaceX company was in Fiji establishing a station that would help reconnect Tonga through SpaceX satellites. Tonga's internet could be down for more than two weeks after a violent volcanic eruption cut the kingdom's only undersea communications cable. SpaceX runs a network of nearly 2,000 low-orbit satellites called Starlink, which provides internet service to remote places around the world. Fiji's Acting Prime Minister and Attorney-General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum tweeted about the SpaceX work, saying the volcano's shock wave had ""shattered Tonga's internet connection, adding days of gut-wrenching uncertainty to disaster assessments."" A spokeswoman for Mr Sayed-Khaiyum said on Wednesday she was waiting for more information about the Starlink project before providing further details. SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. The Starlink internet communications network took a hit earlier this month after a geomagnetic storm, triggered by a large burst of radiation from the Sun, disabled 40 of the 49 newly launched satellites. New Zealand MP Dr Shane Reti wrote to Mr Musk in the wake of the volcano and tsunami, and asked the entrepreneur to provide urgent internet communication to Tonga. Earlier this month, Dr Reti tweeted to say he was ""very pleased"" that SpaceX was in Fiji to work on the gateway. Tonga Cable had warned that restoration of the undersea cable, which suffered two breaks from the volcano, could take a weeks with poor access to the site extending delays. It comes as Tonga, which had avoided the COVID-19 pandemic for more than two years, finds itself in the midst of an outbreak with new infections growing rapidly after the virus was apparently brought in by foreign military crews aboard ships and planes delivering critical aid after the volcanic eruption. Many Tongans are now in lockdown with their communications severely restricted due to the severed undersea cable. A top Defence Force officer says the Australian navy vessel HMAS Adelaide was not responsible for the emerging COVID-19 outbreak which sent Tonga into lockdown. Three people were confirmed killed in the January 15 eruption of the massive undersea volcano and the resulting tsunami, and several small settlements in outlying islands were wiped out and a thick layer of volcanic ash that blanketed the main island tainted much of the drinking water. With many displaced people in the aftermath of the eruption, an already fragile health care system and the isolation of the islands, the outbreak is a particular cause for concern, said Katie Greenwood, the head of delegation in the Pacific for the International Red Cross. ""Resourcing community health and primary health facilities, especially in remote locations, is extremely challenging,"" she said. ""COVID most certainly presents a threat to these systems and to vulnerable people who may not access the level of care required.""

195,Chaotic sights leave 'crab cam' viewers pinching themselves,environment,"  Crab cam reveals a 'hectic' underwater world off Adelaide's metropolitan beaches An octopus attacking a blue swimmer crab over bait, a squid changing colours as it tries to steal the lot; these are some of the scenes being captured off Adelaide's beaches to create an unlikely social media hit. Kayak fisher Andy Burnell has been attaching a camera to bait that he places on the ocean floor, between 500 metres and a kilometre off Henley Beach. ""I've been surprised by all the different things I've picked up along the way; the other fish, and the squid and the octopus,"" he said. ""What amazed me was the grid pattern the squid displays as it first comes in. ""It's got perfect squares all over it and then it turns a dark colour and starts going for the bait — it's right in front of the camera as the crab's trying to pincer it."" The ""hectic"" nature of blue swimmer crabs too has been startling, in particular their aggressive nature as they attack the camera and jostle for bait, having been swept into a frenzy. ""Once they smell the bait in the water, they just come flying in,"" Mr Burnell said. ""It's all go."" Mr Burnell, who has a background in marine biology, said he had the idea to submerge a camera with his crab bait several years ago because he was curious about what was ""going on while I'm fishing"". He originally posted the footage to his personal social media page, but a video shared to a public page resulted in thousands of views. ""It's entertaining, I think, especially for people like crab fishers, because a lot of people fish but don't spend time underwater,"" Mr Burnell said. He subsequently set up a public page dubbed Crab.e.cam where, after a month, his videos are already receiving tens of thousands of views, including more than 50,000 for a video entitled Squid Games. ""I find a lot of people are just stoked to see stuff they wouldn't normally see along here,"" Mr Burnell said. ""It's important because people think, 'It's a metro beach, it's sand, there's not much there', when in fact there's a lot there and it's very close. ""If that makes people think about the marine environment, then I'm happy about it."" Asked if the close contact footage had affected his taste for blue swimmer crabs, Mr Burnell, who is also a scuba and free diver, said it had not. ""The more you know about things and the more you see them, the less likely you want to eat them because you say, 'Oh, their lives are a lot more complicated than you think, and they've got more abilities', or for whatever reason,"" he said. ""But blue crabs are a short-lived, highly productive species that you can fish quite sustainably. ""And the other thing is, if you get to watch some of these things, all these creatures live on the edge every day. ""They turn their eye for one minute and that's it, they're gone; a predator's got them, and that's just the way it is.""

196,'Shocking sight' as 'thousands' of dead fish wash up along Parramatta River,environment,"  Investigations underway after 'thousands' of dead fish wash up along Parramatta River Environment authorities are investigating the death of ""thousands"" of fish after they washed up on the shores of several locations in Western Sydney. The most recent fish kill event took place under Rydalmere Bridge on the Parramatta River on February 6. Chris Bahjat, who regularly fishes along the Parramatta River, described the incident as unique. ""I've seen a few fish kills but not like this,"" the 33-year-old plumber from Merrylands said. ""Literally, thousands of thousands of dead fish, everywhere you walk, a metre apart. ""You fish with the system all your life, you watch water quality slowly improve, and then it's disappointing when you see that many fish dying."" Mr Bahjat said he saw fish of all sizes belly up, including bream, flathead, whiting, luderick, herring, puffer fish and prawns. Parramatta councillor Kellie Darley described the river as littered and under stress. ""It's a shocking sight, with all sorts of dead fish … along the whole Rydalmere foreshore,"" she said in a Facebook post dated February 6. ""Given the tides, it's unlikely that they will be washed back into the river so it's going to get stinky along here."" The NSW Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) began clearing some of the dead fish yesterday but the ABC found leftover fish and fish parts were producing strong odours as they began to rot. The EPA's director regulatory operations, James Goodwin, confirmed the agency had received numerous reports in recent days across several sites including Rydalmere, Ermington and Homebush Bay. Mr Goodwin said it was distressing to see about 4,000 fish dead at one site alone. Last week, on February 3, they were alerted to the first incident at Haslams Creek in Sydney Olympic Park, a body of water that connects to Parramatta River via Homebush Bay. The EPA's early investigations suggest that low oxygen levels — likely caused by a high-density storm — were behind the events and not water quality. ""These events occur from time to time. They’re not particularly common but it’s a combination of factors [such as] a build up [of[ organic matter like leaf litter in drains and that sort of thing,"" Mr Goodwin said. ""A high-intensity storm can come and wash that into the waterways. This then starts to decompose and suck the oxygen out of the water. ""And that presents problems for the fish in terms of getting their own oxygen."" At Haslams Creek, chemical pollution was ruled out as a possible cause. Mr Goodwin said water samples showed conditions there had improved and the sighting of ""some large fish"" was ""promising"". Building a picture of the oxygen levels at different parts of the river to prevent another event was the EPA's main focus, Mr Goodin said. The clean-up is ongoing, with Parramatta Council working with other agencies around the Rydalmere area. The Department of Primary Industries said fish kills are more common in summer and follow sudden changes in temperatures. Professor Joy Becker, an expert in Aquatic Animal Health and Production at the University of Sydney, said the kills occurred because the water conditions didn't strike the right balance to sustain fish life. ""When the water quality drops, it compromises the physiology of the fish, and if the decline in water quality is too much or too prolonged, it will lead to death,"" she said. ""A lack of oxygen or sudden and severe changes in water temperatures are often the most common causes, but also contamination with chemicals are common - or a combination of all of these factors.""

197,The mystery of a giant sponge garden deep under the Arctic ice has been solved,environment," Science Giant sponge gardens discovered on the peaks of extinct volcanoes under Arctic sea ice Researchers have discovered the secret to survival of ""massive"" sponge gardens thriving on top of a ridge of extinct volcanoes beneath the ocean, 350 kilometres from the North Pole. It's a region permanently covered in sea ice in one of the most oligotrophic seas on the planet. An oligotrophic sea is one generally devoid of plant life and very high in dissolved oxygen. Though the scientists found the sponges a few years ago, they weren't able to figure out how they were living in such a hostile environment. But in a paper published today in Nature Communications, they reveal that the sponges survive by getting nutrients from dead sea life that once inhabited the seamounts, according to lead author Teresa Morganti from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology. ""The extinct community was mostly composed of tubeworms and other polychaetes [bristle worms],"" Dr Morganti said. So how was there a community of animals living there before, and what happened to them? The researchers concluded that there was an underwater seep of gases like sulfide and methane from the volcanoes, until around 2,000 to 3,000 years ago. ""The previous community … relied on the chemical compounds from the seepage as energy and food sources,"" Dr Morganti said. ""Once the volcanoes' activity ceased, [they] died out."" But the sponges inhabiting the area today have a microbial symbiont — a micro-organism that can extract carbon and nitrogen from the bodies of the animals that once lived there. In doing so, these microbial symbionts provide nutrients to the sponges, and the sponges in turn provide structure, and also further nutrients to their symbionts as they filter the passing water. ""Both benefit from each other,"" Dr Morganti said. The find is the most northerly sponge garden ever discovered, the scientists said. It's also the ""densest sponge community found in the Boreal-Arctic regions"", according to Dr Morganti. The seamounts consist of three extinct volcanic peaks, known collectively as the Langseth Ridge. The ridge is about 125 kilometres long with the largest peak rising 2,500 metres off the seafloor to about 570 metres below the ocean surface. The first sponge from the area was ""casually"" collected back in 2011, and a proper expedition of the seamount was launched in 2016. That expedition discovered sponge gardens covering an area more than 35 kilometres long and  nearly 10 kilometres across at their widest point. But scientists then had to answer the question of how an area that should be virtually devoid of life was supporting such a rich diversity. ""Our study here was focused on solving the mystery around the food source,"" Dr Morganti said. ""It took quite a while because we tested so many different hypotheses and used very novel methods in dating and identifying the food web structure, and the symbionts and their functions."" Along with the sponges, the researchers identified shrimp, starfish, and soft corals. They estimated around 60 species are inhabiting the seamounts in all. But the physical conditions that have led to the formation of this unique environment are going to change quite dramatically. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. The IPCC predicts that at 2 degrees Celsius of warming, the Arctic will experience ice-free summers around once every 10 years. More sunlight penetrating the ocean could lead to an increase in the amount of food reaching the sponge gardens, Dr Morganti said. ""Such change might not harm these sponges themselves but rather favour the settlement of other species,"" she said. The researchers are calling for increased marine protection zones for the Arctic to be put in place before receding sea ice opens it up for further exploitation. ""The sea ice naturally protects environments from overfishing."" ""But when it recedes, it's important to know which biodiversity hotspots are to be protected, especially from [bottom] trawling that is destructive for such [immobile] forms of life,"" Dr Morganti said.

198,Indonesian crocodile stuck in tyre finally freed after six years ,environment,"  Indonesian crocodile with tyre stuck around its neck finally freed after six years An elusive Indonesian crocodile, which has been travelling with a motorcycle tyre stuck around its neck for six years, has finally been freed. The roughly four-metre long crocodile had generated sympathy among some residents in the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi, who feared the tyre might eventually choke the reptile as it grew in size. It proved difficult to capture, but was eventually freed by local resident Tili, 35. ""I caught the crocodile by myself. I was asking for help from people here but they were scared,"" said Tili, who like many Indonesians uses one name. He tracked the reptile for three weeks, and set up a basic trap with live chickens and ducks as bait. But the wily crocodile managed to escape the trap on two occasions before finally being captured, when locals helped Tili remove the tyre with a saw. ""Many people were sceptical about me and thought I was not serious,"" Tili said. In 2020, authorities in the province had offered an unspecified reward for anyone who could remove the tyre, though for Tili it did not appear this was his main motivation. ""I just can't stand to see animals hurt. Even snakes, I will help,"" he said. Australian crocodile wrangler and wildlife television presenter Matt Wright attempted to free the reptile in 2020, but was unsuccessful. The reptile, which local people had referred to as ""buaya kalung ban"", meaning crocodile with a tyre necklace, was released back into the river on Monday evening.

199,Fears the NT's second-largest river will 'disappear' as miner eyes massive water allocation,environment,"  Roper River will 'disappear', traditional owners say, as government considers massive water allocation As distressed traditional owners in Central Australia grapple with the approval of the Northern Territory's largest groundwater licence at Singleton Station, Aboriginal elders and pastoralists further north are bracing for yet another battle over a precious resource. Mining company Australian Ilmenite Resources (AIR) has plans to extract 3.3 billion litres (3,300ML) of water every year from the Roper River for its mine located around 100 kilometres east of Mataranka. The water application is currently being considered by the NT Water Controller amid a groundswell of opposition and calls to reject the licence. Of those is Caroline Bulabul, a traditional owner, artist and the daughter of the late Sammy Bulabul, who was one of three Native Title holders taken to court by AIR in 2018 over their refusal to provide access to the Roper River for the construction of a pipeline needed to extract water for a dam. After a succession of record dry years spanning 2018 and 2019, Ms Bulabul said she was worried about the river ""disappearing"". ""We used to go there as children, our dad took us out in the school holidays for four weeks,"" she said. ""We had to live on that water to survive."" The Roper River is the second-largest river in the territory with its headwaters reaching north into Arnhem Land and south into the drier expanse of the Beetaloo Basin. Today, it is still the lifeblood of the Indigenous communities it flows through. ""It supplies us so much food … we use it for fishing, bush tucker, we use the lilies to make flour,"" Ms Bulabul said. ""We rely on it in the wet season when the water blocks us in and the roads are flooded … and especially during COVID."" AIR was given NT Environmental Protection Agency approval to begin mining in 2012, using just half the amount of water it is now applying for. In 2014, it was placed into receiver management and not long after it was purchased by Roper Resources. By the middle of 2017, production had quietly begun again, and its first exports were being shipped overseas. The company said it hoped to produce 100,000-120,000 tonnes of ilmenite every year and needs the extra water to do so. Yet in its application, AIR conceded the ""ability to predict the potential impacts … is very limited"" because ""there has not been detailed water assessment of water availability carried out as part of a water allocation plan"". Despite doubling its water requirements, the NT Environment Protection Authority said AIR did not need to refer its plans back for assessment provided ""the mining operations are consistent with the project that was assessed"". But emerging elder Winston Thompson said that was a ""great concern"". He said traditional owners and residents in the communities on the banks of the river had largely been left in the dark and no negotiations, nor consultations, had taken place. ""We want proper research carried out first and an environmental impact study done,"" he said. ""We're facing [the choice between] job creation and saying no to a water licence to protect our land — but that would take away from job creation. ""We don't have an answer, but proper research would help traditional owners in decision making."" Pastoralist Daniel Tapp said it was essential the iconic river was protected. ""We don't know if there's enough water, but still heavy water-using industries such as mining, gas, cotton, and industrial agriculture are lining up to take water for profit. ""I'm not against industry, but we have to make sure it's sustainable development."" Environment Centre NT co-director Dr Kirsty Howey said in the absence of an updated Environmental Impact Assessment, granting the licence would be ""foolhardy"". ""Ngukurr is downstream of this particular proposal but has been subjected to great water insecurity over the years,"" she said. ""There have been occasions where the aquifers have run dry and they've had to switch to water from the Roper River in the late dry season and build up. ""And if this is going to impact those flows, then you have the potential of putting Ngukurr's drinking water at risk."" A spokeswoman for the NT Minister for Environment, Eva Lawler, said all decisions regarding water were informed by science. Bradley Farrar, a clan leader of the Alawa tribe, said he was torn over the water application. While working as a truck driver at the mine last year he was actively fighting against oil and gas companies planning to frack the Beetaloo Basin. He also said a number of sacred sites dependent on the river were on the line. ""Under the water is a big bark, it's been there for hundreds of years, and it's a detailed story of my mother's totem,"" he said. ""I haven't seen the river dry up but I've seen it get close."" He said he felt like he was ""double dipping"". ""On one hand I want to go back and work at the mine, it's the only way to get money, but on the other I need to protect the land,"" Mr Farrar said. The CEO of the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (AAPA), Dr Ben Scambary, said while authority certificates were not mandatory for water extraction licences, AIR holds a certificate for registered sacred sites on the mine lease. Last month, documents obtained by the ABC showed AAPA had serious concerns about the safety of nearly 100 sacred sites around around Singleton Station in Central Australia as its authority certificate did not take into account impacts on water levels. ""Authority certificates are a risk management tool [and] … offer statutory indemnity against prosecution under the Sacred Sites Act in relation to works, provided the applicant complies with any conditions imposed to protect sacred sites,"" Dr Scambary said. After 25 years of flying hundreds of kilometres to study the NT's water systems, it is the Roper River that Professor Sue Jackson from the Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University knows best. For years she conducted research on the social and cultural significance of the upper Roper River for the Mataranka Water Allocation Plan, which a decade later is still not complete. In its absence, she said there was no way of telling if the water application by AIR would have seismic impacts or not. But of even greater concern is the failure to establish water allocation plans across the territory, she said, which were a crucial trigger for Strategic Aboriginal Water Reserves (SAWRs). In the Northern Territory, 95 per cent of the jurisdiction has no water allocation plan in place. ""We're really critical of the failure of the planning process because it enables government to hand out water to all of these industry parties in the absence of having to consider the effect on Aboriginal people and the opportunities for them to benefit,"" Professor Jackson said. ""The frontier metaphor comes into play very strongly, because in the frontier the interests of the settler society was put before Aboriginal people and we are seeing this happening here."" Erin O'Donnell from the Centre for Resources, Energy and Environment Law at the University of Melbourne agreed, and said the decisions were ""indicative of systemic racism"". ""The reason why I think you can say that, in the case of Northern Territory, is that they have a law on the books which says they need to allocate water to Aboriginal people,"" she said. ""So failing to invest adequately in the water planning process means that they will never deliver on their commitment to provide a strategic Aboriginal water reserve."" The NT has granted its largest ever groundwater extraction licence that will eventually use 40,000ML a year. It has raised questions about the science and effectiveness of water laws. Despite heavy criticisms, Dr O'Donnell said one small solution could make major inroads — charge for water. It is already a requirement under the National Water Initiative, Dr O'Donnell said, but the disbandment in 2014 of the national body in charge of oversight meant there was less scope to hold individual states and territories to account. She said putting a price tag on water could be used for further studies into mapping sustainable water allocation. Caroline Bulabul shared the sentiment. ""The mining mob don't pay rent … but if they did, we could put that money back into helping the land,"" she said. The ABC contacted AIR for comment but did not receive a response.

200,"Hoping for climate change answers, scientists went south with a daring plan to flood an icebreaker",environment,"  Beneath the ice Krill are essential to understanding climate change. But Antarctic voyages have been unable to catch krill for four years. So scientists took an untested idea into the south seas in hopes of success. Beneath this thick sea ice is one of the world's most unappreciated climate warriors. Antarctic krill are a food source for almost every animal on the ice. Their home is under threat. The ice that provides protection is melting. Carbon dioxide in the water is killing the young. To understand the threat of climate change, scientists need to study live krill in laboratories. But catching krill is notoriously difficult. This summer, Australian expeditioners set out on a 39-day journey to collect samples using a daring and untested method. Australia's new icebreaking vessel, the RSV Nuyina, was loaded with portable aquariums. It then headed south into dangerous waters, with a plan to deliberately flood a room in the name of science. The first glimpse of sea ice past the Antarctic Circle made the importance of the mission clear. Almost every animal living here — whales, penguins, seals, fish and seabirds — depends on krill for food. The crew watched as several Adelie penguins and a seal jostled for position on a small disc of ice, with krill likely swimming underneath. It's here that Antarctic krill are performing a role that heavy industry and governments across the world are investing billions of dollars trying to mimic — carbon capture and storage. Krill act as a conveyor belt for carbon, carrying it from the water's surface to the deep depths, where it can remain for centuries. Here's how it happens: first, krill eat algae near the surface containing carbon from the atmosphere. Then they swim deep below and deposit the carbon as waste, which sinks to the bottom of the ocean – a natural form of carbon capture and storage. Whales, penguins, seals and fish eat the krill, absorbing more carbon into their own bodies. When those predators die and sink to the bottom of the ocean, they are consumed by deep-sea creatures. Other animals can perform this task, but none to the scale of krill — the most abundant animal on Earth. Estimates of how much carbon is taken deep by Antarctic krill vary greatly, but some studies suggest it could be around 39 million tonnes per year. Dr Anna Belcher, an ecological biogeochemist at the British Antarctic Survey, said krill provide a ""highway for the transport of carbon deeper in the ocean"". ""The deeper in the ocean the sinking faecal pellets get, the longer the carbon they contain is locked away from the atmosphere."" If the krill population was to decline, carbon levels in the water could increase. Antarctica offers a chance to watch climate change unfold before your eyes. If you wait long enough in front of a glacier, you will see sheets of ice from the cliff face collapse into the ocean — another few drops added to rising sea levels. As waters warm, the amount of frozen ocean is shrinking. In East Antarctica, sea ice has remained relatively stable. But it's receding faster towards the west. A 2016 study warned krill habitat could shrink by as much as 80 per cent by 2100. ""We have seen the krill populations move southwards over the last 90 years,"" Dr Belcher said. And there is another predator: trawling vessels, whose commercial opportunities to fish for valuable krill oil are growing as the sea ice cover recedes. Australian marine biologist Rob King, who has spent his life studying the fragile creatures, said if krill disappeared, it would spell disaster for the entire food chain. ""If the krill population declined in the Southern Ocean, we'd see the big charismatic megafauna that we all associate with this region starting to suffer,"" Mr King said. ""Things like the blue whales and fin whales, that are going through a recovery since the end of whaling, would really feel the effects of declining krill."" What scientists need to find out is the tipping point in carbon dioxide levels that could trigger a population collapse. The Nuyina's voyage south is 15 years in the making and informed by decades of trial and error collecting perfect krill samples. Despite their abundance, catching krill isn't easy. Earlier expeditions relied on heavy trawl nets that could be ruined by ice, were difficult to deploy and could damage the krill. Scientists with competing research projects get limited time on board — and it's bad luck if there's no krill around during the allotted time. It's been four years since Australian scientists had fresh krill to study, and it's beginning to compromise their research. Rob King still remembers returning to Hobart after an Antarctic voyage without a single krill to study in the aquarium. ""I think it was just a lot of time spent on decks of ships wishing you could sample for krill when you couldn't,"" Mr King said. ""When you are in sea ice you just can't put [fishing] gear in the water when the ship is moving or it will be destroyed."" Out of that frustration, Mr King pitched an alternative that would make most shipbuilders anxious. His plan: suck the krill inside by drilling holes into the ship to flood it with icy Antarctic waters. ""The thing about adding a hole into a ship is that if you try and do it to an existing ship, there is an enormous back pressure from the people who want the ship to stay afloat!"" Mr King said. ""But if you do it at the very start of a ship's genesis — so that it can go through all of classification and have it built into the ship — that makes it possible."" The Nuyina is unusual in that three holes have been deliberately drilled in the hull to allow freezing waters to flood a small room below sea level. The theory is that Antarctic krill could be sucked inside the ship, where they would spill onto a filter table. The water would push the animals into a well, where they could be scooped into buckets and taken to aquariums. The ""wet well"" is adjacent to the engine hall and there is an obvious risk involved. If something went wrong, the air-tight door into the flooded room must remain sealed. Scientists needing an escape could climb a ladder out of the room and then close the latch. Despite more than a decade of planning, expeditioners on this voyage had no idea whether it would actually work. Understandably, there were some nerves. The first test began around 2am, when krill usually rise to the surface to feed on phytoplankton. More than 8,000 Antarctic krill were caught during the ship's first voyage — the biggest catch in years. ""That is what I always dreamed it could deliver, but you don't expect to just turn it on and have it like that,"" Mr King said. ""It's the best way to wake up in the morning, to go 200 metres from your cabin down to somewhere you can flick a switch and have live Antarctic krill delivered to you instantly."" As aquarist Anton Rocconi monitors the health of the Antarctic krill now floating in chilled aquariums, he marvels at a breakthrough that provides ""survival rates that you just don't see in a trawl"". Mr Rocconi said with so many samples in perfect condition, scientists would be able to run experiments with different temperatures and carbon dioxide levels to truly understand what impact climate change is having. ""Many times, scientists can go to the Antarctic and not be able to catch what they need, so this really improves the chances and really will change the way we do our research,"" Mr King said. One of the riskiest parts of the voyage still remains: getting the temperature-sensitive krill off the ship and safely into Hobart aquariums. As the ship slowly approaches land, a wandering albatross escorts the crew and cargo. There are only 10,000 adult pairs of these birds left in the wild. Its presence is a reminder of what's at stake as preparations are made for the krill aquariums to be lifted off the ship by cranes and onto the back of trucks waiting at port. The refrigerated containers must be switched off before being lifted. That means there's a race against time to get the krill into aquariums before the water temperature exceeds 3.5C in the late January heat. Like penguins scrambling for food on the ice, the scientists jostle for their krill to be offloaded before crew and cargo. There is no time to wait for their bags to be unloaded: the scientists race from the port in the truck. Just days ago, one of the scientists sent a message from a Hobart lab to say some of the Antarctic krill had just bred in captivity. ""It is so relieving and inspiring to know that all of our hard work over the voyage has delivered."" The ABC travelled to Antarctica with the support of the Australian Antarctic Program.

201,Siberia is exporting 100 tonnes of ivory a year — and it's not from elephants,environment," Science Mammoth tusk mining in the Arctic, and the price of 'ethical ivory' Kim Akerman plucks a small, creamy hand-carved figurine from a handmade box resting on his kitchen table. The little mammoth is made out of the tusk from a real woolly mammoth that died eons ago. Although carved recently, the piece of ivory with its striking amber eyes has the feel of something ancient. Kim is an artist, anthropologist and collector, who has been carving since he was a teenager in the 1960s. Even then he was fascinated with the Ice Age. One of the first pieces he ever created was a palm-length carving of a woman made out of whale tooth in the style of Venus figurines made by the Ice Age artists in Eurasia. The ivory mammoth is one of many pieces created out of a large chunk of tusk that travelled through time and space to make it to his kitchen table in suburban Hobart. Kim acquired the ivory a few decades ago when he was working for the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. Someone offered to sell the tusk to the museum, but the piece was large and not suited to the collection, so the institution passed on the offer. But Kim and his colleague could not turn down the opportunity to own ancient ivory, so they pooled their money and purchased it. They cut off a small, more manageable piece for the museum, and kept the rest for their art. Kim is unsure of the mammoth ivory's provenance, but suspects the seller may have picked up the tusk on a business trip to Siberia. While it seems odd for carvings made from the tusk of an ancient Ice Age animal to end up in Hobart, the mystique of mammoths has caused people to mine and trade their remains for millennia. Most mammoth tusks are mined from frozen ground, or permafrost, in the Arctic. The best-preserved specimens are found in far northern Yakutia — also known as Sakha — in Siberia. In the years since Kim acquired his piece of tusk,  swathes of permafrost in the region have thawed as the world has warmed. As the ground melts, the remains of the ancient beasts are easier to prise from their icy graves. This has created a ""mammoth rush"" over the past decade, explains Zara Bending of the Centre for Environmental Law of Macquarie University. An estimated 100 tonnes of mammoth tusk are now thought to be exported from Yakutia each year, according to local media. Some tusks are sold in Russia, but most are exported around the world with major markets in China, Vietnam, and the United States. The rush was further fuelled by domestic bans on the sale of elephant ivory in the United States and China in 2016 and 2017. Mammoth ivory is sold to conscious consumers as ""ethical ivory"", even adorning former US first lady Michelle Obama. Mammoth mining is dangerous, remote, all male and often illegal, explains anthropologist Prokopieva Aleksandra from the Russian Academy of Sciences. ""Currently, mining is mainly carried out by private individuals in the form of groups with mining licenses,"" Ms Aleksandra says. Many of the miners operate illegally, or on edges of illegality, but ""the state is increasingly striving to control this process,"" she says. Mining parties will set up camp in mammoth-rich areas on the Arctic coast and rivers and travel in detachments to mine sites. Locations are closely guarded, and only trusted people are invited to hunt for carcasses. ""[Miners] don't just take random people,"" she says. Sometimes tusks can be collected by walking along a melt line, and occasionally tusk hunters will use dive equipment to extract mammoths. Russian law stipulates that only mammoth tusks that have come to the surface, usually via permafrost melting, can be harvested. In reality, most miners hurry this process along by pumping water through high-pressure hoses to blast away the permafrost, creating vast tunnels. It's low tech, but effective. From the water blasting and melting, Ice Age creatures appear. Skulls and tusks abound, but these miners also unearth more grisly remains: occasionally mummified animals emerge with flesh, blood, and hair preserved. But the process also accelerates permafrost loss, pollutes rivers with muck, and tunnel collapse is an ever-present danger. Once extracted, tusks are moved on and sold to a global market. Just like gold rushes of old, some miners strike rich, but many invest huge amounts of money and risk their lives only to return home empty-handed. ""This is associated with both high risks and big money,"" Ms Aleksandra says. Although mammoth ivory is marketed as an ethical alternative to killing elephants for their tusks, not everyone is convinced this works in practice. There is concern that elephant ivory could be passed off as mammoth, explains Ms Bending. In 2018, this practice drove Israel to attempt to have mammoth ivory listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a convention limiting the international trade of listed plants and animals. ""It was really audacious as a proposal, the idea of listing an extinct animal,"" Ms Bending says. Israel withdrew its proposal as the CITES committee was not convinced there was enough evidence to confirm the sale of mammoth ivory provided the opportunity for elephant ivory laundering. The issue is due to be re-examined after further research in November 2022 at CITES CoP 19. Under Russian law, tusks need to be accredited as genuine mammoth and not elephant. At the beginning of last year, the government banned the export of tusks more than 3 metres long or weighing over 100 kilograms. The size regulations were introduced to preserve the tusks' cultural and scientific value. But it's estimated a third of the mammoth tusk trade is illegal, and the new regulations may push even more of the trade into the shadow economy, Ms Bending says. ""You're potentially making an opportunity for crime to move in, it's an unknown calculus at this point,"" she says. To get around size limits, tusks may be further cut up or made into beads before export. Whole mammoth tusks are very easy to tell apart from elephant tusks, but small pieces are hard to distinguish. Cutting large tusks may muddy the water in the ivory market, making it easier to launder elephant ivory. Employment and profit are hard to come by in the far north of Russia, with both Ms Bending and Ms Aleksandra emphasising that mammoth mining brings money to communities who need it. However, it's often not the miners who reap the biggest rewards, but middlemen who export the tusks, Ms Bending says. When trade is illegal, the chance of miners being exploited by middlemen increases. ""Today, the extraction of mammoth tusk is becoming an acute issue, as it affects the spheres of the shadow economy, land relations and the bowels of the Earth,"" Ms Aleksandra says. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Miners and the environment may be more protected if mammoth mining were included in Russia's official list of Indigenous crafts or trades, such as hunting and fishing, she suggests. ""This entitles Indigenous peoples to benefits, compensations, and advantages in matters of land use,"" she says. ""If the tusk mining had been included in this list, it might have been easier for Indigenous peoples to start doing this legally and not allowing outsiders to prey [on Indigenous miners]. ""As a native of Yakutia, I can say that at the moment, this is at least some opportunity to earn money in the Far North."" The fates of mammoths and humans have been intertwined in Yakutia since before the mammoth went extinct in the region about 10,000 years ago. For carver Kim, this is part of the intrigue. ""People stood up against them and harvested them and their remains,"" he muses. Stories of the behemoths have survived in the Yakutian oral tradition. And mammoth artefacts are common in the archaeological record, Ms Aleksandra says. Evidence of tusks being mined stretches back to the Mesolithic (8000BC-2700BC). ""In the Bronze and Iron Ages, armour, shields, ritual calendars, and combs for combing plant fibres were made from [mammoth] tusks,"" she says. Export of mammoth tusk products increased soon after Yakutia was colonised by Russia in the 17th century. By the late 19th century, the first mammoth rush was on, and curved tusks filled the warehouses on London docks. Mammoth tusks run the risk of being lost to science when they are exported. The mining process can also damage archaeological sites, depriving anthropologists like Ms Aleksandra the chance to study Ice Age humans. However, tusk hunters and scientists have formed an unlikely alliance. Miners are responsible for most of the significant scientific finds to come out of the Siberian permafrost in recent years, according to Albert Protopopov, whose team at the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) studies the ancient Ice Age animals. ""[The miners'] contribution to science is invaluable."" When Professor Protopopov gets word of a significant find from miners, he, or his colleagues, will travel to the site by plane, all-terrain vehicle or — when funds allow — helicopter. It is then their turn to use water pumps to uncover the find. ""All large finds sooner or later get to us. But often small finds like animal skulls are often sold. This is sad,"" he says. Later this year, miners and scientists will meet at the International Mammoth Forum in Yakutia to discuss how they can better work together. Despite being extinct for thousands of years, woolly mammoths grip our imagination. ""I think dinosaurs are interesting, but [mammoth remains] are basically flesh, bone, blood and hair, so they connect a bit more,"" Kim says. The very flesh and bone that make mammoths so tangible to Kim may lead to their resurrection via advanced genetic technology. In 2010, tusk hunters found ""Yuka"", a young mammoth that died nearly 30,000 years ago. Yuka's cells were so well preserved that researchers in Japan were able to cajole them into the early stages of cell division, Professor Protopopov explains. While they could not complete the process, he hopes more preserved mammoth mummies like Yuka will be found. ""But [next time] we will be better prepared for cell preservation. We have the experience we need."" When this happens, researchers will be one step closer to using ancient DNA to resurrect the woolly mammoth. For now though, when Kim carves mammoth tusk, he reflects on what the animal was like when it was alive. ""You are sort of paying homage to the animal itself, it lives in another form,"" he says.

202,'Amazing property': Huge north Queensland landholding to become national park,environment,"  Queensland government buys out grazier to secure 'The Lakes' for a massive new national park After two years of negotiations, an area in North Queensland double the size of Mulgumpin (Moreton Island) is set to become a national park. Environment Minister Meaghan Scanlon today said the state government had purchased a record 35,300-hectare parcel of land. 'The Lakes' is about 100km north of Hughenden, near Townsville. The final price paid to the landowner is commercial-in-confidence, Ms Scanlon said, but $1.829 million of the multi-million dollar purchase was footed by US charitable company The Wyss Foundation. James Fitzsimons, from The Nature Conservancy, said the acquisition of the property on the Gudjala First Nations peoples' traditional country was ""key infrastructure for Australia's biodiversity"". ""The Lakes is a really amazing property,"" Dr Fitzsimmons said. ""It's about three or four large perch wetlands on top of the Great Dividing Range — escarpment country, gulf plains, a range of threatened species and a range of ecosystems that are really under-represented in the reserve system. ""[It is home] to our flora and fauna, which are really critical in the face of climate change."" Ms Scanlon said, after two years of negotiations, the area was identified as an ""important ecosystem"" that needed protecting. ""There's a whole range of threatened species in that area,"" she said. ""It's actually between two existing national parks, which allows for that continuity of protection, which is really critical."" The purchase is part of the Palaszczuk government's $60 million Protected Area Strategy 2020-2030. Ms Scanlon said the government would consider opening the park to visitors, bird watchers and hikers. She said more buy-outs of other properties were planned in the region for the year. ""The department looks at a whole range of properties when we are looking at future acquisitions to make sure we are getting the biggest bang for buck in terms of protection,"" she said. ""It's a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes to make sure we can get these really pristine parts of Queensland secured under Queensland's ownership. ""This is the first big acquisition for 2022 but there's more to come.""

203,'This place has been transformed': Outback South Australia greening provides silver lining to flooding,environment,"  Outback transformed by summer floods after record rainfall in South Australia's north Flooding has wreaked havoc in parts of outback South Australia, but there may be a silver, or perhaps green, lining to come from it all: an explosion of flora and fauna. Vast stretches of the usually dry outback have been inundated with record rainfall, breathing new life into plants and wildlife that have been dormant. ""Everything that can move, does move,"" David Watson, a professor in ecology at Charles Sturt University, told ABC News Channel. ""[The plants and animals] can sit there through pretty grim times and then, when conditions are right, when it's wet and warm, they go bananas. ""This place has been transformed."" Professor Watson said frogs, bats and ducks were among the wildlife that had been revitalised. ""The frogs that have been waiting in deep, deep burrows in the mud — the water reaches down to them [and] they spring to life,"" he said. The intense rainfall began about two weeks ago, with various downpours since, flooding roads and highways. Katy Hayes and her family have noticed an increase in bird and insect life around their homestead at Arckaringa Cattle Station, 90 kilometres south-west of Oodnadatta. The station received more than 200 millimetres of rain over the past two weeks. Director of the centre for ecosystem science at UNSW, Richard Kingsford, said new life emerged immediately after the rain. He said insects and crustaceans almost straight away hatched out of eggs that have been sitting there since the last flood. ""A lot of them have been buried, ready for something to happen,"" Professor Kingsford said. With wildlife, comes more wildlife. ""It attracts this incredible food web of herbivores, invertebrate feeding birds, and you've got the predators, the hawks and eagles, and big fish that are eating little fish so it's an amazing landscape,"" Professor Kingsford said. In some parts of the state, water levels are already falling but, Professor Kingsford said, the greenery will stick around longer, with plants still set to flower. ""You get this absolute blanket of different-coloured flowers across the desert, which will be particularly spectacular, probably this spring,"" he said. University of Adelaide ecologist John Read, who lives east of Kimba on the Eyre Peninsula, said aquatic animals, such as shield and clam shrimp, were turning up in water holes. ""You don't see them in dry times,"" he said. Experts such as Dr Read have also predicted baby animals, including kangaroos, will be on their way. ""There's going to be a whole range of changes we see over the next 12 months,"" Dr Read said. Professor Kingsford said one of the most impressive sights in flooded inland Australia was often the thousands of budgies that flock to the water. ""They're just magic,"" he told ABC Radio's This Week with Linda Mottram. ""They have this amazing capability of knowing when it's on … and being able to find where the good times are happening in the deserts."" Dr Read said that, while the matter of how the birds do it remains a mystery, they are able to navigate thousands of kilometres to end up near water. ""They time their arrival just perfectly to take advantage of food resources in lakes or swamps,"" he said. But the floodwaters bring a potential downside too, with weeds and invasive species set to cause problems. ""We're concerned about buffel grass, which is a really dangerous invasive grass that [covers] the environment and causes big fires,"" Dr Read said. He also cautioned that feral cats and foxes would make their way to where rabbits and mice have been breeding, causing problems over the next year or so, too.

204,Mimicry is a cruel trick in the game of survival. Here are some of nature's most diabolical players,environment," Science Mimicry is a cruel trick in the game of survival. Here are some of nature's most diabolical players When it comes to mimicry, we're all familiar with the vocal acrobatics of the Australian lyrebird, and perhaps more recently, ""Ripper"" the Australian musk duck. If you missed it, Ripper — hand-reared at Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve — could be heard to mutter ""you bloody fool"" when trying to woo a mate, according to research published last year. Australia is full of weird plants and animals. And Dr Ann Jones is on speaking terms with most of them! But while both Ripper and the lyrebird exhibit what is known as reproductive mimicry, a far more deadly form of impersonation has evolved in some predators and parasites. Aggressive mimicry is nature's take-no-prisoners version of the dress-up party. Here in no particular order, are some of the most diabolical examples. Also, if spiders aren't your cup of tea, have no fear. This first example is actually a snake. What do you get if you take a snake, isolate it in rugged Middle Eastern mountains and desert for millennia, and surround it with food that flies mouth-wateringly out of reach? Presenting the ophidiophobe-arachnophobe's phobia of phobias, ""Spider-snake"". Discovered in 2006 in western Iran, the spider-tailed horned viper is a species of the Pseudocerastes genus, also known as false-horned vipers. Mimicry is widespread across the animal kingdom, according to animal behaviour expert Ximena Nelson from the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. ""[For example] there have been ant-mimicking spiders for around 50 million years. There will be some other forms of mimicry that are much older than that,"" Professor Nelson said. Genetic analysis shows the false-horned vipers began to diverge from their closest living relative — the McMahon's desert viper — in the early Miocene epoch (around 20 million years ago) in the Middle East. Tectonic and palaeoclimatic events are then thought to have geographically separated populations of the false-horned vipers, and left them to their devices. Two of the three subsequent species to evolve got by on venom, camouflage and some minor tail-tweaks as a means to a meal, whereas the third developed an elaborate caudal lure — a fancy name for a tricky tail. In this case, the caudal lure on the tail-end of Pseudocerastes urarachndoides, aka the spider-tailed horned viper, aka Spider-snake, bears an uncanny resemblance to an arachnid. Given its cryptic nature, scarcity and remote location in the border region of Iraq and Iran, research is still ongoing; however, the snake has been observed lying in wait, and moving the tail in a figure-of-8 pattern. The result is an unsettlingly accurate impression of a spider, able to lure the snake's feathered tormentors to a front-fanged death by envenomation. If you've ever woken up with a sty in your eye, you might have some small insight into the sufferings of land snails (Succinea) at the hand of Leuchochloridium paradoxum — a species of flatworm known as the green-banded broodsac. Imagine though that instead of that sty remaining in the corner of your eye, it infects your entire eye and optic nerve, causing it to swell, turn various shades of green in distinct bands, and pulse. Now, with this psychedelic caterpillar sticking out your face, you feel an overwhelming compulsion to move away from shelter and into ""better illuminated places ... higher in the vegetation"". In a final twist of the knife, you're painfully aware that there are voracious birds in the area with a penchant for caterpillar — face-bound or otherwise — and your moving out into the open sunlight makes you especially vulnerable. As a consolation, before one or both of your eyeballs are plucked out, know that your former face tenant, which was in its early life phase in your eye, will develop into an adult and take up residence in its new host's rectum, where it will feed on ""passing digested matter"". Its eggs are passed out with the bird's faeces and the beautiful circle of life continues. When is a fish not a fish? When it's a mussel, mimicking a fish, to lure in larger predatory fish in order to plant its larvae in their gills. While researchers used to try to squeeze mimicry into a single category, Professor Nelson says that thinking has broadened. ""I guess it's only really recently, and by recently I mean the last 10 years or so, that we've started to accept that mimicry spans more than one type of [trait],"" she said. This example traverses both the reproductive and aggressive forms of mimicry, as for a few weeks after their encounter, the mussel's larvae act as parasites on the host fish. Though not a trait exclusive to this species of mussel, in this case we're talking about Lampsilis ovata or the pocketbook mussel, a freshwater bivalve endemic to the eastern United States. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. The mussel's ""fish"" is actually what's called a mantle lure — the first type of crude lure thought to have evolved in the Lampsilis tribe — of which today there are over 100 species. Though some of the mussels have since lost their mantle flap lures, aeons ago the pocketbook entered an arms race with its wily hosts, developing more and more elaborate lures as their marks wised up to the game. Today, even in crystal clear water, the female pocketbook's lure can entice fish such as the large-mouth bass to strike, at which point it ejects a plume of larvae into the mouth of its unsuspecting victim. Its larvae attach to the fish's gills, and the gill tissue grows over the mussels-to-be in a process of encystment. The developing mussels feed on their host's blood for weeks before dropping off as young mussels, ready to start the process again. Although the parasitism doesn't appear to do much harm to the fish, there is evidence of fish developing resistance to further colonisation after exposure. If the death's-head hawkmoth looks familiar, it's probably because it haunted the dreams of '90s cinemagoers via its depiction in The Silence of the Lambs. The resemblance to a human skull on its thorax has seen the moth mythologised in popular culture, paintings, and books. Superstition around its distinctive ""death's head"" abound in Europe, Asia and Africa, where the three species are found. In England, it's rumoured to have first appeared at the execution of Charles I. Another myth says the moths plagued the ""Mad King"" — flitting about King George III's bed chamber during a period of mental illness. The death's-head hawkmoth is a perfect example of not fitting neatly into a category of mimicry. Its ""skull"" markings when viewed upside down, as a bird might see it, are thought to make up the eyes on a large face resembling a giant hornet, or similar unpalatable species.

An ultrasonic screech produced by scales on the genital valves is thought to deter bats, and its yellow bands may help it blend in with bees. But it's another device altogether that it uses for hunting. Evidence suggests the moth uses a ""chemical camouflage"" to impersonate the honey bee, allowing it to slip past the guards and into the hive, where it helps itself to their honey. If its game is rumbled, a thick waxy cuticle helps it withstand being stung. While the best-known examples of aggressive mimicry pertain to physical impersonations, there are many other forms too. An Australian katydid attracts male cicadas by ""imitating the species-specific wing flick replies of sexually receptive female cicadas""; when the cicada is within reach, the katydid takes a bite out of its head. The fringed jumping spider — Portia fimbriata — from north Queensland is a spider eater. It has been observed plucking at the webs of orb spiders, giving the impression of an ensnared insect, in order to lure its prey within striking distance. But for all we know about mimicry, there are likely plenty of tactics and frequencies we don't know about, according to Professor Nelson. ""We're only just getting to grips with visual, chemical and behavioural mimicry — what about ultrasound? ""The acoustic mimicry we've looked at is just within our very narrow range of hearing."" The development of such complex and varied devices for survival can be partly explained by phenotypic plasticity — the ability for the same gene to produce different physical characteristics depending on its environment. Mostly though, it's the result of millions of years of natural selection in an indifferent system. ""Mimicry is the resemblance in some sensory modality or other to another animal,"" Professor Nelson said. ""Natural selection is going to act on whatever works.""

205,Camera network reveals secret life of native animals — and their feral predators,environment,"  Wildlife cameras help researchers understand Tasmania's native wildlife and feral species Researchers have opened a window into the lives of Tasmania's threatened native species and their predators by constructing one of the largest wildlife camera trap networks in the world. The network of more than 1,300 camera sites and 600 active camera traps now extends into the farthest corners of Tasmania, after its development began in 2015. The researchers have already amassed 750,000 images of 150 species, including tens of thousands of pictures of Tasmanian devils in their natural habitat. University of Tasmania researcher Dr Jessie Buettel said the idea was to ""cast a massive net"" to better understand what the wildlife was up to, and how incidents such as bushfires and land clearing affect native species. ""In terms of interactions, we see things like birds sitting on the back of pademelons plucking their fur to put in their nests,"" Dr Buettel said. The thylacine is considered officially extinct, but that hasn't stopped people searching for them in the wilderness. ""Interestingly, one of our most charismatic animals is the currawong and the raven; they tend to be very attracted to our cameras. ""I think they're the selfie masters of camera trap networking."" Already, the researchers have learned plenty. ""The thing that surprised us the most when we first started this work was where these animals are,"" Dr Buettel said. ""They're in areas that we never expected them to be — you find eastern quolls on the north west coast for example, you see cats on the far south-west coastline."" While the camera network provides unprecedented detail about Tasmania's native wildlife, it also reveals clues about the lives of feral animals — particularly cats. The predators have been spotted carrying surprisingly large kills, including bandicoots, pademelons and ringtail possums. That's where PhD student Alex Paton comes in. Ms Paton has been analysing the images of feral cats, to better understand where they are distributed, how many exist in the wild and in what densities, and whether they have a preference for certain types of habitat or prey. She said with feral cats detected at 90 per cent of camera trap sites, the information could help researchers target areas for conservation. ""We need to accept that on mainland Tasmania, the chances of eradicating feral cats are very small,"" Ms Paton said. ""It's a big island state, and we're in dense rainforest with other predators present, so we can't bait for cats and we can't shoot cats. ""What we can do is use this camera network to not just monitor feral cats, but their prey species as well, and find the areas that we need to conserve most and put in management practices there.""

206,The world is forecast to hit 1.5C warming in the 2030s. Almost no coral reefs will be spared,environment," Science Coral reef safe zones set to plummet, while potential bleaching events loom in Qld, WA The number of coral reefs worldwide that will be spared the harm of warming is predicted to plummet within just a few decades. That's the finding of research published today in the journal PLOS Climate, which comes as reef scientists ""anxiously"" eye off the potential for bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef and in Western Australia over the coming weeks. Currently about 84 per cent of the world's coral reefs are buffered from ocean warming by influences like cool upwellings, deep water, and cooler ocean currents. But today's research shows that figure will drop to just 0.2 per cent of reefs when global warming breaches 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. We're currently forecast to hit 1.5C in the 2030s, and it's believed that there's now almost no chance of staying under that limit without extremely aggressive cuts to emissions and unproven carbon capture technologies that can draw CO2 from the atmosphere. The Great Barrier Reef suffered bleaching events in 2016, 2017, and 2020, and the co-author of today's paper, Scott Heron from James Cook University, said scientists were anxiously watching weather patterns in Queensland's north, and off the northern WA coast. ""Here we are at the end of January — summertime in Australia — and we're seeing heat stress developing to a point of potential widespread coral stress on the Great Barrier Reef,"" Dr Heron said. ""We're at a point of social anxiety among the coral reef community, wondering what the next month may hold."" Giant machines that suck carbon dioxide from the air are being turned on around the world. So is this part of the solution to climate change? Some overcast monsoonal weather has given the reef a brief reprieve from the heat, and scientists are hoping for more of the same to stave off yet another catastrophic hit just two years after the last, Dr Heron said. But there are already signs of corals fluorescing — a sign of distress in some species — and some whiteness has been observed, according to marine biologist Jodie Rummer from JCU. She says temperatures are already high and if there are cumulative days of heating over the next weeks or months, bleaching is likely to occur. ""We've got temperatures that are warmer than expected [and] there's not as much mixing [of water] as we'd hoped, despite it being a La Nina,"" Dr Rummer said. Marine biologist Mike van Keulen from Murdoch University in Perth says there are already ""signs of coral stress"" in north-west Western Australia as well. Warm waters in the north can cause coral stress down much of the WA coastline, Dr van Keulen says. ""Particularly for WA, that becomes a problem because the warm water to the north of us seeds the Leeuwin current that runs down our coast. ""The last big event we had in 2011 bleached corals all the way down to Rottnest Island [off Perth]."" In order to understand the future of coral reefs globally, Dr Heron and colleagues from the University of Leeds and Texas Tech University modelled the impact of warming on reefs down to a resolution of 1 square kilometre.At 1.5C of warming, they found only a few reefs in Polynesia and the Coral Triangle in the western Pacific would be spared recurring ""thermal stress events"" at least once every 10 years, according to Dr Heron. ""There were very few places around the world [that would be spared] and they were focused in the area of French Polynesia and the Coral Triangle,"" he said. The scientists found that more than 90 per cent of reefs will suffer these thermal stress events at least every five years. Thermal stress events are periods of elevated sea-surface temperature capable of causing ""significant coral bleaching"". No reefs in Australia will be immune to regular thermal stress events once warming reaches 1.5C, they concluded. At 2C of warming, no reefs worldwide will be spared the impact of climate change. Today's findings, and the prospect of yet another bleaching event, underline how important climate action is for the reef, Dr Rummer said. ""All of these secondary and tertiary issues the reef is facing, it's not going to matter if we fix them without addressing the real problem, which is climate change,"" she said. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. A number of scientists, including Dr Rummer, were critical of last week's pledge by the federal government for $1 billion over nine years for the reef, without also committing to ambitious climate action. Dr van Keulen says programs that will be funded under the government's pledge, which are aimed at improving the resilience of corals, are ""too little, too late"". ""We've got climate change that causes consecutive years of bleaching; there's no way we can return to normal from here. ""The only chance we can make a difference is to rapidly wind back emissions."" As we approach 1.5C, Dr van Keulen says the delicate, colourful corals we associate with tropical holidays will be gone. As they go, we will see ""huge flow-on effects"" in fish abundance and diversity, which will also impact many commercial industries like seafood and tourism. Dr Heron says the more we study the impacts of climate change on reefs, the more we realise we're heading toward a ""cliff face"". Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

207,"Blue Mountains could enter world heritage 'in danger' list if dam raising project proceeds, experts warn",environment,"  NSW's Blue Mountains could lose World Heritage status if Warragamba dam plan goes ahead: experts Scientific advisers to the United Nations have delivered a scathing assessment of the NSW government's plans to raise Warragamba dam, prompting fears that the Blue Mountains could lose its world heritage status if the project proceeds. In a letter to the federal government, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), said raising the dam ""appears to be inappropriate in relation to the requirements of the World Heritage Convention"". Australia is a signatory to the World Heritage Convention, and under federal environment law, the federal environment minister is not allowed to approve a project that is inconsistent with the Convention. Experts say if the project is approved anyway, the IUCN's advice could pave the way for embarrassing consequences for Australia. ""The ultimate outcome of that could be a listing of [the Blue Mountains] on the list of World Heritage in Danger or, eventually, a potential delisting of the site,"" said Tracey Ireland, a professor of cultural heritage at the University of Canberra. The NSW government plans to raise Warragamba Dam in the Blue Mountains by at least 14 metres. The additional height would not be used for drinking water storage, but to catch flood waters, mitigating the impact of some floods on Western Sydney. When that happens, thousands of hectares of the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area would be inundated instead. The area that would be impacted includes some of the most important remaining habitat for the critically endangered regent honeyeater bird, of which fewer than 300 are thought to exist. It's also home to a range of other endangered animals and some plants unique to the area. In 2019, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee requested Australia produce its Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the project so it could be reviewed by the IUCN. The IUCN's review, published this week by the NSW government, found the EIS self-contradictory, non-compliant with the requirements of an environmental assessment, and concluded that progressing with the project could be inconsistent with the World Heritage Convention. For the IUCN's advice to have any force, it would need to be taken up by UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, which is made up of representatives from 21 countries. The committee could ask Australia not to progress with the plans, or warn of consequences if it does. While the EIS argued the project would not materially impact the Outstanding Universal Values of the site — the features that made it worthy of World Heritage — the IUCN review concluded the information in the EIS contradicted that claim, and would harm those values. The independent review also concluded the EIS, conducted by consultants engaged by Water NSW, failed to properly consult with traditional owners, failed to assess how the impacts of the 2020 fires overlap the impacts of the project, and failed to adequately survey the site for plants and animals that will be destroyed. Finally, it concluded that the government's heavy reliance on ""offsets"" to compensate for damage was not appropriate. ""This technical review is saying very clearly that raising Warragamba Dam wall is totally inconsistent with Australia's obligations under international law and the World Heritage Convention,"" said Harry Burkitt from the Colong Foundation for Wilderness, which has been campaigning against the dam. He said the review showed the dam project, should it proceed, would likely see the Blue Mountains added to the list of World Heritage In Danger, or even stripped of its World Heritage status. Mr Burkitt said such a move would be deeply embarrassing for Australia and would harm its tourism industry. ""The Blue Mountains is one of the biggest drawcards for tourists who come to Australia, he said. ""Millions of visitors a year come to the Three Sisters up at Katoomba, and if they raise this dam wall, remember: you're going to be able to see the new lake formed by this dam while you're standing at the Three Sisters."" Some say the Warragamba Dam wall needs to be raised to help prevent the devastating floods seen this week — but there is a cost upstream too. Peter Valentine, an expert on World Heritage from James Cook University, agreed those options were open to UNESCO and without political interference would likely occur. ""I'm assuming that the response from the World Heritage Committee in consideration of this would be to urge the Australian government to halt the project,"" he said. Before proceeding to the next stage of the Warragamba dam project, Water NSW needs to wait for responses to the draft EIS, and then seek final determination from the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, which is expected to take months. The project will ultimately need to be approved by the federal environment minister under federal environment law. Professor Valentine said given this advice by the IUCN, Environment Minister Sussan Ley could be in breach of her authority if she approved the project. In a statement, a spokesman for Ms Ley said: ""Before making any decision on the proposal, the Minister will consider the New South Wales Government's environmental assessment and all other matters required under national environmental law."" The IUCN review comes after a host of other organisations and government agencies submitted reviews critical of the NSW Government's assessment. Heritage NSW, a NSW government agency, wrote that it did not consider the ""natural and cultural values of the national parks estate and Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area have been adequately assessed or justified"". A submission by NSW Department of Planning Industry and Environment echoed those concerns and said: ""Notably, the EIS makes incorrect assumptions about how to determine World Heritage values, and therefore how to evaluate impacts on those values."" Sydney's 2021 floods sparked renewed interest in a controversial plan to raise Warragamba Dam's wall — this is what you need to know. The NSW Environmental Protection Agency said the EIS did not properly assess the potential impacts of construction activities associated with building the additional dam wall. Meanwhile, the Australian branch of UNESCO's official cultural advisers, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), wrote that the EIS was ""fundamentally deficient"" and the ""very nature of the project is at odds with … obligations that arise from the World Heritage Convention."" Despite the criticisms, NSW Minister for Western Sydney Stuart Ayres has said the project will go ahead. ""Absolutely it will happen,"" he said on 2GB radio last week. ""It's imperative that Western Sydney gets flood mitigation protection by raising the Warragamba dam wall."" Minister Ayres told the ABC he didn't support the views of the IUCN. ""It's important to recognise that unlike a water storage dam that holds water permanently, the higher wall at Warragamba will only hold water above the current storage level on a temporary basis: a few hours, up to 14 days,"" he said. ""We are confident that given the temporary and limited areas covered by inundation that environmental impacts can be managed.""

208,"From blood-stained killing waters to slice of paradise, welcome to Australia's best beach",environment,"  Misery Beach, on Western Australia's south coast, named Tourism Australia Best Beach 2022 For a place called Misery, it's a little slice of paradise. Little-known Misery Beach, 20 kilometres south of Albany on Western Australia's south coast, has been named the best beach in the country by Tourism Australia. It beat beauty spots including Alexandria Bay on Queensland's Sunshine Coast and The Neck in Tasmania to take the top spot for 2022. Tourism Australia's beach ambassador, Brad Farmer, said Misery Beach was world-class. ""It is a stunning beach,"" he said. ""It just ticks all the boxes of what the typical beachgoer is looking for — uncrowded, crystal-white sand, turquoise waters and a very dramatic granite backdrop. ""Albany is a fascinating place to go exploring for other beautiful beaches in that south-west region."" Mr Farmer said the story of how Misery Beach got its name was one of the compelling reasons for the accolade. A major whaling station operated just two beaches away until 1978. Whale offal would wash ashore, staining the white sand and clear waters blood red. Menang elder Vernice Gilles said during her childhood the beach was not good for swimming due to the whale blood and fat in the water. ""They would dump all the whales' teeth,"" Ms Gilles said. ""I remember walking on the beach and seeing piles and piles of whales' teeth."" Ms Gilles said Misery Beach was historically good for spearing fish and camping. ""When the old warriors were hunting they would drive the kangaroos towards the beach and into the ocean where they could spear and catch them, so that was an important area,"" she said. Two years ago, WA slammed its doors shut and went its own way. Those days may be numbered, despite the state's delayed reopening. The Tourism Australia list has not been without controversy over the years. In 2020 it ranked inland Wagga Beach – 270 kilometres from the New South Wales coast – at in ninth spot. Mr Farmer said many of Australia's famous beaches were ""fatigued and overexposed"". ""I'm really looking at the nooks and crannies and the stories and the communities that make a 'best beach',"" he said. ""People are looking for quirky and out-of-the-box beaches."" Western Australia's hard border had increased interest in the state's beaches, Mr Farmer said. ""The longer you lock us out the more we want to come,"" he said. ""There's a lot of cabin fever and a lot of envy. ""As soon as you open the border, you'll get an onslaught of visitors who love WA's coastline."" While Misery Beach has been relatively unknown nationally until now, Albany's Brad Mostert said he had long been a fan. ""The colour of the beach, the sand and everything — it ticks all the boxes,"" he said. ""There's not much more you could ask for."" Fellow beachgoer and Canadian tourist Cat Wyszomirski agreed. ""(It's) unlike any other beach I've seen,"" she said. ""It's amazing.""

209,Could this technology help curb climate change and earn Australia billions?,environment," Science Direct air capture machines suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Are they part of the solution to climate change? On a barren lava plateau in Iceland stands an entirely new kind of industrial facility that sucks carbon dioxide from the air and traps it in stone. The world's first commercial direct air capture (DAC) plant is designed to remove thousands of tonnes of greenhouse gas every year and then inject it deep underground. Technology like this has been mooted for years but faced huge engineering challenges and, until recently, was dismissed as a costly fantasy. Now the first plants are coming online, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognising that, even if the world reduces its ongoing emissions as quickly as possible, there will still be too much CO2 in the atmosphere to avoid catastrophic levels of global warming. In short, the IPCC says, the world needs to both reduce future emissions and remove historical ones to reach a safe climate. Experts say DAC could become a trillion-dollar global industry — if it can be deployed at scale. So how does DAC work, what's the future of the carbon removal industry, and is this an opportunity for renewables-rich Australia? When Deanna D'Alessandro, a professor of chemistry at the University of Sydney, encountered the idea of mechanical carbon removal, she wondered if there wasn't a simpler solution. There are nearly 800 carbon offset projects across Australia. But do they really stack up? A tree, of course, is a pre-existing and relatively cheap technology that sequesters CO2 in wood and other biomass. When scaled up, it's called a forest. ""My first thought was why not plant more trees,"" Professor D'Alessandro said. ""And then I did the numbers and stood in awe of them."" By her own calculations, using reforesting to capture Australia's CO2 emissions for two years (about 1 billion tonnes), would require an area of land equivalent to the size of New South Wales. DAC could do the same with 99.7 per cent less space, she said. ""Not only do we not have the land, we don't have the water to achieve natural sequestration."" Mark Howden, director of the Climate Change Institute at the Australian National University, agrees. ""The science is very clear that to keep temperatures down to [an increase of] 1.5C, we not only need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we also have to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere,"" he said. ""It's increasingly clear that doing that just from planting trees and relying on farmers and soil carbon is not enough."" DAC is just one of several proposed technologies designed to remove emissions from the atmosphere, which also include repurposing offshore oil and gas platforms to grow seaweed and turn it into fire-resilient bricks. So, DAC works a little bit like a household dehumidifier, but instead of stripping water out of the air, it removes carbon dioxide. The greatest challenge, says Professor D'Alessandro, is processing enough air to capture a significant amount of CO2, given the gas makes up just 0.04 per cent of the air we breathe. ""To be frank, it's been one of the most interesting scientific problems in chemistry in the past 10 years,"" Professor D'Alessandro said. There are generally two approaches. In the first, a fan pulls air into a structure lined with thin plastic surfaces that have potassium hydroxide solution flowing over them. The solution chemically binds with the CO2 molecules, removing them from the air and trapping them in the liquid solution as a carbonate salt. In the second method, a sponge-like filter absorbs CO2 and is then reheated to release the gas into storage. In the case of the plant in Iceland, the captured CO2 is injected about a kilometre underground into volcanic rock. Over two years, it reacts with the basalt to form a solid carbonate material. But underground storage isn't the only option, Professor Howden said. ""Probably the dumbest thing we can do with captured CO2 is put it in the ground,"" he said. ""To my mind, if we've gone to the bother of capturing CO2, why not treat it as a resource?"" Another DAC company, Canada's Carbon Engineering, plans to use captured CO2 as an input to make carbon-neutral synthetic fuels that can substitute for diesel, petrol or jet fuel. Other proposals include using CO2 in cement production and plastics manufacturing, which could make buildings and water bottles carbon negative. CCS involves capturing CO2 at the site of production, such as a gas liquefaction plant or coal-fired power station, and then pumping it deep underground. Part of Australia's net zero by 2050 plan is to use carbon capture and storage to help get emissions down. But is it a realistic option? Instead of filtering the air, it filters emissions from a smokestack. Although the Australian government has singled CCS out as a priority technology for emissions reduction, critics have said it's a failure. One of the major problems is CO2 leaking from underground reservoirs. With DAC, there's a much lower risk of leakage, Professor Howden said. ""With standard CCS you're restricted in the geology to somewhere close to the point of combustion, whereas you can put a DAC system anywhere, so you find geology that's suitable and locate it there."" DAC would need to be enormously scaled up to be useful. Even if the world reaches net zero by 2050, it will still be necessary to remove 5 to 14 billion tonnes of CO2 per year from the atmosphere from 2030 onwards to keep global warming below the 1.5C limit set by the Paris Agreement, according to a University of Melbourne report. The DAC plant in Iceland, which is the world's biggest, can capture and remove 4,000 metric tonnes of CO2 a year. That's about 10 million times less than annual global emissions. At our current level of emissions, humanity is cancelling out the plant's yearly efforts every three seconds. Daniel Egger, the chief commercial officer of Climeworks, the operator of the Iceland facility, said the company was on track for ""megaton capacity"" by the second half of this decade. ""To be an effective solution for climate change, an entire carbon removal industry will need to develop over a period of the next 10 to 20 years, creating capacities of at least 5 billion tonnes of carbon removal by 2050,"" he said. Professor Howden estimated DAC would ultimately account for a more modest amount of carbon removal. ""DAC of 1 to 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 a year is potentially feasible,"" he said. DAC is currently prohibitively expensive, mainly due to the cost of energy. Climeworks has priced its DAC offsets at about $US775 ($1,094) a tonne and says this will fall as low as $US250 ($353) by the end of the decade. The US Department of Energy recently announced a goal of slashing the cost to $US100 per tonne ($141) by the end of the decade. That's still a lot more expensive than offsetting CO2 by planting trees, which costs as little as $US20 ($28) per tonne. So who's paying Climeworks a premium for DAC offsets? ""We have an array of corporate clients such as Stripe, Audi, Shopify, Microsoft, Swiss Re, Boston Consulting Group,"" Mr Egger said. Microsoft, for instance, has committed to going carbon negative by 2030 and is investing $US1 billion ($1.4 billion) from 2020 to 2024 to ""stimulate and accelerate the development of carbon removal technology."" There are several proposed DAC projects in Australia, but nothing yet at a commercial scale. Energy giant Santos struck a deal with CSIRO last November to trial the government agency's new DAC technology in South Australia. That same month, Elon Musk's philanthropic research foundation awarded a University of Sydney team $250,000 to develop solar-powered DAC modules the size and shape of a two-person tent. These could be deployed in non-arable parts of Australia with high levels of solar radiation, said Professor D'Alessandro, a member of the team. A start-up named Southern Green Gas (SGG) plans to produce and deploy at least some of these modules by the end of the year. Australia's abundant solar energy makes it an ideal location for DAC, Professor Howden said. ""DAC takes a lot of energy, so increasingly that will be sourced from renewables. ""And, increasingly, renewables are getting cheaper and cheaper and, at some times of the day, the costs are negative."" But, according to Professor Howden, for the industry to prosper, it will need a price on carbon and more research funding for universities. It will also need public support, as the solar panels and wind-capture systems used for DAC will take up land. ""Would the public like those sorts of things dotted across the landscape?"" Professor Howden said. ""We need to put in place [systems of support for DAC] early and that requires proactivity, which requires vision and foresight. ""If we're smart about this, this could be a billion-dollar earner for Australia."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

210,"Great Barrier Reef 'seen from outer space, not an office in Paris', says Minister rebuking UNESCO's warning",environment,"  Great Barrier Reef to receive another $1 billion in funding to save jobs and environment The Environment Minister has taken a jab at the United Nations' environmental body over its warning it may list the Great Barrier Reef as ""in danger"", at the same time as the federal government has announced $1 billion in new money for the reef. The government is committing an extra $1 billion to  improving water quality, reef management and research, as it seeks to avoid a ruling that the future of the reef is under threat. Environment Minister Sussan Ley, who successfully held off UNESCO from deeming the reef ""in danger"" last year, hinted that the body was ignorant in making the warning. ""You can see the reef from outer space, but not from an office in Paris,"" Ms Ley said. ""The point I made when I visited European world heritage ambassadors last year is, 'Come and have a look.'"" The government hopes the new funding will help protect more than 64,000 jobs and $6.4 billion in tourism dollars attached to the reef economy. More than half of the funding will go towards improving water quality through remediating erosion, improving land condition and reducing nutrient and pesticide run-off. Ms Ley said the $1 billion package would be managed by her department and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and would be delivered through local communities and industries, including traditional owners. ""Our farmers, tourism operators and fishers are our reef champions and we are supporting them through practical water and land-based strategies that will contribute significantly to the health of the reef,"" Ms Ley said. Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Brisbane radio station 4BC the additional funding would not just protect the reef but also the livelihoods of tourism businesses that rely on it. ""There's 64,000 jobs that are dependent on that reef and so its health is about the economic health of that region as well as the natural health of that region,"" he said. The federal government has faced calls to increase its efforts to preserve the Great Barrier Reef, since UNESCO warned last year it intended to list the reef as ""in danger"". The government successfully staved off an immediate listing, but the reef still faces the prospect of being listed as ""in danger"". Australia stopped the Great Barrier Reef being immediately listed as ""in danger"", but the government is under mounting pressure to demonstrate how it's tackling climate change. The World Heritage Committee has asked UNESCO to undertake a monitoring mission but Ms Ley said they have not yet visited Australia. ""I've written to UNESCO. I've invited the reactive monitoring mission to come and look forward to further correspondence indicating that they will visit,"" she told the ABC. ""I look forward to the reactive monitoring mission coming to Australia and seeing for themselves how our reef communities are working hard [and] are practising the strongest possible reef management."" The federal government was also required to submit a report to UNESCO by next month that outlines how it is protecting the reef and, Ms Ley said, the report was on track to be sent soon. Shadow Environment Minister Terri Butler said the government had waited too long to act on the reef. ""It shouldn't take five minutes to midnight, an election campaign and a UNESCO report to get this government to act on the reef, and frankly they need to do more on climate change,"" Ms Butler said. ""The government's announcement is for funding over 10 years or so— we don't even know how much of this money is supposed to be spent immediately, and how much is going to be spent in years seven, eight or nine. ""Australians are going to judge this government on what they have done over the past decade, not what they say they are going to do in a decade's time."" The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's chair has previously warned the health of the reef will continue to deteriorate without climate action. Greens senator Larissa Waters said the ""belated cash splash"" was a distraction from the government's inaction on climate change. ""Climate policy is the most important factor in saving the reef, and the government's policy is crap,"" Senator Waters said. Liberal senator Gerard Rennick, a climate sceptic who has been withholding his vote in a bid to pressure his own party to force states to drop vaccine mandates, has also criticised the funding announcement. ""It’s unnecessary funding and this money could be prioritised elsewhere at a time when the nation has more critical issues to address, such as infrastructure spending and rural health,"" Senator Rennick said. ""Where is the data that justifies spending it beyond appeasing the United Nations?"" A study by James Cook University in 2020 found the Great Barrier Reef had lost more than half its corals since 1995. Mr Morrison said the Great Barrier Reef was ""the best-managed reef in the world"", and the new funding was on top of $2 billion already invested in its sustainability plan. ""We are backing the health of the reef and the economic future of tourism operators, hospitality providers and Queensland communities [who] are at the heart of the reef economy,"" Mr Morrison said. The government said it would direct scientific research funding to projects such as coral seeding, reef stabilisation, the development of heat-resistant coral and climate adaptation work with turtles and other marine species.

211,Cooking with gas? Research finds health and emission risks even when stoves are off,environment," Science Cooking with gas? Research finds health and emission risks even when stoves are off Leaking methane from natural gas-burning stove tops is releasing the greenhouse-gas equivalent of hundreds of thousands of cars, and cooking on gas stovetops is posing a risk to health, according to new research. In findings that have taken researchers by surprise, more than three quarters of methane emissions from stovetops were leaking into houses while the appliances were not in use. They're the results from a study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, which looked at natural-gas emissions from stovetops in households in the United States. The researchers are hoping to replicate the study in Australia, and believe the US results are largely comparable with the situation here. ""COVID-willing, we hope to sample in Australia over the next year or two, probably in 2023,"" said study co-author, Professor Robert Jackson from Stanford University. ""Our biggest surprise was that most of the methane we measured leaked to the air while the stoves were off."" While the rate of methane leakage was higher while the stoves were in use, the amount of time spent not in use meant the overall volume of methane leaked was greatest during this time. Previous studies have found methane emissions from gas stovetops to be lower than this one, but they only measured emissions when the stoves were on, Professor Jackson said. According to today's results, gas leaks from stovetop cookers in 40 million homes in the US produced about 28,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases every year, or the equivalent of the emissions from around 500,000 petrol cars. That's comparing methane and vehicle emissions over a 20-year period. The research did not include finding where the leaks were coming from, but Professor Jackson said they most likely originated from leaking fittings or couplings near the stoves. The researchers based their projections on the emissions from stovetops from 53 homes across California. While methane is emitted while the stove is not in use, nitrous oxides and fine particulate matter (as well as methane) are released during combustion. They build up quickly in the household while the stoves are on and contribute to respiratory diseases, especially in children and the vulnerable, according to public health physician Dr Kate Charlesworth. ""Children are for a range of reasons more at risk from air pollution,"" said Dr Charlesworth, who also works at the Climate Council. ""They have smaller lungs … and a higher respiratory rate."" She worried that equity issues meant that more vulnerable individuals and renters may be most impacted. ""It's the most vulnerable that are being hit hardest — the young, the elderly, the asthmatic,"" Dr Charlesworth said. Energy and climate change policy expert Donna Green from UNSW said she wasn't surprised by the findings, and the fact we're still burning fossil fuels in our homes ""is nuts"". ""We'll be in shock in decade's time that we actually did this,"" Associate Professor Green said. ""There's no excuse other than a lack of awareness and a really good campaign by the fossil fuel industry to sell us something we [don't need]. ""Every [house] from now on should be putting in induction, especially because the price of induction stove tops is so cheap now."" The Climate Council published a report last year that estimated that cooking with gas was responsible for around 12 per cent of the ""burden of childhood asthma"" and was comparable to household cigarette smoke. The issue of fugitive gas emissions from post-meter appliances is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Australia's overall methane emissions, according to Tim Baxter, a climate solutions researcher with the Climate Council. There is little monitoring of fugitive gas emissions in Australia — from the point of extraction, right through the supply chain — and it's very probable that we're underestimating our methane emissions as a result, he said. ""[This research] is certainly not surprising,"" Mr Baxter said. ""This is a broadly unmeasured problem and it's an instance of what is not measured is not managed."" ""This [starts at] the very, very broad scale — entire gas basins,""  he said. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of more than 80 times that of carbon dioxide over its first 20 years. However, it doesn't persist in the atmosphere for as long as CO2. Based on its global warming potential and current rates of emission, methane is considered the second-most significant greenhouse gas behind CO2. Satellite data analysis from a London-based data analytics company last year raised serious questions about the accuracy of Australia's methane emissions reporting. According to their analysis of mines in the Bowen Basin, Australia had only accounted for about one third of our methane emissions from the region. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. At the time, a spokesperson for The Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources said the department was developing its own national methane monitoring system using Sentinel data. Dr Charlesworth said the health and climate impact of methane meant that moving from gas to electric and induction stovetops was an imperative in decarbonising. ""At the very least, open windows, use an extraction fan, keep the kids out of the kitchen. ""From a health perspective, as a doctor and mother, there's a double impact from gas. ""Not only is it a major source of health pollution in peoples' homes, but it's also a fossil fuel."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

212,Ghostly monkeys and succulent bamboo among 224 newly discovered Mekong region species,environment,"  Ghostly monkeys and succulent bamboo among 224 newly discovered Mekong region species A devil-horned newt, drought-resilient bamboo and a monkey named after a volcano were among 224 new species discovered in the Greater Mekong region in 2020, a conservation group has said, despite the ""intense threat"" of habitat loss. The discoveries listed in a report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) include a new rock gecko found in Thailand, a mulberry tree species in Vietnam, and a big-headed frog in Vietnam and Cambodia that is already threatened by deforestation. WWF said the 224 discoveries underlined the rich biodiversity of the Mekong region — which encompasses Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam — and was testament to the resilience of nature in surviving in fragmented and degraded natural habitats. ""These species are extraordinary, beautiful products of millions of years of evolution, but are under intense threat, with many species going extinct even before they are described,"" WWF-Greater Mekong's regional lead for wildlife and wildlife crime, K Yoganand, said. The Mekong region is a biodiversity hotspot and home to tigers, Asian elephants, saola — an extremely rare animal also called the Asian unicorn or spindlehorn — and thousands of other species. Many of them are among the world's most endangered species, at risk of habitat destruction, diseases from human activities and the illegal wildlife trade. A United Nations report last year said wildlife trafficking in South-East Asia was creeping back after a temporary disruption thanks to COVID-19 restrictions, which saw countries shut borders and tighten surveillance. The new species were found in 2020 but last year's report was delayed. Including this latest list, scientists have identified more than 3,000 new species in the region since 1997, the WWF said. Among the latest discoveries are dozens of newly identified reptiles, frogs, newts, fish and 155 plant species, including the only known succulent bamboo species, found in Laos. Scientists used measurements and samples from museum collections to compare and identify key differences with features of the newly discovered animals and plants, the report said. Introducing the report, University of Cologne's institute of zoology's curator, Thomas Ziegler, said studying such differences can help determine the range of species and threats to their survival. Identifying new species is tricky, though, and sometimes can only be determined using a variety of methods, such as frog calls and genetic data used to distinguish the Cardamom leaf little frog, found high up in the Cardamom mountains in a wildlife refuge. Some species are found in more than one country, including the bright orange twin slug snake, which consumes slugs The only new mammal was a monkey with ghostly white circles around its eyes. It was named Popa langur as it was discovered on the steep hillsides of the extinct Mount Popa volcano in Myanmar. The Popa langur was identified based on genetic matching of recently gathered bones with specimens from Britain's Natural History Museum collected more than a century ago, the report said. Two main distinguishing characteristics were the broad white rings around its eyes and its front-pointing whiskers. Working with Fauna and Flora International (FFI), the WWF caught images of the monkeys using camera traps in 2018 and FFI reported the discovery late last year. The monkey is a candidate to be listed as a critically endangered species on the Red List of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the report said, since only 200-250 are thought to survive in the wild, in a handful of places. Underscoring the urgency of such work, more than 38,000 of the 138,000 species the IUCN tracks are threatened with extinction. A new type of begonia with reddish flowers and a berry-like fruit also was found in the uplands of Myanmar, where illegal mining and logging have become an increasingly dire threat in the country, which is in the middle of political turmoil following a military takeover a year ago. Despite human encroachments on tropical forests and other wild zones, much of the Greater Mekong is still little explored and each year dozens of new species are found — a glimmer of hope as so many species go extinct. Not all new species are found deep in jungles. One of the new plant species is a ginger plant called “stink bug"" for its pungent odour — similar to the big beetles Thais use to make a kind of chili dipping paste served with rice — the report said. It was found in north-eastern Thailand, in a plant shop.

213,Regional Victorian Indigenous artefacts feature in world premiere,environment,"  World premiere for The Lake of Scars documentary to screen next month A documentary film about efforts to preserve Indigenous scar trees and artefacts in the Lake Boort area of northern Victoria will get its world premiere at the Antenna International Documentary Film Festival next month. Six years in the making, The Lake of Scars centres on the passion of local historian Paul Haw in creating a Keeping Place for hundreds of artefacts he has collected and stored in his shed, and his close work with the Dja Dja Wurrung people — specifically the Yung Balug clan — to highlight and conserve the largest collection of scar trees in the world. Director and co-producer Bill Code said he became fascinated after hearing about the story. ""I saw Paul's passion, I saw his relationship with Uncle Gary Murray and other members of the Yung Balug clan,"" he said. ""I guess I also saw, not just a fascinating archaeological and cultural site which is obviously super important to members of the clan, but also a really interesting environmental story."" In recent years, Mr Haw has spearheaded the planting of about 3,000 red gums on the lake in a restoration effort. ""In my opinion, to be a true Australian, or better Australian, you've got to learn about the First Australians,"" he said. ""It was really interesting to meld the history, the environment — and what I think Paul would agree was a slow push for him over many decades — perhaps getting some people on board who might not have been so on board at the start."" Mr Haw said that a near-death experience while serving in the Vietnam war gave him the push to investigate the history of Indigenous Australians. ""I had to serve two years in Vietnam in 1968. I saw a lot of Aboriginal blokes in our unit and I thought, 'they're no different to me,' what's going on? ""I was involved with a minefield and a mine went off and killed two and wounded five and I had a near-death experience. ""That changes your outlook on life forever, and those two main experiences made me realise when I got back to Australia what rich Aboriginal history we had around here."" One of the other characters featured in the documentary is Jida Gulpilil, son of legendary actor David Gulpilil Ridjimiraril Dalaithngu (previously known as David Gulpilil). ""Jida's mother is from Dja Dja Wurrung country, a member of the Yung Balug clan, and he was on country for a few years working with the Dja Dja Wurrung Corporation, so he became a character in the film,"" Mr Code said. ""He made a fantastic score with well-known composer David Bridie, so it was lovely to get Dja Dja Wurrung language on the soundtrack as well."" Ngarra Murray, an eighth generation Yung Balug woman from the Dja Dja Wurrung nation was a cultural advisor for the film and said it is an important story of allyship and conservation, caring for country, the practice of culture, and reconciliation. ""There's been a lot of ups and downs with our relationships in the area between black and white, but the film kind of navigates through all of that,""  Ms Murray said. ""It shows a really amazing story of the relationship between Paul Haw, a very respected and principled man, and my cousin Jida Gulpilil and his story."" The film also highlights the significance of the environment, which Ms Murray likens to the Northern Territory's Kakadu National Park. ""It's a place of astounding beauty, with hundreds of scarred trees and artefacts and significant sites."" ""This is a film about working together, and we all wanted from the outset to be making sure we were putting into practice what we were talking about,"" said Mr Code, ""To make the film has been a challenge and a huge privilege.""

214,'The most littered place in the NT': CDU researcher calls for clean-up on Wessel Islands,environment,"  Calls for clean-up to remove plastic waste piling up on the Wessel Islands, off Arnhem Land It should be a pristine stretch of Northern Territory, but the Wessel Islands archipelago is being choked by plastic waste, and Charles Darwin University researchers and rangers say the problem is only worsening. The archipelago, which lies just off the coast of Arnhem Land, is renowned for its picturesque beauty, but also as a biodiversity hotspot, and a haven for several endangered species. However, growing amounts of plastic waste are washing up on its beaches, putting all of that at risk, according to  Charles Darwin University research fellow Carol Palmer. ""I would say the archipelago is the most-littered place in the Northern Territory, if not Northern Australia,""Dr Palmer said. Dr Palmer said she first noticed the plastic waste on a visit in 2011 and, since then, she had seen more and more rubbish of all kinds washing up. ""The amount of plastics, fishing gear [and] ghost nets was astounding,"" she said. Photos show plastic bottles, cartons, foam and even a battered, sun-bleached toy scooter littering one of the archipelago's beaches. ""Certainly, working with both the traditional owners and the Gumurr Marthakal Rangers, we all agreed that this has never, ever been recorded at this level before."" Executive officer of the Gumurr Marthakal Rangers, Marcus Lacey, said westerly winds during the wet season brought the plastic in from the Timor Sea, which was then dumped onto the islands during dry season winds. Dr Palmer said she had been also been surprised by the increase of ghost nets washing up, abandoned nets that could stretch for kilometres, snagging fish and other marine life. ""It would be really great to do a review of what is the percentage of the netting, the plastics, to work out where it's from,"" she said. ""Because it's not just all Asian. It's certainly Australian gear too."" The Gumurr Marthakal Rangers have managed the area around the Wessel Islands since 2016, and Mr Lacey also has a strong family connection to the islands. ""The waste is worse than it has ever been, and its continuing to get worse after every wet season,"" he said. But, because of the isolation and limited resources, it's not a problem the rangers can tackle alone and, Dr Palmer says, it will not be an easy fix. ""It's very expensive to try [to] sort out, and requires a really big planning process,"" she said. ""To do the first clean-up will probably be the biggest clean-up in Australia I would say."" Dr Palmer said the task would be further complicated because most of the work would need to be boat-based, and required cooperation between traditional owners and rangers, scientists, government and non-government organisations. ""It does require good funding and ongoing funding, not just a couple of years. It's actually long-term funding so we can actually maintain this."" Mr Lacey is also calling a permanent ranger station there, after the last permanent settlement was destroyed by Tropical Cyclone Monica in 2006. ""To give people, and traditional owners, a chance to have access to their country, and to care for it,"" he said.

215,Being in the great outdoors is good for body and mind — but so is 'simulated' nature,environment," Health Time in nature is good for our mental health … but what about artificial nature? Take a moment and imagine yourself in nature — whether it's walking in a rainforest, bushwalking, swimming in the ocean, or a moment of wonder at the animals and plants around us. Do you feel it? You might feel relaxed and less stressed by experiencing yourself being in contact with nature. Nature offers us a respite from the daily grind of routines and demands. This innate desire to connect with our natural environments is labelled ""biophilia hypothesis"" — a term put forward by sociobiologist Edward Wilson in 1984. Research has found that spending time in natural settings is linked to: How do we derive such positive experiences from being in nature? Now, many cultures have their own complex connections to nature, but from the Western scientific school of thought at least, two major theories help us understand this connection. From the Snowy River to Central Australia, respect and connectedness to the land are key Indigenous values. First, Attention Restoration Theory is the idea that natural settings restore our attention. We can only focus our attention for a certain period of time before feeling mentally fatigued. Natural environments tend to provide greater recovery from attention fatigue, and they restore cognitive resources depleted by everyday routine activities more than other types of non-green and/or built environments. This sense of ""restorativeness"" improves our sense of wellbeing, and breaks the routine of our everyday life, and helps explain some of the relationship between eco-connectedness and better psychological wellbeing. Second, Stress Reduction Theory explains this positive link via promoting recovery from stress (which is different from attention fatigue). This is important for our survival and helps us better adapt to our surroundings. Stress Reduction Theory specifically focuses on how natural settings can reduce physiological stress and aversive emotion. In other words, natural environments, due to their calm and pleasant aesthetic quality, provide a stress-reducing response that helps with releasing tension. We've evolved to respond positively to non-threatening, natural settings. For our ancestors, these environments would have increased the chances of survival because they provided opportunities for reproduction, food and shelter. Our emotional responses to stimuli we find aesthetically pleasing, like green spaces, tend to decrease arousal responses (such as decrease in blood pressure, normal breathing pattern). This makes us feel relaxed and reduces stress levels. So, the next step in understanding this link is — does virtual contact with nature mimic this positive effect? The answer is that experiences of nature don't have to take place in-person. A study that brought together data from 32 previous studies reported that while people got the most psychological benefit from physical exposure to nature, exposure to simulated natural environments — such as film or virtual reality — had a comparable effect. Benefits seem to depend on the type of nature experience. Research from my lab has looked at the interactive virtual reality (VR) experience. We allocated people into two different groups: natural environment versus urban environment. They got VR headsets that provided full 360-degree immersion, along with corresponding directed sound. What we found was that a virtual experience of a natural environment resulted in higher levels of positive mood and greater attention restoration compared to a virtual reality experience of an urban environment. In another study from my research lab, we tested whether virtual contact with wild nature versus urban nature improved mood differently. People saw different videos on a screen, depending on the group they were in. The wild nature video featured rainforest and dry sclerophyll forest scenes filmed in Mt Glorious, Brisbane. The urban nature video showed public parks and gardens in Brisbane suburban areas; and our non-nature control condition video showed urban built environments (in two suburban areas in Brisbane). There are two ways to measure improvements in ""mood"": by increases in positive mood or by reductions in negative mood. We found that the effect of nature exposure on our wellbeing varied depending on the type of nature (wild versus urban) and was not the same for positive mood and negative mood. We found that a virtual experience of wild nature (natural settings, such as wilderness with little human interference) improved positive mood. By contrast, a virtual experience of urban nature (such as parks in urbanised areas) reduced negative mood. Both are good outcomes, but we can all agree that the first is better to have a net gain in positivity.

A podcast that opens a window on the beautiful sounds of the Australian wilderness. Promoting exposure to virtual natural environments seems like an effective way to improve psychological wellbeing. For many, actual contact with nature may be inconvenient, or not readily available. Maybe you're a resident in an aged care facility, or you live in an urban area. For these people, simulations can help improve urban and indoor environments where access to nature is limited, such as hospitals, urban offices, apartments, and inner-city schools. This might mean displaying photographs and videos of natural colours and patterns, installing living green walls, or placing potted plants in areas people move through every day. We need to recognise the role of biodiversity and ecosystems in maintaining our quality of life beyond just what we can physically harvest from them. Understanding nature's contributions helps inform nature-based health interventions that provide accessible, cost-effective ways of improving psychological wellbeing. Fairy-wrens have probably landed a spot in your heart, but how much do you know about these spectacular birds? This recognition that nature can provide benefits represents a major shift in public health thinking for both the prevention and the treatment of health issues. In a meta-analysis conducted in 2019, researchers found that nature-based mindfulness intervention resulted in positive outcomes, with moderate associations with positive psychological wellbeing outcomes. This study also suggested that natural environments — ""wild"" nature — such as forests, resulted in significantly larger effects than human-made natural environments like gardens or urban parks. Knowledge of the benefits of nature also provides an avenue for communicating the detrimental impacts of climate change on our natural environments, and on our mental health. Many people are now reporting having climate anxiety or eco-anxiety; and my hypothesis is that it is due to the realisation that [climate change?] is disrupting our connection with nature. But maybe there's an opportunity here. If we can understand our deep connection with nature and various psychological benefits we get by connecting with it, it becomes personally relevant to look after our environment. It motivates people, who may otherwise be disengaged or dismissive of negative impacts of climate change, to protect and conserve natural habitats and threatened ecosystems. To improve our psychological wellbeing, we need to help protect and improve our natural environments — an outcome where we all win.

216,Firefighters to work along forest fire's perimeter in south-east South Australia as temperatures soar,environment,"  Firefighters to work along forest fire's perimeter near Lucindale as temperatures soar More than 100 firefighters will continue to tackle a forest fire near Lucindale in the South East of South Australia today amid soaring temperatures and potentially dangerous weather conditions. More than 165 firefighters, including strike teams, worked overnight to halt the spread of the fire burning in the Coles area in bluegum plantations. Additional resources will be brought in today to work along the fire's perimeter to battle any flare-ups or breaks in containment lines. Temperatures are expected to hit mid-30 degrees Celsius today in the Lucindale district. Residents in the area are urged to remain on alert amid potentially changing conditions. CFS regional duty officer Jason Druwitt said the fire was burning through plantations and slash. He said the fire was located about 20 kilometres south of Lucindale. ""Conditions today are going to be pretty testing. We've got a total fire ban in the lower south-east,"" Mr Druwitt said. ""We're going to see winds and temperatures picking up today. So, crews have put a lot of emphasis on the southern area. That's where the main pressure point is going to be today. ""Conditions will be challenging out there. But we've got over 140 crews, 40 fire trucks, and four water bombers coming down to help secure this fire."" Mr Druwitt said local crews would also be bolstered by a number of strike teams travelling from other parts of the state. ""Given the conditions today the main pressure is going to be if the fire was to break containment lines and will be pushing south,"" he said. ""I'm not aware of any assets directly in the path of fire on the southern direction."" Fire crews on the ground described conditions yesterday as ""challenging"" with multiple containment lines breached. ""The area was brought under control with assistance from a second strike team from Tatiara. A few tired members and one filthy truck now,"" said the Yahl CFS. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC South East SA's weekly email newsletter. ABC Emergency brings warnings and coverage of emergencies to one place before, during and after times of crisis and disaster. In a statement, CFS media said heavy plant machinery was used to create mineral earth breaks around the fire's perimeter. ""Further crews will be brought in today to continue working along the fire's perimeter and to actively fight any areas that may flare up due to the daytime weather forecast,"" the statement said. ""An increase in temperature and wind over the next two days is expected which could hinder the efforts of crews on the ground."" CFS crews will be supported by farm fire units, forest industry crews including PF Olsen and Australian Bluegum Plantations crews, heavy plant machinery, and aerial firefighting resources. ""The fire continues to burn in the plantation, including areas known as bluegum slash consisting of old stumps and debris remaining on the ground, and surrounding grassland,"" the CFS said. While overnight conditions eased, the CFS said there were still areas of active fire, and smoke would continue to be seen and smelled by residence in the areas to the south, south-west, and west. ""The community is reminded to stay vigilant and monitor conditions throughout the next few days as it's expected that the conditions will continuously change,"" the statement said.

217,1 in 3 mouthfuls of food we eat relies on pollinators. Pollution could be putting that at risk,environment," Science Air pollution reduces ability for butterflies and bees to pollinate flowers and crops, study finds A study looking at the impacts of common air pollutants has found that flower pollination is significantly lower where pollution is present. In a controlled field trial, the abundance of bees, flies, moths and butterflies and how often they visited flowers was far lower in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone (03), compared to plots where those pollutants were absent. Nitrogen oxides mostly come from agricultural emissions but are also produced when fossil fuels are burnt. Combined with sunlight and volatile organic compounds, they can form ground-level ozone (O3). According to the researchers, whose paper was published today in the journal Environmental Pollution, the pollinators that appeared to be most affected were those species that rely on smell to detect flowers. And it appears that vital pollinators are impacted the most. ""We found that those groups of pollinators that are most important [like] solitary bees, bumblebees, honey bees, were most affected in general,"" Dr James Ryalls and Dr Robbie Girling from the University of Reading told the ABC. ""But some species within those groups may be less affected than other species, depending on how heavily they rely on odour cues."" The presence of air pollution, even at levels lower than US national guidelines, appeared to be interfering with the insects' ability to sniff out flowers and could reduce rates of pollination in areas where air pollution is high, they said. ""The decreases in flower visitation due to air pollution were almost certainly associated with the disruption of floral odour cues."" ""Air pollution levels often exceed these guidelines in agricultural settings, especially if they are near major roadways. ""If this problem is demonstrated more widely and grows in severity, it is certainly likely to have negative consequences for the yields of many insect-pollinated crops."" While the researchers said they anticipated their field trial to concur with previous laboratory studies, they weren't expecting such strong results. ""We were surprised by how severe the decline in pollinator abundance and flower visitation was under air pollution. ""Especially considering the relatively moderate levels of air pollution that were used."" To get their findings, the scientists used generators to pump low levels of ozone, nitrogen oxide, and a combination of the two into plots in a field. They also had ""control"" plots without any pollutants pumped in. The plots were filled with black mustard plants (Brassica nigra) and observers tallied the number and species of insect visitations to flowers across each plot. The yield of developed and undeveloped flowers was also calculated at the end of the trial, and efforts were made to control for variables, including rotating the plots and measuring insect abundance in the absence of flowers. The presence of air pollution reduced the overall abundance of seven pollinator groups, but not for three groups — beetles, true bugs and parasitic wasps. But even with the continued abundance of those three groups, overall pollinator numbers were reduced by 62 per cent and flower visitation by 83 per cent where pollutants were present. Ken Walker, senior curator of entomology at the Museum of Victoria, says some insects are what's known as oligolectic — they rely on a single species for food. Interfering with their capacity to find pollen could be very damaging to both the insect and the plants they pollinate, he said. ""The nose of insects is on their antennae,"" Dr Walker said. ""Anything that disrupts these chemoreceptors on the insects' noses will certainly make it harder to find food."" Dr Walker says there's quite a bit of evidence to suggest there's been a global decline in insects, but more research is needed. ""I hesitate to say it's been globally assured that it's happening. It probably is, but we just don't have the data,"" he said. ""There have been several studies — none in Australia — but there was a study done by amateurs collecting insects in nature reserves in Germany near agricultural areas. ""They found something like a 76 per cent reduction in insect biomass over 25 years."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. While pesticides and the conversion of wilderness to agricultural land have been implicated in the decline, Dr Walker says we're now becoming more aware of the impact of pollutants, including light pollution. ""There's been a lot of work done on polluters for human health, but very little has been done on insect health,"" he said. ""[But] we're now beginning to realise the effects on insects and pollinator health might be quite significant as well."" It's estimated that roughly one in three spoonfuls of food we eat has involved pollination in its production, Dr Walker said. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

218,"Tongans told to stay indoors to avoid inhaling volcanic ash that may devastate their environment for years, say scientists",environment,"  Two dead, Tongans told to stay indoors to avoid inhaling volcanic ash, as scientists warn of ongoing environmental devastation Two people are dead and Tonga's government is advising the public to remain indoors after the eruption of the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai volcano, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Around 2 centimetres of volcanic ash and dust has fallen on Tongatapu —Tonga's main island— since Saturday's eruption, which triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific Ocean. Ash in the air and on the ground has raised concerns about air pollution and the potential contamination of food and water supplies, the WHO said. Locals have been advised to drink bottled water and wear masks outdoors to avoid breathing in the ash. ""Thankfully, all health facilities on Tongatapu are fully functioning and clean-up efforts have been initiated,"" the WHO said. The volcanic eruption in Tonga on Saturday was massive. Here's what we know about why it was so big, whether it's going to erupt again soon, and if there are others we should be keeping an eye on. It said initial reports were that around 100 houses had been damaged and 50 completely destroyed on Tongatapu. ""Many [Tongans] remain displaced, with 89 people taking shelter in evacuation centres on the island of 'Eua and many more seeking shelter with relatives,"" the WHO said. ""The Ha'apai and Vava'u island groups … remain out of contact with the capital [Nuku'alofa]."" There were particular concerns about the smaller and low-lying islands of Mango and Fonoi in the Ha'apai group, the WHO said. Scientists have warned that volcanic ash could deliver long-lasting damage to coral reefs, erode coastlines and disrupt fisheries. Satellite imagery and social media posts capture the moments the underwater volcano off the coast of Tonga erupted, causing shock waves felt worldwide. The scientists have been studying satellite images and looking to the past to predict the future of the remote region. Since the initial eruption, the volcano has been releasing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide — two gases that create acid rain when they interact with water and oxygen in the atmosphere. With Tonga's tropical climate, ""there is likely to be acid rain around Tonga for a while to come"", according to volcanologist Shane Cronin from the University of Auckland. Acid rain causes widespread crop damage, and could ruin Tongan staples such as taro, corn, bananas and garden vegetables. ""Depending on how long the eruptions last, food security could be compromised,"" Professor Cronin said. Satellite imagery shows the plume from the volcano spreading westward, which means Tonga could be spared some of this acid rain, although Fiji could then be in its path. In a bulletin on Monday, the UN humanitarian affairs office said Fiji was monitoring its air quality, and had advised people to cover their household water tanks and stay indoors in the event of rain. Tonga's exclusive economic zone of nearly 700,000 marine square kilometres is 1,000 times larger than its land area. And most Tongans get their food — and livelihood — from the ocean. While scientists have yet to investigate on the ground, ""the few pictures that are available seem to show a blanket … of ash"" on land, according to Marco Brenna, a geologist from the University of Otago in New Zealand. In the ocean, that ash can be harmful to marine life. Weeks before Saturday's eruption, Tonga Geological Services had warned that nearby seawater was contaminated with toxic volcanic discharge, and that fishermen should ""assume fish in these waters are poisoned or poisonous"". Inevitably, the weekend's huge eruption has made the situation worse. Murky, ash-filled water near the volcano will deprive fish of food and wipe out spawning beds. Some fish will perish, and survivors will be forced to migrate, scientists said. Further, changes in the structure of the sea floor could create new obstacles for fishing vessels. ""It will be a while before the same or new fishing grounds will be restored,"" Dr Brenna said. Falling ash can also smother coral reefs that, in Tonga, are the mainstay of a tourism industry that brought in up to $5 million per year before the COVID-19 pandemic. Even before the eruption, Tonga's reefs were threatened by disease outbreaks and the effects of climate change, including coral bleaching and increasingly strong cyclones. Now, ""vast areas of the reefs in the immediate impact area at Hunga Tonga are probably buried and smothered by large deposits of volcanic ash"", according to Tom Schils, a marine biologist from the University of Guam who has studied volcanic eruptions and corals in the Northern Mariana Islands. Such eruptions also release more iron into the water, which can boost the growth of blue-green algae and sponges, which further degrade reefs. The colourful and constantly changing sky over Queensland had many people reaching for their cameras this morning. Reefs may have to start over — a process that could take years, according to Brian Zgliczynski, a coral reef ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ""Species more tolerant of poor water quality will arrive first,"" Dr Zgliczynski said. Meanwhile, hard corals and fish would take longer to return, he added. A loss of coral reefs would also affect Tonga's ability to cope with rising waters and storm surges. This is a concern for Tonga, where climate change is driving the sea level to rise by about 6 millimetres per year, double the global average. In a 2015 report, Tonga valued its natural storm buffers — including coral reefs as well as coastal seagrasses and mangroves — at some $11 million annually. With the latest eruption, a Tongan sea-level gauge recorded a tsunami wave of 1.19 metres before it stopped reporting. Tsunamis are known to cause rapid coastal erosion. And before communication systems went down, videos revealed damage to man-made seawalls. ""Coastal defences and reclaimed land could all be strongly impacted by the tsunami waves, leaving the islands more vulnerable,"" Professor Cronin said.

219,What happens next depends on the Tonga volcano's magma chamber. Here's what we know,environment," Science Tonga volcano: Why was it so big, and are there others we need to watch out for? When the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai volcano erupted in Tonga on Saturday, it sent a huge plume 30 kilometres into the sky and a literal shockwave around the world. Every week there are around 20 volcanoes ""showing some signs of unrest"" across the globe, but most are fairly mild, says Scott Bryan, a volcano researcher at the Queensland University of Technology. So what made this volcano so explosive, was the eruption predicted, will it erupt again soon, and are there other volcanoes we should be watching out for? The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano is what is known as a subduction volcano. Subduction zone volcanoes occur along tectonic plate boundaries where one plate is being forced down under another. Subduction volcanoes tend to have dual personalities, according to Professor Bryan. On the one hand, they have slow, passive eruptions that build the classic conical shape of volcanoes like Mt Fuji, and on the other they're violently explosive, as we've seen in Tonga. There are two factors that can lead to a highly explosive eruption, and although it's still too early to say definitively, it appears both factors may have been at play on Saturday. The first is a high concentration of pressurised water vapour and gases in the magma. When that magma hits the surface from deep underground, there's a sudden release of pressure ""like opening a champagne bottle"", which causes the gases to explosively expand, blasting apart the magma or lava in the process. In the case of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai, researchers had previously looked at the chemical composition of the volcano's lava sediment from an eruption in 2009. They found the lava had ingredients for a powerful explosion, according to Heather Handley, a volcanologist from Monash University who was involved with that research. ""We could see from the chemistry of the rocks that the magma of that eruption was moving to the surface quickly and keeping hold of its gas as well,"" Dr Handley said. The second factor that made the Tongan volcano so explosive was that it was a sub-surface volcano — its lava vent was under the ocean. When magma hits water, it causes an explosive interaction between the two as the water rapidly flashes to steam, Professor Bryan said. ""It's the external addition of the water and the heat of the magma coming into contact with it,"" he said. ""That flashes steam and that's driven the explosion."" The volcano's vent was above water before disappearing below sea level just a few days (or hours) prior to Saturday's catastrophic eruption, according to Dr Handley. ""The satellite images, if you compare from the 6th of January to two hours before the eruption, somewhere in that time frame the middle cone had gone,"" she said. A smaller eruption may have blown apart the cone, allowing the incursion of seawater into the vent, which then catalysed the larger eruption. But Professor Bryan suspects an underwater slip or collapse may have magnified the eruption and caused the tsunami that went with it. ""You need to displace ocean water to make tsunamis,"" he said. ""It's more than just the eruption. Something else has happened underwater that's triggered this explosion."" The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano was on a roughly 1,000-year eruption cycle, according to high-temperature geochemist Oliver Nebel of Monash University. But that doesn't mean we could have pinpointed with any real accuracy when it was going to erupt. ""We know … it's due [to erupt], but that could mean yesterday or it could be in 100 years,"" Dr Nebel said. But there were some signs Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai was becoming more active, he said. ""The volcano had erupted in recent days in the lead-up to the massive eruption."" Dr Handley said the volcano entered a phase of increased activity sometime around December 19-20. ""In the past few weeks, you've been seeing what we call phreatomagmatic eruptions, where water and magma are coming into contact,"" she said. ""You get these dark feathered plumes that come out."" According to the database of the Global Volcanism Program, gas steam and ash plumes had risen at least 12.2 kilometres into the air by late December, but activity had ""significantly decreased"" by early January. The difficulty in evacuating people when volcanoes enter more active phases is that often they may settle down again without a catastrophic eruption, Dr Nebel said. Evacuating people any time a volcano showed signs of activity would not only be costly, but it would lead to an erosion of public trust in scientists, he added. When a volcano like this erupts, it often happens as a series of eruptions, rather than a one-off. Records from the Global Volcanism Program show that the last period of activity at Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai, which began in December 2014, lasted just over a year. During that period a new island was formed, about 120 metres high and about 2 kilometres long. Dr Nebel said he suspected there would likely be more eruptions in the near future. ""I think it will likely erupt again in the coming days, weeks, months,"" he said. ""It's really hard, slash impossible, to predict whether it will be the same severity."" A huge eruption like this one may mean that any following eruptions will be less intense; however, again, there are no guarantees. The problem is that the magma chamber can be tens of kilometres deep, and there's no way of knowing how much more magma is still in the chamber. ""The only thing we can say is that it has erupted now, so the likelihood of there being much more underneath is low, but we have seen [multiple large eruptions] before in the past,"" Dr Nebel said. Similarly, Dr Handley said it was ""impossible to tell"" at this point whether we had seen the biggest eruption, or if there were more to come. Professor Bryan said if there was an underwater landslide that precipitated the eruption, that may actually be good news in terms of future eruptions. ""Hopefully if there was a landslide or whatever happened on Saturday, it's stabilised the slopes to some extent,"" he said. ""[In that case] we may have some explosions or tall columns, but we're not going to get the tsunamis."" Though the fallout and potential death toll is still unknown, Professor Bryan said the earlier eruptions at least gave the people of Tonga some forewarning of what may have been coming. He also said the fact it happened in daylight was a small positive. ""By the sounds of it, most people saw the early signs. Obviously there was a sonic boom and they'd seen the columns from the weeks before. ""If this happened like three hours later in the middle of the night [when] people are asleep, it could have been a lot worse."" Volcanoes like Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire — a roughly 40,000km line around the Pacific Ocean tracing the edge of tectonic plates, where a large share of the world's volcanoes are found. However, these have what is referred to as an ""independent magmatic plumbing system"", Dr Nebel said. What that means is that their magma chambers and any conduits and vents are in no way connected to other volcanoes, and the eruption of one doesn't precipitate the eruption of any others. Across the world there are more than 1,300 active volcanoes, but active doesn't mean erupting now, according to Dr Handley. ""To be active, we say they erupted in the last 10,000 years,"" she said. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. In any week there are around 20 volcanoes showing signs of activity, according to Professor Bryan. The Global Volcanism Program listed 46 volcanoes as ""in continuing eruptions status"" as of December 9, 2021. A number of these are in Australia's Pacific neighbours, including Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tonga. As we've seen, predicting which volcanoes may be an imminent threat to life can prove extremely difficult, but volcano experts say more monitoring and tsunami early warning systems can help.

220,"'We've worked our whole life, this is our family home': What the future of climate change means for coastal property owners",environment,"  Will climate change spell the end of coastal living as we know it? When Chris Rogers returned to the NSW Central Coast after a stint living overseas, he was eager to embrace the quintessential Australian lifestyle — a home where his kids could swim in the ocean whenever they liked and he could walk along the beach he loves every day. But more than a year after powerful swells battered Wamberal Beach, causing massive erosion beneath the waterfront properties, he's been left fearing his home could be washed away in the next storm surge. ""We've worked our whole life, this is our family home, and to look at your kids and not be able to comfort them is scary,"" Rogers says. ""It's no different to someone sitting in a bushfire zone with a beautiful home. They love the bush and they love living there, and … the fire burns their home down. All we want to do is be able to protect our homes and our families."" Rogers, 47, feels lucky compared with his neighbours: some were forced to evacuate when their homes partially collapsed in the storm. The home where Rogers has lived with his wife and two children since 2016 remains intact, but his backyard has ""sunk"" where sand from the beach was washed away. ""Every time there's heavy rain, everyone is having more and more of their bank starting to collapse,"" he says. ""If there are ... multiple east coast lows that hit this beach at the right tide, you could have as many as 10 homes going."" Rogers was attracted to the area by the relaxed pace of coastal living. Thanks to a rise in remote working as a result of the pandemic, more people than ever are making a similar decision to leave large cities and work from regional locations. But this pilgrimage is taking place against a backdrop of climate change, and many of its impacts are already being felt — not just in Wamberal, but all along Australia's coast. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — the most comprehensive report on climate change ever released — estimates a sea level rise of up to 55 centimetres by the end of the century, while not ruling out a 2-metre increase in the same period. The latest IPCC report does not make for particularly uplifting reading. But if you are keen to delve further into the details, it does say quite a bit about Australia. This would have catastrophic consequences for hundreds of thousands of Australians living along coastlines and waterways. In 2009, more than a decade before the IPCC report, the federal government's now-dissolved Department of Climate Change published a report measuring the risk to Australia's coastline — the first and only time it did so for the entire nation. The report identified between 157,000 and 247,600 individual residential buildings at risk of inundation if sea levels were to rise by 1.1 metres. The replacement value for these houses, they estimated, was up to $63 billion. Rogers, who has been leading a residents group agitating for a wall to be built to protect the coastline from further erosion, sees his home, and those of his neighbours, as the ""first line of defence"" against rising sea levels. ""We're working really hard to try and work with the council or the government to come up with potential solutions that protect not only us but all the infrastructure behind us,"" he says. ""Obviously I want to protect the home, but I also want to protect the beach."" He hopes any protective action taken in Wamberal — ""if we can do things right"" — could act as a blueprint for other coastal towns feeling the impacts of climate change. ""It's not just us,"" he says. ""The exposure is massive, really massive, and concerns are simply growing."" Australia is a nation built on the ocean, literally and figuratively. More than 80 per cent of the population already lives within 50 kilometres of a coastline and the idealised beach lifestyle occupies a prime position in Australia's national psyche. And with the rapid rise of remote working, forced by health measures introduced during the pandemic, executive director of the Australian Coastal Council's Association Alan Stokes predicts the number of people seeking a slower pace and water views is only set to grow. ""We're going to notice a big difference in the findings of the 2021 census,"" he says. ""I think we'll find that population levels in coastal areas — particularly those within, or a little beyond, commuter distance from the capital cities — are going to see enormous growth."" This is despite ""at least a metre [of sea-level rise], probably more"" already locked in, according to David Wainwright, a coastal engineer of almost 25 years. ""The thing is the timing: if it's going to affect your property in 100 years, is that something you worry about now?"" The impacts of sea-level rise will not be limited to beachfront homes, but also properties in low-lying areas around estuaries or lakes. They are at risk of what's called coastal inundation. ""As the mean sea level rise goes up in the ocean, you're also going to have the water level going up inside the estuary by a similar amount,"" Dr Wainwright says. It's this latter group that will experience more damage in the coming decades. ""This is a creeping issue that over time is going to inundate more and more frequently — and for certain properties, it might get to the stage where your property might be inundated by tides several times a year, even more. How are we going to manage that?"" Insurance costs are set to soar for thousands of Australians. Exclusive new data shows the areas facing the biggest jumps. Stokes believes the gradual creep of climate change has lured home buyers into a false sense of security. ""There's this perception that the worst of it will be felt in 2100, so someone buying a house now in an area that's likely to be impacted by 2100 is saying to themselves 'well, you know, that's so far in the future it probably won't affect me now',"" he says. ""But there will be increasing impacts during the period leading up to that."" If home-buyers aren't worried, the nation's financial institutions certainly are. In September, the Reserve Bank of Australia released a report warning property values in climate change hot spots could soon take a hit, leaving banks vulnerable in the case of default. It warned that about 3.5 per cent of dwellings in Australia already fell under the international definition of ""high-risk"", but that long-term climate change risk wasn't being reflected in property values. South-east Queensland and northern New South Wales had the largest number of homes at risk of coastal inundation, the report found. ""If current values do not fully reflect the longer-term risks of climate change, housing prices could decline, leaving banks with less protection than expected against borrower default,"" it said. When it comes to the impact of climate change on the property market, Claire Ibrahim, a director at Deloitte Access Economics, says the Reserve Bank is right to expect material declines in housing prices over time in high-risk regions. But, she adds, this is largely separate from how buyers will value property in the short term. ""Because people don't have the information at the moment that clearly tells them with a level of certainty how it will change potentially for the negative because of climate, I think they do assume that it will hold to an extent,"" she says. Once the purview of poor students, more adults are making a return to collaborative living in a bid to keep costs down and build community. ""You have homes that reflect exactly the value of what people are willing to pay for them, but is it the right risk equation within that? No, it's probably not. But would you call it overvalued? No, not necessarily. Because you could, in theory, sell it tomorrow and still make money from it."" But eventually, as banks increasingly start to factor climate risk in, high insurance premiums will force buyers to reconsider the value of a property. ""It really does alter the equation of how we value living by the water,"" Ibrahim says. ""And it starts to change the assumption that probably holds true for now that these properties will always maintain or increase their value."" When will that tipping point come? Climate analyst Karl Mallon has set about trying to answer that question. His company, Climate Valuation, seeks to provide data on the actual risk of climate change to property buyers and the banks that lend to them. Up until now, he says, damage from sea level increase has been relatively rare. That's because most buildings have been constructed above the current sea level and set back from the coastline, forming what he describes as a ""buffer"". He believes the impact of sea level rise will be mild for the next two or three decades, after which coastal inundation will steadily worsen. ""Coastal inundation will be one of the worst impacts [from climate change] we're facing in Australia,"" he says. According to the experts, this comes down to timing and whether the long-term risk is worth the short-term benefits of living by the water. ""Time really matters,"" Ibrahim says. ""When [people] make decisions, it can be really difficult to factor in time and risk in a way that's meaningful for how you value things."" While the impacts are already being felt in some areas, such as Wamberal, it is harder to quantify in regions where the danger is less obvious. By Climate Valuation's measure, about one in 20 properties are at high risk of flooding and coastal inundation. Dr Mallon predicts this could increase to one in 10 properties over the course of the century. Without major works to protect them, these properties face the possibility of becoming uninsurable. ""You're going to have people sitting on a house which they can't defend, they can't insure, and they can't sell,"" he says. Governments across the world have embarked on large-scale engineering works to stop water encroaching on properties, but Dr Mallon believes Australian governments are less likely to go down that route because many at-risk areas have small populations relative to the high cost of intervening. ""In the end, there will be suburbs that will be untenable in this century,"" he says. ""It's likely state governments and councils will just give up."" Meanwhile, Dr Mallon recommends prospective home buyers research whether a property is in an at-risk area, and if it is, make sure their insurance policy covers flooding and inundation — often described as ""actions of the sea"". But after a quarter of a century surveying Australia's coastlines, Dr Wainwright argues we must shift our thinking. ""A lot of it has to do with this assumption that property is permanent,"" Dr Wainwright says. ""When you're talking about the coastline, that's not the case.""

221,How the volcano off Tonga erupted and caused tsunami warnings,environment,"  How the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano erupted and why it caused tsunami warnings The eruption of a giant underwater volcano in the Pacific Ocean has triggered tsunami warnings, including for some of Australia's east coast. Here's what we know about the volcano at Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai and why it erupted. Technically, the volcano that erupted at Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai is classified as an underwater volcano, said Emeritus Professor Richard Arculus from the Australian National University. But as Professor Arculus points out, and as you can see in the image below, the vent or crater of the volcano is above water. It sits nested in between two landmasses, Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai. NASA says these landmasses are ""young"" and were born out of eruption. Yes. And Professor Arculus said it's been ""fairly active in the last 15 years"". A 2015 eruption made headlines after its ash cloud forced several airlines to cancel flights in and out of Tonga. At the time, New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority meteorologist Peter Lechner told Radio New Zealand the volcano was sending volcanic ash more than 9,000 metres into the air. He also said the volcano had erupted in 2009, 1988, 1937 and 1912. When the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano erupted in 2015, scientists did not expect the land mass it formed to last. Its landscape has eroded and changed over the past few years. Professor Arculus described it as a ""major vent-clearing explosion"". Satellite imagery of the eruption shows the explosion at sea surface ""spreads somewhat laterally"". This surge turns into a ""shock wave ring"". Tsunamis are generated by the rebound of inrushing seawater into the cavity made in the Earth's crust by the explosion. Professor Arculus said the ash cloud, seen from outer space, was the result of water and hot fragmented matter interacting. As a comparison, Professor Arculus said it ""would be many times more powerful than White Island"". The White Island volcano erupted in December 2019, and killed 22 tourists visiting the island, including 17 Australians. New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said there were no official reports of deaths or injuries in Tonga, but communications remain limited. The island nation was hit by a metre-high tsunami after the eruption, with witnesses saying the eruption shook the earth for several minutes. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued marine warnings for NSW, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. Chile's National Emergency Office ordered the evacuation of several coastal regions due to a minor Tsunami. Claudio Aldea, Deputy Director of Operations of The National Emergency Office of the Ministry of the Interior asked people in the regions of Coquimbo and Los Rios to evacuate to safe zones at least 30 metres above sea level. Tsunami warnings were issued for New Zealand, Japan, Hawaii, Alaska and the Pacific coast of the United States. Grace Legge, a Senior Meteorologist for Australia's Bureau of Meteorology warned the situation was dangerous and changing. An underwater eruption was much harder to predict than atmospheric weather patterns or earthquakes, she said. ""We're not yet out of the woods."" Professor Arculus said volcanic activity could continue for weeks or months but it was hard to predict if or when another powerful explosion would happen again. ""This might not be over,"" he said. But you can expect to see a reminder of the eruption soon on Australian shores. Professor Arculus said pumice, which is lightweight volcanic rock, will be washing up on our east coast in the months ahead. Pumice floats and can crumble in your hand, it's grey and full of holes.

222,No baby turtles have been spotted in Hyde Park for 15 years and researchers have no idea why,environment,"  Baby turtles missing at Hyde Park as efforts increase to save them from extinction The mortality rate of baby turtles at one of Perth's most loved parks has triggered a fresh attempt to solve a mystery that has perplexed some of WA's most experienced environmental scientists for more than a decade. Despite an abundance of fertile females, no juveniles have joined the 300-odd strong colony of native turtles at Hyde Park in more than 15 years — and nobody seems to know why. ""It's like going into a town and there's plenty of pregnant ladies, but no babies in prams,"" said Associate Professor Roberta Bencini, from the University of Western Australia's School of Agriculture and Environment. Several studies over the years failed to explain why the turtle hatchlings don't survive, but it's hoped a new four-year project closely monitoring their nests will shed some light on the cause. The southwestern snake-necked turtle, also known as the oblong turtle, is endemic to southern WA. Signs have been plastered around the inner city park asking people to report sightings of turtles outside of the water. ""The response from the public has been fantastic,"" Ms Bencini said. ""We've had people calling every time that they see a turtle leaving the water or looking to build a nest. ""We have been able to identify and protect 23 nests in this breeding season."" When a call comes through, Bangladesh PhD student Aliza Khatun springs into action. She visits the lake as soon as she can to find the nest and protect it from disturbance using a plastic mesh. ""I will keep an eye on the nest for the whole incubation period until September ... almost daily I'll check that nest,"" Ms Khatun said. ""Before the hatching period, I'll move that mesh and will put in a barrier and fences to protect the hatchlings. ""When the hatchlings come out, I will measure them and will test their fitness performance and release them safely into the water."" It's hoped Ms Khatun's hawk-eyed monitoring of the nests will lead to the first juvenile turtles being successfully integrated into the colony in years. ""The whole project is about waiting for turtles to nest, protecting the nests and then looking at the hatchlings,"" Ms Bencini said. ""If they're fit, if they're healthy, [we will] release them near the water so that they can go back into the population."" The previous studies offered several explanations for why there were no young turtles, but none were conclusive. ""We were doing ultrasound scans of the turtles, they had plenty of eggs, so they were fertile,"" Ms Bencini said. ""So we think that between being laid in the nest and getting to the water, something happens."" Predating foxes have proven to be a problem at other lakes in southern WA where the turtles are found. In Bibra Lake, in Perth's southern suburbs, the proximity of nests to a busy road have seen many pregnant turtles squashed by cars. Just one nest at Hyde Park was predated upon in the past year — but with no reported sightings of foxes in the area, Ms Khatun believed that was likely a cat. Human intervention was one possible explanation. ""Some people see a turtle out of the water and of course, their instinct is 'what's it doing here' and they put it back in the water,"" Ms Bencini said. ""The poor turtle is trying to lay the eggs instead and instead she gets put back in, and she has to start all over again.""' Ms Khatun suggests the presence of curious humans and dogs could spook the turtles from successfully laying eggs at all. ""I'm guessing that the surrounding environment may be the main factor for not having the baby turtles,"" she said. ""They have no parental care at all. ""They just lay the eggs, fill the hole with soil and leave forever."" Ms Khatun had already managed to release 27 hatchlings into the lake from four nests found around the park, but it was too early to tell if they had survived. While the south-western snake-necked turtles were not threatened or endangered, the experts believed the population was in trouble. ""The fact that there's a whole generation that's gone missing, or maybe many generations that have gone missing ... the population is likely to decline,"" Ms Bencini said. The City of Vincent has funded studies into the Hyde Park turtle colony since 2015. Mayor Emma Cole said it was a slow but useful exercise to understand how to best support the Hyde Park turtle colony. ""We love having this oblong turtle population here in the middle of inner city Perth,"" she said. ""We just want this home to continue for them and we'd love to know that they are a sustainable population and that they have a future here at Hyde Park."" The City has spent $28,000 supporting Ms Khatun's research.

226,Is this Australia's most hardcore animal?,environment," Science Eels can travel over land, climb walls and take down serious prey. They may be Australia's most hardcore animal They may be no match for saltwater crocs or great white sharks, but for their size, our freshwater eels are surprisingly hardcore. These slippery fish can travel over land, take down serious prey, and climb walls — all without any freaking legs! Their shape-shifting rivals that of insects such as butterflies, moths and cicadas. And eels undertake one of the most epic migrations known within Australian waters — but to this day, their breeding grounds remain a mystery. Lurking in the muddy bottom of a river or dam is only part of an eel's life. It's like the Clark Kent bit. The rest is the stuff of fishy superheroes. If you've seen an eel in a river or dam, it's already the stuff of legend. For the first time, Australian scientists are tracking eels with satellites to understand their migration. From the moment it hatched somewhere in the ocean — probably in the Coral Sea — it was on a mission to swim thousands of kilometres to the Australian mainland. Only around one in every 10,000 hatchlings make it. The big swim starts with an easy stretch for the leaf-shaped larval eel. Purpose-built for drifting, the leptoscephalus, or ""narrow head"" larva, rides the South Equatorial Current towards the Aussie coast. But among the challenges it faces are the stages of metamorphosis — gradually moving from the googly eyes and big mouth that only a mother eel could love to a more classic ""eely"" shape. While still in the ocean, probably near the continental shelf, the larva transforms to a classic eel shape, but with a difference: the eel is transparent. It's called a glass eel. Being transparent probably helps glass eels hide from predators, but along with this seeming superpower, the eel loses the ability to eat — just when it has to get all the way to a river mouth or estuary. It's not an easy task for a tiny half-starved glass eel! The eel can only eat again when it reaches a river mouth and undergoes another serious change. Spending time in brackish (a mixture of salt and fresh) water lets its ocean body adjust to the freshwater life ahead. At this stage, it starts to darken in colour and becomes known as an ""elver"". Elver can eat, which is lucky because it needs a lot of strength for the next part of its epic adventure: the long trip upstream. Oh, and puberty. Eels are sexless from the time they hatch until they grow about 30 centimetres in length. Then some version of eel puberty kicks and they transform, becoming either male or female. And which way they go depends on the population density. In an area with a lot of eels, the young eels are more likely to become male. But in areas with fewer eels — like further upstream, which is harder to get to — eels are more likely to become female. You know what's hardcore? Having the body of an eel and still climbing up waterfalls. These creatures are relentless in their journey upstream to find a home. And if that means scaling a waterfall — or the odd dam wall — they're up for it! Fish gotta swim. But it's well known to farmers that eels can make their way across seemingly dry land to reach a dam to call home. Their secret weapon? They can ""breathe"" through their skin! Well … not quite, but their tiny scales and slime help them transfer some oxygen into their bloodstream from their skin. Eels only need the smallest trickle of water to travel, which really gives them an edge as they push their way inland. Eels might start out as vulnerable little wrigglers, but by the time they settle into their freshwater home, they get massive. Long-finned eels (Anguilla reinhardtii) — one of the two common eels in Australia — can grow up to 1.7 metres long. Their short-finned cousins (Anguilla australis), more common in south-east Australia, are about half as long. And adult eels will eat snakes, birds, fish and native water rats (rakali). This makes them a top predator in freshwater ecosystems. If there's one thing that should be obvious about eels by now, it's that they never take the easy option. Once they find a nice river or dam to call home, they don't just settle in for the duration. Eventually, the call to breed compels them to make the long journey back out to sea. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Along the way, these fully grown eels get kitted out for breeding. Their guts shrivel up to make room for their enlarged gonads — where eggs and sperm are made. At this stage they stop eating, which is probably a good thing as their anus shrinks to prevent water loss. And their external appearance changes once again as their eyes enlarge, and their heads gets pointier — probably to refine their swimming and deep-water vision. Eventually, the eels make it back to the ocean; until last year, scientists could only guess where they went. By attaching trackers to short-finned eels, researchers from the Arthur Rylah Institute were able to follow some eels as they swam a whopping 2,620 kilometres from western Victoria all the way to the Coral Sea. Exactly where they spawn is still a mystery, but it's possibly near New Caledonia. We don't know what happens after they spawn, either. Most likely they die of exhaustion. Hardcore?

227,A bushfire burnt into a forest home of native cockatoos. Remarkably their nesting sites survived,environment,"  New Year's bushfire spares nesting sites of iconic red-tailed black cockatoos Skye McPherson was enjoying a coastal holiday on New Year's Eve when panic set in — the vulnerable population of red-tailed black cockatoos she has spent years helping protect was under threat from a fire burning near the Victorian-South Australian border. ""I heard about it on the news and looked it up straight away to see where the fire was and was very concerned,"" Ms McPherson said. As Birdlife Australia's red-tailed black cockatoo project coordinator she was ""expecting the worst"" as she got in touch with some locals to learn more about the situation. ""I managed to catch sight of a few photos [of] just some areas completely burnt,"" she said. ""It was a pretty bad situation there for all the livestock. ""And then these photos just showed this one beautiful redgum still standing and, obviously, it survived the fire. So it's pretty amazing."" By the time the emergency warning was downgraded, the fire had burnt through more than 7,000 hectares, scorching paddocks and killing or severely injuring thousands of sheep. Homes were spared, much to the community's relief, but so too was the crucial habitat of the local red-tail population. Ms McPherson admitted the outcome was ""a bit surprising"" considering the fire burnt into the Meereek State Forest — home to three identified nesting sites. ""It was quite a relief to hear all the known nest areas are okay,"" she said. While red-tailed black cockatoos are found in many parts of Australia, the south-eastern subspecies is its smallest in number and believed to be in decline. Its greatest threat is the deterioration of its feeding and nesting habitat. Ms McPherson, based at Coonawarra in South Australia's south-east, said the red-tails were ""a real iconic species for the region"". ""[They're] a beautiful bird and an important part of the local ecosystem,"" she said. ""This particular sub-species of red-tail there's only roughly 1,500 individual birds left in the wild."" Since 1997, a national recovery team of farmers, scientists, local government and not-for-profits has been working with the community to help the species survive and thrive. While the fire appears to have spared known nesting sites, more time is needed to assess other large redgums in the forest that could make suitable habitat. Ms McPherson said wildlife officers would also need to survey the stringybark forests the red-tails rely on for food, although they are fast to regenerate. Revegetation projects are likely to be organised in the wake of the fire, and they need not be confined to public land. ""If you live in the region and you have the area to do some planting that's probably the best way to support the red-tails,"" she said.

229,"Once the purview of poor students, these women are returning to share-house living",environment,"  Could collaborative living provide an answer to the housing crisis and climate change? Some people think so Donna Lavell is no stranger to sharing her home with people. In her 20s, she lived in share houses in Sydney's inner suburbs; later, after buying a home in Newcastle, she offered up her spare rooms to friends in need, housemates and Airbnb guests. Now, at 61, she's decided to build a home with three women she met less than a year ago. ""I have such a good experience of sharing spaces with people,"" she says. ""It just makes more sense to me."" Donna — along with her future housemates Joanne, Lisa, and Sarah — has secured a plot of land inside Narara Ecovillage — an ""intentional community"" of more than 100 people on the NSW Central Coast. ""We're all very clear that we don't want to put all our money into a house,"" Donna says, adding that she hopes to use the profits from the sale of her current home to support her in retirement. ""The advantage of extra people means there are more people paying for the land."" And she's not alone in trying to keep costs down. After a year that saw the fastest pace of annual growth in national property prices since 2004, more people than ever are looking for creative ways to break into the property market. This is happening alongside a growing awareness of climate change, making ecovillages and other forms of collaborative living an attractive alternative. The term encompasses many different models; from ecovillages, where multiple people live on a single piece of land, often owned by a cooperative, to urban co-housing developments, where everyone has their own apartment but shares common space. What they all have in common, however, is the rejection of the traditional model of property ownership. Typically, this looks like a single person or a couple purchasing a standalone property with a mortgage and without a focus on the surrounding community. While most people agree something needs to be done to make housing more affordable, there's a big split about what the most effective solutions will be. ""It's a very friendly process, unlike a lot of other real estate deals,"" says Joanne Hunt, one of the three other women sharing with Donna. ""The criteria [for finding housemates] was not so much that you had to be the same person, but that you are an honest and open communicator and willing to navigate through the whole process while considering each other's needs along the way."" In order to purchase a lot in the village, prospective buyers must first buy shares that allow them to participate in decision-making and use the site's communal facilities. It's through their involvement with the community that the four women met. They've since agreed to split the cost of the membership, their land, and now an architecturally-designed home and granny flat that will allow all four women — and Sarah's young baby — to have their own space. The home will be split into two wings, with a granny flat in the back where Sarah and her baby will live. Inside, Joanne and Sarah will share one wing — with two bedrooms, a kitchenette, and two bathrooms — and Donna will take the other one. In the middle will be a communal dining area and garden. ""There's no way I could have got into the ecovillage without sharing with somebody,"" Joanne says. ""What it means for me is I can have this little space down here in the ecovillage to live in, but I get to keep my house in Lismore and that will see me into my old age with a supplement to my pension."" Built on the site of an old horticultural institute, Narara Ecovillage is surrounded by dense bushland home to endangered plants and wildlife. Unlike other similar communities, it's located within easy commuting distance to Sydney. The community's founder, Lyndall Parris, says this was by design: ""We attract the IT people, the plumber, the electrician, the doctor, the lawyer, we're very lucky."" There are currently 50 homes on the property, with another 10 under construction. The oldest inhabitant is in their 80s, while the youngest is only months old. While Lyndall stresses the importance of diversity within the community, she says older women make up the largest group. Outside the village, older women are the fastest-growing cohort of homeless people in Australia, often due to retiring with significantly less superannuation than men on average. ""Everybody needs a bit of space where they can go and hide,"" Lyndall says, ""but you don't need a big space, because there's a lot of stuff here that we can actually share."" This sharing spirit extends beyond living spaces; in the common room, there are boxes of children's clothes organised by size that have been donated by residents. Communal buildings left over from the site's former owners are available as shared office and studio spaces. ""You don't necessarily need two bathrooms and toilets, because there's a couple of toilets around the place if you really need a second,"" Lyndall says. ""There's a communal laundry, so you don't necessarily need to have a laundry [in your own home]."" Lyndall describes the village as an ""intentional community"". While environmental principles form the basis of the development, the main thing members have in common is a desire to live with other people. As the village is entirely self-funded, members do need to have some money behind them to get involved. But because it's a cooperative, Lyndall says they can be more flexible. ""How can we stretch, or mould [rigid planning rules] to the fact there are many people who need a house and can't necessarily afford the house prices around Narara? How can we get around that?"" she says. ""Of course, dividing a lot between four is completely different to dividing it between two ... It's quite exciting to see the creativeness of the human spirit, working things out."" Chris Riedy from the University of Technology's Institute for Sustainable Futures says collaborative living could be an avenue to address housing affordability — but it will require Australia's financial institutions to get on board. Banks are used to giving mortgages to individuals or couples, he says, which means it can be difficult for groups of people to secure financing for a property. ""There are banks that are OK with that kind of approach, but a lot more of the mainstream banks are probably not quite ready for it yet,"" Professor Riedy says. ""There's this tradition of the quarter-acre block, and that's the normal way of living here."" But that hasn't stopped collaborative living projects from becoming increasingly popular. In 2015, when the centre first began its research into collaborative living, it hadn't ""really got going in Australia"". Since then, the number of available options has increased dramatically. ""We're finding more and more examples popping up, and certainly a lot of people we talk to being very interested in it,"" he says, ""and certainly increasing government support and policy interest in it as well."" For younger people trying to break into the market, he points to ""co-living models"" as an option. These include small individual apartments or dwellings with significant common spaces, ""almost like a modernised version of university campus living"". One option is the Nightingale Housing model, which in recent years completed its first few developments in Melbourne and Sydney. The sustainable apartment buildings include a number of small studio apartments, multi-bedroom apartments, and shared laundries, gardens and work sheds. The apartments are sold at cost and resale value is capped at the indexed property growth of the suburb. Affordability for people entering the market is also built into the model. Small studio apartments — called Teilhaus, which means ""part of house"" in German — are cross-subsidised and available only to first-home buyers and people with limited financial means. But aside from affordability, people who live in these communities say the other benefits are equally important. Enterprising baby boomers are turning to co-housing to avoid the conventional retirement communities that were often the only option for their parents. For Lyndall, it was community and friendship that originally gave her the idea for Narara Ecovillage. The husbands of two of her friends had recently died, and she was looking for a way to support them and their children. ""I thought, wouldn't it be interesting if we all lived in a village together, wouldn't I be able to support them better? Wouldn't my husband be able to be on the sideline and kick a ball with their kids?"" she says. ""It started in the social realm."" Similarly, Donna and Joanne say they don't see living with other people as a downside to saving money — in fact, it's exactly what drew them to the village. ""It really came about because of COVID last year, I turned 60 and I thought ... it's really important to be around people with the same values,"" Donna says. Meanwhile, Joanne sees the share house and wider ecovillage as two support systems that will allow her to live independently into older age. ""Obviously the ecovillage has a community, but informally you're able to help each other within the house,"" she says. ""So you've got a close support network and a larger support network.""

230,"Climate change complicates wetlands conservation, but a watering program is turning that around",environment,"  Ecologists use selective watering to combat more frequent climate-induced droughts The journey from sheep station to thriving wetland ecosystem has been a long and arduous one for the managers of Calperum Station in South Australia's Riverland. But ecologists from the Australian Landscape Trust say their work is still in its early stages. ""It'll probably sound rather pessimistic, but we're probably on step one or two of a very, very long walk,"" said Peter Cale, senior ecologist at Calperum. ""We've turned the corner and we've stopped the processes from degrading the system, but we're still a long way from that recovery demonstrating itself in the system as a whole,"" he said. Conservation work has been going on at the site, just north of Renmark, for nearly two decades and has been helped by a recent boost of water allocations from the state and federal governments. Despite promising environmental results seen this year, climate change is making it more challenging to protect the nationally and internationally significant wetlands. Calperum Station takes in a large portion of the Riverland Ramsar wetland site and forms part of the large Murray-Darling basin. It supports more than 20 flora and 19 fauna species that are listed as threatened under national and state legislation. Ecologists managing the site have been making progress towards restoring the ecosystem, but they say climate change has complicated their work through more frequent and intense droughts. ""We've just come out of a two-year really intense drought, relatively short but very intense, and we've had less than half of our annual rainfall in this area,"" Dr Cale said. ""So that's definitely caused some severe stress on a lot of the systems. ""It's clearly related to climate change. ""It's the sort of thing that we're going to see in the future, and that new regime is going to cause us to think seriously about how we do some of our work."" With the wetlands struggling to cope by surviving off natural rainfall alone, the managers of Calperum along with the Australian Landscape Trust entered a five-year partnership with the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder in December 2020 to deliver 11,000 megalitres of water for the environment. The water allocation allows the team to gradually provide water to different parts of the site to support struggling and threatened plant and animal species as part of a more long-term plan. Flows from water allocations and natural rainfall throughout the year have meant Calperum is currently experiencing a flooding event. ""It's obviously vital for a floodplain that it gets inundated, and the regime that we've got here means the lake is being managed on a pretty regular basis getting water,"" Dr Cale said. ""Any of these events makes a big difference in that system and allows it to recover from those dry periods. ""All of our watering programs are now working together to deliver the outcomes in a positive direction, and I think that's going to make it much easier to address those challenges that will occur with climate change over the next 20 or 30 years."" Ngarrindjeri man Jeremy Sumner has been working as a ranger at Calperum Station since 2019, leading tours on the site's history and ecology while working to heal country. ""Fortunately, when I first started out here I got to see that regrowth from the environment, and it was just a big relief,"" Mr Sumner said. ""When you see something so deserted, or dead I guess, to see it come back is really beneficial, and really healing,"" he said. One of the main stops of Mr Sumner's tours is Canoe Trees, a site dating back hundreds of years that has evidence of local First Nations people carving boats out of trees in a sustainable way. ""The environmental watering is bringing back regrowth on the tress, so I'm hoping that it'll do the same with the Canoe Trees, because the salt levels have been killing off a lot of the canoe trees,"" Mr Sumner said. ""So if we can direct a bit of water there, that might give them a few hundred years to survive."" Recent results from the watering program are having a more immediate impact on other flora and fauna, allowing ecologists to support significant trees such as black box and river red gums. ""Watering events like this make a huge difference to that obviously, because they'll be able to live off of the water from this for quite a number of years, even if it remains dry,"" Dr Cale said. Waterbird levels are also on the rise, with up to 12,000 seen on the lakes at Calperum in the past year. ""Seeing those populations starting to return to levels that reflect more what was here 20-plus years ago is a really encouraging sign that we're on the right track, and clearly it encourages us to keep on doing what we're doing,"" he said. ""Over the whole system it's a long-term process. ""I certainly won't see an outcome where we can call this job done. I'm getting old now so its going be after my years, but it's certainly something that I think is heading in that direction.""

232,"What is aquamation, Archbishop Tutu's chosen flameless cremation?",environment,"  What is aquamation, Archbishop Desmond Tutu's requested flameless cremation? Archbishop Desmond Tutu has been laid to rest in Cape Town after a state funeral and a private ceremony, interred behind the pulpit from where he once denounced bigotry and racial tyranny. The archbishop, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, has been praised around the world for his role in helping transform South Africa with his non-violent opposition to white minority rule. He died aged 90. He was outspoken about protecting the environment, giving speeches and writing articles about the need to take action to combat climate change, and requested his body be aquamated — considered to be a greener alternative to cremation. Aquamation is a cremation method using water that funeral parlours are touting as environmentally friendly. The process, also known as ""alkaline hydrolysis"", consists of cremation by water rather than fire. The body of the deceased is immersed for three to four hours in a mixture of water and strong alkali-like potassium hydroxide in a pressurised metal cylinder and heated to around 150 degrees Celsius. The process liquefies everything except for the bones, which are then dried in an oven, reduced to white dust and placed in an urn. The water can be processed through normal wastewater treatment facilities. First developed in the early 1990s as a way to discard the bodies of animals used in experiments, the method was later used to dispose of cows during the mad cow disease epidemic, US-based researcher Philip R Olson says. South Africa's flamboyant archbishop was a giant who appealed to our better angels and Australia could learn from following his example, writes Stan Grant. In the 2000s, US medical schools used aquamation to dispose of donated human cadavers, before the practice made its way into the funeral industry, he wrote in a 2014 paper. The process is also used to dispose of animal carcasses in slaughterhouses, where it is considered to be more efficient and hygienic. With burial space in urban areas worldwide becoming increasingly scarce and expensive, aquamation has obvious attractions. However, like human composting — a technique of composting bodies with layers of organic material like leaves or wood chips — aquamation is still authorised only in certain countries. In South Africa, where Tutu died, no legislation governs the practice. Its advocates claim water is a gentler way to go than flames, a liquid cremation consumes less energy than a conventional one and emits fewer greenhouse gases. According to UK-based firm Resomation, aquamation uses five times less energy than fire and reduces a funeral's emissions of greenhouse gases by around 35 per cent. Environmentally Friendly Cremations, a company based in Australia, claims water cremation ""produces less than 10 per cent of the carbon emissions"" of fire cremation, and a firm based in the US said the process ""uses 90 per cent less energy than flame cremation"". Tutu, who died on Boxing Day aged 90, was known for his modest lifestyle. He left instructions that his funeral ceremony should be simple and without frills. The anti-apartheid hero specifically asked for a cheap coffin and the eco-friendly cremation.

233,Breathing Delhi's air is like 'smoking 10 cigarettes a day'. So what needs to be done to prevent a 'dystopian future'?,environment,"  Doctors say breathing toxic air in Delhi is like smoking 10 cigarettes a day and urgent solutions are needed Months after the Delta variant ravaged India's capital, Delhi, the city's residents are taking refuge indoors once more. But this time, they aren't just shielding themselves from a dangerous virus. They're also protecting themselves from the city's toxic air. Schools, construction sites and some workplaces were closed briefly in November due to heavy air pollution and the country's chief justice has asked the central government to take urgent action on the ""very serious"" problem in Delhi. Delhi's air quality has been steadily deteriorating for years, and it is particularly bad during winter when the cool weather traps pollution and smoke, shrouding the city in a thick layer of smog. This seasonal phenomenon has huge health costs for Delhi's residents, many of whom are now agitating for change. Jyoti Pande Lavakare has personally experienced the human cost of Delhi's air pollution crisis. In 2017, her mother, Kamala, died from lung cancer which, she said, doctors told her was triggered by air pollution. ""She got diagnosed and, in three months, she had passed on and that was a very traumatic time,"" she said. Ms Lavakare, a clean-air activist and author, always knew that Delhi suffered from poor air quality, but it was only when she returned from years of living in California that she realised just how bad it was. ""I realised that people who were born and raised in India didn't really know what real blue skies looked like and what real clean air smelled and felt like,"" she said. Worried about the impact on her young children, Ms Lavakare, a former journalist, threw herself into researching the health consequences of living in a polluted city. Concerned by what she learned, she founded a not-for-profit called Care for Air to raise awareness of the health impacts of Delhi's dismal air, activism that became more personal after her mother's death. ""Although I knew myself about air pollution, it was all intellectualised in my head,"" she said. ""But to see her struggle to breathe and to die in that horrific way was something I felt in my heart."" There are multiple contributing factors. Siddharth Singh, an air pollution researcher and the author of The Great Smog of India, noted that while air pollution is a common problem in cities around the world, the kind of pollution seen in Delhi is ""unique to India"". Delhi's air quality worsens when farmers in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana burn their fields in the winter months after the harvest to prepare for the next agricultural cycle. Mr Singh explained that changing wind directions and slower wind speeds in winter mean that smoke gets trapped instead of being blown towards the sea. Another factor was pollution emitted from road vehicles and a dependence on coal to generate electricity — India relies heavily on coal because it's readily available and cheap, Mr Singh said. Northern India also has thousands of small-scale brick manufacturing businesses — which use fire, coal and simple chimneys — that release emissions and dust into the atmosphere and are a ""major contributor to the problem"", Mr Singh added. On top of this, the burning of garbage and biomass such as leaves combine to create a ""cocktail of air pollutants"", Mr Singh said. Breathing in the toxic air of New Delhi has dire consequences for the city's inhabitants. It can lead to lower life expectancy and an increased chance of lung cancer, among other illnesses, according to professor and medical doctor Arvind Kumar. As a chest surgeon at Medanta Hospital in Gurugram — a satellite city of Delhi — and founding trustee of the Lung Care Foundation, Dr Kumar has noticed a significant change in the profile of his patients over the past 30 years. In 1988, 90 per cent of his patients were cigarette smokers and they were mostly men in their 50s and 60s, he said. But, by 2018, 50 per cent of his lung cancer patients were non-smokers and from a younger demographic: Most were in their 40s, with some in their 30s and a few in their late 20s. ""When I used to operate on patients, I used to see black deposits on the lungs of known smokers. But, when I used to operate on patients for other chest diseases, in non-smokers, it was a rarity to see black lungs,"" he said. These days, when he operated on people, finding a normal pink lung was ""a rarity"", he said. In a city as polluted as Delhi, ""there is no true non-smoker"", Dr Kumar added. This is due to the tiny particulate matter known as PM2.5 (with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less), air pollution that is so small it can be inhaled into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. ""So, if today the level of PM2.5 is 220 — which is equal to 10 cigarettes — every newborn today will be smoking 10 cigarettes on day one of his or her life,"" he said. Over December 2021, Delhi's daily levels of PM2.5 averaged around 205 micrograms per cubic metre, nearly 14 times higher than the threshold prescribed by the World Health Organization's air quality guidelines. Ms Lavakare was particularly concerned about the impact on Delhi's children, saying the air is so polluted that ""every newborn is a smoker from the day they're born"". ""You're setting up your young and your youth for failure,"" she said. One of the offshoots of the air pollution crisis is the rise in products and businesses catering to the need for clean, fresh air. ""Air purifiers are a booming industry today,"" Dr Kumar said. Cities like Delhi have also seen a rise in oxygen bars, where customers can pay to breathe in pure oxygen. At one oxygen bar in Delhi, customers can pay 700–1300 rupees ($13–$24) to breathe in flavoured oxygen for around 15 minutes. Dr Kumar described these ventures as ""opportunistic industries"" that are trying to ""cash in on this health crisis"". Mr Singh noted that, while wealthier residents have the option of staying indoors or purchasing air purifiers, lower socio-economic groups are more exposed to air pollution. ""The poor tend to work closer to the roads. They tend to work closer to the brick-manufacturing units. They tend to work at construction sites, so their exposure to pollution is obviously much, much higher,"" he said. In response to the country's air pollution problem, India's central government launched the National Clean Air Program (NCAP) in 2019. The NCAP targets air pollution in around 132 cities in India and aims to reduce pollution concentrations by 2024. Mr Singh was not optimistic about NCAP's success because air pollution ""is not just an urban problem"". The ABC contacted the Environment Minister in the Delhi government, Gopal Rai, as well as pollution control entities at the state and central government level but did not receive a response. What was needed, Mr Singh said, was ""a shift from an urban approach to an airshed approach"". An airshed, he explained, was a region with ""common geographical and meteorological traits that make air pollution in that region very similar"". India's Environment Minister, Bhupender Yadav, recently announced the government would revise its approach to air pollution and would focus on airsheds instead of urban centres. The Delhi government has also attempted to tackle air pollution in the city by building smog towers, which are designed to purify the air around them. Both Dr Kumar and Ms Lavakare consider this solution to be ineffectual and a waste of money. Dr Kumar said air pollution could not be solved by allowing the air to be polluted and then cleaning it. It was the sources of pollution that needed to be controlled, he stressed. But there was also the question of political will. Air pollution was ""not a major electoral issue"", Mr Singh said, because there were more-pressing developmental challenges such as ""poverty, economic growth, jobs, inflation"" along with other political and cultural issues. Air pollution is the second crisis Delhi's residents have lived through in 2021 after the pandemic. However, Ms Lavakare said that its government was not taking air pollution as seriously as COVID-19 and that it had fallen to civil society groups such as hers to do the government's job in spreading awareness. ""It's really a dystopian future unless the government gets its act together,"" she said.

234,Ship captain behind worst environmental disaster in Mauritius to be released,environment,"  Twenty-month jail sentence commuted for captain of MV Wakashio, Japanese-owned vessel that caused Mauritius oil spill The captain and first mate of a Capesize bulk carrier that crashed into a coral reef off Mauritius, unleashing the Indian Ocean archipelago's worst environmental disaster, will be released ""imminently"" after their 20-month sentence was commuted, a lawyer said. The MV Wakashio, a Japanese-owned but Panamanian-flagged vessel, ran aground in July 2020, spilling more than 1,000 tonnes of toxic fuel into pristine waters, coating mangroves, corals and other fragile ecosystems. The two men, who have been in police custody since August 2020, were convicted last week and sentenced on Monday (local time), with magistrate Ida Dookhy Rambarrun noting that the court had taken ""into consideration the fact that both defendants pleaded guilty and apologised"". Kushal Lobine, who represents the ship's insurers Japan P&I, said the sentences had been commuted on the grounds of good behaviour and 16 months of time served, allowing the pair to return home. ""Their departure is imminent. The captain will return to India and the other to Sri Lanka, their respective countries,"" Mr Lobine said. The vessel's captain, Sunil Kumar Nandeshwar, and first officer, Hitihanillage Subhoda Janendra Tilakaratna, were found guilty of ""endangering safe navigation"". ""The captain and his second in command were irresponsible and did not deliver as they should on their 'navigational duties',"" the magistrate said on Monday. The MV Wakashio was sailing from Singapore to Brazil with 3,800 tonnes of fuel oil and 200 tonnes of diesel aboard when it ran into the reef off the south-east coast of Mauritius. During the trial, the captain admitted drinking during an onboard birthday party and said he had given instructions to approach Mauritian waters in order to gain access to a mobile phone network so that crew members could contact their families. ""The sea was bad, but the visibility was clear and it was safe to navigate … At one point, the ship could not move and had touched the sea floor,"" Nandeshwar said. ""Since I had had a few drinks, it did not seem worthwhile to intervene and it did not occur to me that we were sailing that close."" More than 1,000 tonnes of oil seeped into waters full of marine life from a gash in the vessel's hull before salvage crews were able to remove all the remaining fuel. The accident occurred near two ecologically critical sites: Blue Bay, known for its coral gardens, and Pointe D'Esny, which hosts a mangrove forest — a crucial ecosystem as well as a weapon in the fight against global warming. In the days after the accident, thousands of volunteers marshalled along the coast wearing rubber boots and gloves, scrubbing rocks and stringing together makeshift cordons to contain the oily tide. Thousands of people also took to the streets in the following months to protest the government's reaction to the disaster. Mauritius fisheries minister Sudheer Maudhoo said the ship's insurers had agreed to pay compensation worth 112,000 Mauritian rupees ($3,500) each to hundreds of fishermen and fishmongers for the loss of earnings caused by the oil spill. The vessel eventually split in two. Its bow and hull were towed 15 kilometres offshore and sunk. The process to dismantle the stern section and remove it from the reef began earlier this year but has been postponed many times due to rough weather and strong waves.

235,"With elaborate penises and no nipples, echidnas and platypuses are curious critters",environment," Science Five weird things about platypuses and echidnas When it comes to Australian animals, platypuses and echidnas have to take the cake for being the weirdest. These two mammals are so unique they form their own little group, called the monotremes. The ABC Science program Weird Australia talked to scientists who study these truly amazing animals. Here are some of the fun facts we discovered. When a British scientist first saw the skin and bill of a platypus, he thought it was a fake. ""He apparently actually spent a long time looking for the stitches,"" biologist Jane Fenelon from the University of Melbourne says. ""He really thought someone had taken like a mole or a weasel and just stitched on a duck beak to this animal. He couldn't believe it was real."" Echidnas, which some might think look a bit like a hedgehog, were probably a bit less of a shock to scientists — that is until they found out they too had some pretty strange features. Another thing that really confounded scientists was the fact that both echidnas and platypuses lay eggs. Neither are birds nor reptiles; they are mammals that suckle their young. ""[Scientists] didn't believe they laid eggs for a long, long time. That was just another level of weirdness,"" Dr Fenelon says. ""They'd never seen anything like it in their lives."" As well as being the only mammals to lay eggs, monotremes don't have any nipples — the young just lap up milk from patches secreted on the mother's skin. Monotreme eggs are not like chicken eggs and they require a bit of extra effort to get out of. ""The echidna and platypus eggs are completely round and they're also more leathery, so it's just more like a reptile egg and you can't crack them as such. You have to actually tear them to get them open,"" Dr Fenelon says. Animals that lay eggs need either an egg tooth that they can use to tear the egg, or a little fleshy nub on top of their noses, called a caruncle, to force their way out. But monotremes are the only group of animals to have both. ""So we think that what's happening is they're kind of like headbutting [the egg] and then tearing with their teeth,"" Dr Fenelon says. An echidna penis has four heads and is about 7 centimetres long, which is very long for such a small animal. ""It's like Jurassic Park mixed with like Frankenstein,"" Dr Fenelon says. And the reason for this? Scientists can only speculate, but catching a mate — or two — is usually the evolutionary drive behind such elaborate penises. Dr Fenelon says a male echidna can switch quite quickly between using its different penis heads. ""That means they could quickly mate with two different females or twice with the same female, but we don't really know."" A platypus penis has just two heads but is covered in visible spines that could be a way of holding on to their mate when they're in the water, Dr Fenelon says. While platypus feed and mate in water, most echidnas don't live near water but are also good swimmers and will happily jump in the water when they get a chance. ""They seem to just do it for fun, to a certain extent, as well as just to cool down,"" Dr Fenelon says. But, says Queensland University of Technology biologist Matthew Phillips, echidnas have less capacity to stay under water than a platypus, so they use their beak to help them breathe while swimming. ""They use that little kind of beak as a snorkel and it's a curious-looking thing, but they're quite efficient at it,"" he says. Dr Phillips says echidnas and platypuses both evolved from a common swimming ancestor (that was quite platypus-like) about 30 or 40 million years ago. And they both have a flattened body form, which is useful for swimming, as is the movement of their upper arms. ""They use their humerus to rotate, which makes them basically front-wheel drive.""

236,Environmentalists fear for Komodo dragon as Indonesia pushes tourism,environment,"  Environmentalists fear for Komodo dragon as Indonesia pushes tourism On a dirt path, forked yellow tongue darting from its mouth, a member of the world's largest lizard species lazes on an island in eastern Indonesia's Komodo National Park as tourists snap photos. About 30 kilometres away on another park island that harbours Komodo dragons, trees have been removed and concrete poured for new tourist facilities that have aroused the ire of residents and environmental activists. The construction is part of an ambitious Indonesian initiative that has generated tensions between a government that wants to develop natural attractions for luxury tourism and conservationists who fear habitat for the endangered Komodo dragon will be irreparably harmed. United Nations officials have also voiced concerns about potential tourism impacts on this unique wildlife-rich park. Encompassing about 2,200 square kilometres of land and marine area, Komodo National Park was established in 1980 to help protect the famed dragons. The predatory lizards, which can reach a length of 3 metres and weigh more than 135 kilograms, were recently classified as ""endangered"" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) list of threatened species. Indonesia's Ministry of Environment and Forestry estimates around 3,000 Komodo dragons live there, along with dugongs, sea turtles, whales and more than 1,000 species of tropical fish. Because of its biodiversity and beauty, the park became a UN World Heritage Site in 1991. It is one of Indonesia's crown jewels for tourism, typically drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world each year. For years, the government has been trying to figure out how to best capitalise on the park. ""We are embarking into a new era of tourism in Indonesia based on nature and culture, focusing on sustainability and quality tourism,"" Indonesian Minister of Tourism Sandiaga Uno told The Associated Press. Part of that multi-million-dollar tourism development is a project on Rinca Island, where more than one-third of the park's dragons are estimated to live on generally hot and dry terrain. The construction includes an expanded ranger station, viewing platform, boat dock, toilets and other infrastructure. The project worries local environmental activists and residents within park boundaries who say their livelihoods as tour guides, boat drivers and souvenir sellers depend on the draw of the area's natural beauty. ""When we talk about the development in the conservation area, we have to think … whether this is a wisely considered economic effect for the local people — or the environmental effect,"" Gregorius Afioma, a member of the local non-governmental organisation Sun Spirit for Justice and Peace, said. ""The situation now is like collective suicide. ""We think that this kind of business will eventually kill others' businesses and even themselves because they destroyed the environment."" UNESCO — the United Nations body that designates World Heritage Site status — has also raised concerns about development in the park. Guy Debonnet, UNESCO's chief of its natural heritage unit, says the body is concerned with the proposals. ""The state party did not inform us, as required by the operational guidelines,"" he said. ""This is definitely a project of concern because we feel that the impacts on the universal value [of the park] have not been properly evaluated."" During a meeting in July, UNESCO expressed other concerns, such as the project's reduction of the park's wilderness zone to one-third of the previous area, the addition of tourism concessions within the property, lack of an adequate environmental impact assessment and a target to dramatically increase visitors. ""Third-party information transmitted to the State Party indicates that a target of 500,000 annual visitors for the property has been proposed, which is more than double the pre-COVID-19 pandemic visitor numbers,"" a report from the meeting said. ""This raises the question of how this tourism model fits [Indonesia's] vision of moving away from mass tourism to more sustainable approaches."" At UNESCO's request, the country submitted more information about the project. But after reviewing it, the UN agency requested in October 2020 that Indonesia not ""proceed with any tourism infrastructure project that may affect the Outstanding Universal Value of the property prior to a review of the relevant environmental impact assessment"" by the IUCN. The IUCN is an international, non-governmental organisation that provides UNESCO's World Heritage Committee with technical evaluations of natural heritage properties. After multiple attempts to get permission from government authorities, The Associated Press was unable to gain access to the construction site, which has been closed to the public for months. However, satellite imagery shows construction continued after UNESCO requested the project be paused. The government has not responded to a request for comment. As of December 6, UNESCO still had not received the requested revised assessment, Mr Debonnet said. Some experts fear tourism expansion in the park could lead to disturbance of Komodo dragon habitat. The predatory lizards, which can reach a length of 3 metres and weigh more than 135 kilograms, were recently classified as 'endangered' on the IUCN list of threatened species. The organisation cited the impacts of climate change and the deterioration of the dragons' habitat — including human encroachment — as reasons for the change. Bryan Fry, an associate professor at the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Queensland, said tourism could ""have a big impact, not just from the number of people disturbing the behaviour of the dragons and disturbing their prey, but also how much freshwater is being siphoned off"". ""That could dramatically impact the very delicate balance of these islands."" The opening date for the new Rinca Island facilities has not been announced. Mr Debonnet said it is engaged in talks with Indonesian officials to arrange a monitoring mission to assess the impact of ongoing development on the park and review its state of conservation. World Heritage sites are usually discussed by the UNESCO committee on two-year cycles, however, Komodo National Park will be discussed in 2022, Mr Debonnet said. ""That is kind of an indication that we see there is some urgency in this issue,"" he said.

237,analysis: The crime-solving antibacterial superhero living in our garbage bin,environment,"  Meet the maggot: how this flesh-loving, butt-breathing marvel helps us solve murders Not all superheroes wear capes — some live in rubbish bins, garbage dumps and on dead bodies. Maggots are the offspring of the blowfly, the scourge of the Aussie picnic, nuisance of summer and feared by farmers for infesting and killing sheep. However, these humble little legless larvae are actually nature's antibacterial soldiers. Their ability to survive and thrive in decomposing matter is making them our new secret weapon in forensic entomology — the science of using insects to solve crimes — and for cleaning chronic wounds. But their success in this field depends on us seeing past the ""yuck"" factor and appreciating what these unique organisms can do for us. So what do maggots actually do, and why do we need them? Maggots hatch from eggs laid by female blowflies on moist, microbe-rich matter. This might be a corpse, a wound, food waste or anything else palatable or decomposing. After hatching, the maggots spread enzymes and bacteria that break down their food source into a delectable soup. They drink this soup, heads down and bottoms up, with their cleverly designed bottoms adapted for breathing. This means non-stop voracious feeding in this high nutrient, bacterially rich soup can continue uninterrupted — there's no need to come up for air. Their efficiency in recycling decomposing matter so rapidly and effectively makes them a fantastic waste disposal system, but their love of flesh is multi-faceted. Let's start with the negative. Attracted to all things decomposing, from rubbish to human remains, they live in filth. Bacterially infected environments are their happy place. Unfortunately, this can extend to live animals, with wounds becoming infected by maggots, which is known as myiasis. The Australian sheep blowfly (Lucilia cuprina), for example, is responsible for flystrike on our sheep following the soiling of fleece with rain and body fluids. It can result in significant discomfort and ultimately death for the animals. This costs Australian agriculture approximately $173 million per year. On the flipside, in forensic entomology we use the rapid attraction of female flies to lay eggs on human remains as a ""biological clock"". Flies are our detectives — moments after a person's death decomposition begins, the odours produced from the remains quickly attract the flies. We determine the age of insects on remains to estimate the time since death. Forensic entomologists have provided valuable evidence in many death investigations, and this is possible purely because blowflies are attracted to decomposing organic matter rich in bacteria. Curiously, the bacteria don't kill the insects and the larvae feed almost invincibly. This ability is being exploited in human health care. The most intriguing interaction of maggots and humans is in an area known as maggot therapy. Clean, medical-grade maggots are intentionally and carefully introduced to a chronic wound, where they remove dead tissue and overcome the need for invasive surgical treatment. Research has shown maggots don't just remove the dead tissue by debriding the wound, they simultaneously kill off the harmful bacteria responsible for the infection. This occurs in the very acidic stomach of the maggot, as well as in the wound itself, where highly specialised antibacterial substances are excreted and secreted by the feeding larvae. So maggots are not just eating machines to eliminate dead tissue, they are medicinal, utilising their own bespoke pharmaceuticals to clean up wounds that often fail to respond to other treatment — and all for a bargain. A wound may be healed for approximately $200-500 with no need for a hospital stay or surgical intervention. Chronic wounds are an increasing burden in the health system, with 400,000 Australians estimated to have a chronic wound or ulcer at any point in time. This bears an estimated annual cost of $2-4 billion, with this figure likely to increase due to the ageing population and prevalence of chronic disease, including diabetes. Additionally, antibiotic-resistant ""superbugs"" are posing a challenge to effective wound treatment, which means surgery is needed where less invasive methods fail. The importance of maggot therapy has been recognised by some Aboriginal people, Central American Mayan tribes and wartime surgeons in the 1500s and 1800s, but was abandoned in favour of antibiotics. In the United Kingdom, maggot therapy is approved for doctors to prescribe and could save the National Health Service an estimated $2.5 billion per year. In the United States, maggot therapy has resurged and the US Food and Drug Agency provided clearance to market medicinal maggots in 2004. Dating back to tribal and ancient medicine, maggot therapy is slowly crawling back for therapeutic medicinal purposes in Australia. In Australia, maggot therapy isn't yet TGA approved, and we need to invest research dollars into understanding its mechanisms and conducting our own clinical trials before this will be achieved. The maggots, while highly effective, are often misunderstood and clinical data is somewhat skewed by the fact maggots are always the last resort for a chronic, non-healing wound — right before amputation. This life-saving service provided by the humble maggot all comes back to their love of bacteria and a good necrotic soup. So the next time you hose maggots out of your rubbish bin, pause to reconsider that ""yuck"" reaction, because nature's little superheroes are ready to help, if only we let them.

238,Holiday travellers urged to be cautious as mosquitoes and algae threaten waterways,environment,"  Ross River virus and toxic blue-green algae detected in regional Victoria and New South Wales People travelling through regional Victoria and New South Wales in the Christmas period are warned to be on the lookout for a surge in mosquito numbers and algae blooms, following the detection of Ross River virus and blue-green algae. Ross River virus has been detected in mosquitoes in Moira Shire, Campaspe Shire and Greater Shepparton City Council in Central Victoria. The Victorian health department warns weather conditions in the coming week are favourable to mosquito biting and breeding, with increased travel during the Christmas period exposing more people to infection. Mosquito numbers are predicted to be very high along parts of the Murray River from Gunbower to Yarrawonga. Long, loose-fitting clothing and mosquito repellent is advised for anyone spending extended periods of time outdoors. It takes about three to nine days for symptoms of Ross River virus disease to develop following exposure, and occasionally up to 21 days. Anyone suffering from joint pain and stiffness, headache, fever, rash and fatigue is encouraged to seek medical treatment. A red alert level warning has been issued for Hume Dam, following algal testing revealing potentially toxic blue-green algae in the area. People are advised to not undertake recreational activity or drink untreated water while a red alert is in effect. Mussels and crayfish caught in algal-bloom-affected water may also be affected and should not be eaten while a red alert is in place. Blue-green algae occurs naturally and usually appears as green paint-like scums on the water, near the edges, or as greenish clumps throughout the water. Contact with blue-green algae can also pose a threat to livestock and pets. People who believe they may have been affected by blue-green algae are advised to seek medical advice. WaterNSW said regular monitoring would continue and the alert would be lifted as soon as testing confirmed the bloom had dissipated.

239,Is Christmas lunch complete without prawns? Advocates say it might soon need to be,environment,"  Water allocation licenses, rise of agriculture poses widening threat to Christmas prawns from the north Days out from Christmas, an unassuming, corner-block building on Darwin's harbour is bustling inside. ""[It's] crazy. It hasn't stopped at all,"" Laura Luchetti said. Every year, a stampede of customers stocking up on a Christmas staple has Laura rushed off her feet. Prawns of all types have been ""flying out the door"" of the local seafood shop, making up almost half of the business's sales at this time of year. But advocates say affordable wild-caught prawns could soon be off the festive table, with species in the north facing a growing threat from industries looking to extract massive amounts of water from rivers. Every year, about 8,000 tonnes of wild prawns are caught from a fishery in the north spanning nearly a million square kilometres from Cape York to Cape Londonderry, the northernmost point of mainland Western Australia. The crustaceans are shipped all over the world, but here in Australia nearly 80 per cent of the catch is eaten across the Christmas period. ""The real joy is what a wild prawn can mean for a Christmas feast. It's just such a classically iconic Australian thing to do,"" said David Carter, chief executive of commercial fishing company Austral Fisheries. But he said increased agriculture development was posing a widening threat to the future of Christmas prawns due to the NT government's water allocation policy plans and the expansion of irrigated agriculture in the Northern Territory. He named the ""impact of increased agricultural use of water, excess use of agricultural chemicals and cotton"" as some of the biggest threats. ""We run across a big geographical area, but each one of these potentially adds to a death by 1000 cuts."" When Cyclone Tracy hit Darwin on Christmas Eve 1974, demolishing 80 per cent of building structures and taking more than 70 lives, it also dropped buckets of rain. That year led to the northern fishery's largest-ever haul of banana prawns. Fourteen thousand tonnes were caught, and nothing has beaten it to this day. ""The underpinning of our successful fishery over 40 years has been the environmental flows that sustain the baby prawn,"" Mr Carter said. The prawn's life cycle is intrinsically linked with the wet and dry that characterises the Top End, and a good year hinges on full rivers and big downpours that flush baby prawns into the ocean. Larvae is spawned at sea before embarking on a massive journey into rivers, where they await the wet season's monsoonal rains. ""So, if agricultural industries are allowed to take a lot of water from those river systems it does pose a threat to our livelihood,"" he said. ""Whether it's irrigated pasture for cattle, or more intensive cropping operations like cotton, it all begins to interfere with the natural flow of those coastal and estuarine systems that are so important to us."" The Northern Territory government is consulting on possible changes to its longstanding 80:20 water rule, which determines how much of the resource must be allocated to the environment and how much can be used for drinking and by industries. On its election in 2016, the Gunner government promised to improve the management of water licensing, but the rule has since been at the centre of controversy. Documents released under Freedom of Information laws show the Northern Territory government secretly negotiated controversial water allocation rules. Mr Carter warned against policymakers going for ""the next shiny thing"" in terms of industry development ""only to forget about legacy industries"" like his, which he said have supplied both local and export markets and provided extensive regional economic activity for decades. ""As we keep impacting adversely on different parts of the fishery, amid climate change … then that absolutely increases the economic pressures on this long-standing industry."" In April, the Northern Prawn Fishery Industry voiced its concerns to a Senate Committee. Chief executive Annie Jarrett said water extraction ""may reduce flow volumes, consequentially reducing crustacean and fish populations"". ""Sequential years of reduced flows due to water diversion for irrigation may increase the frequency of low-level flow years and hence increase the years of uneconomic catches to a level where the long-term economic viability of the NPF banana prawn fishery is compromised,"" she said. Mitch Hart, the NT manager for the Pew Charitable Trusts, said the community and businesses that rely on healthy rivers ""have made it clear that they are concerned"". ""We must ensure that our water management system is up to the task. Any environmental policy is only as effective as the regulatory regime within which it operates. There are serious structural deficiencies within the Northern Territory's water regulatory regime,"" he said. A Northern Territory government spokeswoman said prawns were ""not at risk"". ""The Territory government is developing a long-term, comprehensive strategic water plan to ensure the sustainable management of our water resources, and that water is available for drinking, growing and making valuable products,"" she said.

240,analysis: Huge increase in supply of carbon credits leaves questions to answer for climate policy,environment,"  The price of Australian carbon credits is soaring — but that's not necessarily a good thing The price of Australian carbon credits is soaring. We've got a carbon credit bull market. A market for carbon credits is ultimately designed to achieve one thing: help reduce carbon emissions. I'll explain that further shortly, but it's essentially one way economics and financial markets are joining the fight against climate change. So this is a good thing, right? It would be if the regulator wasn't significantly boosting supply of carbon credits. The government, via the Clean Energy Regulator, is now being accused of artificially lowering the price of carbon offsets to make it easier for big corporates to continue producing dirty energy. Let me explain. Climate change is an existential threat, with a solution that is fairly simple: cut carbon emissions to ""net zero"" by 2050. That will help reduce the amount of CO2 being trapped in the atmosphere and warming should slow, rebalancing the climate. Achieving a net zero aviation sector will require a huge collaborative effort from industry and government — and consumers can also play their part. How do you cut emissions? You make it really expensive for big corporations to pump out greenhouse gases. A market for carbon credits can do this, and it is doing it in Australia. Businesses can buy Australian Carbon Credit Units or ACCUs. Each unit they buy effectively cancels out, on paper, their emissions. Yes, that's right, there are not actual emissions reductions in this process. The price of ACCUs or ""carbon credits"" is simply the securities companies purchase to reduce their registered soaring emissions. And that price has had a huge rise this year, hitting $49 this week, according to Reputex executive director Hugh Grossman . ""[The price of Australian Carbon Credit Units or ACCUs] started the year looking at about $16 [per tonne] so we've seen a fairly notable upswing — about 200 per cent on the year which is pretty remarkable,"" he says. He says there's been a surge in big companies buying Australian Carbon Credit Units or ACCUs — the trading name of carbon credits or offsets — in a rush to meet hastily arranged emissions reductions targets in the wake of COP26. The Purbrick family has been making wine for almost 100 years, but its winery, already one of the few certified as carbon neutral in the country, is moving firmly towards the future. ""They're building a pipeline of carbon offsets that they can then sit on, rather than use them today, to meet an emissions reduction target."" In the meantime, heavy polluters, he says, need to weigh up the cost of reducing carbon emissions ""on paper"", against investing in new technology to actually reducing emissions. ""Really importantly it gives you a timetable for making an investment decision."" ""I can see where the market's going today, I can see where it's going in five or 10 years' time, I can then design my investment decision around that."" The futures market for carbon credits shows that the price of carbon offsets lifting into the new year, according to Grossman, As the price of carbon offsets keep rising, renewables like solar, green hydrogen, soil carbon or carbon capture and storage become more attractive as investments. But one way to limit price increases, for anything, is to increase supply, or so say the economics textbooks. The latest Quarterly Carbon Market reports — for September — shows the clean energy regulator is flooding the market with supply of carbon credits. While demand for credits is up 24 per cent over the previous 12 months, the total Australia carbon credit unit supply for the year, the report says, will reach a record 17.3 million units. Polly Hemming is an advisor in the Australia Institute's Climate and Energy Team. She believes the Australian market mechanism for reducing carbon emissions is ineffective. ""So while there might be a spike in prices, the overall idea is that the regulator is going to increasingly be generating a huge supply of offsets, and so potentially the price is going to come down, and it will be easier again for those businesses who aren't actually decarbonising to just offset and not actually have to invest in that capital that will mean they're decarbonising or reducing their emissions in real terms."" Crucially, she's told the ABC the regulator is positioning itself to significantly boost the supply of ACCUs to help drag the price of carbon credits down. We asked Energy Minister Angus Taylor's office to confirm if the regulator is again poised to step in to increase the supply of credits in order to artificially reduce the price on carbon. We didn't receive a response from the minister by the time of publication. A new analysis finds the level of deforestation ""avoided"" and paid for by carbon offset schemes is too high to have realistically occurred in the first place. On its website, the regulator makes it clear the market is doing its job, saying emissions reduction from schemes administered by it are conservatively estimated to reach 57 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2021, but could be as high as 75 million tonnes. The regulator also concedes it is boosting supply. ""The government has implemented a range of measures to increase participation in the ERF and the supply of carbon credits,"" a spokesperson says in a statement to the ABC “The government will continue to look for ways to increase the supply and demand of ACCUs and will consult further on these.” A crucial aspect of Australia's effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is for companies to embrace investments in renewable energy. Global financiers, analysts say, have been looking for a clear signal from the federal government that it's taking realistic, credible, proactive steps to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050. Achieve that, and money for renewable investments will come flooding into the country — making renewable investment even more attractive. But a regulator that seems to be disincentivising large corporations from reducing emissions would be seen as contrary to this whole idea.

241,Rangers stumble across secret meadow full of rare native orchid,environment,"  Secret crop of near-extinct Oaklands donkey orchids discovered in the Riverina Rangers have discovered a secret meadow of near-extinct native orchids on a travelling stock reserve in the Riverina. The extremely rare Oaklands donkey orchid comes from the genus Diuris, known for its petals that poke up like ""donkey ears"". Until recently, there were just 1,000 Oaklands donkey orchids remaining, their survival threatened by livestock grazing, rabbits and invasive weeds. Murray Local Land Services officers had been searching for a reintroduction site for the endangered bloom when they discovered a hidden crop. ""We found a single plant back in 2017,"" senior land services officer Shanna Rogers said. ""It was dry conditions for the next two years, and nothing came up. ""And then, last year with the good rainfall, they found a healthy population of 250 plants."" There are just four populations of the orchid in the entire region, all clustered around Urana and Oaklands. Ms Rogers said it was a bit of an estimate as to how many flowers there were. ""Not all of the orchids found within an area flower each year,"" she said. ""So we just monitor the flowering orchids because there potentially could be other orchids in the area that are dormant tubers that just don't come up."" It was the incredible rarity of these flowers that seeded the Wild Orchids Project, a New South Wales Environmental Trust-funded initiative. As part of the project, experts are looking into three endangered orchid species, also including the sandhill spider orchid and crimson spider orchid. ""Monitoring back in 2014 indicated the numbers of these orchids were incredibly low, and that we needed to do something to manage the remnant populations and boost their numbers in the wild,"" Ms Rogers said. Each year, winter rains turn the dusty landscape of WA's Midwest into a rich tapestry of colours, smells and sounds. Officers have started caring for known remnant populations and are working to reintroduce orchids back into the wild at new translocation sites. In the wake of their latest discovery, officers have fenced off the meadow to protect the orchids from grazing stock. It's just a small patch – 3 hectares of a 150-hectare reserve. But it could determine the survival of this highly endangered plant. ""While the orchids are dormant tubers, it's not a risk,"" Ms Rogers said. ""But we obviously didn't want to have stock grazing and trampling the orchids while they were flowering and setting seeds. ""This management of the orchids will continue permanently.""

242, Rare marbled frogmouth snapped after 'absolutely crazy' effort,environment,"  Rarely seen marbled frogmouth nest snapped after 'absolutely crazy' three-week effort What drives two blokes to build a 13-metre scaffolded tower in the middle of dense rainforest despite the storms and heat of a Queensland summer? ""A little bird up in the tree,"" according to Matt Kelly. That little bird is the rare marbled frogmouth, found in bushland across south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. While it has been photographed before, Mr Kelly said his video of the bird in the Gold Coast hinterland may be the first time it has been captured in such proximity and while nesting. ""To the average person it might just look like a tawny frogmouth but to capture that image of the baby up in the rainforest; it was on the edge of your seat,"" he said. ""Seeing that thing looking back at me and taking that image, it really was surreal."" But getting the shot was no easy task. Formerly a builder's labourer, Mr Kelly now works as a tour guide for O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat. He first heard the ""bizarre"" call of the marbled frogmouth 11 years ago, but said he managed to track a pair to an old dairy farm now overgrown in dense vine thicket. ""I played a recording of their call and I got response from about six different birds,"" he said. ""It was the jackpot of marbled frogmouths."" To get the best photograph, Mr Kelly enlisted the help of Glen Threlfo, who has produced wildlife documentaries for the BBC and ABC. ""[Matt Kelly] dragged a ladder out in the bush and had it roped to trees and he was hanging on for his life,"" Mr Threlfo said. The pair decided to use parts of an old scaffold Mr Threlfo had in storage to build a 13-metre tower in the middle of the dense hinterland rainforest. ""It's so steep we had to cut steps into the hillside to be able to negotiate the slope,"" Mr Threlfo said. ""It was crazy; you gotta have something wrong with you to do this."" After spending more than a week building the tower using a ""see-saw"" system of ropes and pulleys, Mr Kelly said he had to be careful ""because you don't want to scare the parents away"". ""I'm not good with heights, but this was proper terrifying,"" he said. ""But [with] that positioning in that tower, you couldn't help but take a good photo. ""To get to that angle and find that animal; that's what I can be proud of."" Mr Threlfo said ""there's a great reward in the end"" for all the effort. ""The difference between general photography of birds and broadcast quality is getting up into the perfect place so you're looking only at eight or 10 feet away,"" he said. ""I don't think there's any decent photographs anywhere in Australia of that bird. ""When you see something special in nature, you imagine what this is gonna look like on a screen for people to enjoy."" Mr Kelly said he intends to keep the exact location secret, to ensure rainforest regrowth and avoid further disruptions. “It sounds weird, a little bird up in the tree, but truly as far as conserving animals, [I want to] make it so people love them.""

243,"Anger as Indonesian boats surge back into Australian waters, weeks after illegal vessels were torched",environment,"  Piracy and illegal fishing concerns grow as foreign boats return to marine park The WA government is urging the Commonwealth to ""step up"" and halt the surge in illegal foreign fishing boats harvesting seafood in a pristine marine park. Fresh footage obtained by the ABC shows Indonesian crews have returned to the Rowley Shoals Marine Park within weeks of a crackdown that resulted in boats being burnt at sea. The footage, shot by a local charter operator in late November, shows Indonesian sailors waving and smiling at the camera. Western Australian Fisheries Minister Don Punch says it is unacceptable. ""It's a serious matter, as it has a big impact on the marine ecology of the Rowley Shoals, but also on the charter boat tourism that's happening in the area,"" he said. ""It's a matter we have taken up with the federal government, and I've had conversations with the Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews. ""But unfortunately it's still happening, and we need the federal government to step up and take control of the situation."" Government data shows the number of foreign fishing boats is continuing to surge. So far this financial year, 231 boats were intercepted, with 29 seized and destroyed. That compares with just four boats in the 2019-20 financial year. The situation is complicated by the multiple government agencies involved. The Rowley Shoals are within a WA government marine park, but the federal Australian Border Force is primarily responsible for keeping foreign vessels out of Australian waters. Local skippers are worried the illegal fishing will intensify in coming months, due to the northern wet season. It's understood the WA government boats that usually patrol the Kimberley marine parks have headed south for maintenance, as the monsoon season makes it dangerous to be at sea. In a statement, the Australian Border Force said its surveillance and enforcement will continue throughout the summer. ""The Australian Border Force is actively responding to reports of foreign fishing vessels in the vicinity of Rowley Shoals,"" the statement said. ""Maritime Border Command operations will continue throughout the monsoon season, noting adverse conditions also impacts on illegal fishers."" But locals believe the Indonesian fishermen have the determination, desperation and equipment to continue fishing amid the wet season storms. Kimberley Marine Tourism Association chair Jig Albert says the situation poses several risks. ""Our operators are massively concerned because the Indonesians are netting, walking on the reefs, collecting trepang, harvesting shark and — what's really disturbing — is they're taking the giant clams, which take years and years to grow,"" Mr Albert said. ""There's also the concern about biosecurity hazards like COVID-19. ""And these people are really desperate, so there's the risk of piracy as well."" One veteran Kimberley skipper, who didn't want his charter business to be identified, told the ABC the Indonesian crews seem organised and well-resourced. ""Some of them are well set-up, with good boats, solar panels and GPS navigators,"" he said. ""They know what they're doing and they know what they're after. ""If it's allowed to keep going, they'll realise it's open slather, and they will wipe the joint out [of marine life].""

244,Victorian logging regulator to get new powers over VicForests after allegations of illegal logging,environment,"  Victorian logging regulator to get new powers over VicForests after allegations of illegal activity State government-owned logging company VicForests will soon face harsher regulation and greater oversight by the regulator, a move which comes in the aftermath of an ABC investigation into allegations of illegal logging. The regulator's additional powers were announced as part of what Victoria's Agriculture Minister described as ""major changes"" to the state's plan to shut the native logging industry by 2030. But they were packaged with other changes, which conservationists have said may weaken protections for the environment. The changes included nearly doubling the money given to communities affected by the industry's decline, and a move one industry player hopes will limit the ability for conservationists to challenge logging in courts. ""The plan ensures critical supply chains that rely on native timber will have enough time to adjust ahead of the phase-out in 2030, while supporting workers and communities through the 2024 step-down and beyond,"" said Mary-Anne Thomas, Victoria's agriculture minister, in a statement. Last month, an ABC investigation revealed areas that had been logged were not being regrown as the industry claimed. Some areas, which were officially marked as regenerated, years later appeared to be nothing more than weed-infested grasslands. VicForests said at the time it complied with the law and that any questions about those areas already marked as regenerated should be directed to the government since they were no longer VicForests' responsibility. The ABC reveals alarming evidence that forests aren’t always being grown back after they've been logged, undermining VicForests's claim to sustainability. But the decision to categorise many of those logged areas as ""regenerated"" did not require any independent checks. In a statement, a VicForests spokesperson said: ""VicForests welcomes today’s announcement by the Victorian government to bolster the Victorian Forestry Plan. ""We look forward to working with all relevant stakeholders to ensure a strong and vibrant future for Victorian forestry."" Now, the government has said they will reinstate a requirement for any areas being claimed as regenerated, to be approved first by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. To support that change, the government also announced $14 million would be spent, including on work to establish a way of managing regenerated forests in the long term. Margaret Blakers, an independent researcher who conducted a detailed investigation into VicForests' regeneration, said the move was positive but mostly ""window dressing"". ""The first point is that they have actually recognised that there are huge problems with regeneration. That's implicit in the response,"" she said. But she said the main problem underlying the failed regeneration was simply the scale and intensity of the logging. ""Regeneration starts with logging and there is no reduction in the intensity of logging, no moving forward of the 2030 deadline,"" said Ms Blakers, who has been a prominent member of the Greens. ""So logging continues at the same pace until at least 2024 and that's a disaster."" Minister Thomas also announced plans to give the Office of the Conservation Regulator new infringement powers, giving it more tools to discipline VicForests if it breaches logging laws again. But the government could not provide details about what those new powers would be. High-resolution spatial data and information obtained as part of an ABC investigation sparks allegations of widespread and systemic illegal logging in protected Victorian water catchments. Last month, the ABC revealed evidence supporting allegations of widespread and systemic breaches of logging laws by VicForests. The ABC also revealed the regulator had failed to properly investigate those allegations. David Lindenmayer from the Australian National University, one of the world's leading forest ecologists, said the announcement sounded meaningless. ""They haven't used the powers they have, so I want to see something real here rather than vacuous arm-waving,"" he said. Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au. Nicola Rivers, an environmental lawyer at Environment Justice Australia, agreed. ""While it is promising [that] the Andrews government has recognised this is a serious issue, it is absolutely inadequate to waste time introducing new infringement options when the focus should be on using the strong environment protection tools already available in Victorian law,"" she said. ""The problem is not a lack of enforcement tools, the problem is the government's failure to use them."" VicForests has consistently denied breaching the law in a widespread way. ""All timber harvesting and regeneration operations are conducted in line with Victoria's strict environmental regulations and the State's Forest Management Zoning Scheme,"" it said in an earlier statement. Meanwhile, in response to legal challenges, the government said it would introduce legislation to give more ""certainty"" to industry. New legislation would make changes to the way something called the ""precautionary principle"" is required to be complied with by loggers. The precautionary principle is written into the law, requiring VicForests to abide by it. In general terms, it means actions should be taken to avoid environmental harm, even when it is not certain that harm would occur. But precisely how that is applied in any particular jurisdiction is a complex matter usually decided by courts. Last year, the Federal Court ruled VicForests had been breaching the precautionary principle by failing to avoid serious and irreversible damage to the threatened Greater Glider. ""We have seen increased litigation which has locked up coupes and made it more difficult for our industry to access the timber that they need,"" Minister Thomas said. Malcolm McComb, chairman of forestry business Pentarch Group, was very grateful for the government's announcement. ""We would just like to say we are very thankful to the government for taking the steps to stop the warfare, and the legislation changes to stop the amount of time that's been wasted on pursuing political change through the court system,"" he said. No detail was released about how that would be implemented. Minister Thomas said it would be revealed in legislation to be tabled in 2022. Environmental lawyer Nicola Rivers said the move could weaken environmental law and put wildlife at greater risk. ""Logging continues to drive threatened wildlife towards extinction. It's time for the Andrews government to use the full force of the law not rewrite it, and to immediately protect remaining important habitats,"" she said.

245,'Scaring it to death': Study finds robot fish are removing invasive species in Australian waters,environment,"  Robot fish scare off invasive species in Australian waters, study finds Robots could one day be patrolling our rivers and land to seek and destroy invasive species. Researchers at the University of Western Australia built a robot fish in 2018 that they used to scare away one of the world's most invasive species, the mosquitofish, which they describe as ""one of the most problematic animals on the planet"". In a study published on Friday in the journal iScience, researchers revealed how fear altered the behaviour, physiology and fertility of the invasive fish, effectively ""scaring it to death"". The international team of biologists and engineers from Australia, the US and Italy used the decoy to mimic its natural predator — the largemouth bass — by simulating its movements. Gambusia, known as mosquitofish, were originally introduced into Australia about 100 years ago to combat mosquitoes. The species is now considered one of Australia's biggest freshwater threats. Now there are millions of the tiny fish threatening Australia's native fish as well as frogs, chewing off the tails of freshwater fishes and tadpoles and eating fish and frog eggs. Report author Giovanni Polverino, a behavioural ecologist at the University of Western Australia, says the mosquitofish is particularly damaging to Australia's natural ecosystem. ""We made their worst nightmare become real: a robot that scares the mosquitofish but not the other animals around it,"" Dr Polverino told AAP. ""Instead of killing them one by one, we're presenting an approach that can inform better strategies to control this global pest."" Invasive species cost Australian agriculture and the environment around $25 billion a year, according to the Centre for Invasive Species Solutions. The endangered red-finned blue-eye fish is being pushed to extinction by the ""cane toad of fish"" so scientists are using artificial springs on a remote outback reserve to defend the species. ""Gambusia endangers a range of threatened species, including the green and golden bell frog,"" chief executive Andreas Glanznig said. ""Given the predator is such a key threat, any effective technology that can reduce their impact is welcomed."" This concept could be applied more widely, according to Dr Polverino. ""Every animal on the planet is affected by predators … we have now applied this idea into an aquatic system where we have invasive species and endangered species but the idea could be applied on a terrestrial system,"" he said. The robot ""precisely targets the bad guys"" without threatening the native species. Dr Polverino said the robot was built ""to copy the ancestral predator"" of gambusia, which has American origins. ""We made their nightmare visibly real, but without scaring the Australian species who haven't encountered the predator before, so they're not afraid."" Peter Johnson, from the Queensland branch of the Australian New Guinea Fishers Association, said the mosquitofish problem was a failure on the scale of the cane toad. Getting rid of mosquitofish would allow native species such as rainbow fish to return and lead to healthier aquatic ecosystems, he said.

246,"Green light for Queensland coal mine expansion, with conditions, after decade-long battle",environment,"  Land Court gives conditional green light to New Acland coal mine expansion but farmers vow to maintain 'existential fight' The Queensland Land Court has conditionally approved the controversial expansion of the New Acland coal mine on the Darling Downs. The planned expansion has been the subject of legal battles for well over a decade, with a group comprising more than 60 local landholders opposing the project. The mine's owners, New Hope Group, said the conditional approval was an excellent result. ""There are still a number of steps required to obtain final project approval for stage three,"" said the mine's general manager Dave O'Dwyer. ""We will continue to work closely with the relevant Queensland Government departments to achieve these approvals."" Oakey Coal Action Alliance (OCAA) secretary Paul King said he believed the legal process had ""severe limitations"" as important issues like the impacts on groundwater were not considered. ""It would be wrong to say we're not disappointed that the mine was not rejected,"" he said. ""But it would also be wrong to say that we're surprised. ""There was no consideration of groundwater or intergenerational equity and we think they're deficiencies with the system. Everything should be considered."" Mr King said the OCAA would continue its fight against the project, planning to make representations to Resources Minister Scott Stewart on intergenerational equity and seek stricter noise conditions from the Coordinator-General. ""It's certainly not the end of the line,"" Mr King said. ""The farmers involved in OCAA are fighting an existential fight. ""Their livelihoods depend on the mine not going ahead and therefore they cannot give up."" The Queensland government has long maintained it would only consider granting approvals for the mine once all legal processes were finished. Resources Minister Scott Stewart has been contacted for comment. Mining at the New Acland site stopped on November 26 after it exhausted its supply of coal. More than 280 workers have been made redundant from the mine since 2019, with only 20 staff on the site now for care and maintenance. New Hope Group said the final approval, if granted once conditions are met, would enable a restart of operations and more employment opportunities. New Hope Group first applied for approval for its stage-three expansion in 2007; since then, it has been stalled by legislative demands and protracted legal challenges. The OCAA first lodged its legal challenge against the project in the Land Court in 2016. The hearing lasted almost 100 days, becoming the longest in the court's history. In May 2017, Judge Paul Smith rejected the application for the mining lease and environmental approval on the grounds of inadequate groundwater modelling and its impact on farming land. New Hope Group appealed against the decision in the Supreme Court, with the matter being sent back to the Land Court in May 2018 for a rehearing. Land Court President Fleur Kingham reheard the case and decided that if the miner could comply with amendments to noise limits, the environmental authority for the expansion could be approved. The OCAA appealed against that decision and then New Hope cross-appealed. These actions were both heard in the Court of Appeal, which dismissed OCAA's case in November 2019 and allowed the New Hope cross-appeal, finding the first Land Court decision by Judge Smith had been affected by apprehended bias. The OCAA then applied for special leave to appeal to the High Court to have its whole case reheard. The High Court found in favour of the group earlier this year and ordered the case be reheard in the Queensland Land Court.

247,Mines department staff say NT ICAC's rejection of fraud and misconduct complaint leaves them nowhere to go,environment,"  Mines department staff say NT ICAC's rejection of fraud and misconduct complaint leaves them nowhere to go A group of Northern Territory public servants who alleged management fraud and misconduct had affected their ability to regulate major mines are dismayed their complaint has been rejected by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Eight mining officers alleged they were pressured to water down environmental assessments for projects, including Glencore's controversial McArthur River Mine, and that they were being pushed to facilitate mining at all costs. The NT Department of Industry, which regulates mining, rejected the allegations and denied the rigour of approval processes had been affected. The ABC understands investigations will go no further through the ICAC. Some of the mining officers felt they had nowhere else to go to get their concerns addressed. ""If the ICAC considers the complaints of eight public officers not worth investigating, what is?"" one of the group told the ABC. ""It's damning and serious."" Public servants are legally banned from speaking to the media without their management's permission, so the group member is not being named. The officers said they first complained to managers within their department and then the Public Employment Commissioner in 2019. Employment Commissioner Vicki Telfer produced a report on the allegations in November 2019, which has been seen by the ABC. Environment groups call on the Commonwealth to regulate Glencore's McArthur River Mine after the NT government reduced the scope of the mine's current independent monitor. Ms Telfer rejected some of the allegations, including claims that staff were directed by management to ""water down environmental assessments"" and to ""support mining at all costs"". But she found other allegations were correct, including: The complainant said the group believed some of the things they alleged occurred posed serious threats to the environment. They said these incidents included a staff member being asked to recalculate the McArthur River Mine environmental security bond, which the government holds, in just 24 hours. ""That was one example of feeling pressured to cut corners,"" the complainant alleged. ""The department didn't do their own calculation — McArthur River Mine's calculation was accepted instead."" They said on another occasion, staff were worried about being asked not to increase the mine's security bond amount because the company had argued some activities expanding the mine were ""cost-neutral"". They also alleged that the department's management would not provide approvals for site visits in 2018 and 2019 to monitor water discharges from major mines. ""The site visits are normally done in the wet season to capture the flows, but the approvals needed weren't in place, so they ended up doing sampling in June and July when the mines aren't discharging,"" the complainant said. ""The behaviour of management affected me personally, it affected the team, and the ability to regulate the mining sector. ""The quality of the work was impacted and it would be placing the environment at a higher risk."" They alleged staff concerns had contributed to the resignation of 17 of 38 departmental staff in one section since they started complaining, and that many had not been replaced. The NT Regional Organiser for the Community and Public Sector Union, Kay Densley, provided advice to some of the complainants and said she was very surprised the ICAC rejected their case. ""I think fraudulent behaviour and not letting people do their job, which is important to keep all Territorians and the environment safe, I think that's pretty serious,"" she said. ""The other thing they were concerned about was [management] putting mates into positions, people more willing to cut the corners."" Industry Department chief executive Shaun Drabsch said he was aware of bullying claims that were not substantiated. ""I completely reject any inference that internal staffing matters have impacted the rigour of our approval processes,"" he said. ""There are stringent protections to investigate any claims of misconduct or fraud."" The ICAC Commissioner Michael Riches would not comment on the mining officers' complaint, saying: ""I do not comment upon matters that were dealt with by the previous commissioner."" ""Nor will I comment upon matters that may or may not be the subject of a current investigation."" But he later said that it would be wrong to presume that all the matters relating to the issues raised have been closed. Mr Riches took over the role from former commissioner Ken Fleming in September. The former mines department officers do not know whether their complaint was dropped because the ICAC Commissioner announced in September that he was reducing the number and scope of his investigations to just the most serious corruption cases. ""There's now nowhere for public servants to go to have their concerns addressed,"" the complainant said. The ICAC said last year it had received allegations of serious systemic issues across a number of NT Government departments, ranging from abuse of power to fraud. Ms Densley said the reduction in the ICAC's investigative scope had worried many public servants. ""They need somewhere to go, so it is disappointing that ICAC has come to this,"" she said. Independent MLA Robyn Lambley said the ICAC's reduction in scope was a ""backward step"". ""Closing down the ability of Territorians to refer matters that they are gravely concerned about involving misconduct or corruption is not the way to go."" Ms Lambley questioned whether the ICAC had reduced its investigations because of a lack of funding. She has called on the government to publish the results of a secret review it carried out into the ICAC, the terms of reference for which have also been kept under wraps. But NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner said ICAC's reduced scope was not because of a resourcing problem. ""The ICAC Commissioner allocates what they think their priorities are, so that's a decision of the ICAC, they still have all the legislative powers they had, we've made no changes to the Act,"" he said. Asked by the ABC whether resourcing has caused the ICAC to reduce its scope, the Commissioner said: ""I will not take on more matters than my resources permit."" ""To do so will inevitably delay the timely resolution of matters and increase the likelihood of unintended errors,"" Mr Riches said.

248,The world's first true thousand-foot millipede has been found in a WA mine,environment," Science We have a new world record holder. Introducing the first millipede with more than 1,000 legs Ladies and gentlemen, introducing a creature that could empty the wardrobe of Imelda Marcos, our new king of limbs, the princess of poda, boasting 1,306 spectacular stilts, the ""true thousand foot"" Eumillipes persephone. Until now, the term ""millipede"" has really been a case of false advertising. Literally translating from the Latin mille (thousand) and pes (foot), the ""millipede"" species with the most legs has so far only boasted 750. But a new discovery 60 metres down an exploratory mining drill hole in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia has finally delivered us a millipede that not only lives up to its name, but walks it out of the park. As if the other 12,000 or so species of inadequately limbed ""millipedes"" didn't have enough on their plates, the discoverers of E. persephone decided to add the Greek prefix ""eu"" (implying ""true"") to its name, to underscore our new hero's singular bona fides. And because Eumillipes persephone is too much of a mouthful, it will henceforth be referred to as the true millipede throughout this story. ""[My colleague] was the first one to lay eyes on [the true millipede in the lab], and she was like, 'look, these millipedes are amazing',"" said Bruno Buzatto, who works for the environmental consultancy that made the discovery and is also an author on the paper. Dr Buzatto, who is also affiliated with Macquarie University and the University of Western Australia, said the new species was discovered as part of an environmental impact assessment survey for a proposed mine. Traps containing leaf litter were lowered down drill holes for differing periods of weeks to months, and then returned to the consultancy laboratory for emptying and analysis. When he first saw the true millipede, Dr Buzatto said he was reminded of an earlier research paper he had come across. ""I looked back on that paper and realised that 750 legs was the highest number for the millipede,"" he said. ""I looked at our millipede and saw at least 800 [legs]."" First discovered in 2020 and described for the first time today in a paper published in Scientific Reports, the millipede's body is divided into 330 segments, has a cone-shaped head with ""enormous"" antennae, a beak, and has lost its eyes and much of its pigment. It measures about 9.5 centimetres long, by about 1 millimetre across. But most spectacular of all is its generous array of legs, which Dr Buzatto says are thought to aid in locomotion in tight crevices. ""[Millipedes] get longer and have more legs when they're adapted to living underground,"" he said. ""They're not living in big underground caves, they're living in small fissures — it's quite possible they have more legs to get more traction to move."" The true millipede closely resembles the previous world leg-record holder Illacme plenipes from California, in a case of convergent evolution — where species develop similar traits independently. That so-called millipede species also lives underground, and has a thin, elongated body. Our true thousand footer though is actually in an order called Polyzoniida, according to taxonomist Juanita Rodriguez from the CSIRO, a co-author who worked on the classification of the new species. Species in that order are typically shorter with dome-shaped bodies and fewer legs. To work out its pedigree, Dr Rodriguez constructed a phylogenetic tree using genetic orthologs — shared genes passed down through species from a common ancestor — to then find the most recent common ancestor of the true millipede. ""For this paper, we looked at over 300 genes in the genome,"" she said. But beyond its phylogeny and morphology, Dr Rodriguez says there's not too much we can say about the ecology of the new species at this stage. It has been caught at 60m underground, but could theoretically be found much deeper. And like other members of the family Siphonotidae, it may feed on fungi from plant roots, but it's all speculative at the moment. It may be some time before we get more answers, partly because there are only a handful of millipede specialists in the world, according to Dr Rodriguez. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. ""There are I think 12,000 species of millipedes in the world and I think most of the people who work with millipedes are on this paper,"" she said. Dr Buzatto says the other issue is that there is very little support for identifying and classifying new species at the moment, especially in Australia. ""The very first step to conserving those things is to identify and classify [them],"" he said. ""The vast majority of subterranean fauna and a lot of invertebrates in Australia are still undescribed — 90 per cent of what we pull out of those holes are undescribed species."" Dr Buzatto says taxonomists in Australia are doing very important work with few resources and there are likely to be many more undescribed subterranean species in the region where this millipede was found.

249,Optimism for vulnerable malleefowl chicks as good winter rains boost chance of survival ,environment,"  Wet winter lifts survival hopes for quirky malleefowl that mates for life but doesn't parent Good winter and spring rains on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula have ecologists optimistic one of the region's rarest birds will breed in greater numbers this season after surviving a series of drought years. Malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) rely on good winter rain to support the plant life needed to build and maintain their nests. The birds are unusual as they bury their eggs in a mound of sand and leaf litter — measuring up to four-metres wide — which they maintain to a consistent 33 degrees Celsius. Ecologist Cat Lynch said there were more active nest sites found this season than in previous years at both Secret Rocks, a privately owned nature reserve, and at Ironstone Hill Conservation Park, about 50 kilometres south-west of Whyalla. ""We monitored 250 known malleefowl mounds across that area and we found seven active mounds … that are actively being used by mallee fowl for breeding and incubating eggs,"" Ms Lynch said. ""While seven out of 250 breeding mounds does sound quite low, compared to the past couple of years it is a bit higher which is promising. ""In 2020 we only recorded two active mounds and then only one in 2019."" In the far west of the state at Yellabinna Regional Reserve, Yumbarra Conservation Park and Maralinga there were 23 mounds of which eight were active. Regional ecologist Brett Backhouse said the local conditions were ""very, very hot and dry"" in summer. While malleefowl mate for life and are dedicated to the nest, the birds are not so enamoured with parenting. The male malleefowl uses his beak as a thermometer to constantly check the nest, removing or adding compost litter to regulate the temperature of the eggs. After a 60-day incubation, the hatchlings — the size of a poultry chick — dig their way out of the nest and head off solo to find food and shelter. Mr Backhouse said despite low nest numbers and a high predation rate of chicks, the malleefowl are tough and are quite good survivors. ""Eyre Peninsula and Murray Darling basin and areas in Victoria they've got hundreds and hundreds of mounds and they'll have a small percentage that are active, whereas we [in the far west] tend to be not that many mounds but we tend to have relatively high activity levels,"" he said. ""Malleefowl are quite a remarkable bird. ""It's quite an intensive breeding strategy and its quite incredible to see the birds raking the leaf litter into the mound and maintaining the temperature needed to incubate the eggs."" Ms Lynch said the chicks were susceptible to predation from introduced foxes and feral cats so their survival rate was quite low. Even the adults faced many threats. Adelaide University PhD student Peri Stenhouse has been studying malleefowl on Eyre Peninsula since 2016 and has tagged nine birds with satellite trackers for her study. Only one tagged bird remains alive. Most of the others were killed by feral cats or foxes. ""It is alarming because the birds are quite long lived,"" Ms Stenhouse said. ""So if the life expectancy of an animal is only a year or two then it's normal for them to die reasonably quickly, but if the bird is expected to live about 20 years — which a malleefowl probably is — it's worrying and especially because we know juvenile mortality is very high. ""Other studies have shown most of the chicks that were released were dead within weeks basically, so we need the adults to stick around for a long time so they can keep on breeding so that at least a few of the chicks that they produce actually make it to adulthood."" Ms Stenhouse said a number of factors impacted on the survival of malleefowl, including predation, competition from introduced and native herbivores, loss of habitat and a changing climate. ""2019 was the driest year ever in South Australia and the numbers were sad,"" she said. Ecologist Katherine Moseby, who co-owns Secret Rocks nature reserve, said Eyre Peninsula was lucky to still have malleefowl. Secret Rocks has a 4,000 hectare exclusion zone to keep out feral predators and herbivores, but the park has still seen a decline in malleefowl numbers. ""Over the past couple of decades the numbers have declined pretty much everywhere across Eyre Peninsula,"" Dr Moseby said. ""We've gone from seeing birds every day crossing our driveway to rarely seeing a bird at all. ""It's really sad for the malleefowl and some of it is the climate changing — more droughts and less winter rain — but some of it is just cats and foxes and overgrazing by kangaroos and rabbits, and goats and sheep. ""We can certainly do more to help them by excluding those herbivores from patches of scrub, fencing them off from stock and trying to do more control of predators. ""It's pretty sad they're still declining even thought we're trying to do everything right.""

250,Giant 'thunder birds' had infections so severe they warped their bones,environment," Science Fossil discovery shows some Australian 'thunder birds' had painful bone infection before species went extinct Around 50,000 years ago, a giant flightless bird roamed the open woodlands and lake edges of southern Australia. This mihirung paringmal (giant bird), sometimes called a ""thunder bird"" (Genyoris newtoni), weighed five to six times that of an emu, was 2 metres tall, and had a huge beak. But what caused the demise of the species isn't entirely settled. As with much of Australia's extinct megafauna, the sticking point centres on the relative influence of people versus climate change. Now new evidence has found the giant birds had another struggle to contend with. Analysis of fossils found stuck in the salt-lake beds of the Lake Callabonna fossil reserve in South Australia shows some of the animals were suffering from a painful bone infection when they died. Lead author of the research published today in Papers in Palaeontology, PhD candidate Phoebe McInerney from Flinders University, said the infection would likely have caused pain and weakness in the afflicted animals before their deaths. ""We had some large cavities throughout the bones and we also had some distorted bones,"" Ms McInerney said. ""The surface of the bones is really frothy and doesn't have the smooth look of healthy bones."" The abnormal growths and cavities, which were found on the chest, leg and foot bones of four individuals out of a total of 34 animals the researchers looked at, point to osteomyelitis — a severe bone infection that can spread via the bloodstream or tissue. It's found in birds today including domestic chickens and turkeys, as well as people, and often arises from an injury to the bone or an infection elsewhere in the body. But it's rare in wild birds to find multiple individuals of a population suffering osteomyelitis, and points to external pressures causing the disease cluster, Ms McInerney said. ""Having a single infection type in 11 per cent [of the population] is highly unusual,"" she said. ""We were able to use dating of the fossil site [to see that it coincided] with really severe drought."" The disease is thought to become more prevalent when an external stress, such as drought, compromises the immune system. The mihirung that the well-preserved fossils once belonged to are thought to have become stuck in mud on the edge of a lake. It's possible that the weakness and pain caused by the osteomyelitis made it more difficult for those individuals to get out of the mud, and may also go some way toward explaining the cluster of fossils found with signs of the infection. Dated to between 54,200 and 50,400 years ago, the animals died during a period when severe droughts were becoming more frequent, and swathes of the continent were being reshaped; inland lakes and forests were disappearing, and grasslands and desert were becoming increasingly dominant. Other species of fossilised megafauna have also been found at the site, Ms McInerney said, and point to a very different landscape than the one there today. ""We also have evidence of diprotodon getting stuck, and giant tree kangaroos as well. ""Now there is just nothing. You stand there and look over this flat plain and you have a few salt bushes — it's pretty much just desert."" When it comes to the extinction of Australia's megafauna, there are a few competing hypotheses. At one extreme, the blitzkrieg hypothesis argues that the extinction of megafauna all around the world likely happened as humans spread out, encountering native and easily-hunted prey as they went. At the other end of the scale, it's argued that the extinction of megafauna was caused by climate change. Research published last year in Nature Communications looked at megafauna extinctions in northern and eastern Australia, including at South Walker Creek near Mackay in Queensland. Despite being over 1,000 kilometres from Lake Callabonna, the two sites are connected, according to the lead author of that paper, palaeontologist Scott Hocknull from the Queensland Museum. ""Even though they're thousands of kilometres apart, they both share the same catchment,"" Dr Hocknull said. ""The lakes at Lake Callabonna all drain from Queensland — it's all part of the Lake Eyre basin."" But the megafauna extinctions at the South Walker Creek site are thought to have occurred thousands of years after those at Lake Callabonna. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. This is consistent with a trend of aridification that is thought to have started in Australia's interior, spreading outwards toward the coast, Dr Hocknull said. But it's not consistent with the pattern of dispersal of people across Australia. The evidence of environmental stress in the Lake Callabonna population of Genyornis newtoni, prior to the extinction of the species Australia wide, suggests climate factors were heavily influential at that location. So does that shift the debate one way or the other? ""A few years ago there was definitely two camps: either climate change or humans did it,"" Dr Hocknull said. ""Most of us working in this area have always considered that neither one, nor the other, did it. ""The research suggests that each catchment in Australia needs to be treated individually.""

251,How renters can benefit from solar power — no roof required,environment," Science 'Solar gardens' may be the answer for renters and apartment-dwellers locked out of renewable energy When Ash asked his property manager to pass on a request to the landlord to install solar panels at his Sydney rental, he knew it was a shot in the dark and probably going to fail. Why would the landlord pay for the panels if Ash, a tenant he'd never met, would reap the lower power bills? ""It wasn't the most enticing offer,"" Ash said. ""The property manager said thanks for the idea, but the landlord is not ready for it."" Australia has an exceptionally high uptake of rooftop solar, but for millions of households, installing panels is not an option, even when they can afford them. They're either renting, living in an apartment, or their roof is too shaded. All up, a whopping one-third of all households are unable to directly participate in the switch to renewables — meaning they're locked out of saving money through cheaper power bills. The most vulnerable, low-income electricity users fall into this category. One proposed solution to this is community solar energy gardens, where households can invest in a ""plot"" in a solar array elsewhere, and then get credits on their electricity bill. The latest national Energy Consumer Sentiment Survey, commissioned by Energy Consumers' Australia (ECA), suggests the idea is growing in popularity, with almost three-quarters of family households interested in buying power from a local community solar garden. But despite the idea being around for some time, and popular in the US, Australia has only one tiny solar garden. So what are solar gardens, and why has the idea been slow to catch on? Australia's first and only solar garden is a 35kW solar array situated on the roof of the North Coast Community Housing (NCCH) building, a social housing provider in Lismore, NSW. The NCCH pays Enova Energy, a local community-owned retailer, for any electricity it uses from the array. The money generated by that purchase is converted to electricity bill credits and divided between 24 ""solar gardeners"", who are a mix of local community groups and NCCH social housing tenants. ""We've provided $1,000 in bill credits to four community organisations in the 2021 financial year and tenants have been provided around $4,500 in credits on energy bills,"" said Felicity Stening, Enova's managing director. ""It's an amazing thing to be able to provide credits onto people's bills that comes from solar generated on someone else's roof."" A second, much larger solar garden planned to be built in the Riverina region of NSW is taking a different approach. The Haystacks Solar Garden will be a collection of 330 3kW plots totalling 1MW. Customers, who can be anywhere in NSW, will pay about $4,200 to own a plot and receive credits on their electricity bills. The project is in the final stages of getting financial approvals and grid connections completed, says Kristy Walters from the Community Power Agency, which is a partner in the project. ""We're hoping to go ahead and start construction next year,"" she said. Though solar gardens have been slow to catch on compared to privately-owned rooftop panels, there's evidence of growing public interest in community-owned energy generation and storage. A small Western Australian wheat and sheep town is the unlikely location for a radical community energy project. Most people responding to the Energy Consumer Sentiment Survey said it was unfair renters and those living in apartments could not access solar. A sizeable majority backed the government installing solar and batteries in community housing and incentivising landlords and apartment complex owners to do the same. Almost half of households said initiatives such as solar gardens should be supported by government investment. This points to a change in the way many Australians are thinking about solar and energy in general, ECA chief executive officer Lynne Gallagher said. Previous surveys have shown that values of independence and self-sufficiency motivate people to get solar panels. This survey suggests there's emerging interest in a more community-oriented way of looking at energy — something to share and a way to help neighbours and take part in a common enterprise. ""The rise of rooftop solar in Australia has been a world-leading success. But we know the benefits have not been equally available to all,"" said Ms Gallagher, whose organisation represents residential owners and small businesses. ""We are now seeing an appetite for new models of generating and storing clean energy that are more local, more community based and can be enjoyed by all."" Earlier this month, Labor unveiled a climate plan that includes a proposal for dozens of ""solar banks"" — another name for solar gardens. Under the plan, a Labor government would invest $100 million to support the creation of 85 solar gardens, which Labor says could allow more than 25,000 households to share in the benefits of solar power. The funding would subsidise up to 50 per cent of the capital cost of a project. A 2018 feasibility study part-funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) also proposed a capital subsidy of 50 per cent to make solar gardens financially viable. This would work out to about $2,400-$4,200 per household, the report said. Its lead author, Jay Rutovitz from the University of Technology Sydney, pointed out that households have been enjoying generous government subsidies for years, in the form of solar panel rebates. Subsidising solar gardens would extend this welfare to a further third of households. ""There's also a strong equity argument for making solar available to people for whom it's not been available to,"" Ms Rutovitz said. But Ms Rutovitz, who is the research director with the Institute for Sustainable Futures at UTS, added that subsidies did not go far enough and it was necessary to reform the electricity system. After years of increases, power prices are set to fall, thanks largely to cheap solar. She proposed that energy customers who got their power from a nearby community-owned solar array should not have to pay as much for transmission as an energy customer who got their power from further away and relied on costly long-distance transmission. ""We need to have some kind of local network tariff for community solar and community batteries as well,"" Ms Rutovitz said. Network charges, aka the cost of delivering power, make up a large proportion of a standard electricity bill. In the US, solar gardens don't have to pay this cost, and there is now 3.4 gigawatts of installed community solar across 41 states. ""In Australia, we gave subsidies to put solar on the roof, while in the US they said that for anyone that sets up a solar farm, the consumer is not to be charged network charges,"" Ms Rutovitz said. ""It's a different way of structuring the subsidies and it's had perverse effects in both places. They got massive amounts of centralised solar farms and very little rooftop."" Enova Energy's Ms Stening said government funding was needed to ""get these projects off the ground"". The Haystacks project is supported by a grant from the NSW government. Ms Walters from the Community Power Agency said the financial rewards of solar gardens would never be as good as having a rooftop solar system, but they were better than no solar savings at all. Ash, who's still renting in Sydney and remains locked out of access to solar, has signed up to the Haystacks project. He hopes to soon buy a plot in the array. ""This is a no-brainer,"" he said. ""Renters and tenants get a really shit experience. I don't have any power in this whole landlord game play. ""But this is a tangible thing I can invest in.""

253,'No-one should have to live next to this': Tip fire in Melbourne's west to burn until May 2022,environment,"  Residents in Melbourne's west fear the worst as Kealba Landfill fire to burn through summer Every Monday, St Albans resident Nicole Power checks the weather forecast, to see if there will be a northerly wind. If there is, she brings the washing in and closes the windows and doors to stop the smell of burning rubbish getting inside her house. ""We don't go outside, we close all the windows, put all the deodorisers on,"" she said. Nicole Power lives about 350 metres from the Kealba Landfill, on the banks of the Maribyrnong River in Melbourne's west. It is a built-up area, with lots of young families. They say the tip was not much of a problem until the spotfires developed underground more than two years ago. ""It varies between the smell of living in the back of a cattle truck, to a chemical-based burning odour,"" Ms Power said. The fire has been burning since November 2019, and is not expected to be put out until May 2022. Ms Power is regularly woken up by the smell of the fires. ""You'll be dead to the world and you can feel it in your throat,"" she said. ""You can taste it, it wakes you up, and you realise what it is, so you close the windows but it's too late. It's already in the house."" She said she has regularly reported the tip to the Environment Protection Authority (EPA), sometimes multiple times a day. Air quality monitors set up by the EPA and the tip's owners have not found any long-term risk to the community's health, associated with the tip. But for many locals, including Ms Power, two years of living with the windows closed and being woken up at night is affecting their mental health. ""No-one should have to live next to this,"" she said. Many residents want to know why it has taken more than two years to put out the fires. To show residents what they are doing to put out the fire, the tip's owner, the Barro Group, took some neighbours and the ABC inside the tip. We were not allowed to take photos, but we were shown a 20-metre-high pile of waste. There are four fires burning at the bottom of the pile. The company uses heat sensors to find the fires, then it has to use heavy machinery to dig the waste out to get to them. At the end of the day, it all has to be covered up. A Barro Group spokesman, Steve Murphy, told the ABC it is a big job. ""Several hundred thousand cubic metres of material needs to be excavated to access the hotspots and extinguish them,"" he said. ""Each bucket of material has to be temperature checked before it can be loaded, treated and reburied, which makes it a safe but laborious process."" He added that the company is confident three of the four hotspots are out, but they are waiting on an auditor's inspection. The EPA's chief executive, Lee Miezis, said the environmental watchdog visited the site regularly. ""Two years is a long time to be living with odour,"" he said. ""We're all really focused on making sure this is put out, [that] it's done quickly and it's done safely."" In September 2021, the EPA suspended Barro Group's licence to operate, after the company failed to meet deadlines to put the fires out. That means the tip can't accept any more waste, at least for now. Victoria's Environment Minister, Lily D'Ambrosio, said the EPA is doing enough. ""Ultimately the EPA has cracked down on the Barro Group and they are on notice — they've got to fix this problem,"" she said. Tip fires do sometimes happen, including at Coolaroo in Melbourne's north in 2017. Barro Group spokesman Steve Allen said the company would investigate what caused the fires, once they were all cleared. ""But it is suspected that air ingress (entering) into the compacted waste played a part,"" he said. He said the company was working to make sure there were no more fires. ""The site was constructed and operated in line with EPA-mandated standards and a thorough review of those issues will be undertaken once remediation is completed,"" he said. Many residents of Kealba, Sunshine and St Albans are worried about another hot summer with the windows closed. Colin Dunphy lives on the other side of the tip, and said the tip fire is a reminder that when we throw rubbish away, it doesn't really go away. ""Cities develop and grow, you have your landfills on the outer edges, eventually residential catches up to that and that's just where we are here, I think,"" he said. Last year, Victoria generated 15.86 million tonnes of waste, across households, industry and construction, and 4.8 million tonnes of that ended up in landfill.

254,Up to 100 killed in Kentucky as tornadoes wreak havoc in US,environment,"  Death toll 'north of 70', up to 100 feared dead in Kentucky as tornadoes wreak havoc in US Up to 100 people have been killed in a devastating series of tornadoes that ripped through Kentucky and several other US states, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear says. Mr Beshear said the string of tornadoes was the most destructive in the state's history. ""The level of devastation is unlike anything that I have ever seen,"" Mr Beshear said. ""We were pretty sure that we would lose over 50 Kentuckians. I'm now certain that number is north of 70. It may, in fact, end up exceeding 100 before the day is done."" US National Weather Service said 36 separate tornadoes struck the Midwest of the country. In Kentucky, they caused damage in more than a dozen counties. The primary tornado travelled more than 320 kilometres across the state, Mr Beshear told an early morning news conference. ""The reports are really heartbreaking,"" Mr Beshear said. ""This has been one of the toughest nights in Kentucky history and some areas have been hit in ways that is hard to put into words. ""This is going to be some of the worst tornado damage that we've seen in a long time."" More than 56,000 Kentuckians were without power, he said, adding he had declared a state of emergency and was deploying dozens of national guardsmen to communities. The hardest-hit area appeared to be the city of Mayfield in Grave county, where a roof collapse at a candle factory caused ""mass casualties"". Kyanna Parsons-Perez, who was inside the factory, said the roof collapsed soon after the workers could hear and feel the hollowing winds and the lights began flickering. ""We could feel the wind … then we did a little rock,"" Ms Parsons-Perez told NBC. ""And then boom everything came down on us."" About 110 people were inside the factory when the tornado ripped through, the New York Times reported. ""We believe we'll lose at least dozens of those individuals,"" Mr Beshear said. President Joe Biden ordered federal resources to be surged to locations with the greatest need. In Tennessee, the severe weather killed at least three people, authorities said, while at least one person was killed and five were injured when a tornado shredded the roof of a nursing home in Monette in northern Arkansas. Craighead County Judge Marvin Day said it was lucky more people weren't killed when the 90-bed facility was hit in Monette, a small community near the border with Missouri. ""It just took a direct hit from the tornado,"" Mr Day said. ""We were very blessed that more people weren't killed or injured in that. It could have been a whole lot worse."" In Illinois, authorities said at least two workers died after the roof collapsed at an Amazon warehouse near St Louis late on Friday as tornadoes and strong storms blew through the area. The death toll may continue to rise with several people not accounted for at the facility. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company was ""heartbroken over the loss"" of its staff members in Edwardsville and would continue to work closely with the local authorities on the rescue efforts. The storms caused a CSX company freight train to derail in western Kentucky, although no injuries were reported, the Times said. Bill Bunting, operations chief at the Storm Prediction Center, part of the National Weather Service, said at least five states were hit by the tornadoes: Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and Arkansas, the Times reported.

255,"Tornado strikes a US nursing home with dozens of residents inside, killing one",environment,"  Tornado hits an Arkansas nursing home, killing one resident as tornadoes smash US One person has been killed and five injured after a nursing home in Monette, a city in the southern US state of Arkansas, was hit by a tornado. At least one fatality was also reported in Missouri as severe storms, some believed to have spawned tornadoes, swept across the Mid-west and parts of the south. In Tennessee, two storm-related fatalities were reported in Obion County in the state’s northwestern corner, said Dean Flener, spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. Mr Flener said he had no details on the deaths. Craighead County Judge Marvin Day told The Associated Press that a tornado struck the Monette Manor nursing home at about 8:15pm, local time, trapping 20 people inside as the building collapsed around them. Within two hours, the building had been cleared and everyone initially believed to have been inside had been accounted for, Mr Day said. ""It looks like it's pretty much destroyed,"" Judge Day said of the building. ""… It happened quick but apparently there was a little bit of time with tornado sirens going off."" Some residents were found in the basement ""and were prepared for this"", he said. The nursing home has about 90 beds. Judge Day cautioned residents to shelter in place. ""The worst thing to do would be to leave,"" he said. Photos posted to Twitter show emergency service vehicles surrounding what appears to be the badly damaged nursing home. A series of tornado warnings were issued for the area because of a strong storm system, according to local media. Meanwhile, emergency crews in southern Illinois were also responding to reports of injuries at an Amazon warehouse after a roof collapsed amid storms there. Footage from St Louis TV stations showed dozens of emergency vehicles at the Amazon centre near Edwardsville, Illinois, about 40 kilometres west of St Louis. It wasn’t immediately clear if, or how many, people were hurt, but the Collinsville, Illinois, Emergency Management Agency on Facebook called it a ""mass casualty incident"". One official told KTVI-TV that up to 100 people were believed to be in the building, working the night shift, at the time of the collapse. The Belleville News-Democrat reported that the Amazon fulfilment centre in Edwardsville opened with two warehouses in 2016, with 1.5 million square feet of space between them. Those warehouses are used to store items until they are shipped to mail-order customers. It wasn’t immediately clear if the damage to the Amazon warehouse was caused by straight-line storms or a tornado, but a large tornado was reported in the Edwardsville area at about the time the building was damaged. The Bureau of Meteorology has confirmed a tornado smashed through Queensland yesterday. Since when are tornadoes in Australia a thing? The National Weather Service office near St Louis issued reports of “radar-confirmed tornadoes” in the Edwardsville area. “The safety and well-being of our employees and partners is our top priority right now,"" Amazon spokesperson Richard Rocha said in a written statement. ""We’re assessing the situation and will share additional information when it’s available.” The collapse came as a strong thunderstorm — and, possibly, a tornado — ripped through the St Louis area. Winds of up to 70 mph (113kph) were reported in parts of St Charles and St Louis counties in Missouri. In rural St Charles County, Missouri, one person died and two others were injured when buildings collapsed near the town of Defiance, according to the National Weather Service. At least three St Charles County residents were admitted to hospital and several homes in the area near Augusta, Missouri, were damaged. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said on Twitter that Illinois State Police and disaster officials were coordinating with local officials at the Amazon fulfilment centre in Edwardsville, and he was monitoring the situation. ""My prayers are with the people of Edwardsville tonight, and I’ve reached out to the mayor to provide any needed state resources,"" Mr Pritzker said. Illinois and Arkansas were among several places in the Mid-west that reported tornadoes forming or on the ground. The storms caused additional damage as they tracked through Tennessee and into Kentucky. Several buildings collapsed in the southern Kentucky community of Mayfield, said Sarah Burgess, a trooper with the Kentucky State Police in Mayfield. Trooper Burgess said there were no reported deaths, however she said several people were trapped inside a damaged candle factory in Mayfield.

256,India is discovering surfing — and the plastic 'gifts' that the sea is carrying,environment," Science Surfing in India is taking off, but locals are staring down a tidal wave of plastic pollution When Tushar Pathiyan and Ishita Malaviya moved to Manipal on India's west coast in the mid-2000s, neither knew their lives were about to take a left turn. Tushar was studying architecture and Ishita journalism at Manipal University when they discovered the Surfing Swamis. India's first surf school had been co-founded in 2004 by the original Surfing Swami, American Jack Hebner, down the coast from Manipal. ""The second year [of studying] we started surfing,"" Tushar says. ""For me, starting surfing as a grown-up, it flipped the game in terms of my priorities. We were chasing not so much money, but a certain lifestyle,"" he says. A woman surfing in India was virtually unheard of back then, Ishita adds. ""When I first started surfing, if you literally googled surfing in India, nothing would show up,"" she says. ""When the competitions started, there were no women's categories."" Ishita went on to become India's first female professional surfer, competing in local events, and together with Tushar they started The Shaka Surf Club at a fishing village called Kode Bengre, about 40 kilometres up the coast from the Swamis. Setting up a surf school in rural India came with its own set of challenges, Ishita says, but their primary goal was to get locals surfing rather than cater to tourists. ""In the rural areas I find it way harder to get girls in the water because rural families are much more conservative,"" she says. ""It's the patriarchy — it's the men who don't want the women to have these freedoms. ""But I try to push the boundaries a bit — I have to."" It's been more than 10 years since they started the club. And today, surfing in India, including with women, is taking off. ""When we started surfing, there were maybe 15 people in the whole country that surf,"" Tushar says. ""Now [there are] at least 20 to 30 surf schools and contests are happening — it's definitely grown."" But the connection with the ocean that Tushar and Ishita say surfing brings comes with a heightened awareness that many of the coastal waters around India are in trouble. In May this year, Tropical Cyclone Tauktae slammed the west coast of India, regurgitating mountains of rubbish from the ocean back onto the coastline. At the time, many took to Twitter saying it was the ocean's way of returning the unwanted ""gifts"" it had been given. Some called for stricter rules against littering. It's a problem that east-coast champion surfer Appu is painfully familiar with. Appu grew up in Kovalam, a fishing village on India's east coast in the state of Tamil Nadu, and says surfing has changed his life and his relationship with the ocean. Appu runs Ocean Delight Surf School, which he founded with his schoolmate Vicky in Kovalam. They also run Beach Ocean Life — a program trying to engage locals and their surfing clients to help look after the beach. At this time of year, he says cyclones and heavy rains wash rubbish out of the rivers and prevailing ocean currents push it up onto the coastline. ""I've been trying to clean it for a month,"" Appu says. ""The first clean-up I arranged about 100 people came, then the next clean-up only 10 people came. ""I don't know what to do, but I at least want to clean the beach."" He says the local government has helped a bit, but it's not enough. Whenever there's another cyclone, the rubbish comes straight back, until the seasons change and it's washed out to sea. ""From May to June, there will be no plastic — the oceans will be clean."" Appu is currently trying to engage businesses to support a program paying women from the village to help with the clean-up. ""I tell all my students and local surfers and they understand now,"" he says. ""When you go to surf, you see the plastic on the wave. When you fall off you feel the plastic on your body, it's not comfortable."" Like Tushar and Ishita, Appu says he hopes that by teaching people to surf, he can also foster a respect and interest in caring for the waves. ""A lot of people are scared of the ocean in India and a lot of people don't know how to swim,"" he says. ""I have a program – ocean swimming class — I teach them to swim [and] they get more confident. ""I'm really happy to bring surf culture in India."" He says there's more at stake than being able to surf clean waves. ""When we throw the fish net in the ocean … and we cannot take the plastic from it, the net [is] f***ed."" ""A few fish I've found plastic inside the stomach and I told my mum, 'This is why we're doing what we're doing.' ""In maybe 10 years, people will be too scared to eat fish."" A report from the Pew Charitable Trusts in 2020 estimated that about 11 million tonnes of plastic flows to the oceans around the world each year. Owing to global population growth and increasing consumption, it's estimated that will grow to 29 million tonnes per year by 2040. Some of the impacts of plastic pollution are well known: seabird starvation, entanglement of wildlife, and bioaccumulation of plastics in marine animals. But other issues are still coming to light. The persistence of plastic — much longer than biodegradable materials like wood — means that coastal species are able to raft long distances across the ocean. After the Japan tsunami in 2011, at least 289 species from Japan washed up on plastic rafts on the US coast, with some arriving after as long as six years at sea. New research published in Nature this month shows permanent coastal invertebrate communities are developing on plastic ""rafts"" in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre — aka the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — the world's largest floating plastic gyre. What they found was that rather than a stream of animals being washed out to sea on plastic, species are now reproducing in the Pacific gyre (a swirling, anticlockwise basin-wide current) and turning over generations without necessarily getting further input from the coast. The Great Pacific Garbage patch is just one of five massive garbage gyres, including one in the Indian Ocean. Scientists say this capacity for coastal species to last so long at sea increases the likelihood of invasive species colonising new regions. On a global scale, India is not the worst offender when it comes to ocean pollution. In fact, research published in Science in 2015, which calculated the mass of mismanaged waste for people within 50 kilometres of the coast, ranked India twelfth. China topped the list, with Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka rounding out the top five. But even that list can be misleading, according to plastic pollution researcher Denise Hardesty from the CSIRO. Many developed countries including Australia send large quantities of their recovered waste overseas, mostly to developing countries, many in Asia. ""To blame it on those countries isn't really giving the full picture,"" Dr Hardesty says. ""When you look at per capita waste and consumption, the US is out in front; it's the developed countries that create the most waste because we can afford to."" Tushar says people in India feel that wealthier countries are simply exporting their waste problems. ""It's an illusion when you go to countries [with clean beaches] like Australia, when they send their waste to other countries,"" he says. In 2019-20, Australia exported on average 354,000 tonnes per month of waste and recovered materials, with Indonesia followed by India taking the greatest portion of that. This year, Australia banned the export of glass and mixed plastics — where different types of plastics are bundled together. Next year, the export of plastics sorted into single resin or polymer types will also be banned. By taking the waste of developed nations, developing nations have an extra volume to deal with, researcher Jutta Gutberlet says. ""Often the material doesn't come completely clean and often [the importing country has] to separate the waste from what is recyclable — they are basically importing the problem,"" Professor Gutberlet says. ""I think countries need to work out the solution [to their waste] for themselves."" Dr Hardesty says decent waste collection infrastructure in Australia means comparatively little of our waste ends up in our oceans. Even so, research from a few years ago found that on our beaches, there are around five to six pieces of plastic for every Australian. She also says that Australians tend to be in denial about the source of plastics that wash up on our beaches, often blaming other countries. ""Most of our debris is local in origins and we see plumes of floating trash that expand out from our urban centres."" In the immediate future, improving waste management infrastructure in India can help reduce the amount of plastics entering the ocean, according to Ravinder Kumar, an associate professor of monitoring and impact at the University of Greenwich. From an infrastructure perspective, he says the issue is getting worse because of three reasons: He also says importing waste needs to be investigated, but that there are more fundamental changes that need to happen, including stronger regulation around single-use plastics and extended responsibility of producers for their products at end of life. But the responsibility to enact meaningful long-term solutions don't rest solely on the countries where the plastic crisis is most visible. Many experts agree firstly that developed countries like Australia need to manage their own waste and recycling onshore. And globally, we need to be entirely getting rid of single-use plastics as soon as possible. Putting a recoverable price on plastic will help stop pollution, Dr Hardesty says. ""When we treat plastic as a commodity that has value, when we put a price on it, it will stop being lost to the environment."" Professor Gutberlet says our way of thinking about products needs to change, and that single-use needs to be phased out. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. ""The most important thing [is] to stop producing new plastic waste that is not recyclable or is not captured,"" she says. ""That is the one root cause that can be settled with behaviours and policies."" For Appu, Ishita and Tushar, surfing is their tool for changing minds. ""Every person needs to stop using plastic, that's the only thing we can do,"" Appu says. ""I tell my surfer kids, we can stop using plastic, then you can tell others to stop too."" Similarly, Ishita says the next generation is the key. ""I don't like dogma, people being told what to do, but in surfing … only when you have a connection with the ocean, can you want to take care of it."" Tushar says change needs to come from the top. ""You can do beach clean-ups but it's futile — you clean a beach and there's the same amount of trash there the next day. ""That's been our dream — teach enough people from [Mumbai] to surf and get more people campaigning for [waste] treatment plants. ""It's about getting people to surf who are powerful — those people are the ones that make all the changes."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

257,Aboriginal land council approves 'divisive' plan to bury tyres,environment,"  Aboriginal land council approves mining giant's plan to bury hundreds of tyres a year A northern NSW local Aboriginal land council has said it had little choice but to approve a plan to bury hundreds of tyres a year at Maules Creek coal mine. Whitehaven Coal (WHC) applied to get rid of 400 heavy-duty tyres per year onsite, arguing  there are no ""feasible or viable"" recycling options available. In a letter to the company last month, the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) said the plan affects land owned by a local Aboriginal land council, and WHC needed consent from the group. The Red Chief Local Aboriginal Land Council (LALC) manages a travelling stock route that cuts through the site. In a statement, Red Chief's chief executive, Lisa Burges, said the council did not have much room to affect the application. ""Red Chief are not in a position to veto or prevent the modification, and accordingly it was passed by the board after much debate,"" she said. ""The practice of burying tyres is not something Red Chief members and board fully support and is certainly an emotive and divisive issue."" Ms Burges said the LALC was told burying tyres was the only option available to the mine. ""NSWALC contacted the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) seeking advice on environmental concerns about the burying of tyres and were advised that currently it is an acceptable practice by the EPA and DPIE, until a viable alternative can be sought."" In a document responding to the company's proposal, the EPA acknowledged there were ""barriers"" to recycling end-of-life tyres. It recommended a suite of licence conditions like those applied to WHC's Tarrawonga and Werris Creek mines, where the practice had already been approved. WHC's licence allows it to bury 150 heavy plant tyres a year at its Werris Creek mine, and 441 tonnes of tyres at its Tarrawonga mine – equivalent in weight to about 300 mid-size cars per year. The EPA mandates that WHC needs to provide a report every two years which proves it tried to find recycling options in NSW, and a cost-benefit analysis of recycling tyres, as opposed to burying them onsite. The application is still under review by the DPIE. Whitehaven Coal chose not to provide comment for this story.

258,Disposable masks lying on the ground? It's a worldwide problem and Australia's far from the worst offender,environment," Science As countries open up after pandemic lockdowns, the world is relying on the use of billions of face masks a month to help stop the spread of coronavirus. But experience in the UK has shown that mask mandates can lead to an explosion of a new form of plastic litter that can last generations. And Australia is on notice to avoid a looming environmental disaster. Disposable face masks can take hundreds of years to break down and threaten to entangle wildlife, litter our beaches, block sewers, and pollute the food chain. In the face of alarming pollution anecdotes, researchers have provided hard evidence of the massive global growth of this new form of litter. The University of Portsmouth's Keiron Roberts and colleagues compared the growth of mask litter in 11 different countries and found a big increase occurred between March to October last year. ""There was this massive jump, almost 9,000 per cent jump,"" Dr Roberts said. The study, published today in Nature Sustainability, was carried out while the researchers were still required to work from home, so they had to think laterally about how they were going to collect the data. ""We wondered how we could do a study that's global without actually leaving our bedroom?"" Dr Roberts said. This is when they turned to data amassed by citizens who record what litter they collect on an app called Litterati. Each item of litter is photographed, tagged and linked to a time and place. The researchers used 2 million of these litter records to calculate the relative change in amounts of litter from masks over time. Data was also collected on gloves and wipes. ""We weren't looking at the volume of what was being picked up, but how it's changed,"" Dr Roberts said. The researchers then looked at changes in COVID-19 policies in the different countries studied. This is when they discovered mask pollution increased most dramatically following mask mandates, which were encouraged by the World Health Organization to stop the airborne spread of coronavirus. ""This might be stating the obvious, but it's the first time we've been able to evidence it,"" Dr Roberts said. He said the team was surprised to find the worst increase was in the UK. Between September 2019 to September 2020, the number of bits of litter tagged ""mask"" went from non-existent to over 6 per cent. Australia did not have the larger increases seen in some other countries, including the UK. ""Within the first three months of mask mandates in Australia, mask littering remained below 0.2 per cent of all collected litter,"" Dr Roberts said. One reason for this, he said, could be that as mask wearing became more widespread around the globe, Australia was having very strict lockdowns. ""When you guys go into lockdown, you really go into lockdown,"" Dr Roberts said. This meant people were not out and about, wearing masks and discarding them as litter. But Dr Roberts has a warning for Australia as it opens up and masks become more important in controlling the spread of COVID-19. ""We will see a build-up of litter in the environment if public behaviour doesn't change,"" Dr Roberts said. To avoid replicating the UK experience, he recommended using reusable masks, or at least binning disposable masks properly. Governments that mandate masks, he added, need to help through education and providing more bins for masks. ""Legislating for masks causes mask littering, so if you ask someone to do something, you need to make sure there are mechanisms in place to support them to do the right thing,"" Dr Roberts said. ""This gives Australia the opportunity to act now and help prevent this wave of mask litter sweeping other nations."" While disposable face masks might seem to be innocent tissue-like objects, the truth is they're a new form of plastic pollution that environmental scientists are increasingly worried about. Not only is face mask litter potentially contaminated with coronavirus, but masks are made of long-lasting plastic materials that don't break down. They can smother plants, entangle or choke animals and potentially cause blockages in the sewerage system. A recent study showed disposable masks can contain dangerous chemical pollutants and tiny plastic fibres and particles that can accumulate in the food chain. ""We're only just starting to understand the impacts of what microplastics do in the environment. So this going to be a very long legacy,"" Dr Roberts said. According to Tom Rainey, a chemical engineer at QUT's Centre for a Waste-Free World, most disposable face masks filters are made of meltblown polypropylene — a type of non-woven plastic fabric that does not biodegrade. ""We need to move away from polypropylene,"" he said. Dr Rainey is currently working on developing masks that incorporate more biodegradable materials such as cellulose. Pip Kiernan from Clean Up Australia is already well aware of the problem of mask pollution. ""We know anecdotally from our volunteers there's a significant amount ending up in the environment,"" she said, adding that pollution of waterways was of huge concern. ""Whatever is dropped on land is likely to end up in a waterway eventually."" She said the new study showed it was clear we needed to be on guard against mask pollution. ""It's an opportunity to think about our habits again."" RSPCA Australia's scientific officer Di Evans urged people to cut the ear loops off masks when disposing of them to reduce the chance of animals becoming entangled in them. ""Wearing a mask has become necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic, but unfortunately discarded masks can have a terrible impact on animals,"" Dr Evans said.

259,"Bogong moth, grey-headed flying fox listed as endangered",environment,"  Bogong moth, grey-headed flying fox listed as endangered by IUCN Once found in overwhelming numbers, bogong moths used to flood Parliament House in Canberra and even troubled athletes at the Sydney Olympics on their annual migration to the Australian alps. But the bogong moth has now been declared endangered by the world's leading scientific assessment of species vulnerability. It is one of 124 Australian species added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) ""Red List of Threatened Species"". Of those, 54 have been categorised as either critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable, which includes the bogong moth, the grey-headed flying-fox, greenlip abalone, arcadia velvet gecko and several insect species from Kangaroo Island. A ""dramatic crash"" in the bogong moth population in 2017 led to a 98 to 99 per cent decline in their numbers, according to Australian National University scholar Jesse Wallace. He is studying how bogong moths navigate from their breeding grounds, which are predominantly in the western parts of Queensland and New South Wales, to granite caves in the southern alps. ""The main factor [in their decline] is probably the drought in New South Wales, which geographically speaking overlaps very closely with their breeding grounds,"" he said. He estimates the population is growing again, ""maybe a 5 per cent recovery per year or so,"" but is concerned about the bogong moth's future prospects. ""We're waiting with bated breath to see what happens this year,"" he said. ""It is no longer really drought, [but] there are flood in some of their breeding grounds, which probably isn't good news for them either. ""We haven't actually seen them arriving in large numbers into the mountains this year yet. ""It has been a delayed migration, which is probably also due to the weather."" The absence of bogong moths in the high country has a cascade effect, as it is an important food source for other alpine species, including the critically endangered mountain pygmy possum. The federal and state governments keep their own lists of vulnerable species, but the IUCN's ""Red List"" is developed independently through international scientific collaboration. So while the bogong moth is regarded as endangered by the IUCN, it is not listed as a threatened species at all under the Commonwealth's scheme. ""The addition of so many species to the international Red List should be a real wake-up for the federal government,"" Jess Abrahams from the Australian Conservation Foundation said. ""Most urgently, we need serious action on climate change because so many of the additions of new animals to this list are because of the impact of climate change."" He points to the addition of many insect species from bushfire-affected Kangaroo Island and the heat-sensitive grey-headed flying-fox to the Red List as examples of the impact of climate change on Australia's biodiversity. ""Whether it's drought, or bushfire, or the loss of alpine environments, climate change is having a big toll,"" Mr Abrahams said. The ACF is also calling for more investment in recovery efforts for threatened species and strengthening of environmental and biodiversity protection laws. ""We're in the midst of an extinction crisis. We're losing species at a faster rate today than we ever have before globally,"" Mr Abrahams said. Internationally, the IUCN Red List now has more than 40,000 species classified as threatened. It has reduced the number of extinct Australian species from 45 to 44, deciding there is not enough data to officially declare the smooth handfish extinct.

260,Indonesia's president vows to rebuild after volcano eruption kills 34,environment,"  Indonesian President Joko Widodo vows to rebuild after Mount Semeru volcano eruption kills 34 Indonesian President Joko Widodo has promised to bolster evacuation efforts and repair damaged homes after visiting the site of a volcanic eruption that killed at least 34 people. Java's 3,676-metre Mount Semeru volcano first erupted on Saturday and erupted another three times on Tuesday. Experts at Indonesia's Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation said on Monday there was potential for further flows of hot gas, ash and rocks. Thousands of people have been displaced and 17 remain missing, according to the disaster mitigation agency. Nearly 3,000 houses and 38 schools were damaged. Search and rescue efforts continued on Tuesday after previously being suspended but were hampered by wind and rain, and limited equipment in some areas. After visiting evacuation centres and taking a helicopter to see villages submerged in molten ash, Mr Widodo said recovery efforts would be bolstered now and in the months ahead. ""I came to the site to ensure that we have the forces to locate the victims,"" he said, speaking from Sumberwuluh, one of the worst-hit areas. ""We hope that after everything has subsided, that everything can start — fixing infrastructure or even relocating those from the places we predict are too dangerous to return to."" At least 2,000 homes would need to be relocated to safer areas, he said. The number of dead and missing is expected to rise as much of the search area is mountainous and ""geographically difficult"", said Andris Rufianto Putro, a field coordinator for Semeru emergency response at Indonesian Red Cross. Mount Semeru is one of more than 100 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an area of high seismic activity atop multiple tectonic plates known as the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"".

261,"Indonesia's Mount Semeru erupts again, causing rescuers to pause the search for survivors",environment,"  Indonesia volcano Mount Semeru erupts again, rescue operations suspended Indonesia's Mount Semeru spewed more ash on Monday, forcing rescuers to suspend the search for survivors as aerial images showed the extent of the devastation unleashed by the volcano's deadly weekend eruption. The biggest mountain on the island of Java thundered to life Saturday, ejecting a mushroom of volcanic ash high into the sky and raining hot mud as thousands of panicked people fled their homes. At least 22 were killed. Aerial photos showed entire streets filled with grey volcanic ash and mud, which had swallowed many homes and vehicles, including whole trucks. Rescue operations were suspended because of fresh volcanic activity on Monday. ""All evacuation teams have been pulled out… temporarily because there was a small fresh eruption and it could endanger the evacuation teams,"" said rescue worker Rizal Purnama. ""The search will continue today once the situation is a bit safer."" Indonesia's national disaster agency said 27 people were still missing. Dangerous thick plumes of smoke continued to emerge from areas blanketed by the volcanic ash, while rescuers in hard hats tried to dig through the mud to find survivors — and recover bodies. Their task was made more difficult as the volcanic debris started to harden. ""It's very difficult… with simple tools,"" Rizal Purnama said. ""It is very likely bodies that have not been found are buried under the hot mudflow."" Other rescuers helped desperate villagers salvage their belongings from wrecked homes. Some locals lifted mattresses and furniture on their shoulders while others carried goats in their arms. Officials have advised locals not to travel within 5 kilometres of Semeru's crater, as the nearby air is highly polluted and could affect vulnerable groups. Ash from Semeru travelled up to 4km away after Saturday's eruption, Indonesia's geological agency reported. A sand mine company's office in Kampung Renteng village was buried, trapping 15 people, according to foreman Hasim, 65, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. Some people believe volcanic eruptions are caused by fate. Others believe a volcanic eruption is a sign that a mountain is upset because residents living nearby have sinned. But science has another explanation. ""There's no news from them. Only one operator was rescued; he's now at the hospital with burns,"" he told the AFP news wire. Hasim said he ran home after the eruption. ""It was pitch dark,"" he added. ""It was only 3pm but it looked like night."" Rescue officials said some people were buried inside their vehicles, with no time to escape. Those who managed to find shelter recounted the horror after the eruption. Suwarti Ningsi and her daughter were trapped for five hours at home after the eruption. ""I couldn't see anything, it was just like at night. Everybody was panicking,"" the 42-year-old said. ""I could only pray … for me and my daughter to be saved."" The ash and mud also polluted the waterways around Mt Semeru, turning them into streams of dark grey sludge. Rain is forecast for the area, which could further hinder rescue work. There is also a risk of the rain causing ash sediment to form a new river of hot lava, the country's top volcanologist Surono told a local TV station. Mt Semeru's last major eruption was in December 2020, which also wrecked villages and forced thousands to flee. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the meeting of continental plates causes high volcanic and seismic activity, and the country has nearly 130 active volcanoes. In late 2018, an eruption in the strait between Java and Sumatra islands caused an underwater landslide and tsunami that killed more than 400 people.

262,"'Turbid, silted-up': As people flock to Victoria's Surf Coast, a construction boom is killing off green spaces",environment,"  Torquay locals pressure council to step up, hold developers accountable for environmental harm From the street in a new residential estate in Torquay on Victoria's Surf Coast, a wetland should be a welcome sight of wilderness among the maze of shiny, new, modern homes. Its greenery helps bring the grey and neutral tones of the houses in The Dunes Estate to life, but upon closer inspection, the wetland isn't the tranquil, beautiful feature it may first appear. Instead, it's a pit of muddied, stagnant water harbouring rapidly-growing weeds and litter. Pieces of polystyrene float near a path, which looks purpose-built, but is actually a shelf made of layers and layers of silt, so thick you can easily walk on it. Local resident Jan Selvay has watched on in horror as the wetland has turned to mud over the years. ""So you've got a turbid, silted-up asset that doesn't work,"" she said. ""This is basically an example of a dead wetland."" Over the last decade, the Surf Coast has rapidly grown in popularity, prompting the development of large-scale housing estates across the Torquay area. Being stuck at home during the pandemic has only added to the allure of a relaxed lifestyle by the beach for many, especially Melburnians who can work remotely. As the houses pop up almost overnight, the estates are all required to have man-made wetlands to help mitigate the environmental impacts of developing housing on such a massive scale. ""They're really created to help filter a lot of the stormwater that's coming through from housing and urban developments before it runs into our beautiful bays,"" Deakin University research fellow Paul Carnell said. ""There can be pollutants and things in there and it's a matter of filtering that water through before it gets out into our coastal areas."" That's precisely what a report has found the Dunes wetland isn't doing. The water technology report was commissioned and paid for by a residential group worried about what was happening to the local waterways. It found the Dunes wetland was too small, not maintained, filled with rubbish and invasive plant species, and was not filtering out all the dirt and sediment running off nearby construction sites. ""Without changes to specifically address the functionality of the existing constructed wetlands and the impacts of urbanisation within the catchment, the degradation of the Karaaf wetlands and downstream receiving waters will continue,"" the report said. The nearby Karaaf Wetlands plays host to a number of migratory bird species and the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. It also drains into the Breamlea Flora and Fauna Reserve. Both Breamlea and Karaaf are being considered as Ramsar sites, which would protect them under the international environment convention. Ms Selvay said the report showed the wetland needed a complete overhaul. ""The recommendations purely and simply were this whole thing needs to be dug out, cleaned out, starting from the gross pollution traps ... getting all the silt out and actually digging out the rubbish, taking out nearly all the vegetation and replanting it with correct species,"" Ms Selvay said. Dr Carnell said a wetland in such a built-up area wasn't something you could ""set and forget"". ""If you do get build-up of those heavy metals, that can impact things like frogs and fish that we get in our wetlands and we want to support that biodiversity,"" he said. According to the Surf Coast Shire's development processes, the council signs off on the wetland design when they approve the development application for a new estate. The wetland is then the developer's responsibility to create and maintain while construction is underway. Once it's done, the developers — in the case of Dunes, a Melbourne-based company called Land Development Consulting — hand it over and it becomes the council's job to manage. Ms Selvay said construction is almost finished and the company has neglected the wetlands, but the council hasn't done enough either. ""You would have to say that historically council hasn't paid proper attention to the protection of these assets or to using the correct parameters for them to be designed,"" she said. Surf Coast Shire chief executive Robyn Seymour confirmed it was up to the council to ensure the developers were complying with their environmental obligations but said it had not taken any action against the company. ""Obviously there's a lot of development happening, it's been a wet winter and it is ongoing work we need to do … it is a work in progress,"" she said. ""We'll also continue to work with the developer around the functioning of those wetlands to make sure they are maintained and managed effectively."" The council can issue fines of up to $400 to developers for not complying. When contacted, Land Development Consulting refused to comment. Ms Selvay said she was happy to see the issue finally gain some traction. ""We've been trying for over a decade to get somewhere with council to in fact get someone to acknowledge the problem we are dealing with and to start to get some action,"" she said. ""The water technology report, as this stage, appears to be working.""

263,"Four hours from Hobart, this 'black box' will chronicle humankind's downfall",environment," Science Earth is getting a black box to record our climate change actions, and it's already started listening On a granite-strewn plain, surrounded by gnarled mountains, sits a giant steel box. Incongruous in the landscape, much like Kubrick's black monolith of 2001: A Space Odyssey fame, its alien presence suggests it was put there with intent. And if those that discover it can decipher the messages it contains, they could get a glimpse of what caused the fall of the civilisation that was there before. This is Earth's Black Box. When an aeroplane crashes, it's left to investigators to sift through the wreckage to recover the black box. It's hoped the recorded contents can be used to help others avoid the same fate. And so it is with Earth's Black Box: a 10-metre-by-4-metre-by-3-metre steel monolith that's intended to be built on a remote outcrop on Tasmania's west coast. Chosen for its geopolitical and geological stability, ahead of other candidates like Malta, Norway and Qatar, the idea is that the Tasmanian site can cradle the black box for the benefit of a future civilisation, should catastrophic climate change cause the downfall of ours. If that sounds unhinged, it's worth remembering that we're currently on track for as much as 2.7C of warming this century. Ask any climate scientist what happens when warming breaches 2C, and they'll almost invariably tell you it's not worth thinking about. Plenty of past civilisations and empires have collapsed in the face of less. So what is this black box? Artistic installation? Academic experiment? Or something else? The project is completely non-commercial, and the guiding design principle is functionality, according to Jim Curtis from Clemenger BBDO. ""Obviously it's really a powerful concept when you say to someone, 'Earth's got a black box'. Because they're like, 'Why does it need a black box?'"" said Mr Curtis, who's collaborating on the project with University of Tasmania researchers, among others. ""But first and foremost, it's a tool."" The box is planned to be made from 7.5-centimetre-thick steel, cantilevered off granite, according to Jonathan Kneebone, co-founder of artistic collective the Glue Society, which is also involved. ""It's built to outlive us all,"" he said. ""If the worst does happen, just because the power grids go down, this thing will still be there."" The box will be filled with a mass of storage drives and have internet connectivity, all powered by solar panels on the structure's roof. Batteries will provide backup power storage. When the sun is shining, the black box will be downloading scientific data and an algorithm will be gleaning climate-change-related material from the internet. Broadly, it will be collecting two types of data: ""The idea is if the Earth does crash as a result of climate change, this indestructible recording device will be there for whoever's left to learn from that,"" Mr Curtis says. ""It's also there to hold leaders to account — to make sure their action or inaction is recorded."" The black box will record backwards, as well as forwards in time, to document how we got to where we are — pulling any available historical climate change data off the internet. Could Australia become a renewable superpower by 2030? You decide. And although construction of the housing structure itself is anticipated to begin mid next year, the hard drives have already begun recording, beginning with the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November this year. Using compression and archiving, the developers estimate there will be enough capacity to store data for the next 30 to 50 years. In the meantime, they're investigating ways to expand that capacity, and more long-term storage methods including inscribing to ""steel plates"". ""This will enable us to be far more efficient with how each tier of storage is used and make it possible to store data for hundreds, if not thousands of years,"" they said. So let's say we go the full Mad Max; climate change causes crops to fail year on year; ocean food-webs collapse; it becomes impossible to feed eight, nine, 10(?) billion people; hundreds of millions are displaced by rising seas; economies shrink and society as we know it goes over the falls. Those who have discovered the black box — now the colour of rust, its solar panels long since dead — have got no frame of reference for what they find inside or how to decipher it. So now what? ""That is a [question] that we are still working on ourselves,"" the developers say. ""It is impossible to anticipate who or what will find [it]. ""But it can be assumed that it will not be of any use unless it is discovered by someone or something ... with the capability of understanding and interpreting basic symbolism."" Gaining access to the box's interior through its three-inch-thick steel casing will already require some ingenuity. The developers presume whoever is capable of that will also be able to interpret basic symbols. ""Like the Rosetta Stone, we would look to use multiple formats of encoding,"" they said. ""We are exploring the possibility of including an electronic reader that stays within the box and will be activated upon exposure to sunlight, also reactivating the box if it has entered a long-term dormant state as a result of catastrophe."" Once the black box is up and running, the growing data bank will be accessible via a digital platform, and the plan is that people will also be able to connect wirelessly with it, if they're to visit the site. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. ""There are other features we are playing with such as transmitting summary stats in longer intervals into space, and having [a] ""heartbeat"" that communicates that the box is on and actively recording to on-site visitors,"" the developers said. The project still needs to pass official planning approval and community consultation but David Midson, general manager of West Coast Council, which oversees the region where the project is slated to be built, says he's a ""big supporter"" of seeing it happen. Mr Midson says regional places like the west coast of Tasmania often don't get the credit they deserve for their role in tackling climate change, and he hopes this project might help change some perspectives. ""I think it will really build on the cultural and artistic aspects of the west coast,"" he said. The location, between Strahan and Queenstown, is remote enough to offer some insulation from sabotage, but accessible enough for those who want to see it, according to the developers. ""It takes a good four hours from Hobart, [but] it is something you'd be able to stop your car and go look at,"" Mr Kneebone said. And while it's intended as a blueprint for a post-apocalyptic society of what not to do, it's also hoped that a complete recording of political and business leaders' actions on climate change might have an impact right now. ""When people know they're being recorded, it does have an influence on what they do and say,"" Mr Kneebone said. ""That's our role if anything, to be something in the back of everyone's mind."" It's tempting to write this project off as an indulgence in climate alarmism. But while most people don't get onto an aeroplane thinking it's going to crash, that's not a reason to forgo a black box.

264,Homes buried under thick volcanic ash as Indonesian rescuers search for survivors of volcanic eruption,environment,"  Mount Semeru death toll rises to 14 as rescuers sift through thick ash to find survivors Rescuers were sifting through smouldering debris and thick mud in search of survivors a day after the highest volcano on Java island erupted with fury, killing at least 14 people with searing gas and ash. Mount Semeru in Lumajang district in East Java province spewed thick columns of ash more than 12,000 metres into the sky in a sudden eruption that was partially triggered by heavy rains on Saturday. Villages and nearby towns were blanketed with ash and several hamlets were buried under tonnes of mud from volcanic debris. Flows of hot gas and lava travelled up to 11 kilometres to a nearby river at least twice on Saturday and three times on Sunday at the smaller distance of up to 2 kilometres, according to Indonesia's Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Agency. Authorities warned the thousands of people who fled the volcano's wrath not to return during Sunday's lull in activity but some were desperate to check on livestock and possessions left behind. In several areas, everything — from the thinnest tree branch to couches and chairs inside homes — was caked with ash. ""There's no life there … trees, farms, houses are scorched, everything is covered in heavy grey ash,"" said Haryadi Purnomo of East Java's search and rescue agency. He said that several other areas were virtually untouched. Search and rescue efforts were temporarily suspended on Sunday afternoon because of fears that hot ash and debris could tumble down from the crater due to heavy rains. On Saturday, a torrent of mud destroyed the main bridge connecting Lumajang and the neighbouring district of Malang, as well as a smaller bridge, said Thoriqul Haq, the district chief in Lumajang. The eruption eased pressure that had been building under a lava dome perched on the crater. But experts warned that the dome could still further collapse, causing an avalanche of the blistering gas and debris trapped beneath it. A thunderstorm and days of rain, which eroded and partly collapsed the dome atop the 3,676-metre Semeru, triggered the eruption, said Eko Budi Lelono, who heads the geological survey centre. Semeru, the stratovolcano in shape of a cone, is also known as Mahameru, meaning ""The Great Mountain"" in Sanskrit. It has erupted many times over the last 200 years, and is one of 129 under watch in Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago — where more than 62,000 people call Sumeru's fertile slopes home. Some people believe volcanic eruptions are caused by fate. Others believe a volcanic eruption is a sign that a mountain is upset because residents living nearby have sinned. But science has another explanation. It last erupted in January, with no casualties. Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 270 million people, is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity because it sits along the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" a horseshoe-shaped series of fault lines. Currently 54 per cent of the country's population live on Java, the country's most densely populated area. Officials said earlier they had hoped they could avoid casualties by closely monitoring the volcano. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said 56 people had been hospitalised, mostly with burns. He said rescuers were still searching for nine residents of Curah Kobokan village. More than 900 villagers streamed into makeshift emergency shelters after Saturday's powerful eruption, but many others defied official warnings and chose to remain in their homes, saying they had to tend to their livestock and protect their property, said Mr Purnomo. ""We'll do everything we can to evacuate them by preparing trucks and motorbikes for them to flee at any time,"" he said. Indonesian President Joko Widodo said he instructed his Cabinet ministers and disaster and military officials to coordinate the response.

266,13 killed and dozens burned as volcanic eruption leaves Indonesian villages in darkness,environment,"  Indonesia's Mount Semeru volcano erupts, killing at least 13 people The death toll from Indonesia's Semeru volcanic eruption on Java island has risen to 13, a spokesperson for the country's disaster mitigation agency says, as 10 trapped people were evacuated to safety. Semeru, the tallest mountain on Java island, threw up towers of ash and hot clouds on Saturday that blanketed nearby villages in East Java province and sent people fleeing in panic. The eruption severed a strategic bridge connecting two areas in the nearby district of Lumajang with the city of Malang, and wrecked buildings, authorities said. Disaster mitigation agency BNPB official Abdul Muhari said in a media release that two of the 13 people killed have been identified. Ninety-eight have been injured, including two pregnant women, and 902 have been evacuated, the statement said. Videos posted on social media show terrified people running from approaching clouds of ash from Mount Semeru, the highest volcano on Indonesia's most densely populated island of Java. Other footage shows that, in places, the sun was completely blocked out, plunging communities into darkness. Tents have been set up for thousands of people who've abandoned their homes, many of which have been destroyed or covered in ash. Thoriqul Haq, a local official in Lumajang, said earlier sand miners had been trapped around their work sites. BNPB said at least 35 people had been hospitalised, while Lumajang's deputy head said 41 people suffered burns. Semeru, more than 3,600 metres high, is one of Indonesia's nearly 130 active volcanoes. It erupted in January, causing no casualties. Indonesia straddles the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"", a highly seismically active zone, where different plates on the earth's crust meet and create a large number of earthquakes and volcanoes. Separately, an earthquake of magnitude 6 struck north of Halmahera on Sunday, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said. Halmahera is about 2,000 kilometres north-east of Semeru. A thunderstorm and days of rain — which had eroded and finally collapsed the lava dome atop the Semeru — triggered an eruption, said Eko Budi Lelono, who heads the geological survey centre. He said flows of searing gas and lava travelled up to 800m to a nearby river at least twice on Saturday. People were advised to stay 5km from the crater's mouth, the agency said. ""Thick columns of ash have turned several villages to darkness,"" Lumajang district head Thoriqul Haq said. Several hundred people were moved to temporary shelters or left for other safe areas, he said, adding that power blackouts hampered the evacuation.

267,'A remarkable story': Resilient coral a sign of hope as living reefs suffer heat stress,environment,"  Promising signs of new life on Australia's largest oceanic reef, despite frequent heat stress A research trip to Australia's largest oceanic reef system has shown promising signs of new life, following the 2016 mass bleaching event, which impacted coral reefs all over the globe. But unlike mass bleaching events of the past, scientists are concerned Scott Reef is facing a barrier to its recovery. Coral ecology research scientist James Gilmour, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said repeated, smaller marine heatwaves since the 2016 event were compounding bleaching impacts. ""Unfortunately since 2016 we've seen additional heat stress in 2017, 2019  and 2020,"" he said. ""We're getting this recurrent heating and stress to the reefs which obviously are going to impede its recovery. ""We see this overlying resilience, but the effects of ongoing heat stress impeding that."" ""Because of its isolation, it doesn't have these additional pressures, such as fishing pressure or the pollution pressure that you see on other reefs that can confound our inferences about what is happening from climate change and coral bleaching,"" he said. The observations at Scott Reef reflect a dire pattern emerging not only in Australia but around the world. A major global analysis of coral reefs, released in October, found about 14 per cent of the world's coral, the equivalent of more than all living coral in Australia, had been lost in less than a decade. It found the main cause of the decline was ""recurring large scale coral bleaching events"" that were ""preventing coral from recovering"". But the analysis also found there was hope, with some corals showing strong, and at times surprising resistance to ongoing heat stress. University of Western Australia and AIMS research associate Luke Thomas said this was observed on Scott Reef too. ""Considering this reef has gone through three serious bleaching events in the last 20 years, it's just been hammered and hammered over and over... the fact that there's any coral left is a remarkable story and a testament of the system,"" he said. Dr Thomas said researchers were trying to utilise this surprising resilience. ""One way is if we know this pocket of reef houses heat resistance corals, let's protect them, let's avoid anchor damage or overfishing,"" he said. He said a second way was to breed tolerant coral populations for restoration. ""So if we want to restore a degraded section of reef, we don't want to just replace those corals with ones that will bleach and die the next heatwave,"" he said. ""We want to replace them with much more fit, tougher individuals. ""So we can target this pocket of heat resistance corals as a broodstock, or a supply for those reefs."" The science and restoration work on Scott Reef is similar to that happening on the Great Barrier Reef, with the government kicking in half a billion dollars in 2018 to help deal with the problems facing the Great Barrier Reef. The management and restoration work of corals is crucial to saving reef systems in the future, researchers say, but it comes second to the need to cut down carbon emissions. James Cook University marine biologist Jodie Rummer said Australia left ""a lot to be answered for"" after the COP26 conference in Glasgow. ""There was a clear message over the past five years of what increased emissions and climate change have been doing to Australia, let alone the entire world, and we weren't able to stand up to do anything about it."" Dr Rummer said the federal government priorities were wrong. ""Clean economic recovery is win win for Australia,"" she said. ""This is what needs to be the priority for Australia but for some reason Australia is still prioritising coal, gas and oil exploration. ""This goes in complete conflict with Australia's national priority of protecting people, our ecosystems and natural spaces.""

268,"They're barely visible, but these tiny IVF coral 'babies' are breathing new life onto desolate reefs",environment,"  Hope for damaged parts of Great Barrier Reef as tourism sector helps deploy millions of coral 'babies' Plumes of tiny white particles fall like underwater snow over the remnants of this reef. It is the first sign of new coral life here in years. Once a vibrant expanse of underwater colour, this site on the Great Barrier Reef was obliterated during a severe tropical cyclone nearly five years ago. Now, a team of researchers and tour guides is floating on the surface above the reef. Armed with a few boats, special pontoon structures and some patience, they're confident it can be revived. The process began a week ago, during a spectacular spawning event that saw trillions of coral egg and sperm bundles released into the water. The annual phenomenon was recorded off the coast of centres including Cairns and Airlie Beach. Whitsunday tourism operators and scientists from groups including the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and Southern Cross University were there for the occasion. ""What we're trying to do is collect the eggs from parts of the Whitsundays that have significant coral spawning events and then bring the eggs to parts … where there's not much coral,"" said marine biologist with Reef Catchments, Johnny Gaskell. Dr Mark Gibbs, principal engineer at AIMS, said the spawn was transferred into floating nursery pools stationed kilometres away to develop into larvae. ""We're stopping them from being washed to sea and depositing them right on the reef,"" Dr Gibbs said. After about six days the larvae is funnelled onto reef systems damaged by bleaching or cyclones, such as the reef off Black Island in the Whitsundays. This is known as coral IVF, a process pioneered by Queensland professor Peter Harrison. ""A few people around the world are trying this now, but a lot of the development has come from Australia,"" Dr Gibbs said. ""They've all, to my knowledge, been done by researchers. ""This is the only program I know about where we're effectively taking it out of the lab and using the tourism industry to do it."" The program, funded by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation's Reef Islands Initiative, has been trialled at a few sites off the Queensland coast since 2016, and has been scaled up with the help of locals. As well as sites off Black Island, the larvae is also deploying off of Lizard Island north of Cairns. It's hoped the local tourism sector will play a key role in this type of reef restoration in coming years – providing businesses alternative income streams and upskilling staff in reef regeneration. ""One of the problems with this method is coral spawns once or twice a year, when it happens we need people and vessels to do it,"" Dr Gibbs said. ""There's an existing pool of people and vessels in the tourism industry. ""This project is about developing the equipment and testing the methods with participants, which are traditional owners and the tourism industry. ""The dream I have is that this happens all over the Great Barrier Reef, the pools we use are in sheds and then every year, groups of local people come out and do it without my input."" ""It's all very inexpensive, accessible equipment."" Michela Veltri works as a deckhand at an adventure tourism company. She, like many other local staff, jumped at the chance to get involved. ""There are still some amazing places to go snorkelling and diving in the Whitsundays,"" she said. ""But if you look at some of the other areas that were exposed on the northern parts of the islands, they're not recovering very well."" Few have spent as much time underwater in the Whitsundays as marine biologist Johnny Gaskell. He has seen the impacts of bleaching and cyclone damage first hand, but said many parts of the reef were still teeming with life and hope. ""Ever since Cyclone Debbie, the Whitsundays has less coral cover than it did … but there are plenty of sites to go have a look,"" Mr Gaskell said. ""To fight the big impacts like climate change, small-scale restoration has no chance. ""But to try and increase the recovery of local tourism sites, that's where restoration really becomes an important part of the recovery process."" It can take about three to four years for decent corals to form after the larvae is released. The first microscopic larvae deployed using this technique on Heron Island in 2016 has grown to dinner-plate size. Four different tourism businesses pitched in with this latest project on the Whitsundays. While usually competitors, it was a rare chance to work together. And Dr Mark Gibbs said it was a great success. ""That gives me confidence we have got this method very close to a stage where we can hand it over,"" he said.

269,"analysis: Drought, a mouse plague and now La Niña — but is that good or bad news for farmers?",environment,"  Do La Niña rains mean boom or bust for Australian farmers? After years of punishing drought in some areas, many farmers in Australia's east are hoping the newly declared La Niña event will bring them good rains. But will it? La Niña has disappointed farmers before — and will do so again — due to variability of where and how much rain falls. This variability has led to increased mistrust in seasonal forecasts. Even though Australia has just had its wettest November in more than two decades, some farmers are still waiting. Last year's La Niña delivered good rainfall in some areas — while leaving others drier than they would have been under an El Niño, with many areas in southern Queensland missing out. In La Niña years, the cattle farming town of Roma receives an average of 247mm from November to the end of January. Last year they only got half that. This year's La Niña has already delivered rain to many areas left dry last year. Roma, for example, has received more than 200mm in November 2021 alone. These large rainfall events and seasons are required after ongoing drought to recharge the moisture in the soil. But continued rain will be less welcome in newly waterlogged areas along the Queensland and NSW border and the Northern Rivers region, given it may lead to further flooding. Seasonal forecasts give a greater than 60 per cent chance of rainfall above the median for much of eastern Australia from now to the end of March. If this summer of rain eventuates, it will be welcome news for many farmers in eastern Australia who have had below-median rainfall for three or more years. Farmers usually welcome La Niña with open arms, given plentiful rainfall can boost production and profits. Still, a boon for one industry can be a burden for another, with heavy or prolonged rainfall able to damage fruit and delicate crops as well as delaying harvests or making them more challenging. Flooding can wash away entire fields and damage roads and other infrastructure. For the sugar industry, increased rainfall associated with La Niña can mean sugarcane has to be harvested at lower sugar content levels, or be delayed in harvesting. The cane can be knocked over by heavy rain, which makes harvesting difficult and reduces yield, all of which reduce profitability. For the grains industry, the bumper grain crop predicted for 2021 has already been downgraded in areas like New South Wales due to flooding, with losses expected to be in the billions. By contrast, the beef industry in Queensland relies on grass, so a La Niña summer with above average rain can increase pasture growth and regeneration as well as cattle weight gain and market prices. This double-edged sword — too much rain or not enough — is nothing new to Australian farmers. Understanding how La Niña and other ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) events impact different regions and industries is critical to take advantage of good years, minimise losses in poor years, and make sound decisions based on the best possible information. What does that look like? In La Niña years, cattle farmers may decide to move their cattle out of flood prone regions or rest a paddock to allow it to regenerate with the extra rain, which will provide more grass in the following season. For grain farmers, La Niña means keeping a close eye on both three-month seasonal climate forecasts and the daily weather forecasts to decide if it's worth the risk to plant a big crop and if they are likely to be able to harvest it before any big rainfall events occur. La Niña events usually bring average to above average rain to much of Australia's east. Unfortunately, no two La Niñas occur in the same way. Because of this variability, it is important for farmers to understand how La Niña events impact their area so that they can plan for likely conditions. Australia's east coast climate is heavily influenced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a naturally occurring phenomenon centred in the tropical Pacific that consists of three separate phases: La Niña, El Niño, and a neutral or inactive phase. La Niña years occur around 25 per cent of the time, with El Niño years also at 25 per cent, and neutral years making up 50 per cent. ENSO is not fully predictable, and moves irregularly between these phases. While it is unusual to have back-to-back La Niñas it is not unprecedented. During these La Niña events, surface water in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific cools and the ocean to the north of Australia tends to warm. Changes in the ocean drive changes in the atmosphere over the Pacific. Like a rock thrown in a pond, however, this Pacific phenomenon ripples outwards, causing atmospheric changes in places like Australia and Chile. In Australia, La Niña tends to bring more rain and lower temperatures across much of the country, while we see increases in heavy rain, flooding, and severe tropical cyclones making landfall. What does the future hold? While most La Niña events are projected to produce less rainfall in many regions, projections suggest the wettest La Niña years will tend to be just as wet or wetter that they were in the past. Australia's farmers will continue to face the challenges of floods and droughts brought by La Niña and El Niño, but as farmers learn more about these events and how they impact their area and industry, they can become more resilient.

271,"Sir David Attenborough writes to Adelaide shopping centre, asking for removal of falsely attributed quote",environment,"  Sir David Attenborough writes to Tea Tree Plaza shopping centre, asking for removal of falsely attributed quote An Adelaide shopping centre has come under fire for falsely attributing a quote about the plight of bees to Sir David Attenborough, with the broadcaster personally writing to centre asking for the plaque to be removed. The plaque at the Westfield Tea Tree Plaza shopping centre in Adelaide's north-east caught the eye of science graduate Heath Hunter. ""Back in July some time I saw this really beautiful mural of honey bees … of all places it was actually down this little corridor leading towards the toilets,"" Mr Hunter told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""On the edge of the mural there was this tiny little plaque, maybe 10 centimetres wide, and it had these fake quotes from David Attenborough on there."" The plaque quoted Sir David as saying: ""In the last five years the bee population has dropped by a third. If bees were to disappear from the face of the Earth, humans would have just four years left to live"". Mr Hunter said he recognised the quote, which has been attributed to other iconic figures as well. ""I know that they've been attributed to [Albert] Einstein in the past,"" he said. ""I'd seen it online a lot, but I'd never seen it engraved and displayed in a public place."" Mr Hunter said he reached out to the mural's artist, who directed him to the shopping centre's management. ""I just explained to them that it's not true and would you mind removing it,"" he said. A couple of months later he returned to the centre and the plaque was still there, so he decided to go a step further. He wrote to Sir David and sent him a photo of the quote. ""He sent a little letter to me and said thanks for letting me know, and then there was a separate one attached,"" Mr Hunter said. The attached letter was to the shopping centre asking for the plaque to be taken down, which Sir David asked Mr Hunter to send on. ""The funny thing is, the letter from David Attenborough wasn't enough to make them remove it. ""I sent them that about three weeks ago, but they got a call from a journalist yesterday morning and it came down pretty quick."" A spokesperson for Westfield Tea Tree Plaza confirmed the plaque had been taken down. ""We appreciate the customer bringing this to our attention,"" the spokesperson said. ""The plaque, including the quote, has been removed."" As a lifelong Sir David fan, Mr Hunter will be hanging on to the letter he received.

272,"Report showing Tasmanian waterways deteriorating kept secret, department did not want a 'bombshell'",environment,"  Tasmanian report showing waterways deteriorating was kept secret, department did not want a 'bombshell', documents show A major report showing a deterioration in Tasmanian rivers was not publicly released after the department directed staff to make it an internal document, following acknowledgements some stakeholders might have found it ""difficult to accept"" and the department did not want a ""bombshell"". The report drew on more than 20 years of monitoring data from 85 sites on Tasmanian rivers, and showed 46 per cent of those sites had declined in recent years, with many severely or significantly impaired. The independently reviewed report linked agricultural land use and water extraction to poor river condition. Titled Temporal and Spatial Patterns in River Health across Tasmania, and the Influence of Environmental Factors, the report was never publicly released. Instead, it was obtained by the Tasmanian Greens under Right to Information (RTI) laws, with all the recommendations redacted. Now, new RTI documents obtained by the Greens show the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and the Environment (DPIPWE) had planned to publicly release the report, and staff worked on a communications strategy, until the department requested it be marked an internal document. The documents show the report was discussed at a Water Management Steering Committee meeting in October 2018. Draft minutes from the meeting show one manager noting the ""deputy secretary and secretary are aware that results need to be communicated carefully … need a conversation, not a bombshell"". In June 2019, a communications strategy for internal and external stakeholders was drafted. It notes that ""given the links between river health and various business sectors and state government initiatives (e.g. AgriVision 2050), the findings will need to be communicated sensitively, as some stakeholders will find the results challenging to accept and/or act upon"". Agrivision 2050 is the government's plan to double the growth rate of the agriculture sector by 2050. The strategy also noted recent experiences with some stakeholders who found it ""difficult to accept that declines do (and are) occurring in rivers in Tasmania, and that land use and water use may contribute to changes in river health"". The Temporal and Spatial Patterns report was due in mid-2019, and in July 2019 it was sent to the department's general manager of water and marine resources for review. Five months later, one of the authors of the report, a freshwater ecologist, queried his manager about ""where [the general manager of water and marine resources] is at with the statewide river health report"" and offered to meet with her, but a meeting was not scheduled until early 2020. Documents show the outcome of that meeting was that staff were directed to mark the report as an ""internal document"", not prepare a briefing note for the minister and not finalise the drafted communication strategy. Tasmanian Greens leader Cassy O'Connor said it was frustrating and wrong that the report had not been released. ""This is public interest science that is publicly funded through DPIPWE,"" she said. ""We had some of our finest scientists working on this report for a considerable period of time in the expectation that it would be a public document that would inform future policy around water management. ""And instead, what happened is a decision was made in the department to prevent the release of the report."" It is still unclear why the report was not released. In September this year, Water Minister Guy Barnett told the ABC that it was up to the department whether or not to release it. In September, DPIPWE did not answer the ABC's questions about why the report was not publicly released. A new statement from a DPIPWE spokeswoman on Friday said: ""The RTI released by DPIPWE clearly indicates that there were differing views at officer level within the department as to why the report was not released."" In September, the DPIPWE secretary, Tim Baker, told a parliamentary budget estimates committee that the report had not been made public because of a new government water strategy. ""I'm informed that the reason the document was not released was that it was superseded by the Rural Water Use Strategy,"" Mr Baker told the committee. Tasmania's rivers are under increasing pressure from climate change, agriculture and industry. Yet a state department has been sitting on a report exposing the problem. However, advice contained in the RTI documents from the department's manager of water assessment, who informed communications staff in April 2021, was that ""this report hasn't been superseded"". ""These Right to Information documents make it oxygen clear that, in many ways, the temporal and spatial analysis report had very little connection to the Rural Water Use Strategy,"" Ms O'Connor said. ""This temporal and spatial report is foundational science, a standalone report."" A DPIPWE spokeswoman said Mr Baker, who has been secretary since mid-2020 but was due to resign shortly for unrelated reasons, answered the question truthfully based on information provided to him at the time. She said, ""the report's recommendations were superseded by the actions outlined in the more current Rural Water Use Strategy."" Ms O'Connor expressed her view that it made no sense that the report, which was finished in February 2020, was not released because of the Rural Water Use Strategy, which was released in June 2021. She said the report brought into question the government's Agrivision 2050 plan, and she believed politics had played a part in it not being released. ""It's an insult to the scientists who worked on it, and worse than that, it's totally self-defeating to us as a state not to have honest and open conversations based on scientific evidence about the health of our rivers, and what that means for agricultural production, our economy, our capacity to access clean drinking water,"" she said. A spokesman for Mr Barnett, who is both Water and Primary Industries Minister, said he categorically did not ask anyone in DPIPWE to not release the internal report. John Gooderham, a freshwater ecologist, runs a national science project called the Waterbug Blitz helping anglers and others identify waterbugs — one of the best indicators of river health. Mr Gooderham said it was disappointing the temporal and spatial patterns report had not been released. ""It's a bit of groundbreaking science really and so it's kind of surprising that it doesn't make it into the public forum,"" he said. ""And also surprising that DPIPWE isn't absolutely beside themselves, chuffed proud that they put it together."" In his view, it was not possible for the Rural Water Use Strategy to replace the report. ""They are wildly different documents,"" he said. Mr Gooderham said Tasmania was extremely lucky with the amount of information and science available to inform river and catchment management. ""There should be pride and celebration that we've got these enormous datasets kicking around, and instead they've just been shoved in a filing cabinet,"" he said. Mr Gooderham has now formed the Tasmanian Rivers Alliance, a group for people who want to see and promote improved river management in the state. ""It's nice to have a bit of a feel for what the landscape looks like. It helps with attempts to ameliorate that sort of stuff.""

273,SA announces 'grand initiative' to create Australia's largest national park,environment,"  Australia's biggest national park declared in South Australia's far north Australia's largest national park has been formally proclaimed, edging out the previous title holder Kakadu by more than a million hectares. The Munga-Thirri—Simpson Desert National Park in far northern South Australia reaches the Queensland and Northern Territory borders. The new park is more than half the size of Tasmania, or roughly three times the size of greater Sydney. ""It is truly exciting that South Australia is now home to Australia's largest national park and ... this provides a significant boost to conservation,"" SA Environment Minister David Speirs said in a statement. The Wilderness Society described the proclamation as a ""grand initiative"". ""For over a decade the Wilderness Society has been advocating for a conservation corridor in the heart of Australia, allowing endangered animals and plants to move and adapt to a rapidly changing climate,"" the society's SA director Peter Owen said in a statement. The Munga-Thirri—Simpson Desert National Park was created by joining together an existing Regional Reserve and Conservation Park. There are special protections at Kallakoopah Creek, an environmentally significant waterway in the park that is now considered a wilderness zone. The state government also proclaimed a new national park in the southern Flinders Ranges, combining several existing conservation parks in the Wirrabara and Mount Remarkable area. The Wapma Thura — Southern Flinders Ranges National Park is co-named for the Nukunu term for ""snake people"", recognising an important totem. Two other conservation parks — Cleland in the Adelaide Hills and Deep Creek on the Fleurieu Peninsula — were also converted into national parks, as was the Lake Frome Regional Reserve. ""Ephemeral salt lake systems such as Lake Frome represent highly unique and little-known environments, and as such are considered to be of national significance,"" the government said in a statement. Meanwhile, almost 5,000 hectares of land that was formerly a conservation park has been incorporated into the Nilpena Ediacara National Park.

275,'I'm still stunned': Ancient mammoth tusk found 3km under the sea,environment,"  Discovery of 'particularly rare' 100,000-year-old mammoth tusk stuns Californian researchers An ancient mammoth tusk, thought to be over 100,000 years old, has been recovered off the central coast of California more than three kilometres under the sea. Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) has been exploring the ocean's depths for over 30 years, but in 2019 their team of scientists spotted what appeared to be an elephant's tusk. After returning to retrieve the tusk in July, researchers from the University's paleogenomics lab discovered the one-metre-long tusk belonged to a Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi). The extinct species inhabited the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch, between 2,580,000 to 11,700 years ago, and could be found in the Northern United States and further south in Costa Rica. Researchers said cold, high-pressure ocean environments ensured the tusk was well preserved and allowed the team to study it in detail through computed tomography (CT) scans. Senior scientist Steven Haddock said the scans revealed vital information about the mammoth's age. ""You start to expect the unexpected when exploring the deep sea, but I'm still stunned that we came upon the ancient tusk of a mammoth,"" he said. ""We are grateful to have a multidisciplinary team analysing this remarkable specimen, including a geochronologist, oceanographers, and paleogenomicists. ""Our work examining this exciting discovery is just beginning and we look forward to sharing more information in the future."" An analysis of a woolly mammoth's 17,000-year-old tusk offers a vivid snapshot of the places the creature visited during its lifetime Palaeontologist Daniel Fisher said it was uncommon for mammoths to be retrieved from more than ""tens of metres"" below the ocean's surface. ""This specimen's deep-sea preservation environment is different to anything we have seen elsewhere."" An analysis of radioisotopes revealed the tusk is more than 100,000 years old, making it one of the oldest and most well-preserved mammoth tusks ever retrieved in the region. ""Our age estimate on the tusk is largely based on the natural radioactive decay of certain uranium and thorium isotopes imparted to the tusk from the ocean,"" scientist Terrence Blackburn said. The discovery will help paint a picture of the species life, and the environment in which it lived, he said. ""Mammoth remains from continental North America are particularly rare, and so we expect that DNA from this tusk will go far to refine what we know about mammoths in this part of the world,"" he said.

276,"Clearing a blow to Wheatbelt tourist drawcard, according to wildflower group ",environment,"  Warnings famous wildflowers could disappear from Wheatbelt verges from over clearing Wheatbelt shires risk losing wildflowers as their main tourist attraction if they keep clearing roadside vegetation, according to an organisation aimed at protecting Western Australia's unique flora. Wildflower Society vice president Brett Loney said some shires have just three per cent of natural vegetation left because of what he called excess clearing and some of it is being done without permits. He acknowledged some of the clearing did not require a permit. ""Roadsides are really the shop windows if you like to the native flora and fauna within our state,"" Mr Loney said. ""Invariably once that vegetation is taken out you get an invasion of weeds and other plants, seeds that have blown off adjacent paddocks and they never recover."" ""Where they may have an exemption (to clear) is where they are doing road maintenance."" ""It is not just road maintenance that is being done, it is road widening,"" Mr Loney said. He said the society's conservation committee, which he chairs, was concerned about recent clearing of roadside vegetation in Dowerin, 150 kilometres north-east of Perth. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Shire of Dowerin said storms and flooding in February last year had damaged 18 roads and these were now being repaired, but denied they were being widened at the same time. ""It is the understanding of the Shire of Dowerin that no clearing permits were required for this project,"" the statement read. Among the instructions given to the contractors were that clearing could not be done ""in mapped environmental sensitive areas or areas where threatened and priority flora is mapped, even if the vegetation encroaches on the road/drains,"" the spokesperson said. ""Road verges within the Shire of Dowerin which have previously been cleared, usually contain a seed bank within the topsoil, and wildflowers and other understorey fully recovers within a five-to-10-year time frame,"" the statement continued. They said community concerns had been raised with staff in Dowerin and the contractors told them ""road repair activities had been contained within the maintenance corridor."" Mr Loney said the problem is not with one shire and the society was also concerned about clearing on farmland because of the impact on biodiversity.

277,This invasive weed is choking rivers in far north Queensland,environment,"  Traditional owners and landholders call for statewide declaration on Amazon frogbit weed An invasive weed is slowly choking rivers in far north Queensland, prompting fed-up traditional owners and local landholders to get their hands dirty and try to stop it in its tracks. Amazon frogbit is commonly used in home aquariums and ponds as a decorative plant, and it has been declared a statewide pest in New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, but not in Queensland. The weed is spreading in creeks across Mareeba and the Atherton Tablelands, including Chinaman, Granite, Atherton, Narcotic Creeks and more recently the mighty Barron River. Sick of waiting for government authorities to act, Koko-Muluridji traditional owner Ann-Marie Keating has enlisted her family and friends to pull weeds out with their hands. ""We started in the same position that we started last year and then we moved towards the bridge so that water could run freely,"" Ms Keating said. But it is an uphill battle, with 80 per cent of the cleared weeds returning within 12 months. ""It should be similar to Clean Up Australia Day, where we clean up litter,"" Ms Keating added. ""I think we need to start looking at how as a community we can start cleaning up our river systems."" ""It's important that we do this as it's part of our traditional lands."" Mareeba Shire Deputy Mayor Kevin Davies believes the infestation was caused by a weed discarded from a fish tank. ""It clogs up your water ways; it grows like a mat [across the water],"" Mr Davies said. ""It stops all the sunlight from getting down below. All your native fish die because they need oxygen."" The Mareeba Shire and Tablelands Regional Councils have declared Amazon frogbit a weed under local laws, but they are worried it could still be brought in from other areas of the state. The Mareeba Shire Council has written to the state government calling for a statewide declaration, which would stop the sale of it in pet shops. In a statement to the ABC, Minister for Agricultural Industry Development and Fisheries Mark Furner said biosecurity officers first located the weed in Brisbane in 2011 and the department was reconsidering the consequences of continued trade of the plant. Ms Keating doesn't care which government department is responsible; she just wants the job done before it is too late. ""Everybody should help, whether it's a financial investment or just physically helping,"" she said. ""If we can jump into the water to swim and play, then we can jump in and pull out the weeds. ""We shouldn't get into a battle over who should do it; we should all support each other and just get into the water and pull it all out."" For the local Koko-Muluridji people, the water is sacred. ""Waterways can provide our boundaries; they are part of our stories, and our waters are sacred to our clan,"" she said. ""As holders of different stories, water is a major part that connects us to certain animals and sacred women's sites."" News of the noxious weed has travelled nearly 500 kilometres to the Mitchell River, where concerned landowners have formed the Frogbit Sentinel Network. Traditional Owner at Din Din (Barron Falls) and Djabugay Bulmba Rangers Project Manager Mr Barry Hunter Junior said weed management required a concerted community effort. ""Often, we see there's little co-ordination between institutions and agencies, so the work that we [rangers] do can be seen as a band aid,"" he said. Concerns have taken on a new urgency since the recent discovery of Amazon frogbit in the Barron River. CleanCo, which runs the hydro-electric station at Barron River, engaged the Kuranda Riverboat and an excavator to contain the weed. ""CleanCo initiated efforts to remove an area of Amazon frogbit that had floated into the Kuranda Weir, to avoid any infestation causing problems in the river as a whole and in CleanCo's Barron Gorge hydroelectric operation in particular,"" said general manager, Tim Hogan.

278,Sarah campaigned to protect a Victorian forest. Then a PI says he was told to find 'dirt' on her,environment,"  VicForests accused of 'spying' on protesters and environmentalists Sarah Rees had no idea she was being followed. On a morning like any other in 2011, she walked out of her home in Healesville, about an hour's drive from Melbourne, and started her car. She drove to an office where she ran a small conservation group, did a bit of paperwork and then drove to Melbourne for the day. Alan Davey says he was never far behind her. For about four days, the professional private investigator says he followed her every move, at the request of a state government agency. ""They told me they wanted me to get as much dirt as I possibly could on the woman,"" Mr Davey says. ""I was of the understanding Sarah Rees was a person of great interest that VicForests was trying to shut up."" VicForests is a Victorian government agency tasked with supplying timber from state forests to sawmills and pulp mills around the state. It's run as a for-profit company, owned by the government. However, the ABC can reveal VicForests hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance on conservationists and, more recently, conducted what some have called ""digital surveillance"" on people the agency argues are trying to ""discredit"" it. It's not just conservationists who have been the target of this work. An academic says he has also been the subject of digital surveillance by VicForests. ""Government agencies allegedly spying on their citizens — there is a real question there whether that's lawful, whether it complies with our privacy laws, and whether it's consistent with our rights under the Charter of Human Rights that we have in Victoria,"" says Yusur Al-Azzawi, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre. Alan Davey has done all sorts of things as a private investigator. He's tracked down stolen cattle in the outback, served court documents on unwilling defendants, and uncovered cheating spouses. Much of it paid well, he said. In 2010, he was hired by VicForests to tail logging trucks and spot any contractors who were driving dangerously. He spent days and nights on roads through the Central Highlands of Victoria, filming trucks hauling logs out of the forests, recording their speeds and registration details. ""There were some rogue operators, for want of a better word, that were speeding. And their speeds were dangerous,"" he said. Hours of video footage seen by the ABC shows Mr Davey doing that work. In 2010, workers caught wind of what was happening, and objected to VicForests hiring private investigators to spy on contractors. However, Mr Davey's work with VicForests didn't end there. In 2011, Mr Davey claims he was told to focus on a new target: Sarah Rees. ""I'd never met this woman before, but I was deployed to do three to four days' surveillance on her,"" Mr Davey said. By 2011, Sarah Rees had been involved in forest conservation for about a decade, after she watched the water supply at Marysville degrade, something she says was caused by logging. But that year, a campaign kicked off over logging at Toolangi State Forest — just 30 kilometres out of Melbourne — which, she says, raised the stakes. After the 2009 Black Saturday fires burned 450,000 hectares of forest and killed 120 people in nearby Kinglake alone, VicForests saw a lot of their resources — state forests — disappear. ""Toolangi was considered the green hole in the black doughnut,"" Ms Rees said. ""It was burnt all around and, due to freak weather, due to the fact it's a rich, wet old growth forest, it didn't burn."" She says that meant both environmentalists and VicForests valued the area — but for very different reasons — and a campaign involving protest activity kicked off. VicForests has regularly come into conflict with protesters. But Ms Rees says the situation in Toolangi, near Kinglake, was a problem for them. She says the protests lasted longer than usual — about six weeks. And, she says, the support this protest had from the local community, as well as its close proximity to Melbourne, made it a worry for VicForests. It was in the midst of that campaign that Alan Davey says he was hired to follow Sarah Rees. Alan Davey says he met with a senior manager at VicForests, who explained what they wanted: ""dirt"". ""[They said] 'I want as much content as you can possibly get. I want to know any s**t that she's doing' … and that's what I did,"" Mr Davey says. ""He said to me, 'I want to know what she's doing in the next four days, where she's going, who she's going to see and the places she's visiting'."" Mr Davey says he followed Ms Rees for four days. He took videos and photographs. Mr Davey says he didn't find anything of significance for VicForests. ""Four days of absolutely nothing,"" he says. ""Just living a very normal life."" High-resolution spatial data and information obtained as part of an ABC investigation sparks allegations of widespread and systemic illegal logging in protected Victorian water catchments. Ms Rees says VicForests saw her as a threat because she was using the legal system to challenge their right to log areas that were crucial to their business. ""I was effective,"" she says. ""I was using the system that had been designed to hold them to account and … they were seeking to damage my standing."" However, she's troubled by the surveillance. ""The truth of it is it was bloody awful to learn of that,"" she says. ""I was shocked. I felt violated."" She says she ceased the lease on the office she was using, removed her mailbox and began using a post office box. ""I started acting in ways that I normally wouldn't. A degree of paranoia crept in."" Mr Davey's engagement by VicForests to surveil protesters is confirmed in court documents, including sworn testimony by then-senior managers at the agency. Invoices show he was paid tens of thousands of dollars for his work. The court documents also show it all came to an end later in 2011, after a different spying operation went wrong. In August, a VicForests manager met with Mr Davey, and asked him to conduct covert surveillance on protesters, including taking photographs. Sworn testimony by VicForests staff shows that evening, a VicForests general manager of operations drove Mr Davey to the forest near Toolangi to conduct his surveillance. An invoice seen by the ABC shows he was paid more than $8,000 by the government agency for the mission. The operation didn't go well. Mr Davey says he was detained by several people and badly assaulted in the forest that night. He says he has no idea if the alleged assailants were protesters, loggers or perhaps even an organised crime syndicate that may have been using the forest to grow drug crops, something that was known to occur in the region. Mr Davey sued VicForests for damages and, as a result, details of his employment are available in court documents. The case was settled out of court. VicForests didn't respond to any questions about the issue, but in a statement said: ""VicForests is always professional in its dealings with both contractors, and those who don't support Victoria's important timber industry. VicForests found no evidence to substantiate claims by Ms Rees."" However, while Mr Davey walked away, VicForests' pursuit of Ms Rees and others was not over. Sarah Rees says VicForests has continued to surveil her. In 2019 and 2020, Ms Rees was deputy chair of the Australian arm of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). It's an international not-for-profit that assesses products made from wood for sustainability, and gives them a tick of approval. Having that tick of approval is important for companies such as VicForests, since some customers won't purchase their wood without it. Bunnings, for example, has stopped selling wood from Victoria's state forests for that very reason. VicForests has tried several times to get FSC certification, but has repeatedly failed. ""I think VicForests is suffering challenges on many levels with the attainment of the standard,"" Ms Rees says. Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au. In 2020, stories began appearing in rural and industry media about some board directors of FSC, including Ms Rees, being ""biased"". The alleged bias of Ms Rees and other board directors was so bad, according to the reports, that VicForests postponed its attempt to get FSC certification. Several of those stories reported a complaint VicForests lodged with FSC, calling for Ms Rees to be sacked. The ABC has obtained that letter, and an associated attachment, which Ms Rees describes as a ""dossier"" on her. It contains a list of hundreds of tweets, which VicForests alleged demonstrated her promotion of illegal protest activity and ""actively seeking to discredit VicForests, a government agency, and the Victorian government regulatory system"". ""It's a repeat of 2011,"" Ms Rees says. ""This idea of surveillance on citizens because they don't like what we're talking about, because they don't like us expressing a view."" The complaint called for Ms Rees and another environmentalist, Peter Cooper, to be sacked. They weren’t sacked, however Ms Rees says she was set to become chair of the organisation but withdrew her nomination because of all the controversy. In a statement, a spokesperson for FSC Australia said Ms Rees “is a current and valued director”. And it turns out conservationists weren't the only targets. The complaint also compiled the tweets and other public appearances of Chris Taylor, a forest scientist from the Australian National University. Dr Taylor's research has alleged VicForests has been engaged in widespread and systemic illegal logging, a claim denied by VicForests. ""They more or less compiled a dossier of tweets that I made, articles that I've published, research papers that I've published and co-authored, and misrepresented them,"" Dr Taylor says. ""It was quite off-putting that they would actually dedicate this time to surveil me in that regard. ""I think VicForests sought to … remove my credibility, thereby my voice."" FSC commissioned an investigation into the complaint. The ABC has obtained a copy of the investigation report. It doesn't conclude that FSC board directors did anything wrong. However it notes that the investigators were ""taken aback by the reaction and escalation"" to those actions. ""The allegations [of bias] were investigated by FSC Australia and they were rejected,"" Dr Taylor says. Legal experts say both physical and digital surveillance is worrying, especially when done by a government-owned agency. ""State surveillance comes at a very high democratic cost,"" Ms Al-Azzawi says. ""Surveillance violates people's rights to privacy, and it has a really chilling effect on the exercise of political rights. ""I think that this kind of surveillance, the fact that it is happening in an unregulated environment, means that we're all at risk."" Although the revelations heavily impacted Sarah Rees, she says it hasn't dissuaded her from her activism. ""I don't think it's appropriate for a government agency to … behave like this. The government has an obligation and a duty to take care of its citizens, not to surveil its citizens, not to intimidate its citizens,"" Ms Rees says. ""I won't capitulate to the fear and intimidation and the tactics they're using to silence us."" Watch 7.30 tonight for more on this story.

279,Gold Coast set for a greener 'communal backyard' with new development,environment,"  The central Gold Coast gets a 'communal backyard' as the north looks to industrialise The City of Gold Coast has set the groundwork for two very different developments with swathes of land to become a green recreational area, while 1,100 hectares may become industrialised. On Tuesday, councillors resolved to develop 270 hectares of land between Robina and Merrimac into the 'Greenheart' project. Councillors also endorsed plans to investigate how a 3,000-hectare industrial zone in Yatala could be expanded. State government benchmarks mean 80 per cent of new developments must be built within the existing urban footprint, meaning more high-density housing. Lifestyle and Communities Chair Cr Hermann Vorster said people living in high-density development could not be expected ""to give up their backyards without giving them a big communal backyard"". ""It's going to make sure that suburban Gold Coasters enjoy the very same very high standard of amenity enjoyed by their coastal cousins,"" he said. ""We don't want people stuck in traffic trying to get to the Broadwater Parklands when they should and could be enjoying something on their own doorstep."" The first stage of 'Greenheart' will be the already-approved 22 hectare Robina City Parklands, with construction set to begin next year. The parklands — adjacent to Robina Stadium — will include sporting fields and playgrounds. ""Once this gets going, my view is there'll be unstoppable momentum to deliver the Central Park that the Gold Coast needs."" Cr Vorster said each stage would go to tender separately but the entire project would cost tens of millions of dollars. According to the City of Gold Coast, the Yatala Enterprise Area employs 40,000 people, with hopes to provide 50 years worth of land supply for new industrial developments. Local area councillor Mark Hammel said expanding that industrial zone further east could double the number of jobs. ""With this investigation into more land supply we present the opportunity to possibly have one of the biggest industrial precincts on the eastern seaboard,"" he said. ""It's about the initial investigation works of what would need to happen in terms of traffic infrastructure upgrades, what would need to happen in terms of hydrology studies."" But Cr Hammel said upgrades to the M1, along with completing the Coomera Connector before the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, are vital for the project. ""It puts council in a really good position to then go to state and federal governments with a well put-together plan, based with economic data, to say 'this is why you need to invest more in the infrastructure in the northern end of our city'.""

280,Another Port River dolphin found dead as interim report struggles to identify cause,environment,"  Another Port River dolphin found dead as interim report struggles to identify a cause A third dolphin has been found dead inside the Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary, but despite showing similar symptoms to other dead or missing mammals an interim investigation is no closer to finding the cause. A four-year-old dolphin known by enthusiasts variously as Squeak or Mimo was found dead late on Sunday near Fletcher's Slip on the Port River. Squeak was the latest Port River dolphin to be showing signs of emaciation and illness after his older brother, Hunter, had to be euthanised due to severe ill health. A 12-year-old dolphin known as Tallulla — renowned for tail walking across the surface of the water — was found dead in August. Department of Environment and Water Conservation and Wildlife (DEW) director Lisien Loan told ABC Radio Adelaide all the dolphins had shown similar symptoms and suffered a ""really quick decline"". ""They're looking quite healthy with normal behaviour and then quickly, within four or five weeks, getting quite thin and either going missing and we haven't been able to see them again, or dying,"" she said. Two other dolphins, named Twinkle and Doc, are also presumed dead after presenting with similar symptoms earlier this year before disappearing, and a sixth dolphin washed up dead on Semaphore Beach during July. The Port River dolphins are a cherished tourist attraction, with the deaths prompting DEW Minister David Speirs to launch an investigation in August into their failing health. Ms Loan said post-mortems, or necropsies, of the dolphins had found the dolphins were all suffering from infections and diseases that were affecting their health with varying degrees of severity. ""The reports, however, don't show a definitive cause of common links between the dolphin deaths beyond possible suppression of their immune system,"" she said. Two of the dolphins, Hunter and Doc — sampled before he disappeared — were found to have been exposed to Brucella, a zoonotic bacterium that could result in dolphin abortions, male infertility, neurobrucellosis, cardiopathioes, bone and skin lesions, and death. Investigators said broader surveillance was required to see if it was negatively impacting the dolphin population, particularly with regard to to calf mortality. The 118-square kilometre dolphin sanctuary encompasses the Port River and adjacent Barker Inlet, and stretches north into the Gulf of St Vincent to the Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary. The Port River dolphins once numbered in their 40s, with about 30 remaining almost entirely in the river area. In recent times the main river population has declined to about 10, with a further 10 coming and going from the gulf. Testing would also continue for environmental toxicants, including biotoxins and other factors that might contribute to weakened immunity, including water quality, toxicology, pathology, and marine ecosystems. Ms Loan said veterinary pathologists on the investigating team were keen to continue looking for a disease or neurological condition that could be causing emaciation and leading to other infections. ""We're also looking at genetics and doing a trawl back through data over the last 30 years, and samples we've got in the museum, as well as a complete literature review,"" she said. This included data of dolphin deaths worldwide in an effort to ""pin point or narrow down what we might be looking for"". Despite escaping hypersaline water at nearby St Kilda which killed off mangroves and salt marsh since late last year, Ms Loan said it was unlikely to be a factor due to the size of the body of water involved. She said the affected dolphins seemed to be those that stayed in and about the Port River tidal estuary and lived within a ""very small home range"". ""That's why they're well known to the community down there because they tend to be in that inner Port River area around Garden Island and don't tend to move too far from there,"" Ms Loan said. ""We have a lot of other dolphins that use the sanctuary that also come in and out of the gulf.""

281,Woodside's $16b Scarborough gas project gets green light,environment,"  Woodside BHP Scarborough gas project off north-west WA gets final go-ahead Woodside will press ahead with the biggest oil and gas development to be built in Australia in a decade, after sanctioning its $16.5 billion Scarborough project off Western Australia. In a move that has enraged green groups, Woodside announced it had approved the Scarborough development and the associated upgrade of its Pluto liquefied natural gas facility near Karratha, 1,600km north of Perth. The decision comes despite a furious, last-ditch bid by environmentalists to stymie the project after the Conservation Council of WA last week launched legal action, claiming the project required assessment under federal law. That decision also coincided with news that the boards of Woodside and BHP had agreed to merge their petroleum businesses in a $40 billion deal, which will create one of the world's biggest fossil fuel players. With a price tag of $US12 billion ($16.5 billion), Scarborough is set to be the biggest oil and gas development undertaken in Australia since the end of a $US200 billion ($275 billion) investment splurge 10 years ago. The project will involve the construction of a 430-kilometre pipeline, linking the Scarborough gas field to the mainland, as well as a second production train at the Pluto LNG processing plant. At the peak of construction, as many as 3,200 jobs are expected to be created, with first production slated for 2026. Woodside's chief executive, Meg O'Neill, alluded to the project's importance to the company's future by noting it would provide cashflow and fund future developments for decades. ""Today's decisions set Woodside on a transformative path,"" Ms O'Neill said in a statement. ""Scarborough will be a significant contributor to Woodside's cashflows, the funding of future developments and new energy products, and shareholder returns. ""This capital-efficient development leverages Woodside's existing infrastructure and our proven expertise in project execution."" However, the decision was condemned by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which contrasted Woodside's actions with the International Energy Association's call for an end to new oil and gas projects. Dan Gocher, the centre's director of climate and environment, questioned ""what part of 'No new fossil fuel projects' doesn't Woodside understand"". Conservation Council of WA executive director Maggie Wood was similarly critical. Ms Wood also suggested the environmental movement would continue its fight against Scarborough, including on legal grounds. These have included allegations the development is unlawful because it has not been subject to an assessment under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. ""We are, of course, disappointed at this news,"" Ms Wood said. ""Anybody who cares about our environment and the future of our planet will be disappointed and rightly angry that Woodside and BHP are insistent on pursuing this climate-destroying development. ""However, this is far from over. The coordinated national campaign against Scarborough gas will continue to apply pressure on this development, its investors and its buyers. ""Scarborough is a disaster for our climate, for our iconic marine life and for globally significant Aboriginal heritage on the Burrup Peninsula. Ms Wood said the project was the ""single-most-polluting fossil fuel development currently proposed in Australia"". ""At a time when the world is facing up to the dire need to reduce emissions and prevent irreversible damage to our climate, this project is an insult to ordinary Australians who will bear the brunt of future extreme weather events and climate disasters caused by developments like Scarborough,"" she said. Anticipating the backlash, Ms O'Neill defended the environmental merits of Scarborough, noting the gas field had an exceptionally low carbon content. She also argued that gas would be vital for the transition away from an energy system underpinned by fossil fuels to one dependent on renewable energy sources, especially in countries such as China and Japan. ""The Scarborough reservoir contains only around 0.1 per cent carbon dioxide, and Scarborough gas, processed through the efficient and expanded Pluto LNG facility, supports the decarbonisation goals of our customers in Asia,"" she said. ""Developing Scarborough delivers value for Woodside shareholders and significant, long-term benefits, locally and nationally, including thousands of jobs, taxation revenue and the supply of gas to export and domestic markets for decades to come."" But in its official development proposal, Woodside revealed the total carbon emissions for the project, including the Scope 3 emissions, which take into account customer emissions, were forecast to be 880 million tonnes. Graeme Bethune, the chief executive of analyst firm EnergyQuest, said the Scarborough project would buttress Woodside's financial position and made strong commercial sense given forecasts of high gas prices for years. Mr Bethune said the end of gas had been overstated and pointed to the scores of LNG projects on the table in the US, with energy superpower Qatar as evidence of this. However, he acknowledged the difficulty in Australian companies developing mega oil and gas projects and suggested Scarborough may be the last of its kind in the country. ""At least this gives them one major growth project, whereas the cupboard was looking a little bare previously prior to Scarborough and prior to the BHP deal,"" Mr Bethune said. ""Any new development like this is significant... it's the biggest oil and gas development in Australia for 10 years."" Premier Mark McGowan welcomed the announcement and said Scarborough was expected to comply with WA's domestic gas reservation policy, under which gas equivalent to 15 per cent of reserves are sold into the domestic market.

282,Inside the complicated friendships and daring 'treasure hunts' of South Korea's last surviving mermaids,environment,"  Come on an underwater treasure hunt with Korea's haenyeo — the women of the sea Follow Korea's oldest free divers on their underwater treasure hunt. The volcanic island of Jeju is a wild paradise sitting just off the coast of the Korean peninsula. It is said to be plentiful in three things: rock, wind and women. Each have been instrumental in shaping its success. The rock and wind represent the island itself, formed after a volcanic eruption thousands of years ago and regularly at the mercy of a strong gale. The women are haenyeo, which literally translates to women of the sea. Since the 17th century, they have made a living from free diving along Jeju’s winding coastline. Regarded as South Korea's first working mothers, it's speculated these women began diving at a time when the men of the island were away gathering food or at war. Yoon Sook-nyeo has been a member of haenyeo for more than 40 years. Now one of the group's leaders, she believes they have played an instrumental part in the island's history and development. ""For a long time, haenyeo have formed a community in the village,"" Yoon says. ""And when they enter the sea, they go in and out together, laugh and fight together, and live together like that."" Haenyeo's knowledge is passed down to younger generations in families, by local community groups, even at school. With thousands living on the island, the women are divided into smaller groups and designated a particular spot of coastline to focus on. Leadership can vary from group to group depending on its size. Sometimes the highest ranking members go for dives while the lower rank keeps watch from above. But haenyeo we travel with are part of a flatter power structure and dive closer to the shore. Status comes with experience. The older women rotate leadership among themselves. The leader might occupy the best seat on the Korean-style heated floor as they get ready, but the decision making seems democratic. Each group of haenyeo have a bulteok — a space where they meet in the morning. Where they dive that day is decided after they meet. Like many in the group, Lee Yu-jung views the 21 women she dives with as her family. ""As the youngest, it's my job to make the coffee each morning,"" the 32-year-old says. ""I feel like I have 20 maternal grandmothers. If my wetsuit is ripped, they’ll help me fix it."" Members start arriving from around 6am, taking dried clothing off the lines and applying sunscreen. Everyone quickly falls into a comfortable rhythm. New arrivals are greeted with warm smiles as the women swap stories and speculate on the day ahead. Some will go and pray at the haesindang, a shrine to the sea god, asking for a safe dive and help in catching an abundance of fish. ""We are friends, but sometimes we fight,"" laughs Yoon after we witness a lively discussion carried out in the distinct accent of the island. At a sprightly 65 years old, she's a relative youngster among the women of the sea. The oldest current member of this group is 91. At its peak, it's believed about 23,000 haenyeo were working the waters around the island. Now the third pillar of Jeju's proverb is under threat. The number of haenyeo has dwindled over the years, and currently stands at about 3,500. Many members are at an age where workers would be considering retirement. Less than 100 are aged under 50. Most young women on Jeju these days are choosing to stay above the water to earn a living. They see it as both a less dangerous and more lucrative option. But for the women of the sea, free diving isn't just a profession, it's a way of life. Haenyeo take to the water at 8am, having grown accustomed to the bracing cold of the ocean. Donning their patched up, matching wetsuits, pink fringed masks, and yellow flippers, the women make the short walk to their diving spot for the day. All 21 members go diving at once, waiting for Yoon to signal it's time to move. Then, one by one, they dive. The women can swim as deep as 30 metres and are known to hold their breath for up to three minutes at a time as they forage for catch or hunt down the odd wily octopus. While they gather together and go out to dive as a group, each woman works on their own in the ocean. Depending on the time of the year, Haenyeo can harvest for up to seven hours a day, 90 days of the year. Though in the cooler months that can halve. The only sign of their work to the casual on-shore observers are their distinctive orange floats bobbing on the surface of the water. Attached are nets, increasingly swollen with their catch. ""Working at sea is like a treasure hunt,"" Lee Yu-jung says. ""The more I find, the more I can buy what I want, and I give my parents money by selling what I caught and sharing the delicious food."" The type of catch changes throughout the year, depending on what's available. Urchins are the target from March through May, while haenyeo mostly gather seaweed during the summer months. By October, when we visit with them, they have turned their attention to conches – sea snails. The women are conscious of sustainable collection while still etching out a living. But they face a bigger concern while underwater: overexertion. It is all too easy to miscalculate your limits during a free dive, underestimating the time it will take to reach the surface or overestimating the oxygen you have left. That's why training to be a member can take many years. According to Jeju city authorities, on average between five and 10 women lose their lives diving, each year. Even very experienced members take medicine to avoid motion sickness in the rocky conditions. ""It's dangerous, but this is the skill we've learned. We dive when it's cold and when it's hot,"" one member says. Many have decades of experience and hard-earned knowledge of weather patterns and tides. They all have an opinion on where is best to hunt on any particular day. But haenyeo have noticed the water is changing. The temperature is slightly warmer and certain fish are easier to spot. While in one sense that makes the early morning dives easier to bear, it's a source of anxiety for the group, who are concerned about how it will impact their fishing grounds. Jeju University professor Park Sang-ryul says the island and haenyeo, which are dependent on its health, are facing a crisis. The area is experiencing some of the fastest climate change in the world, he says, with the water temperature here rising three times faster than the global climate change trend. According to Professor Park's research, the water temperature around the island has risen more than one degree in the past 30 years. In total, it has risen by about two degrees over the past 80 years. The change could be potentially catastrophic for the area, he says, as slight temperature changes in the ocean can have a bigger impact than on land. ""A change of 1 degree in the ocean is considered to be a change of 10 degrees on land,"" he said. The changes have been so drastic that the seas have moved from being a temperate zone to now being subtropical. And already it's having an impact on sea life. ""There is a decrease in kelp forests and an increase in corals in the ocean,"" he said. The changes are not only limited to algae and plant life though, with haenyeo noticing that creatures further up the food chain are suffering as well. ""The sea in Korea is a cold sea. It used to be hard to see colourful fish, but these days they're everywhere,"" one of the free divers says. Leader Yoon says the change is most obvious in the underwater plants where ""five or six kinds of seaweeds have disappeared"". ""Too many species have disappeared even in the 40 years I have been around,"" she says. Jeju is one of the major tourism drawcards in South Korea, famous for its volcanic mountain peak in the centre of the island and the relatively sedate beautiful blue waters that surround it. The island offers a reprieve to Koreans wanting to escape the hustle and bustle of their clogged cities. Tourism has brought more jobs to the island, with people needed to provide services to new visitors. But Jeju's popularity has come with a large environmental cost, particularly in the forms of increased pollution. Lee regularly goes out with a group of like-minded divers to clean up some of the rubbish blighting the waters. For these expeditions she makes sure to use full scuba gear and an oxygen tank. The refuse they collect ranges from discarded fishing gear, bottles, car parts and a huge amount of plastic. ""We try to come out as much as possible,"" the young diver says. But there's always so much rubbish. And along with their anxiety over the changes happening in the ocean, haenyeo fear for their future. As more young women have given up on the practice, many worry the women of the sea could die out completely. With their numbers dwindling, the group we travel with look out for new recruits like Lee Yu-jung. At 32, she is young by haenyeo standards. Three decades separate her from the second-youngest haenyeo in her group. Her father was a fisherman and this connection helped her to gain acceptance with the group. She joined as an intern, made possible only with the unanimous support of all the women she free dives with. Lee spent two years in the role training and passing milestones related to her skills before she could graduate into the main ranks. After four years with the group, she says free diving is not about the capacity to earn money. ""I was a quick-tempered person who got bored quickly when I started,"" Lee said. ""In the early days I used to spend time under water thinking about all the happy and sad things that were happening in my life. ""I was so lost in my thoughts I couldn't focus on my work."" Lee talks about her work in transformative language. The hours she has since spent submerged in the water, controlling her breath, have altered her core. ""The older haenyeo told me I wasn't performing, that I would only ever be a low-level haenyeo. That motivated me,"" she said. ""I really learnt to be patient by working in the sea with them. I also learnt how to work hard."" At 75, Yang Gye-ran is a more seasoned haenyeo member, having spent more than five decades free diving. She was born into haenyeo and has been a member since she was 19. Both her mother and sisters were also haenyeo but she says it's not just biology that binds the women together. ""We're like a family just because we work together here,"" she says. Not only is she haenyeo, but she's also a head of the local fishing village, which includes the fishermen. On the mainland of South Korea, that would cause something of a stir. But given the revered role of haenyeo on Jeju, it's not all that unusual. Even at an age when most would be thinking about retiring, Yang says she can't spend too much time away from the ocean. ""No matter how the sea changes, I like it. It feels so good to go to the sea,"" she says. ""Haenyeo get sick on land. My legs hurt, my body hurts, but when I go into the sea, the pain goes away.""

283,Thai festival that honours the river goddess has begun polluting the water it reveres,environment,"  Thailand's Loy Krathong festival honours rivers, but it's starting to pollute them too Thais are flocking to rivers and lakes in an annual festival honouring the goddess of water, with the hundreds of thousands of floats adorned with flowers clogging the country's waterways. The Thai festival is called Loy Krathong and it marks the end of the rainy season Believers symbolically float their misfortunes away and start the new year with a clean slate The thousands of floats made with materials like Styrofoam are polluting the waterways Within hours on Friday, workers began trawling the rivers to fish the offerings back out. The Loy Krathong festival allows believers to symbolically float their misfortunes away on ""krathongs"" and start another year with a clean slate. The festival is celebrated on the night of the full moon of the 12th lunar month, which traditionally marks the end of the rainy season. Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a leading Thai marine biologist, said getting people to stop using harmful materials such as polystyrene foam — Styrofoam — for their floats remains the priority because they caused the most damage to the water and aquatic life. The number of endangered sea creatures found dead ashore, which he believes stems from the problem of ocean trash in Thailand, doubled from 2017 to 2020. Activists have noted a change in people's behaviour over decades, pointing to rising awareness of the damage krathongs cause. The total number of krathongs collected in Bangkok has fallen from more than 900,000 in 2012 to just over 490,000 last year, and there has been a sharper reduction in the number of floats made of Styrofoam, from 131,000 to fewer than 18,000 over the same period. Even so, some conservationists advocate a more radical solution. ""We need to revolutionise the practice, allowing the ecosystem of the waterways to be restored,"" said Tara Buakamsri, Thailand country director for the environmental group Greenpeace. ""We should not release any floats, because even if they are made from natural materials, the amount of them exceeds what rivers can naturally deal with,"" Mr Buakamsri said. ""We depend on clean water for our livelihood and the aim of Loy Krathong should be to protect and rejuvenate our rivers without putting anything in them,"" he said. Sales of materials for krathongs have been slow this year due to the pandemic, said Nopparat Tangtonwong, a vendor at Pak Klong market, famous for selling flowers. ""COVID-19 causes the economy to be sluggish, so people prefer saving their money and floating online instead,"" she said. At the same time, children are uninterested in banana-leaf floats, the main natural alternative to Styrofoam, she said. ""They prefer fancy floats made of ice-cream cones and bread because they can feed the fish at the same time."" Such an approach is not helpful, said Wijarn Simachaya, president of Thailand Environment Institute. ""If you float somewhere with no fish, those floats will cause pollution in the water. It is difficult to collect them, too, as the bread absorbs the water and sinks into the river,"" said Mr Simachaya. ""In addition, the sellers usually put chemical colors in those floats, which is harmful to the water,"" he said. Banana leaves are the best krathong material because they do not decompose too quickly, and once collected, can be used for making fertiliser, Mr Simachaya said. ""Doing a virtual Loy Krathong celebration is another good solution to avoid environmental damage, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak, but I don't think it can satisfy people as they still want to enjoy the festival,"" Mr Simachaya said. Late on Friday night after people floated their cares away, municipal workers come out to scoop up a sea of floats that drifted along canals and down the Chao Phraya River before they decomposed and contaminated the water. Dozens of small boats travelled along the river, each carrying about half a dozen people with hand-held nets to collect the krathongs. The boats then took their catch to a moored mothership, where it was dumped into a large shredding machine, then compacted and hauled away by garbage trucks for landfill in a waste dump. ""We have been campaigning for people to stop using Styrofoam and we have received support from the public,"" said Chatree Wattanakhajorn, a top Bangkok official. ""We hope that this year the numbers of Krathongs made with Styrofoam will continue to decrease and will be less than last year. And we will finish our clean-up operation before 5 o'clock in the morning.""

284,PM's performance at COP26 behind Allegra Spender's tilt at seat of Wentworth,environment,"  Carla Zampatti's daughter, Allegra Spender, to run as independent in Wentworth at federal election A high-profile independent running for the federal Sydney seat of Wentworth says the Prime Minister's performance at the recent climate change conference in Glasgow motivated her to enter the race. Businesswoman and renewable energy advocate Allegra Spender, the daughter of late fashion designer Carla Zampatti and former Liberal MP John Spender, will run as an independent for the blue-ribbon, eastern-suburbs seat in next year's election. The seat is currently held by Liberal MP Dave Sharma with a margin of 1.3 per cent. The former ambassador to Israel reclaimed the seat for the party in 2019 after defeating independent, Kerryn Phelps. In 2018, Dr Phelps won the seat in a by-election triggered by the resignation of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. Ms Spender, who is currently the CEO of Australian Business Community Network, decided to run after what she said was the federal government's failure to deal with climate change. ""I decided to run really about climate, integrity and the economy,"" she said. ""We are not doing enough on climate and that is having a big impact on our economy and our environmental future."" In recent years, the 43-year-old has channelled her passion for climate action into her role as chair for Sydney Renewable Power Company where the focus is on giving people ""practical solutions to the environmental challenges"". But the tipping point for her to enter the political domain came when she saw Prime Minister Scott Morrison on the world stage. ""It was really watching COP26 and just realising that Scott Morrison and the team were never going to get there,"" she said. ""It is the next 10 years that are really going to make a difference, both for the economy but also for the climate. ""That was really clear in COP26 that Australia was an absolute laggard in terms of what we signed up to — and we need to move faster."" Ms Spender said even though her father was a former Liberal MP for the federal seat of North Sydney, he supported her independent candidacy. ""My dad was a Liberal MP but he is 100 per cent behind me,"" she said. Her family's ties to the party date back to her grandfather, who was a Liberal MP for Warringah but had initially stood as an independent in 1937 over his objection to the then-governments' defence policy. ""We’re a family of Liberals but we've also been people who've said, 'We know what we stand for,' and you have to stand up for that, and that’s really my background."" Ms Spender sees herself as a ""typical frustrated Wentworth voter"" — who voted for Dr Phelps in the last election and Mr Turnbull before that — with a unique opportunity to make a difference. ""Wentworth has shown it is willing to elect an independent when it elected Kerryn Phelps and it is a very marginal seat,"" she said. ""I think the frustration of the people I talk to in Wentworth is real — and it is about climate, and it is about the economy, and it is about trust in our politicians. ""I strongly believe business and the environment can work together.""

285,Conservationists concerned nesting turtles disturbed by major sand works,environment,"  Bundaberg Regional Council carries out heavy machinery work on Bargara beach during turtle nesting season It is turtle nesting season along Queensland's coast, but one council has come under fire for creating an ""obstacle course"" for mothers trying to lay their eggs. Bundaberg Regional Council has been conducting heavy machinery work digging out the mouth of Moneys Creek at Bargara, with the sand moved to Kelly's Beach. Sea Turtle Alliance president Ainsley Gatley said the timing was concerning as nesting turtles were coming to shore. ""Why you would be doing this sort of work during turtle season, which is directly impacting the dunes, is questionable,"" she said. ""If there are any eggs that have already been laid there, then they've been buried even deeper and will be harder for hatchlings to emerge in six to eight weeks."" She said the disturbed sand would be soft and made it difficult for turtles to dig their egg chambers. ""We know November to March is nesting season, so why not do it outside of those times?"" she asked. A spokesperson for Bundaberg Regional Council said the work was undertaken annually. ""[It is] to improve water quality in the lagoon for holiday makers and to reduce the risk of summer fish kills,"" the spokesperson said. ""Precautions are in place to ensure turtle habitat isn't disturbed. ""All approval authorities were notified of the works."" Researchers have been using satellite tracking technology to trace the movements of the first turtle to nest at the nearby Mon Repos beach, a well-known marine turtle nesting spot. The flatback turtle, known as X23103, has been breeding for at least 47 years. Acting ranger in charge Nicole Murnane said she was one of the world's longest studied marine turtles. ""For the past few years she's come back every second year, which is good to see,"" Ms Murnane said. ""She has long-term fidelity to Mon Repos, so she doesn't go to other beaches to lay the odd clutch. Most of them [turtles] or all of them have been at Mon Repos. ""She actually lives up in Repulse Bay in North Queensland. Ms Murnane said that in 2015, a satellite tag was attached to the female turtle, which observed a 645 kilometre journey to get back home that took about 28 days.""

286,Hong Kong begins culling wild boars in urban areas  ,environment,"  Hong Kong begins culling wild boars found in urban areas amid public safety concerns Hong Kong authorities have euthanised seven wild boars as they embark on a catch-and-cull program to reduce numbers in urban areas, after a policeman was bitten last week. The cull took place less than 30 minutes from the heart of Hong Kong's financial district, where officials say some residents have been spotted feeding the animals. ""Veterinarians used dart guns to capture seven wild pigs for humane dispatch through medicine injection,"" the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said in a statement. The move to cull the boars marks a significant policy shift in controlling the most commonly seen wild animals in the city. The department said boars were ""accustomed to wandering along the road and looking for food from passers-by or even chasing vehicles."" Last week, a wild boar knocked down a police officer and bit his leg, causing a deep wound and prompting Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to warn the government would increase penalties for those who feed them. That animal subsequently fell off the edge of a car park, plunging about 10 metres to its death. About 30 boar attacks have been reported in recent years, authorities said. Hong Kong's policy had been to capture the animals, then sterilise and relocate them to remote, unpopulated areas. The city is home to about 3,000 wild boars, according to government data. The animals are not considered a protected species. Boars have at times been seen on subway trains, or waiting for the traffic light to turn green at pedestrian crossings by the harbour. At the start of the pandemic last year, when most Hong Kong people were working from home, a video of a boar family bathing in a fountain in between the financial district's skyscrapers went viral. The shift in policy has sparked criticism from animal rights groups, with police seen detaining at least one activist who tried to steer the boars away from waiting traps. Feral pigs are a known threat to the environment, but new research reveals their digging is also contributing to carbon emissions. Roni Wong, spokesperson for the Hong Kong Wild Boar Concern Group, said the boar problem was caused by the government failing to allocate resources to deal with the animals peacefully. ""Now the animals have to pay for the cost,"" Wong said. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she understood many in Hong Kong loved wild animals, but ""ultimately, our society has to ensure the safety of residents."" ""As a responsible government, we need to take action,"" she told reporters.

287,Natural disaster zone flagged as NSW floods cost farmers millions,environment,"  Forbes set to be declared a natural disaster zone as farmers count cost of floods The New South Wales government says it has started the process for Forbes to be declared a natural disaster zone. Major flooding has caused extensive damage to agricultural land in the shire, with millions of dollars worth of crops and pastures lost due to inundation. The government says it has prepared the paperwork for the declaration to be made and is now waiting on the federal government to respond. ""We have supported our rural sector during some of the toughest times,"" Deputy Premier Paul Toole said. ""We've been there side by side with our rural communities, and I'll tell you once again, the NSW government will have your back."" The Lachlan River reached 10.53 metres on the eastern side of Forbes on Thursday morning. It is more than 10 centimetres below what had originally been predicted and lower than floods that hit the shire in 2016. There have been 33 flood rescues during this emergency and many streets and gardens are covered by water. ""It is a real cruel blow to our local farmers who were expecting a bumper harvest,"" Mr Toole said. ""We won't know the extent of that damage until the water has receded."" With harvest yet to begin in some areas, Chris Groves from the NSW Farmers Association said the losses would be substantial. ""I think it's safe to say we've had a bit much rain right at harvest,"" Mr Groves said. ""It was looking pretty good, but we are now in the scenario where there's going to be larger economic losses, crops even wiped out. ""People will have no income on those low-lying areas."" More rain is on the horizon and Mr Groves said that, coupled with the lack of airspace at the Wyangala Dam upstream, made the situation was likely to deteriorate. ""Hopefully, they're mitigating the water as much as they possibly can with Wyangala Dam,"" Mr Groves said. ""If we get another lot of rain that will be [exacerbated]. That will go on for a further three or four days, so really any more rain on the weekend we could do without."" Mr Toole is in Forbes with Premier Dominic Perrottet and Emergency Services Minister David Elliott to meet State Emergency Service volunteers, residents and farmers. ""That is the spirit that gets our state through these difficult times and, as premier, to come here and visit gives an understanding of the extent of the damage that we're seeing and the challenge that still lies in front of us here in Forbes,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""Ultimately we will get through this like we've got through everything in the past."" Farmers and residents at Forbes have expressed concern about the length of time it is taking to complete the planning process for the proposed upgrade of Wyangala Dam at Forbes. The state and federal governments want to raise the dam wall to store more water. The storage lies upstream, east of Cowra, and the millions of litres that have had to be released have contributed to the major flooding at Forbes. The business case for the project is yet to completed and there has been a lot of speculation that members of the government and government agencies want to shelve the work. ""We remain completely committed,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""We've invested record budgets in emergency services in critical infrastructure right across the state — dams are an important part of that agenda. ""We put significant funding aside for projects right across the state and we'll continue to work with the commonwealth."" Mr Perrottet said he could not give a date for when the business case would be completed. Dave Rankin from the SES said with the immediate danger at Forbes seemingly passed, the focus would move to other river communities. ""We'll be keeping an eye on downstream river systems now,"" Mr Rankin said. ""We're hoping the smaller flood peak won't affect those communities too greatly, but we're certainly keeping on the ball to keep prepared, to help those communities like we've done this week in Forbes.""A partial all-clear was issued for parts of Forbes yesterday afternoon, allowing around two-thirds of affected residents to return home. Properties on Bathurst, Ferry and Ooma Sts are among those considered still a potential for flooding. ""There is still a bit of water moving about the place but for the people we issued the all-clear for we don't consider them to be at a flood risk,"" Mr Rankin said. Despite evacuation orders being lifted yesterday afternoon for two-thirds of residents who were asked to leave their homes, some locals are still worried. Grant Nicholson said with the Lachlan continuing to rise, he personally felt the danger hadn't passed. ""I'd be lying if I said I was easy and comfortable. It's still coming up, so we'll see what happens,"" he said. Katie Guise went for a morning walk along Lake Forbes to check out the flood levels. ""There's surprisingly a lot of water that's come up overnight — it seems to be quite fast moving,"" she said Hayley Hurford said although it was a relief major flooding had been avoided, the weather forecast was still worrying. ""I think the dangerous bit has gone, but we're getting more rain on the weekend and next week so we'll see what happens then,"" she said.

288,Birds rely on these sand flats to refuel at the end of their migration. They may soon find a retirement village there instead,environment," Science Turtle Cove Haven Retirement Village development near endangered bird habitat at River Heads back on table A controversial proposal to develop a Queensland retirement village next to a critically endangered bird habitat is back before federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley. The proposal to build the Turtle Cove Haven Retirement Village has been previously rejected on environmental grounds. The village would be built near the coast at River Heads, across the Great Sandy Strait from K'gari (Fraser Island) in Queensland's Wide Bay Burnett region. The Great Sandy Strait is a declared Ramsar site, meaning it contains wetlands recognised under a United Nations convention to be of international significance. But most importantly for conservationists, the sand flats next to the proposed development are a crucial feeding ground for famished eastern curlews at the end of their epic migration from as far away as Russia. Both BirdLife Australia and the Queensland Wader Study are opposing the latest proposed project, which is smaller and set further back from its previous iteration. BirdLife Australia's Andrew Hunter says the development will still impact the birds and is calling on the government to do everything in its power to protect the habitat. Mr Hunter says over 1,000 critically endangered eastern curlews have been seen roosting there. ""It's one of the most important sites for roosting shore birds in Australia,"" he said. The proposal to build the retirement village has been scaled down several times, with an original plan to build up to 500 independent living units later changed to less than half that. In rejecting that proposal in 2020, Ms Ley noted that the development would encroach on the 250-metre buffer zone from the highest astronomical tide (HAT), which was deemed too close to the critically endangered eastern curlew habitat. Now a third plan consisting of 84 independent living units, an onsite sewage treatment plant and internal roads has been put to the federal Environment Department. Because the developers have submitted a new plan, the Minister now needs to determine whether the new proposal will have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance. If that is deemed to be the case, the proposal will be declared a controlled action and assessed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. That could then result in strict conditions being put on the development, or in the development proposal being rejected again. According to the developer's (Anscape Pty Ltd) submission to the Minister, its latest proposal would now be ""located at a distance of 250 metres from [the highest astronomical tide]"". BirdLife Australia's Andrew Hunter says that's still too close. ""They've increased the buffer from 200 to 250 metres but we don't see that as being sufficient to alleviate the impacts on the birds."" The eastern curlew (Numenius madagascariensis) is the world's largest migratory shorebird. It breeds in China and Russia, then migrates to Australia around August. Once considered abundant, global populations have crashed since the 1980s. On current trends, only 10 per cent of the bird's 1993 population levels will remain by 2035, according to the Threatened Species Recovery Hub. Loss of habitat at key migratory stopover points in the Yellow Sea is considered a major reason for the decline. But in Australia, coastal development is also considered a threat to the species. However, Anscape director Brian Clarke, who is trying to get permission to develop the site, says he is more than confident it can go ahead without impacting the birds. Mr Clarke says he has spent thousands on environmental assessments over nearly 10 years. ""We reduced [the number of units] to 250 and that was still knocked back. Then we did it to 190, even though we got the public environmental report [PER] done scientifically,"" he said. ""We've abided by everything we've been requested to do, which has cost me a fortune."" The environmental assessor who Mr Clarke employed to survey the site, Roger Currie of REMC, said a 100- to 150- metre buffer from the birds would be more than adequate. ""I spent five years studying the site. I observed the curlew behaviour for five years and I wrote a public environmental report which was a 1,400-page document,"" he said. Part of that research included flight initiation distance (FIDS) assessments, which involve creating disturbances and measuring the distance at which the birds took flight. ""We also did an experiment with a tractor and a slasher and the tractor could drive within 20 metres without disturbing the birds."" Both Mr Currie and Mr Clarke said the 250-metre buffer was recommended to the Minister by a researcher who hadn't visited the site. According to Mr Clarke, the problem was when he bought the property, there was an existing development approval on it. But in the meantime, the EPBC Act had come into force, meaning it was much more difficult to develop the property than he'd been led to believe. ""I bought it on the basis of the approvals that were given to me by the council,"" he said. ""It's become a political football. I'm 78 now, I've had a couple of heart troubles. I'm just sick of fighting."" Both Mr Clarke and Mr Currie also said they felt the project was being used as a scapegoat, while much bigger and potentially damaging projects were being approved. ""I think the Minister needed an example, given that Adani had just been approved, that she would be tough on EPBC referrals,"" Mr Currie said. ""If [the government] could approve a coal mine when the CSIRO said 'no, we're not confident you should go ahead with it', how can you knock back a little retirement village at River Heads?"" Even minor disturbances to the birds can cause major problems, according to ecologist and policy researcher April Reside from the University of Queensland. When they arrive after their migration from the northern hemisphere, they're famished and have little energy to flee or find food, she says. ""When they do these massive intercontinental migrations, they're so starving they're actually beginning to digest some of their [internal organs],"" she said. ""They're eating themselves from the inside out."" Robert Bush from the Queensland Wader Study Group says the group is opposed to the development in its current form, and developers need to do more than the bare minimum to ensure habitats are protected. Development rejections under EPBC referral have been extremely rare since the Act came into force in 2000, according to Mr Bush. ""The EPBC Act 1999 is extremely weak,"" he said. ""You can count on two hands the number of projects that have been turned down. ""The problem is that this game is about finding a way to get through the legislative framework – it's not about enhancing conservation."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Dr Reside says many bird species in Australia, such as the black-throated finch found around the Adani coal mine development, are dying a death of a thousand cuts. ""There are a bunch of birds in Australia that are endangered or critically endangered and one of the issues is they have a really large range they occupy,"" she said. ""So the government looks and says 'this is a massive area, we'll just take away one little bit and then this little bit over here'."" Mr Bush says it's a similar case for the eastern curlew. ""The two largest flocks in Australia are on the Great Sandy Strait where this area is, and in Moreton Bay. ""And both of these flocks are challenged by development: one in Toondah Harbour by the Walker Corporation and the other up there."" But Mr Currie said the developers had done more than enough to get approval. ""This is the third referral and the third referral is based on the 250-metre buffer,"" he said. ""There would be no reason for the Minister not to approve it this time."" A decision on whether the proposal will be a controlled action requiring assessment under the EPBC Act is expected to be made on November 23, a spokesperson for Ms Ley said. ""The Minister will receive a detailed departmental report before forming a view,"" they said. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

289,New Delhi shuts coal-fired plants as it battles toxic air pollution ,environment,"  New Delhi suspends coal-fired plants and closes schools indefinitely amid ongoing air pollution India has temporarily shut down five coal-fired power plants around the capital New Delhi as part of its drive to combat air pollution, according to an order from the Federal Environment Ministry Panel on Air Pollution. The Commission for Air Quality Management has also banned trucks carrying non-essential goods and stopped construction in Delhi and its neighbouring cities. In its latest order, the panel said there was a ""compelling"" need to ensure that air quality did not deteriorate any further. Pollution levels surged to ""severe"" levels this month, with the Air Quality Index in New Delhi going as high as 499 on a scale of 500, indicating healthy people were also at risk of developing respiratory illnesses. Delhi, among the world's most polluted capital cities, battles chronic winter smog every year as a drop in temperatures traps deadly pollutants from coal-fired plants outside the city, fumes from vehicles and the open burning of garbage. The Delhi government on Saturday said schools would be shut for a week, but the Commission for Air Quality Management has extended the closure indefinitely. The Commission also said at least 50 per cent of government employees should work from home until November 21. The measures follow a Supreme Court order earlier this week asking the commission to suggest measures to cut pollution. The court also rapped the federal and local area governments over their failure to mitigate pollution in the city of 20 million people, who endure toxic air almost every winter. India's efforts to reduce the burning of crop waste, a major source of air pollution during winter, have had little benefit, despite its expenditure of billions of rupees over the past four years. Hospitals in the capital reported a spike in the number of patients with respiratory ailments being admitted following the increased air pollution. Dr Bobby Bhalotra, the vice-chairman of the department of chest medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said along with patients with pre-existing respiratory conditions, they were seeing a number of post-COVID recovering patients. New Delhi's worsening smog has brought with it a surge in the concentration of fine particulate matter known as PM2.5, which is small enough to enter the blood stream when inhaled into the lungs.

290,"Massive NT water licence a step closer but groups, and the expert panel, remain concerned",environment,"  Fortune Agribusiness' NT water licence a step closer but groups, and the expert panel, remain concerned Environmental groups and traditional owners say they still hold grave concerns about the Northern Territory's largest groundwater licence, despite new conditions. Fortune Agribusiness has again been granted the right to extract 40,000 megalitres of water a year from Singleton Station in remote Central Australia. The staged licence was first approved in April, but in September underwent a formal review process overseen by a panel of independent groundwater experts. It was re-approved on Monday with new requirements, including a better understanding of the region's sacred sites. Lesley Turner from the Central Land Council said this was ""encouraging"" but said the CLC did not trust the NT government to protect sacred sites. ""[This is] paying lip service to Aboriginal people, its just not good enough,"" he said. The new conditions also included further study of the aquifer. Kirsty Howey from Environment Centre NT said both of the studies should have been done before the licence was approved. ""What we see here is an approach which they're calling adaptive management, but I would describe as a suck it and see approach,"" she said. The new licence was granted by Minister Kate Worden instead of Minister for Environment Eva Lawler. Ms Lawler said she excused herself because of a perceived conflict of interest over her extension of the licence from 10 years to 30 years. ""I didn't want to put at risk the Northern Territory government, so I stepped aside,"" Ms Lawler said. The expert panel found aspects of the project were ""problematic"" and it did not adequately manage ""risks"" or ""uncertainty"". The panel found not enough was known about the aquifer to say weather or not it was safe to extract the amount of water the project was proposing. ""These risks and uncertainties need to be better defined before there can be confidence in the decision to provide the volumes of water that the licence makes available to the proponent,"" the report said. The review panel did not recommend reducing the size of the licence, but did recommend further studies be carried out by Fortune Agribusiness. Ms Howey said it was ""concerning"" this work had not already been done by the government. The review panel also recommended the first stage of the project be increased from two years to five, to give authorities a better understanding of the aquifer. The first stage of the licence was increased from two years to three, instead of the recommended five. When questioned about this decision, Ms Lawler said she was unsure because it had not been her decision, it had been Ms Worden's. ""But there has been, it's not just this one project, this Singleton project, there has been extensive work around the water allocation for that area,"" she said. A groundwater extraction licence allowing the use of 40,000ML a year for free has traditional owners and environmental groups questioning the effectiveness of water laws. Ms Lawler said the formal review's findings that more work was needed showed ""the process works"". ""Obviously the water controller felt that work had been done, and that it was clear it was accurate,"" she said. ""And we listened to the review report. That work will then continue."" Ms Lawler said it gave her no reason to doubt the work of the water controller or her Department of Environment. ""I will back them in the work that they do, as I said they are exceptional people that have integrity."" Fortune Agribusiness declined to comment for this story.

291,Ancient assassin spider rises from the ashes on bushfire-ravaged Kangaroo Island,environment," Science Ancient assassin spider, feared extinct after fires, has been discovered on Kangaroo Island An ancient species of spider, feared extinct after devastating bushfires tore through Kangaroo Island in the summer of 2020, has been found alive. The assassin spider, also called the pelican spider (Zephyrarchaea austini), was only known to live in the Western River Regional Protection Area on Kangaroo Island. That area was razed in the massive bushfire that burnt through more than 200,000 hectares of bush and farmland across the island nearly 2 years ago. But two individuals — a female and a juvenile — have been found in a small patch of leaf litter, according to Jessica Marsh, an honorary research associate at the South Australian Museum. While the researchers are keeping the exact location under wraps, it was outside the previous known range of the spider on Kangaroo Island, Dr Marsh said. ""It was amazing! We'd been searching since the fires. [We] had just about given up hope. ""These spiders don't disperse far, so it's very unlikely they've moved there before the fires."" The discovery was made at the end of September, but the announcement was delayed until DNA testing could confirm it was the same species of assassin spider. The spider dates back to the Jurassic period, and is called an assassin for the way it hunts other spiders. It's considered to play a crucial role as a regulator of spiders within the food web. Given that the spider has been found outside its known range, Dr Marsh said her team would keep expanding their search, which has been funded by the Landcare Led Bushfire Recovery Grants Program. ""I'm not confident that we've got all of them,"" she said. ""I think there may be other pockets out there and we'll keep searching."" She said the focus at this stage would be on locating and protecting any more populations if they find them, but that they may consider intervening to assist in recovery, such as through captive breeding, down the track. As Flinders Chase National Park reopens for the first time since devastating bushfires destroyed about half of Kangaroo Island, photos show how much has been lost. The discovery of a juvenile is a promising sign that breeding has happened since the bushfires. But recovery of the species is still extremely tenuous. It's likely the population has gone through what is known as a genetic bottleneck. There will likely be far less genetic diversity between the remaining spiders than in the previous population, meaning if a new population is able to establish, it could be less resilient to stressors. And there are other challenges to its recovery, Dr Marsh said. ""There are several things that aren't on their side. ""Low dispersal is a key one. And the habitat they live in, it's going to take a long time for that habitat to regrow."" The spiders are habitat specialists, living in dense vegetation along creek lines. Where they have been discovered is in some very small remaining pockets of that habitat, Dr Marsh said. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. ""It shows us how important those little pockets are,"" she said. ""It give us hope but, it's also a warning sign."" Only about a third of invertebrate species in Australia have been described by science, according to Dr Marsh. Many may be threatened or have already gone extinct without us identifying them or understanding their ecosystem functions. ""There is a massive amount [of species] that are under threat,"" she said. ""We're not talking about extinction in isolation. When it's more species and more land lost, we may start to notice."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

292,'Saved by coal': Why India refuses to give up an ecosystem that gives life to millions,environment,"  Life on the ground in India shows why it's so hard for the world to quit coal after COP26 letdown Every night, Raju straps half a dozen sacks of coal pilfered from mines — weighing up to 200 kilograms — to the reinforced metal frame of his bike, and cycles 16 kilometres to traders who pay him less than $3. Thousands of others do the same. This has been Raju's life since he arrived in Dhanbad, an eastern Indian city in Jharkhand state, in 2016. Annual floods in his home region have destroyed most traditional farm jobs, so coal is all he has. This is what climate change conferences like the COP26 are up against. After pressure from India and China, the wording of the COP26's final deal was diluted to a pledge to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. The last-minute alteration left COP26 president Alok Sharma on the brink of tears. The Earth desperately needs people to stop burning coal, the biggest single source of greenhouse gases, to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change — including the intense flooding that has cost agricultural jobs in India. Coal remains the world's biggest source of fuel for electric power. So many, desperate like Raju, depend on it for their very lives. ""The poor have nothing but sorrow … but so many people, they've been saved by coal,"" Raju said. The developing world argues it should be allowed the ""carbon space"" to grow as developed nations have, by burning cheap fuels like coal, which is used in industrial processes such as steelmaking along with electric power generation. On average, the typical American uses 12 times more electricity than the typical Indian. And there are over 27 million people in India who don't have electricity at all. Power demand in India is expected to grow faster than anywhere in the world over the next two decades. And as its economy grows and ever more extreme heat increases, India's need for the air conditioning that so much the rest of the world takes for granted is also certain to increase. Meeting that demand will not fall to people like Raju, but to Coal India. It is already the world's largest miner, and aims to increase production to 1 billion tonnes a year by 2024. DD Ramanandan, the secretary at the Centre of Indian Trade Unions in Ranchi, said conversations about moving beyond coal were only taking place in Paris, Glasgow or New Delhi. He said they had hardly begun in India's coal belt. ""Coal has continued for 100 years. Workers believe it will continue to do so,"" Mr Ramanandan said. A 2021 Indian government study found that Jharkhand state -- among the poorest in India and the state with the nation's largest coal reserves -- is also the most vulnerable Indian state to climate change. But there are roughly 300,000 people working directly with government-owned coal mines, earning fixed salaries and benefits. There are nearly 4 million people in India whose livelihoods are directly or indirectly linked to coal, said Sandeep Pai, who studies energy security and climate change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. India's coal belt is dotted by industries that need the fuel, like steel and brick making. The Indian railways, the country's largest employers, earns half its revenue by transporting coal, allowing it to subsidise passenger travel. ""Coal is an ecosystem,"" Mr Pai said. For people like Naresh Chauhan, 50, and his wife Rina Devi, 45, India's economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic has intensified their dependence on coal. The two have lived in a village at the edge of the Jharia coalfield in Dhanbad all their lives. Accidental fires, some of which have been blazing for decades, have charred the ground and left it spongy. Smoke hisses from cracks in the surface near their hut. Fatal sinkholes are common. The couple earn $4 a day selling four baskets of scavenged coal to traders. Families who have lived amid coal mines for generations rarely own any land they can farm and have nowhere else to go. Naresh hopes that his son would learn to drive so that he, at least, could get away. But even that may not be enough. There's less work for the city's existing taxi drivers. Wedding parties, who in the past reserved cars to ferry guests, have shrunk. Fewer travellers come to the city than before. ""There is just coal, stone and fire. Nothing else here,"" Naresh said. Could Australia become a renewable superpower by 2030? You decide. That could mean even harder times for the people in Dhanbad as the world eventually does turn away from coal. Mr Pai says this is already happening as renewable energy gets cheaper and coal becomes less and less profitable. India and other countries with coal-dependent regions have to diversify their economies and retrain workers, he said. This is both to protect the livelihoods of workers and to help speed the transition away from coal by offering new opportunities. Otherwise, more will end up like Murti Devi. The 32-year-old single mother of four lost the job she had all her life when the mine she worked for closed four years ago. Nothing came of the resettlement plans promised by the coal company so she, like so many others, turned to scavenging coal. On good days, she'll make a dollar. On other days, she relies on neighbours for help. ""If there is coal, then we live. If there isn't any coal, then we don't live,"" she said.

293,"analysis: It may be incremental, but at least the COP26 climate pact mentions fossil fuels, unlike Paris",environment,"  COP26 has wrapped up in Glasgow. So was the climate summit a success? It was ""our last chance to avoid the worst effects of climate change"", according to COP26 president Alok Sharma and ""the most important international meeting of the century"", according to climate councillor Lesley Hughes. Some were so quick as to declare it a failure before it even started, but as the meeting got going, serious progress was made. So now that COP26 has wrapped, was it a success? Views from those involved vary widely, but here's what's clear: Not enough has been done to stop warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, or even the catastrophic 2C threshold. But more importantly, the world is moving faster to reduce emissions now than it was a couple of weeks ago. And those actions are now set to accelerate. So the big question is this: Did COP26 keep the chance of stopping warming at 1.5C alive? Before the Paris Agreement was signed, the world was on a trajectory to about 4C of warming by 2100. Such a world would be literally unlivable for billions of people around the world. It was a path towards planetary collapse. Through commitments made under the Paris Agreement, the world came to COP26 with 2030 commitments that would see the world warm by about 2.7C by the end of the century. Still catastrophic, but it was a pathway that bought us time to take stronger action. Could Australia become a renewable superpower by 2030? You decide. Through the COP26 process, 140 countries strengthened their 2030 targets, although Australia was not one of them. If nations come good on those commitments, then warming may only reach about 2.4C by the end of the century, according to leading analysts, Climate Analytics. Still not enough, but there are other reasons for optimism, and maybe even some relief. ""Glasgow has not closed the emissions gap in 2030, which is vital to keeping 1.5C alive, but it has set up an urgent process to address this gap, inviting countries to submit more ambitious national climate targets by the end of 2022,"" Bill Hare, senior scientist and chief executive at Climate Analytics, said. That ""urgent process"" is one of the most important outcomes of the meeting. Another piece of analysis during COP26 gave people around the world a rare shot of hope: Assuming nations' less concrete longer-term commitments, including Australia's net-zero by 2050 target and India's similar target for 2070, warming could peak at 1.9C and drop to about 1.8C at the end of the century, according to researchers at The University of Melbourne. ""We would have to do more in 2030 to limit warming to 1.5C,"" said the University of Melbourne's Malte Meinshausen, who led the research. But finally there's a projection that sees warming stay under 2C. However, that assumes a lot of work will be done to implement those long-term targets, which for some countries so far seem barely consistent with their plans for 2030. That won't happen without a lot more work on increasing and then implementing 2030 targets. So that's where one crucial aspect of the Glasgow Climate Pact comes to life. The Glasgow Climate Pact, agreed to by every nation including Australia, requests countries strengthen their 2030 targets to align with the 1.5C goal next year. ""There is now clearly a consensus that this is not something that can be left. That it's an urgent tissue,"" Howard Bamsey, who was previously Australia's chief climate negotiator, said. The pact also sets up working groups and work programs to drive ambition in those targets. There is no question now that there is global consensus to drive ambition forward this decade to keep 1.5C alive. ""It keeps the hope alive, which is the important thing,"" Professor Hughes from the Climate Council said. According to Kaveh Guilanpour, from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions in the US, the test of whether COP26 was a success will be how promises are turned into reality. ""We need to move from a conversation only about 'how much?' toward one that is also about 'how?'. COP26 has provided the political signal, building blocks, and the solutions to do just that,"" he said. International climate diplomacy is an incremental game. And some incremental gains here have many excited about what they will achieve in the coming years — possibly turning ""how much"" into ""how"". For the first time, this COP's decision singles out coal and fossil fuels. It might seem strange, but fossil fuels were not mentioned in the Paris Agreement. It calls for nations to both phase down unabated coal power, and ""inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"". The government has committed to reaching net zero by 2050, and says it is on track to beat its 2030 emissions targets. But what will it take to turn Australia green? ""Post-Glasgow, we can rid ourselves of the pretence that fossil fuels can be part of the solution to the climate crisis,"" said Richie Merzian, a former climate negotiator for Australia, now at The Australia Institute. Domestically, that has big implications, says Howard Bamsey, and will be the basis for stronger international agreements in coming years. ""You've got Australia agreeing to an outcome that uses the term 'phase down' of coal. It legitimises a discussion of that topic which has been taboo until now,"" he said. ""This will provide the groundwork for some progress on the Australian domestic scene which has been a total mess."" Media commentary has focused on the fact that this wording has been weakened from a draft of ""phase out"" to ""phase down"", but Mr Bamsey and Professor Hughes both said having either form of words in there is a big deal. ""Regardless of whether you say 'down' or 'out', moving beyond coal and removing fossil fuel subsidies … It's another part of the pact that puts considerable pressure on the Morrison government — on all politicians before the next election — that transitioning out of fossil fuels has to be part of any credible policy,"" Professor Hughes said. ""We all wanted more than that, but at least coal has been identified as the toxic substance that it is."" Outside the official negotiating stream at Glasgow, a range of strong and promising commitments were made, which could help make promises a reality. More than 100 countries, not including Australia, agreed to slash methane emissions. And 190 countries, again not including Australia, agreed to phase out coal power and end public funding. And more than 100 countries, including Australia, signed a pact to end deforestation. The last positive outcome, which many thought was unlikely to be achieved, was the so-called ""Paris rule book"" was finalised, paving the way for global emissions reductions through carbon trading. And according to early analysis, it looks like it has avoided the issue of ""double counting"", where countries can sell carbon credits as well as counting them as part of their own achievement. ""That's a very good outcome,"" Mr Bamsey said. The UK will see the meeting as a success, with COP26 clearly contributing to the fight to halt the climate crisis. But not everyone is so pleased. The developing world needs global emissions to be reined in, but they also need money to pay for their own reductions (called ""climate finance""), and they have demanded compensation for the damage they're seeing caused by climate change (called ""loss and damage""), which has been caused by rich nations. Children and young people in the Pacific have grown up in the shadow of climate change, watching rising sea levels swallow landscapes and waiting in fear for the next natural disaster to strike. There was progress made on climate finance, but the overdue goal of reaching US$100 billion a year by 2020 has still not been met. And little progress was made on loss and damage. ""COP26 will be remembered as a betrayal of global south countries — abandoned to the climate crisis with no money for the energy transition, adaptation or loss and damage,"" Sara Shaw from Friends of the Earth International said. Jagan Chapagain from the International Federation of Red Cross had a similar view. ""We are particularly disappointed that COP26 did not deliver the finance needed to support communities at the frontlines of the climate crisis,"" he said.

294,'Deeply sorry' COP26 president breaks down as action on coal is watered down in climate deal,environment,"  Nations reach climate deal at COP26 after compromise on coal Government negotiators from nearly 200 countries have adopted a new deal on climate action after a last-minute intervention by India and China to water down the language on cutting emissions from coal. The agreement, which came more than 24 hours after Friday afternoon's deadline, was sealed by COP26 president Alok Sharma banging down his gavel to signal there were no objections from the 197 nations attending the conference. The deal aims to keep alive hopes of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in order to prevent the effects of catastrophic climate change. Earlier, Mr Sharma broke down during proceedings and apologised after objections by India and China over the wording around the phasing out of fossil fuels forced a last-minute change to the text, drawing complaints from vulnerable nations wanting stronger action on fossil fuels. The change India and China proposed replaced the phrase ""phase out"" with ""phase down"". China and other coal-dependent nations including Nigeria, South Africa and Iran had supported the proposal to soften the language further. His voice breaking with emotion after hearing from nations which expressed their anger over the changes to the text, Mr Sharma said: ""May I just say to all delegates, I apologise for the way this process has unfolded and I am deeply sorry."" ""I also understand the deep disappointment but, I think as you have noted, it's also vital that we protect this package."" Several countries, including small island states, said they were deeply disappointed by the change put forward jointly by India and China. Nation after nation had complained earlier on the final day of the two weeks of talks about how the deal was not enough, but they said it was better than nothing and provided incremental progress, if not success. Negotiators from Switzerland and Mexico said the change to the language about coal was against the rules because it came so late. However, they said they had no choice but to hold their noses and go along with it. Could Australia become a renewable superpower by 2030? You decide. Swiss Environment Minister Simonetta Sommaruga said the change would make it harder to achieve the international goal to limit warming to 1.5C. The COP26 agreement in effect acknowledged that commitments made so far to cut emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases were nowhere near enough, and asked nations to set tougher climate pledges next year, rather than every five years, as they are currently required to do. ""I think today we can say with credibility that we've kept 1.5C [warming] within reach,"" Mr Sharma said. ""But its pulse is weak, and we will only survive if we keep our promises."" Scientists say that to go beyond a rise of 1.5C would unleash extreme sea level rises and catastrophes including crippling droughts, storms and fires far worse than those the world has already suffered. But national pledges made so far to cut greenhouse emissions — mostly carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and gas — would only cap the average global temperature rise at 2.4C. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was still a ""huge amount"" of work to do over the next few years. ""But today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,"" he said. ""I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change, and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal."" Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, was optimistic about the deal. ""They changed a word but they can’t change the signal coming out of this COP, that the era of coal is ending,"" she said. ""If you’re a coal company executive, this COP saw a bad outcome."" Another sticking point had been the issue of climate financing, with developing countries arguing that rich nations, whose historical emissions are largely responsible for heating up the planet, must pay more to help them adapt to its consequences as well as reduce their carbon footprints. Children and young people in the Pacific have grown up in the shadow of climate change, watching rising sea levels swallow landscapes and waiting in fear for the next natural disaster to strike. The deal, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact, gave the poorest nations more promises, but no guarantees, that they would finally get more of the financial help they have long been told they would get. It urged rich countries to double funding for climate adaptation by 2025 from 2019 levels, offering money that had been a key demand of small island nations at the conference. Adaptation funds primarily go to the very poorest countries and currently take up only a small fraction of climate funding. A UN committee will also report next year on progress towards delivering the $US100 billion ($136.42 billion) per year in overall annual climate funding that rich nations had promised by 2020 but failed to deliver. And governments will be summoned to meet in 2022, 2024 and 2026 to discuss climate finance. Yet even $US100 billion a year is far short of poorer countries' actual needs, which could hit US$300 billion by 2030 in adaptation costs alone, according to the United Nations, in addition to economic losses from crop failure or climate-related disasters. Earlier on Saturday Australia's ambassador for the environment at the summit, Jamie Isbister, said Australia accepted the text and called on other countries to ""come together to deliver a successful outcome from COP26"". The government has committed to reaching net zero by 2050, and says it is on track to beat its 2030 emissions targets. But what will it take to turn Australia green? He said Australia had recognised the strong focus on climate finance and said it had committed to doubling its commitment to help reach the US$100 billion goal. ""We've also heard the call for loss and damage and acknowledging how we need to tangibly look at how we can deliver a greater focus on loss and damage, and how we particularly support national and regional efforts to address this,"" Mr Isbister said. ""Australia looks forward to the finalisation of the proceedings today and leaving here, as other colleagues have said across the Pacific, that we deliver on what we've come to do."" Australia committed to net zero emissions by 2050 coming into COP26, but its formal target of reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 remained the same as when it was set in Paris in 2015 when Tony Abbott was prime minister. The commitment falls below other major developed countries like the UK and the United States, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been pressed by Pacific Island leaders to do more as their nations face immediate threats from global warming. The head of the Climate Council, Simon Bradshaw, said Australia had cemented its reputation as a climate laggard at the conference and let down its Pacific neighbours. ""As our allies and trading partners rise to the climate challenge, we’re stuck in a polluting past with a handful of countries including Russia and Saudi Arabia,"" he said in a statement. ""The Government’s own Net Zero modelling, released two days ago, predicts Australia will still be a major coal and gas exporter in 2050. ""The Glasgow Climate Pact has made it very clear that our government must come back to the table next year with a stronger 2030 target. It’s time to slash carbon pollution this decade, as if our futures depended on it – because they do.""

295,The world's greatest rainforest could lose its rainfall and become a savannah,environment," Science Amazon deforestation is stopping forest from recycling rainwater, which affects temperatures For 55 million years, heavy rain has brought life and splendour to the Amazon rainforest. But a rapid increase in deforestation is threatening the very water systems that make the forest …  well, a rainforest. The destruction of the Amazon threatens water security, both in the rainforest itself, and further south in more temperate climes. In the week leading up to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Brazil surprised many observers by joining an international pledge to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Despite South America's dependence on the rainforest for water, there was a 34 per cent increase in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon in 2019, compared to 2018 when an estimated 10,129 square kilometres was clear cut. Clear-cutting continued to rise last year, when an estimated 11,088 square km of rainforest in Brazil was lost. Forests make clouds, which in turn create rain, explains Amazon expert Bill Laurance of James Cook University. The Amazon rainforest is large enough to cover about three quarters of the Australian mainland and Professor Laurance says its sheer size allows it to have a profound impact on the world's weather. The dark forest absorbs energy from the sun and becomes a giant ""heat and water engine"", Professor Laurance says. ""Hot, moist air moves high up into the stratosphere, and then that moist air goes poleward until it gets to the middle latitudes."" Much of the rain falling in southern parts of Brazil and South America, including Brazil's most populous city São Paulo, begins its journey in the Amazon. When it rains, trees capture the water with their roots. During photosynthesis, this water is moved up the plant and released into the air via pores on the leaves. This process is called ""evapotranspiration"". Each tree in the forest behaves like a giant fountain, moving large amounts of water from the soil to the air. You can see this in action when a forest appears to steam, and clouds rise from the canopy. There are billions of trees in the Amazon, and each one is pouring water into the air, creating clouds that eventually fall again as rain. As thick plumes of smoke blanketed Brazil's most populous city, global attention turned to the Amazon rainforest. The rainforest's water originally evaporates off the Atlantic Ocean; much of this water is kept in the system by the trees recycling it. ""On average a drop of water gets sucked up six times as it travels across South America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Andes,"" Professor Laurance says. Deforestation stops this cycling in its tracks. Extensive deforestation in the tropics can reduce rainfall in a region by up 40 per cent. In Brazil, the rainforest is being replaced by soy fields and cattle pastures. These landscapes do not cycle water like rainforests. Fields are less complex, with fewer plants and a lower biomass. This means there are not so many leaves pumping water back into the air, Professor Laurance explains. ""If you imagine a rainforest, then imagine measuring every single leaf [in that rainforest] and then compare that measurement to the leaves on a cattle pasture. It's just a tiny fraction."" If deforestation continues, the Amazon will reach a tipping point whereby the rainforest will not be able to produce enough rain to keep itself alive and it will become a savannah, Professor Laurance warns. In 2018, researchers published a cautionary letter in Science Advances, writing that with the combined effect of deforestation, fire, and climate change, it may only take 20 to 25 per cent deforestation to transform the east, southern and central Amazon rainforest into savannah. We are edging close to this tipping point. In 2019, the World Wildlife Fund reported that 17 per cent of the Amazon had been deforested in the past 50 years. Deforestation also reduces rainfall in Australia, according to Clive McAlpine from the University of Queensland. Historical clearing has caused local climates to increase by up to 2 degrees Celsius, Professor McAlpine says. This has been paired with declines in rainfall of up to 15 to 20 per cent. ""We are losing that cycling function of our deep-rooted trees,"" he says. Not all the water pumped into the air by Amazonian trees falls back on the rainforest. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. A percentage of the water is carried away and falls in temperate regions south of the rainforest, explains Philip Fearnside, a biologist at Brazil's National Institute of Amazonian Research. ""A tremendous amount of water is transported by these so-called flying rivers and winds that circle around through the Amazon and go [south] towards São Paulo,"" Professor Fearnside says. ""During the rainy season in São Paulo, [about] 70 per cent of the water is coming from the Amazon, and that's when you need to fill the reservoirs. ""The city of São Paulo has come close to running out of water several times, and that's without destroying the Amazon rainforest, which makes it much more likely you'd have a major catastrophe."" Professors Fearnside and Laurance are among the many researchers and commentators who lay the blame for Brazil's recent spike in deforestation at the feet of President Jair Bolsonaro, who came to power in Brazil in 2018. ""Bolsonaro has been pushing for new roads into the Amazon, which always create a Pandora's box ranging from deforestation, poaching, illegal mining, illegal logging, illegal land colonisation, a lot of illegal burning for charcoal, other things,"" Professor Laurance says. Professor Fearnside adds: ""You have a projection that São Paolo is going to be out of water; that's a very drastic thing. ""It's much more convenient to just deny it. ""The reflex to deny a major catastrophe is very attractive."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

296,'Plant for pollinators': Gardeners urged to help battling native Australian bees,environment,"  Gardeners urged to plant natives in bid to help battling native Australian bees We all see black-and-yellow European honey bees buzzing around from time to time. But would you recognise a native Australian bee, if you saw one? To date, 1,700 Australian bee species have been identified and named, with estimates that the true figure is closer to 2,000. Rather than living in hives, most native bees are ground dwelling. Some, such as blue-banded bees and teddy bear bees, dig shallow burrows in clay soil, while others dig burrows over a metre deep. Bee expert Dr Ken Walker says protecting native bees is about continuing an essential ""love story"" necessary to help native flora thrive. ""If you were to lose a significant part of that native fauna such as bees, then suddenly there would be the knock-on effect of the number of plants that would reduce enormously,"" he says. Some of the major factors threatening native bees are habitat loss from agriculture and urban environments, bushfires, pesticide use and climate change. Dr Walker says bees mostly lose food sources and places to nest because gardeners usually plant ""exotic"" plant species in their backyards. With the bee focus on European bees and their contribution to the honey industry and their role in pollinating economically important crops, advocates are worried native species are being left behind. The federal government currently has three bee species listed as critically endangered; all native. The recent Global Change Biodiversity report also found at least 11 species of bees met the criteria to be listed as threatened following the Black Summer bushfires. Dr Walker says the extent to which native bees are declining is unknown in Australia due to limited historical research. ""One of the ways that you can estimate the current condition of any native fauna is to know how it was in the past and what it's like now,"" he says. ""But there has never been a complete survey done of native Australian bees from the past."" Simon Mulvany, bee activist and founder of Save The Bees, says advocating to protect native bees can be difficult because a lot of people do not understand the important role they play. ""We get a lot back from honey bees that's sort of tangible. We get the honey and we can measure how many hives we have to pollinate,"" Mr Mulvany says. ""You haven't got that with the native bees and so a lot of people don't notice them."" Mr Mulvany started his organisation in 2014 to raise awareness of native bee conservation in Australia. Since then he has seen the conversation around native bees grow with most beekeepers taking action. ""But there is still lots we can do,"" he says. Solutions to saving bees have been growing rapidly in recent years. Urban bee farming has been a growing trend, while organisations across the country have turned to educating farmers on better practices to support bees. But advocacy charity, The Wheen Bee Foundation says making a difference could be as simple as planting the right garden flowers. The charity launched its ""Bee Friendly Gardening"" program off the back of its Bee Friendly Farming. ""What we're asking people to do now is plant pollinator-friendly species, bee-friendly species of plants,"" CEO Fiona Chambers says. The program has a particular focus on encouraging people to plant native species and plants that flower annually rather than seasonally. ""Just having a little bit of planning around what to plant around the garden can really make a huge difference to supporting an increased number and diversity of native pollinators,"" Ms Chambers says. Ballarat local and Wheen Bee Foundation ambassador Amanda Collins says she can not wait to see native Australian bees in her home garden. Like many people she sees a regular influx of honey bees, especially with her own backyard beehives and ""exotic"" plants and flowers. But she says native bees are the ones needing more support. ""Being passionate about bees and beekeeping, you kind of become attuned to what the latest information and evidence is around being bee-friendly,"" Ms Collins says. ""For us, it's been about extending some of the gardens we have to include native flora."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Ballarat's weekly email newsletter. Ms Collins holds the title of a Bee Friendly Gardener at Ballarat in Victoria's south-west. She says the right plants in her region could attract blue-banded bees, cuckoo bees or leafcutter bees. ""It really is about creating that habitat, creating some space for Australian native bees, making sure you're planting Australian native plants,"" Ms Collins says. ""If you don't want to be a beekeeper that's totally fine, you can be a bee friend.""

297,Decades-old debate takes a new turn following fatal shark attack at metropolitan Perth beach,environment,"  Familiar debate unfolds following fatal shark attack at Fremantle's Port Beach In the days after Paul Millachip was taken by a shark off Fremantle's Port Beach last weekend, a familiar routine played out. ""Have you got any strong feelings about possible shark mitigation at all?,"" one journalist asked Mr Millachip's widow on Sunday, the day after he disappeared. It seemed the public discussion around the 57-year-old father's death would head down the well-trodden path of drum lines and shark culls. But a press conference on Monday took things in a different direction when Fisheries Minister Don Punch said the WA Government was looking to install more shark enclosures. ""That's part of our $17 million shark hazard mitigation program, and we've set aside funding for shark enclosures,"" Mr Punch said. Local councils are encouraged to apply for funding for an enclosure, which are delivered in partnership with the government, he said. Yet WA only has a handful of enclosures dotted across the state. Quinns, Coogee and Cottesloe beaches are the only locations with enclosures in Perth. In the South West, only Dunsborough and Busselton beaches are protected. Esperance will also have its own barrier soon, bringing the state's total to seven. Mr Punch said the government was working with the City of Albany to upgrade its enclosure at Middleton Beach. So why, in a beach-loving state like WA, do so few beaches have that kind of protection for swimmers? One of the most obvious reasons is that enclosures do not work for every beach. Coogee Beach is one example of a spot where they do work, after the City of Cockburn went its own way and installed one without government funding in 2014. ""In terms of the swimming and recreational activities people do at Coogee Beach, it's well suited to that in terms of swimming and small paddle sports and stuff like that,"" the City's marina and coastal engineering officer, Jon McKay, said. ""I imagine it's probably less suitable for surfing and activities like that, that need wide, open expanses of water, and also I know it's more challenging to implement in more exposed, open ocean locations,"" he said. Mr Punch said he is not sure why more local governments have not taken up the government's offer. ""I'm absolutely available for any local government that wants to look at beach mitigation and to work with them in terms of shark mitigation and beach mitigation issues,"" he said. Cockburn's barrier costs the city around $90,000 each year to lease. Asked whether other locations had been deterred by the cost, Mr Punch said: ""No council has raised that with me"". One swimmer at Port Beach on Monday told the ABC he was concerned about animals getting stuck in the net. While that might have been the case for older-style enclosures, Mr McKay said Cockburn had not experienced any similar issues with barriers installed by local company Eco Shark Barrier. ""That was a key consideration for the city in initially installing the barrier,"" he said. ""We have had instances where fish or seals or dolphins have made their way into the barrier, usually during winter if there's been some storm damage. ""On those occasions, either the animal's swum out itself, or Eco Shark Barriers themselves will come down and let down one section of the barrier and the animal will swim out again. ""We're not aware of any adverse impacts to wildlife or any losses."" Mr McKay said the barrier had also helped bring more people to the beach by giving swimmers ""peace of mind"". ""I know that people do travel from far afield within the metro area to swim at Coogee beach because of the shark barrier,"" he said. Even more controversial though is other kinds of mitigation strategies open to authorities, like drum lines. In the wake of the attack that claimed Mr Millachip's life, a number of Port Beach regulars stridently opposed any measure that could harm sea life. ""If you don't like the sharks, don't go in the ocean, go in the pool,"" one swimmer said. ""That's their habitat, the ocean. We're going into their area, so there's no way they should be culled,"" said another. University of Wollongong human geographer Leah Gibbs has researched the attitudes of ocean users on different strategies to manage sharks, both in the eastern states and in WA. She said like any diverse group, there are a range of views, although one perspective stood out. ""A lot of people felt that they respected the ocean, and they were not particularly keen on management strategies that would potentially harm sharks, even if those sharks may occasionally present some kind of threat to their safety,"" Dr Gibbs said. ""People who use the ocean or have a strong relationship with the ocean, they respect that space. They recognise that space has a complex ecosystem and sharks are part of that ecosystem. ""If we take those creatures out, then that has implications for a place that they love, a place that they value, that they have a strong connection with."" But Dr Gibbs said the perspectives of people across the board, not just ocean-goers, have also been changing. ""In the past, it's been viewed that it's one or the other — you're either for the sharks or for the people,"" she said. ""But I think that increasingly, people are seeing and people are feeling that you can actually care for both people and sharks."" She said that is increasingly being facilitated by new technologies, including the ability for drones to provide increased aerial surveillance. Greg Pickering knows first-hand the risk he takes every time he goes in the water, having survived two shark attacks. In 2004 he was spearfishing off Cervantes when a bronze whaler bit his lower leg. Then, in 2013, he received deep lacerations to his head, face, shoulder and back while diving for abalone along WA's southern coast. Mr Pickering said trying to manage the safety of swimmers and the protection of sharks was a difficult balance. ""What can you do? There's a lot of coastline, a lot of places people go swimming,"" he said. ""I think all they can do is just set aside areas with protected nets. Other than that, you're on your own, you're taking a risk. ""They can put helicopters in the sky, they can have all sorts of shark tagging programs and receivers everywhere, but you still never cover everything. There's always a chance of it happening."" Having spent the last 50 years diving off the WA coast, Mr Pickering said he had been seeing more sharks off the coast in the last 10 or 15 years. He said some effort needed to be made to manage shark populations. ""There probably needs to be a discussion held about how you could do that,"" Mr Pickering said. ""They're not getting caught in the area, so the numbers are going to gradually build up. But he admitted even that wasn't going to remove all risk. ""I haven't got a solution to the problem,"" he said. ""If you're going to dive, you're going to have to take the risk and take precautions as best you can. ""It's something I've got to do all the time when I dive, but it does worry me that it's probably going to happen again.""

298,Nanocrystal glitter keeps the sparkles without the polluting plastics,environment," Science Scientists create new type of eco-glitter made from biodegradable, sustainable materials Glitter is used everywhere from kids' craft projects to cosmetics, but beneath its shiny surface is a dark side. Beyond being annoying like a party guest that refuses to go home, these tiny sparkles are traditionally made of plastic and contribute to pollution. As a result, scientists have called for it to be banned, and it's no longer used by organisations such as the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. But there may be an alternative in the future with the creation of a new nanomaterial inspired by nature. A team of researchers from the University of Cambridge has found a way to turn tiny crystals of plant fibre known as cellulose into glitter on a commercial scale, they report in the journal Nature Materials. ""The advantage of what we have is it is 100 per cent made of [natural] cellulose,"" said Silvia Vignolini, the study's senior author. There are already a number of ""eco glitters"" on the market, but while they can contain some cellulose, they are not fully biodegradable, Professor Vignolini said. Last year, another research group from the UK found that both conventional and alternative glitters currently on the market can have ecological impacts on freshwater environments. ""The other eco-glitter you find contains a small metallic layer and then they can have another polymer that can be cellulose that contains pigments inside,"" she said. The metallic layer in these products, which acts like a mirror to give the pigment its shine, may be made out of aluminium. Pigments may contain layers of the mineral mica, which is often mined in developing countries, and titanium dioxide, which is banned in Europe and under review in Australia for use in food products in the wake of health concerns. Most things around us are coloured using pigments, which reflect different wavelengths of light in a scattered way so they don't shine. The new material is made out of nanocrystals sourced from cotton or wood that are configured to focus light in a particular direction, in a process known as structural colour. ""So when you look in one direction you observe one colour, but then if you shift direction the colour changes like in the feathers of a peacock,"" Professor Vignolini explained. To achieve this effect, the team of researchers led by Benjamin Droguet added water, salt and another type of soluble cellulose to the tiny particles to help them stick together, and make them reflect different wavelengths of light. The mix of wet pulp was rolled out into a thin film that was dried out. ""When you evaporate the water, the particles have less volume so they are forced to interact with each other and form the structure [and the colour],"" Professor Vignolini said. The film was then heated up again and crunched down to make glitter, which held its colour for a year without fading or dissolving when it was added again to a liquid such as a drink. Professor Vignolini said their final glitter product still needed to undergo testing for its biodegradability and toxicity. ""We haven't done [testing] yet on the glitter, but it has been done on the cellulose nanocrystal [and] it seems it is biodegradable, it's not toxic and it ticks all the boxes,"" she said. Jennifer Lavers, a marine ecotoxicologist at the University of Tasmania, says it's encouraging that people have started talking about the harm glitter does and are thinking about alternatives. But, she says, the study from last year shows we need more research to understand how glitter products affect the environment. ""I think we need to be careful as scientists, that really anything we are putting into habitats in the environment, whether it's cellulose and fully biodegradable or otherwise, it could be detrimental for some species,"" Dr Lavers said. ""Literally anything can become a pollutant; even too much fresh water in a marine ecosystem."" The concept of whether something is biodegradable can also be a grey area. ""It's unclear under what conditions something can be biodegradable. Does it need certain bacteria, does it need extreme heat, what does it biodegrade into? ""Often products labelled as biodegradable actually require very specific conditions to meet the criteria of biodegradability, and those criteria are not going to be met in the stomach of a mussel or a clam or a seabird or a fish."" Nasim Amiralian of the University of Queensland works with a different team creating biodegradable and sustainable medical textiles and packaging out of cellulose fibre from grasses. She says while some types of plant-based materials such as polylactic acid sourced from corn starch or sugar cane are not biodegradable in marine environments, the type used in the new study is. ""The material Silvia is using is basically paper. You can degrade paper in home composting,"" Dr Amiralian said. But the time it takes for the end product to degrade may change when nanoparticles are modified. ""If you compare it to a leaf, a leaf is going to degrade faster than these materials,"" she said. But no special treatment was needed to break them down into water and carbon dioxide, she said. While the team had previously achieved this effect in small quantities in the lab, this was the first time they had created large strips of material. ""The beauty of this work is that they are using already established processing that's been available for different industries,"" Dr Amiralian said. But it's still got a way to go before we see it on our shelves. The team hope to create a company and look at how to produce larger volumes of the material. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. They are also investigating questions around the possibility of using renewable sources of cellulose to make the product sustainable, Professor Vignolini said. ""If you want to replace all of the pigment that is existing on the planet with this technology, how much [cellulose] would you need? Can you harvest it in a way without destroying the environment?"" While the experiment focused on producing glitter, Professor Vignolini hoped the process could one day be used more broadly to make environmentally friendly pigments used in everyday products such as paints. ""Sometimes I feel bad because I want to do something that has a good impact and I think there are better ways to save the planet than make more sustainable glitter,"" she said. ""But pigment is so embedded in our communication — if you can produce it in a more sustainable way that is not impacting the environment, I don't see it as a waste of resources.""

299,"analysis: Morrison coined a new slogan this week, but does it have a future?",environment,"  Scott Morrison has a bingle or two on campaign trail with his electric vehicle rollout It seemed remarkable chutzpah that Scott Morrison, back from Glasgow where Australia remains a criticised laggard despite its embrace of a 2050 target, would hit the trail to campaign on climate policy. Alternatively, as some suggest, perhaps the Prime Minister just wanted to tick that box early, before moving onto more congenial issues. Either way, it didn't turn out well. His policy to promote electric cars, which contained minimal substance, backfired. And he wedged himself with a too-smart-by-half attempt to wedge Labor on carbon capture and storage. Morrison surely must have seen the dangers of exposing himself on electric cars, after all he'd said in denouncing Bill Shorten's policy in 2019. The quotes from then were grenades for the throwing. Shorten wanted to end the Aussie weekend, Morrison declared; such a vehicle ""won't tow your trailer. It's not going to tow your boat. It's not going to get you out to your favourite camping spot with your family"". The Prime Minister said an electric vehicle won't tow a trailer and is not going to tow a boat. Is he correct? RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates. How did Morrison believe he could execute a turnaround in the harsh political spotlight without being called to account? Especially when his political honesty is under the most intense questioning. Sean Kelly, columnist and former staffer for Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, writes in his just-published The Game: A Portrait of Scott Morrison, that the PM, ""never feels, in himself, insincere or untruthful, because he always means exactly what he says; it is just that he means it only in the moment he is saying it. Past and future disappear."" Unfortunately for Morrison, the electronic clips don't disappear. Those on electric cars were there to be played again and again. Morrison himself explained his about-face by claiming it was a ""Labor lie"" that he had campaigned against EVs in 2019. ""I didn't. […] I was against Bill Shorten's mandate policy, trying to tell people what to do with their lives, what cars they were supposed to drive and where they could drive."" There was another problem with Morrison's decision to climb into a hydrogen-fuelled car during his first visit to Melbourne in a very long time. His policy — $178 million for charging and refuelling infrastructure and the like — lacked substance. It had no subsidies, with the government claiming they would not be a good use of taxpayers' money. Within hours of the announcement, a devastating critique of the policy came from his own side of politics, delivered by NSW Environment Minister Matt Kean. Surveys show Australians want to buy electric vehicles, but they continue to languish at less than 1 per cent of new car sales. What's going on? Speaking to ABC 7.30, Kean contrasted Morrison's weak policy with NSW's robust approach and spelled out how Morrison should be acting. ""I would encourage the federal government to be looking at doing things like providing direct support for people who want to purchase an EV. There are a range of taxes and charges that could be waived,"" Kean said. ""We want to see things like the federal government investing more heavily in electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The funding that they've put on the table doesn't even match the funding that we've put here just for the state of New South Wales. ""But the biggest thing the federal government can do is deal with the issue of fuel standards. Australia has some of the worst fuel standards anywhere in the world"", which meant it ""is becoming the dumping ground for the vehicles the rest of the world doesn't want"". The NSW government is forward-leaning on climate issues, and Kean and Morrison have some interesting history. The PM sledged him spectacularly last year after Kean said ""some of the most senior members"" of the Morrison government were concerned about its climate change policies. In one of those ""in the moment"" prime ministerial statements, Morrison responded that Kean ""doesn't know what he's talking about"" and declared ""most of the federal cabinet wouldn't even know who Matt Kean was"". They certainly know now. Kean is Treasurer as well as Environment Minister in the Perrottet government, and that government is willing to chivvy the Feds when it feels like it. In another climate announcement this week, Morrison said the government would contribute $500 million for a new $1 billion fund, administered by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, to help small companies commercialise low-emissions technology. The legislation will contain a provision widening the remit of the CEFC to allow it to invest in carbon capture and storage, which it is banned from doing at present. Labor has consistently opposed such a widening, so the government briefed that this would put pressure on the opposition. But Labor took one look at the trap and seems determined to avoid it. It indicated it might support the change, given the $500 million would be ""new money"" for the CEFC rather than a redirection of existing funds. In the meantime, a couple of renegade Queensland Coalition senators, Matt Canavan and Gerard Rennick, flagged they'd vote against the fund. The Prime Minister is no longer comparing electric vehicles with a war on the weekend. This isn't a climate conversion but an awakening to a changing political landscape, writes political correspondent Brett Worthington. More generally, Morrison this week sharpened the Coalition-Labor contrast he has set up on climate policy, between a government that encourages and supports and an opposition that would regulate and tax. He encapsulated his desired dichotomy by saying that ""we believe climate change will ultimately be solved by ‘can do' capitalism, not ‘don't do' governments seeking to control people's lives and tell them what to do, with interventionist regulation and taxes that just force up your cost of living and force businesses to close"". Indeed, he seeks to use the contrast broadly. ""I think that's a good motto for us to follow not just in this area, but right across the spectrum of economic policy in this country,"" he told a business audience. ""We've got a bit used to governments telling us what to do over the last couple of years. I think we have to break that habit."" This reverts to Liberal Party ""free enterprise"" ideology, which has had to take a battering in the pandemic as the government spent wildly to keep things afloat. It also taps into the post-lockdown sentiment of those exhausted by restrictions and orders and welcoming ""freedom"" again. But in terms of climate policy, the reality is far from so simple. The point has been made many times that ""taxes"" — taxpayers' money — are financing the multiple billions the Morrison government has committed to encouraging ""capitalist"" solutions. While expounding ""can-do capitalism"", the government is in fact pursuing an interventionist approach by putting all its eggs in the technology-support basket and not enough in the market-creation one. ""Scotty from Marketing"" likes slogans, but ""can-do capitalism"" doesn't ring like one with a future. ""Capitalism"" works as an economic system (with more than a little help from governments), but it is beyond clunky as part of a sound bite.

300,'Every step matters right now': China and US make surprise climate change promise,environment,"  China and US vow to tackle climate change in joint statement at COP26 Glasgow talks The world's two biggest carbon-polluting countries, China and the United States, have agreed to work together to redouble efforts to fight climate change. In a surprise joint statement issued at the COP26 climate talks in Scotland, the two countries said the deal called for ""enhanced climate action in the 2020s"" using the 2015 Paris climate deal's guidelines, including a new stronger emission cuts target in 2025. The announcement from the geopolitical rivals adds further weight to a draft agreement released as the talks near their end, and could put further pressure on Australia to boost its commitments. The agreement vows to ramp up cooperation tackling climate change, including by cutting methane emissions, phasing out coal consumption and protecting forests. Australia snubs one of the key global actions to come out of the UN climate change conference by bowing out of an international pledge to reduce methane emissions. ""Both sides recognise that there is a gap between the current effort and the Paris agreement,"" China's chief negotiator Xie Zhenhua said. ""So we will jointly strengthen climate action and cooperation with respect to our respective national situations."" The Glasgow talks are seen as one of the world's last opportunities to halt global warming at between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius on pre-industrial levels. The world is currently on track to hit 2.7 C of warming by 2100, UN analysis released before the Glasgow summit said. The effects of such warming would be catastrophic for the planet, with many of the effects already being felt. ""We both see that the challenge of climate change is an existential and severe one,'' Mr Xie said. ""We will take our due responsibilities and work together.'' US climate envoy John Kerry said the agreement was a statement of support for a successful climate summit, with both countries taking a step towards closing the emissions gap. ""Together we set out our support for a successful COP26, including certain elements which will promote ambition, but let me be clear: this declaration is a step we can build on in order to close the gap,"" Mr Kerry said. ""Every step matters right now and we have a long journey ahead of us. ""So we have to mitigate faster, we have to cut methane emissions faster, we have to continue to raise ambition and most of all we have to take action in order to keep 1.5 degrees ... alive."" Could Australia become a renewable superpower by 2030? You decide. The first draft of the COP26 agreement released by host nation the United Kingdom urges parties to ""revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions"". For the first time in COP talks, the draft agreement makes explicit reference to fossil fuels, urging countries to speed up efforts to stop burning coal and phase out fossil fuel subsidies. After protracted negotiations within the Coalition, Australia committed to net zero by 2050 before going to the summit. But its formal target of reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 remained the same as when it was set in Paris in 2015, when Tony Abbott was prime minister. Australia's contributions at the major Glasgow talks have been labelled ""disappointing"" by a top UK advisor, and the country has been called a ""pariah"" by climate justice lawyers. It is one of 19 countries which overnight signed a joint agreement to establish ""green shipping corridors"" with zero emissions by 2050. Negotiations on the finalised agreement are expected to be fierce before the talks draw to an end on Friday.

301,"As townhouses go up and our suburbs become more dense, 'thermal inequality' is emerging",environment,"  As backyards get smaller and trees are removed, urban heat islands could be making suburbs hotter Flanked by two looming townhouses, Jyoti Dhakal's suburban bungalow might look out of place. The engineering consultant moved to Clayton in south-east Melbourne in 2013, with her husband and two young children. Back then, she said the neighbourhood felt like a typical Melbourne suburb, dominated by family homes and single-storey units. But things have quickly changed. ""Ever since we moved here, the prices have gone up,"" Ms Dhakal said, adding increased demand has led to older houses being demolished to make way for new townhouses. Clayton is set to become a ""mini-CBD"" to cope with a booming population, and rapid development is underway to cater to these new residents. Monash City Council has rezoned residential areas to ""facilitate apartment-style development"", particularly targeting students from the nearby Monash University campus. There are currently no controls in Clayton to regulate the removal of trees on private land, and some residents are noticing gardens being eaten up by this demand for higher-density housing. ""You see more of concrete buildings, [so] obviously there is … bound to be less vegetation,"" Ms Dhakal said. ""It is a bummer."" Council policies aim to protect vegetation and ensure developers maintain green spaces, but in the area surrounding a new train station and skyrail, Ms Dhakal has noticed a particular difference. ""It is hotter because you have that concrete built over there,"" she said. It's a familiar sight across many Australian suburbs. Demand for housing has led to a rise in subdivisions, and a loss of yard space and the trees they contain. Block sizes for new houses across Australian cities have plummeted by 22 per cent — to an average of 467 square metres — in the past 15 years, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In Melbourne alone, about 240,000 new lots — including houses and units — have been created since 2015 as a result of subdivision. And while the size of land is shrinking, house sizes have remained the same, according to the ABS — meaning more Australians are building big houses with smaller yards. That combination is leading to a dramatic loss of residential trees and vegetation. Gregory Moore, a senior research associate at the University of Melbourne, has been studying Australia's declining urban canopies. ""In most Australian cities, the density of the canopy cover is diminishing at various rates,"" Dr Moore said. ""Nearly all of the change is happening on privately-owned land … and most of it is the redevelopment of large blocks into smaller blocks or into townhouse developments."" The trend is exacerbating an urban heat island effect, where hard surfaces like concrete and steel absorb and then release heat. Trees and the shade they provide can help reduce the impact, but stripping away that canopy accelerates the effect. It can make our cities 4–10 degrees Celsius hotter than surrounding rural areas, according to research from RMIT's Sustainability and Urban planning program. Associate professor Joe Hurley and his RMIT colleagues have mapped vegetation loss in a number of Australian cities. They found several outer suburbs in Melbourne and Sydney were most vulnerable to the heat island effect. ""Areas like the western suburbs of Sydney and the western suburbs of Melbourne, where we see lower socio-demographic factors, we also see lower vegetation and higher susceptibility to heat,"" Dr Hurley said. Melbourne's south-east, where Clayton is located, might look leafy and green from above, but Dr Hurley's team found vegetation cover between 2014 and 2018 decreased by about 1 per cent. That equates to 131 hectares, or more than 60 MCG stadiums. Other nearby areas have been more affected, with outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne losing more than 2 per cent of their tree canopies in the same period. A tree canopy cover of around 20 per cent is ideal, Dr Hurley said, but Clayton and its surrounding suburbs currently have a vegetation cover of around half that. Dr Hurley said the loss of this tree canopy was leading to higher temperatures, and could have dire consequences. ""Cities like Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane have considerable deaths that have been attributed to heat waves in our cities, exacerbated by the urban heat island effect,"" he said. It's not just Melburnians feeling the burn. In Western Sydney, demand for housing and the rise of subdivisions have similarly shrunk urban forests, and made communities less heat tolerant. Temperatures here can get up to 10C hotter than suburbs closer to the coast. Anoop Sud lives in Stanhope Gardens in Western Sydney, and has seen it rapidly develop over the past 11 years. Having migrated to Australia from India, Mr Sud said he was used to overpopulated cities, but now felt ""claustrophobic"" because of the number of houses and people. As his neighbourhood becomes more crowded, he is finding it harder to escape the extreme heat — in February last year, temperatures soared to 44.5C, and Mr Sud found it difficult to breathe. Just a month prior, in the heart of the 2020 bushfires, nearby Penrith in Western Sydney was deemed the hottest place on earth, reaching a high of 48.9C. Despite installing solar panels to offset energy costs, Mr Sud still finds it too expensive to cool his entire house during summer. ""We, as a family, move into one section of the house, stay together, and put on the AC there,"" he said. ""Otherwise, if you start cooling the entire house, the cost will go up."" Shade provided by trees alone can reduce ambient temperatures by an estimated 8C, leading to a reduction in air conditioning costs and electricity savings of 12–15 per cent per year, a study from Dr Moore found. Thuy Linh Nguyen from Voices of Power, a campaign that advocates for more affordable and cleaner energy, said the people of Western Sydney were suffering the burden of the urban heat island effect. ""It's really hard to keep it cool or warm, and so people are spending a lot of money to keep their houses cool in summer,"" she said. ""We're hearing about people taking their mattress out and onto the lawn to sleep there."" Ms Nguyen said many people vulnerable to heat waves lived in ""leaky homes"" — or inefficient homes with poor insulation — that used a lot of energy to keep cool, and it could be expensive to make homes more efficient. She is urging governments to give households ""support through grants to be able to upgrade their homes, so they can cool their homes really well"". Not all suburbs are losing trees at the same rate. In some of Melbourne's wealthy inner-city suburbs, dense trees wrap around streets providing sun protection even on a sizzling summer's day. Dr Moore and other researchers found that houses on a tree-lined street can be up to $30,000 more expensive than those that have very sparse vegetation. ""The green and leafy suburbs were definitely suburbs that were not intended for the working class,"" he said. ""So there are social, historic and ecological reasons why there are differences in vegetation cover."" For example, 60 years ago, much of Clayton was cleared and flattened for farmland and factories, which is why it can be difficult to find tall, well-established trees in the area. Melbourne's northern suburbs were always dry and arid, even before European colonisation, and that geography means its residents are particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures today. ""The way we are developing new suburbs on the fringe continues to be in a mode that delivers very little private vegetation, very little space for private canopy trees,"" Dr Hurley from RMIT said. ""This is not helping to cool these suburbs."" Hidden behind a dense cover of leaves and trunks stands Lyn and Michael Lawson's weatherboard home. Like many of their neighbours, the couple have noticed rapid changes on their streets. They complained to council about the three-storey townhouses being built over the fence that look directly into their yard, to no avail. ""There's a lot more cement than there used to be, and people are growing less trees,"" Ms Lawson said. ""We find it distressing because it's just blocked buildings and you can't see beyond them … we just find it very invasive."" The Lawsons have lived in Clayton for the past 30 years, slowly developing their flat and uninspiring garden and backyard into a suburban oasis. During summers, the couple have been able to keep cool by finding shade under their thick canopy of vines and trees. ""We love trees. We love fruit. So most of our yard is fruit trees,"" Ms Lawson said. Protecting these trees on private properties is one way to avoid the worst of the urban heat island effect, experts say. But the decision should not be left up to garden-loving families like the Lawsons. ""We need to be balancing that provision of new housing, that new development, with the provision of urban trees and vegetation to ensure that we have an extensive and functioning urban canopy and urban forest to help keep cooling those neighbourhoods,"" Dr Hurley said. Councils are adopting laws to make it harder to remove residential trees and encourage property developers to make space for gardens. Monash City Council, for example, has put in place a Tree Management policy and Street Tree strategy to better preserve vegetation, and plants approximately 1,500 street trees per year. State governments are also taking note. Proposed planning laws in Canberra would require new developments to have a minimum 20 per cent tree cover. In Victoria, the government aims to plant 500,000 trees across Melbourne's western suburbs, an area that experiences the highest urban heat island effect. It will also introduce new planning guidelines this month, proposing a 30 per cent tree canopy target for Melbourne's new growth areas. But with suburban populations set to rise as climate change makes our summers even hotter, some experts are urging Australians to rethink their love for large homes on suburban subdivisions. Dr Moore from the University of Melbourne said that more developed land should be set aside for plants. ""That doesn't mean that you wouldn't have dense housing. But it does mean you would have to go up,"" he said.

302,analysis: We witnessed Morrison's 'Freedom Day' this week — and his reversal on electric vehicles was the main event,environment,"  Scott Morrison is back on the campaign trail with an electric vehicle push he hopes won't upset his base — can it work? When the long lockdowns were finally coming to an end in Sydney and Melbourne, some just couldn't wait to rush out and do everything at once. A talkback caller told ABC Radio's Virginia Trioli their first day of freedom would involve a haircut, a visit to a favourite jam donut shop and a relaxing lie down in a float tank. A quirky combo, but each to their own bottled-up desires. Last month's freedom frenzy came to mind as the Prime Minister burst forth this week with his first bout of campaigning in a very long time. Here was a man clearly hoping to put the year's vaccine, submarine, and climate change problems behind him. Scott Morrison was back in his element, making gnocchi and spring rolls, visiting a barber, climbing into a truck, patting a dog, reversing course on electric vehicles, taking a hydrogen car for a spin, and shaking many hands. Yes, shaking hands is officially back. There was none of the awkward elbow bumping we saw with foreign leaders only a week ago. ""Australians"", he declared, ""have had enough of governments telling them what to do."" It was a line that sought to link the joy of reopening with the Coalition's climate approach. To those who may not have immediately grasped the connection between COVID restrictions and emissions policy, Morrison was explicit. ""Labor wants to tell everybody what to do,"" he said. Of course, the government isn't entirely getting out of the business of, well, governing. It's still making decisions on how to spend taxpayer money — in increasing amounts as it happens. This week more funds were announced for electric vehicle charging stations and carbon capture and storage start-ups, on top of the $20 billion committed pre-Glasgow to achieve the net-zero target. All this spending is aimed at leveraging private investment and ultimately emissions reduction without anything that could be interpreted as a direct ""price"" on carbon. This has become a political imperative; a way to maintain faith with net-zero critics in the ""base"" and differentiate the Coalition from Labor. Yet this refusal to touch anything that may resemble a ""price"" means even sensible steps, like basic CO2 fuel efficiency standards, are discarded. Australia is the only country in the OECD without fuel efficiency or vehicle emissions standards for CO2. Indeed, they've existed for years in most developed and developing countries, including the US, UK, EU, Japan, China, and India. Surveys show Australians want to buy electric vehicles, but they continue to languish at less than 1 per cent of new car sales. What's going on? These standards typically apply as an ""average"" across a car makers' fleet, creating an incentive for manufacturers to push down the price tag on electric and hybrid models so more are sold in those markets. They do this by charging more for their petrol and diesel models. Without any fuel standard in Australia, no such incentive to lower the price of electric and hybrid cars exists. Instead, car makers openly warn they will dump their gas guzzlers in Australia — one of the few countries with no limits on vehicle emissions. At the last election, Labor pledged to phase in an emissions standard of 105 grams of CO2 per kilometre for light vehicles. Most of the attention at the time was on the headline of Bill Shorten's electric vehicle policy — a target of 50 per cent new car sales being electric by 2030. But the fuel efficiency standard was the engine to get there. Labor's current policy has no 2030 sales target and instead promises some modest tax relief on electric cars. On the critical question of whether it still plans to introduce a fuel efficiency standard, the official line is Labor will have ""more to say"" soon. The Prime Minister is no longer comparing electric vehicles with a war on the weekend. This isn't a climate conversion but an awakening to a changing political landscape, writes political correspondent Brett Worthington. Tanya Plibersek possibly hinted at where this is heading on Tuesday, telling Sky News: ""Australia is behind the world when it comes to vehicle emission standards, and … is the dumping ground for the most polluting vehicles in the world."" It's the same language used by the car makers who are calling for the standard. As with its 2030 emissions target, Labor must decide whether to fight an inevitable Coalition scare campaign over any sort of fuel standard or fold. The politics on climate change, generally, and electric vehicles, specifically, have undoubtedly shifted since 2019. As a result, Morrison has also shifted to the point where he this week tried to pretend that he hadn't bagged electric vehicles before the last election. (The tapes don't lie.) Anthony Albanese must judge whether the shift in the electorate is strong enough to win a nuanced debate about the need for emissions standards. The federal government says it will not force Australians out of the car they want to drive, but the choice may have already been taken away from them. In one aspect, both sides of politics are already committed to a small ""price"" on vehicle emissions. The Coalition and Labor both plan to leave fuel excise arrangements alone, delivering some advantage to electric car drivers who don't pay the excise and disadvantage to those chewing through more fuel. Indeed, OECD Secretary and former Finance Minister Mathias Cormann calls this an ""implicit"" carbon price. Is applying this price to some vehicles and not others a way of ""telling Australians what to do""? Not really, but nor is a vehicle emissions standard. Both create some greater incentive to go electric, without destroying the weekend. David Speers is the host of Insiders, which airs on ABC TV at 9am on Sunday or on iview.

303,Hindus know this water is toxic but they are bathing in it anyway to celebrate the festival of Chhath Puja,environment,"  India's Yamuna River is covered in chemical foam yet residents are bathing in it to celebrate Chhath Puja One of India's most sacred rivers appears to be coated with a thick layer of snow. Except it isn't. A vast stretch of the Yamuna River is covered with white toxic foam, caused in part by pollutants discharged from industrial plants that ring New Delhi. Still, on Wednesday hundreds of Hindu devotees stood knee-deep in its frothy, toxic waters, sometimes even immersing themselves for a holy dip to mark the festival of Chhath Puja. The 1,376-kilometre Yamuna is one of the holiest rivers for Hindus. It is also among the most polluted in the world. The river provides more than half of New Delhi's water, posing a serious health risk to its residents. It has become dirtier over the years as most of the capital's sewage, farm pesticides from neighbouring states and industrial effluents from factory towns flow into the waterway, despite laws against polluting. Yet, devotees flock to it every year during the festival, which is dedicated to the solar deity and is observed with holy bathing. Rajesh Kumar Verma was among those who offered prayers on Yamuna's banks on Wednesday. He knows the water is harmful but stood in it anyway, unfazed by the health hazard. ""What fear? If we are scared, then how can we pray?"" he said. Authorities deployed motorboats in an attempt to disperse the toxic foam. They also erected barricades of bamboo sticks to keep it away from the river banks. India's capital, home to more than 20 million people, is one of the world's most polluted cities. Winters in particular have become a time of health woes, when the city is covered with a toxic haze that obscures the sky and air pollution levels reach catastrophic levels, in a city where the air quality is frequently the world's worst on a daily basis. Pollution levels soar as farmers in neighbouring agricultural regions set fire to their land after harvests to clear it for the next crop season. On Wednesday, New Delhi's air quality index was ""very poor,"" according to SAFAR, India's main environmental monitoring agency.

304,Concerns for Adelaide's Port River dolphins after foam cleaning balls found on shore,environment,"  AGL, EPA probe how Torrens Island Power Station's foam cleaning balls found in Port River The health of Adelaide's Port River dolphins is again in focus, after cleaning balls from a nearby power station washed up on the shoreline. The Environment Protection Agency and energy company AGL have been investigating how the small, colourful foam cleaning balls from the Torrens Island Power Station were found in the Port River. A member of the public noticed the foam balls over the weekend and posted about it on social media. An AGL spokeswoman said a ""small number"" of the balls had washed up on the shoreline. ""These foam cleaning balls are used regularly to reduce build-up in our condensers as part of our routine maintenance activities,"" she said. The spokeswoman said AGL had conducted a clean-up of the area on Monday morning and would ""continue to monitor the situation"" and work closely with the EPA and the local community. In a statement, the EPA said it was told yesterday that small, coloured balls were in the water at the Barker Inlet, and that its officers would continue to investigate. ""The EPA thanks the public and the City of Port Adelaide Enfield for reporting the matter,"" the statement read. Australian Marine Wildlife Research Rescue's Aaron Machado told ABC Radio Adelaide that dolphins and seabirds were unlikely eat the foam balls, but there was a possibility they could eat fish that may be attracted to the balls. ""[The foam balls] don't get digested by the animal and, if it does happen to cause any gut impaction, then everything they eat after that backs up and … it's [an] extremely painful, slow death,"" he said. An investigation into the declining health of dolphins at the Port River sanctuary has been underway for months. Mr Machado, one of the experts involved in the investigation, said the cause was not yet clear but it was not solely due to human activities such as fishing and boating. ""There's a lot of pollution in that river … that will be there through my lifetime, my children's lifetime and so on, and the adverse effect of that type of pollution is going to live on,"" he said. Mr Machado said the Port River had been ""misused"" in the past and was a ""very industrialised port"". ""The by-product of that is you are going to have animals that have adverse effects, as would we if we lived in that environment."" Mr Machado said it was also not clear if the impact of hypersaline water leaking into the St Kilda mangroves had affected the dolphins. ""Is it a coincidence? I don't know,"" he said.

305,How slapping solar on the MCG could help Melbourne to net zero,environment," Science How rooftop solar on skyscrapers and the MCG could help Melbourne get to net zero With Australia now committed to net zero domestic emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, the focus is on how to achieve that — from the national scale down to the state and city levels. What would it take, for instance, for an Australian city to be net zero? Monash University researchers have been looking at a part of this puzzle; by mapping sunlight in the City of Melbourne, they've calculated how much solar energy this urban area could produce. The research, published in the journal Solar Energy, finds that by crowding the sunny-enough rooftops with photovoltaic panels, the city centre could meet about two thirds of its energy needs. Replacing the facades and glazing with high-tech solar-panel walls and windows would bring that figure up to three quarters. Jacek Jasieniak, a professor of engineering at Monash and a co-author of the study, says turning the dense cluster of energy-guzzling towers into vertical solar arrays makes net zero cities achievable. ""Cities are thought of as massive energy users, but are never conceived as massive energy producers,"" he said. ""All of a sudden, you can see that a city can actually do both."" So why is the solar uptake on office towers currently so low, and what else would be required to make a city net zero? The Monash research focused on the 37-square-kilometre central area of Melbourne, which includes high-rise developments in Southbank and Docklands, mid-rise apartment towers in South Yarra and North Melbourne, and industrial low-rise in areas like Port Melbourne. Could Australia become a renewable superpower by 2030? You decide. This relatively small area accounts for a whopping 7.5 per cent of Victoria's total electricity consumption, or 3,200 GWh per year. But it produces relatively little energy of its own: rooftop PV uptake is low. To calculate how much solar electricity this area could produce, the researchers had to know the amount of solar radiance, or sunlight, that fell on the buildings over a year. To do this, they developed a 3D model of the city that included the shadows cast by the buildings over the course of a day. Now they could work out which rooftops, walls and windows would be sunny enough for photovoltaics, said Maria Panagiotidou, a co-author of the paper, private sustainability expert and Monash research fellow. ""We set a threshold for solar radiation of 1,000 kilowatt hours per square metre per year, because who would install a PV in an area where there's not enough radiation?"" she said. They concluded the City of Melbourne's total solar potential was 2,354 GWh per year, or 75 per cent of the city's current consumption. Most (88 per cent) of the energy generated would come from rooftop solar panels. According to Professor Jasieniak, the level of installed capacity in Melbourne CBD, which is at 13.7 MW, is a ""fraction of the potential capacity that the city can offer based on this work."" This begs the question: why not just import the energy? The arguments for generating energy locally come down to cost and resilience, Professor Jasieniak said. Up to 20 per cent of electricity is lost by the lengthy process of sending it down kilometres of wire and cables from the power plant to the socket. Transmission itself accounts for about 40 per cent of the cost of electricity. Buildings with solar panels can keep operating through grid power outages, which means offices don't have to shut down. ""There is a risk that if you get transmission line problems in Victoria, you're going to get blackouts,"" Professor Jasieniak said. If rooftop solar panels are so good, why do so few office towers and apartment blocks have them? One reason may be they tend to be rented, Professor Jasieniak said. ""Developers want to build cheap, so they build as cheaply as possible to sell to someone that ultimately rents the building. ""There's no clear responsibility on who is mandated to actually put on photovoltaics. There's a massive policy challenge here."" From 2017-2019, the Australian Photovoltaic Institute (APVI) released a series of reports estimating the solar potential of the CBDs of most of Australia's capital cities. It found all were generating only a fraction of their potential. Current installed capacity (MW) Potential installed capacity (MW) Brisbane 1.1 188 Melbourne 5 461 Sydney 6.7 619 Canberra 1.3 68 Adelaide 4 129 Perth 5.4 102 The APVI also looked at how much energy particular buildings could generate. Central Station in Sydney decked with solar panels would have a capacity of 3,000 kW, equivalent to about 400 average-sized household rooftop solar arrays. Given a solar panel makeover, the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) could generate up to 2,200 kW of solar energy, and the Australian War Memorial in Canberra could produce 1,200 kW. APVI secretary Renate Egan, a UNSW solar expert, says ""big public buildings"" are ideal for rooftop solar. Some buildings, however, are too tall and narrow. She doubted any city would get close to generating three quarters or even half of its energy needs; they'd rely mostly on solar and wind farms. ""The cost of utility-scale solar will continue to fall as we keep accessing economies of scale,"" she said. But local generation will still be cost effective for some buildings. ""In CBDs, there's still significant room for improvement — there's now 1-2 per cent demand being met with rooftop solar when it could be 10-20 per cent,"" she said. Making a city net zero requires more than substituting solar panels for coal-fired power plants. In the short space of one year, Annabelle and Alex have slashed the money they spend on electricity, gas and petrol to zero. Here's how they did it. Another big job is ""decarbonising buildings,"" says Anna Skarbek, chief executive officer of the non-profit ClimateWorks. ""Buildings and transport are the major sources of emissions in cities,"" she said. Buildings will have to be retrofitted with better insulation and more energy-efficient equipment that runs on electricity, rather than gas or oil, Ms Skarbek says. New buildings will have to be built to a higher energy efficiency standard — proposed changes to the National Construction Code 2022 would increase the minimum thermal performance of new homes from six stars to seven. ""About half the buildings that will be operating in 2050 are not yet built,"" Ms Skarbek said. ""Our research shows that the code could go up to eight stars, and still benefit households who would save hundreds of dollars a year in avoided energy costs."" Monash University is working through these problems at a smaller scale by transitioning its Australian operations to zero emissions by 2030. The biggest problems aren't technology, but deployment and coordination, says Scott Ferraro, the director of the university's Net Zero Initiative. ""We don't need any new technology to enable a net zero city. We just need commitment and resources to drive it,"" he said. With commitment, a net zero Melbourne by ""2030 or 2035 is not unrealistic"". Cities around the world are racing to reach net zero. The historic wheat and sheep farming town of Katanning is embarking on a community energy project to change not just how it gets electricity, but who gets the money. In Europe, this work is being coordinated by the EIT Climate-KIC non-profit, with funding from the European Union. Speaking from the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Climate-KIC chief executive officer Kirsten Dunlop said none of the frontrunner European cities, including Copenhagen, Amsterdam and Madrid, are on track to be near to net zero by 2030. ""We've got a huge gap between what we believe is feasible and what's actually needed,"" she said. Like Monash's Mr Ferraro, she says the greatest challenge is not developing new kinds of low-emission technology, but deploying the existing ones. Cities are made up of many parts interlocking in complex ways, from the different levels of government, to the private sector, to the public itself. ""Everyone knows the big problem is how to actually implement,"" she said. Australia could learn from Europe, she said. ""I do encourage Melbourne to join us, because there's no reason why this shouldn't be happening across the world between Europe and Australia."" You may be wondering about those high-tech solar-panel windows mentioned earlier: when are they arriving? Part of Australia's net zero by 2050 plan is to use carbon capture and storage to help get emissions down. But is it a realistic option? Solar windows are solar cells that generate electricity while allowing light to pass through. Various window-integrated PV technologies already exist but are not efficient, meaning the costs generally outweigh the value of electricity being generated. ""We are working on different types of technologies where the efficiency is of the order of four to five times higher than what is available commercially,"" Professor Jasieniak said. ""They're still very, very early-stage technologies. They probably won't be available for a decade."" Another emerging technology is building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), where solar panels are built into the exterior of a building. Basically, the idea is for the building itself to become the solar panel. Dr Panagiotidou says these ideas should be incorporated into building design to maximise the sunny space for solar cells. Sun and shadow should also be considered by town planners, she added. If a proposed building will cast a shadow on existing ones and lower their solar generation potential, maybe it should go somewhere else. ""We need to figure out what's the best design to have the largest amount of incident solar radiation on the buildings' surfaces."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

306,"Barack Obama takes aim at China, Russia for missing COP26",environment,"  Barack Obama tells COP26 the world is 'nowhere near' climate targets, takes aim at Russia, China Former US president Barack Obama has thrown his support behind those on the frontline of global warming, calling for action by rich nations to help poorer nations on the issue of climate change. At the start of the second and final week of the UN climate talks in Glasgow known as COP26 — ministers got down to the detail of trying to honour promises to pay for climate-linked losses and damages, and to address how to help nations adapt to the effects of climate change. ""We have to act now to help with adaptation and resilience,"" Mr Obama told a meeting of island nations at the summit, adding that his views on the immediacy of the threat had been shaped by his experience growing up in Hawaii. It was a sentiment agreed with by other prominent politicians from less developed nations. ""Everyone knows what is to be done,"" said Kenya's Environment Minister Keriako Tobiko. ""There have been too much and too many workshops, retreats and conferences. And it is always 'the time is now' 'the time has come'. Actually there's no more time, let's put the money on the table."" At a UN climate summit 12 years ago in Copenhagen, wealthier nations promised to hand developing countries US$100 billion ($134 billion) a year by 2020 to help them adapt to climate change. The target was missed, and at COP26 richer nations have said they will meet the goal in 2023 at the latest, with some hoping it could be delivered a year earlier. In recent weeks and months rich nations including the United States, Japan, Spain and Italy have raised their ""climate financing"" pledges, but some still fall short of what international bodies say is a fair contribution. Ghana's Environment Minister Kwaku Afriyie said negotiations over funds for adaptation in the nations hardest-hit by climate change were not reflecting the levels of ambition publicly voiced by developed countries. ""It's very unfortunate and sad indeed,"" he said. While developing countries want more money to help them battle rising temperatures that have caused more frequent droughts, floods and wildfires, developed nations have focussed on channelling finance towards cutting emissions. The cost of both is huge, but it will be even higher unless the Glasgow talks can keep alive a goal that dates from UN talks in Paris in 2015 to keep global warming below 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Mr Obama said the Paris Agreement he helped to broker had created a framework to tackle climate change, but too little had been done since then. ""We are nowhere near where we need to be,"" he told the Glasgow audience, chiding the leaders of China and Russia, two of the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, for failing to even attend the summit. “It was particularly discouraging to see the leaders of two of the world’s largest emitters, China and Russia, decline to even attend the proceedings, and their national plans reflect what appears to be a dangerous lack of urgency."" Activist Greta Thunberg already dismissed the talks as a ""failure"", and and said world leaders need to make good on the many pledges they delivered in the first week of the conference, which is scheduled to finish on Friday. The Earth could be just 10 years from a global warming threshold beyond which even more serious and frequent natural disasters are expected to wreak havoc on humanity. Underlining the difficulties, COP26 President Alok Sharma said there was a desire among parties ""to continue technical work with a renewed urgency to make progress"" on climate finance where there was ""a large number of outstanding issues"". ""My priority now is pace,"" he added. ""There needs to be a sense of urgency in all our negotiations. ""There is now a practical recognition that action is needed on this topic in the face of growing impacts.""

307,"At 83, the ‘Nimblewill Nomad' is now the oldest to hike Appalachian Trail",environment,"  At 83, the 'Nimblewill Nomad' found more than inner peace, hiking 3,500km into record books An 83-year-old from Alabama started walking when he retired more than 25 years ago — and never stopped. MJ ""Sunny"" Eberhart strode into the record books this week as the oldest hiker to complete the 3,500km Appalachian Trail in the eastern United States. Mr Eberhart, who goes by the nickname Nimblewill Nomad, said despite being a seasoned hiker,  the trail was tough going at his age and led to quite a few spills on slippery rocks. ""I've a got a couple of marks on me, but I'm OK,"" he said. ""You've got to have an incredible resolve to do this."" Mr Eberhart hiked the trail in sections in reverse order to take advantage of optimal weather, and had already completed northern sections including Maine's Mount Katahdin. He completed his final section in western Massachusetts, the same year a 5-year-old became among the youngest to complete the feat. Joining Mr Eberhart for the finish was the former record holder, Dale ""Greybeard"" Sanders, who lives outside Memphis, Tennessee. He completed the hike at age 82 in 2017. He's not sad to see the record fall. ""My dear friend Nimblewill is taking my record away from me, and I'm happy for him. Records are made to be broken,"" Mr Sanders said. Jordan Bowman, from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy confirmed Mr Eberhart as the oldest person to finish the trail, surpassing Mr Sanders. Mr Eberhart discovered his love for hiking after retiring from his career as a Florida optometrist in 1993. With his flowing locks and full beard he was somewhat reminiscent of a famous movie character and actually hiked farther than most who traverse the full trail between Georgia's Springer Mountain and Maine's Katahdin. He started his hike in February at his home in Flagg Mountain, Alabama, adding hundreds of kilometres to the route. The journey was a modest distance for Mr Eberhart, who previously trekked 7,080km from the Florida Keys to northern Quebec, which he chronicled in his book, Ten Million Steps. Mr Eberhart later hiked a greater distance, from Newfoundland to Florida, and walked from Chicago to California. He said he was feeling his age on this hike and his reflexes weren't what they once were, so he tried to limit himself to eight hours of hiking a day. But he still got banged up. He recently took a tumble and bloodied his elbow, causing his hiking companion Odie Norman to ask if he would like to take a break. Mr Eberhart retorted, ""do you think if I complain about it it will go away?"", before picking himself and pressing on. Despite some stumbles Mr Eberhart hasn't lost his desire to keep moving or to seek the sense of calm that he feels while hiking in the company of his tight-knit community. His first major hike was motivated by a search for peace after struggling with the emotional and mental baggage of a divorce and losing the respect of his children, he said. But eventually, he found peace and forgiveness. ""You can seek peace. That doesn't mean that you're going to find it,"" he said. ""I persevered to the point that the good Lord looked down on me and said 'you're forgiven, you can be at peace',"" ""It's a profound blessing. It's as simple as that."" With the hike completed, Mr Eberhart plans to return to his Alabama home where he serves as caretaker of a fire tower and cabins built by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Mr Norman, a friend of Mr Eberhart, said it is unlikely he will hang up his boots anytime soon. ""I don't think it's going to be his last hike. I just don't think he knows what's he's going to hike next.""

308,Rallies in Glasgow and Sydney call for 'survival of humanity' in face of climate change,environment,"  Big crowds rally in rainy Glasgow for COP26 climate action Tens of thousands of protesters have marched through rainy downtown Glasgow, and in many other cities around the world, to demand bolder action at the UN climate conference. Students, activists and climate-concerned citizens linked arms as they moved slowly through the streets of the Scottish city, host of the COP26 meeting that began on Monday. Some pushed children in strollers, some danced to stay warm. Police watched the procession from the flanks. ""It's good to have your voice heard,"" said Kim Travers of Edinburgh. ""Even with the rain, I think it makes it a bit more dramatic."" Just a few blocks from the procession, back-room negotiations continued at the COP26 meeting. On stage, speakers sounded the alarm over the threat of global warming to food security. Since the climate talks began, national delegations have been working to agree on technical details for the final pact, to be announced at the end of the conference after more negotiations this week. The first week also saw countries make a slew of promises to phase out coal, slash emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane and reduce deforestation. Business leaders and financiers, meanwhile, pledged to invest more in climate solutions. Jo Dodds wants Scott Morrison to do more about climate change, so she went to Glasgow. But activists have demanded that the meeting make more progress. Ros Cadoux, a grandmother from Edinburgh, said she came to march for future generations. ""If you've got kids and grandkids, my God, what else could you do?"" Colourful banners bore slogans ranging from earnest calls for ""Climate Justice Now"", to the more comical: ""No planet = no beer"". One group bounced along to the sound of a drum and chanted: ""Get up, get down, keep that carbon in the ground."" ""The climate crisis is about the survival of humanity as we know it,"" said Philipp Chmel, who traveled from Germany for the march. ""It's up to the youth and the workers, the working class, to bring about the change that is necessary."" One group of young people — some with bullhorns — blamed companies for the climate crisis and chanted calls in favour of socialism while punching their fists in the air. Around midday, the rain cleared for a few hours, and an enormous rainbow streaked across the sky. ""If ever there was a time for activism, and if ever there was a time for the people to come out onto the streets, then it is today,"" said University of Glasgow student Theo Lockett, 20. Climate activists held rallies in many other cities, including Seoul, Copenhagen and London. More than 1,000 people demonstrated on Saturday in Sydney and Melbourne to protest against the government's climate policies and the strategies it offered at COP26. Why aren't the disturbing aspects of both the climate change and strategic positions of the government under more intense pressure? Sydney's first legal protest after a months-long COVID-19 lockdown saw about 1,000 people march in support of global action day for climate justice, a worldwide movement mobilised during the COP26 meeting. ""We're all out here to show that we want more from our government,"" said protester Georgia, who gave only her first name. ""The COP 26 agreements were happening and it's not turning out the best for Australia at the moment."" Marchers carried signs reading, ""We need human change, not climate change"" and ""Code Red for Humanity"". Australia has rejected a global pledge to slash emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Campaigners and pressure groups have not been impressed by the commitments of other world leaders. Melbourne's protest was smaller than Sydney's, with just a few hundred people turning out for a rally that featured a giant koala bear emitting plumes of smoke, and protesters dressed as skeletons on bikes. Several smaller events were held elsewhere in Australia. During a panel of speeches on Saturday (local time), Democratic US senator Sheldon Whitehouse urged companies to rein in groups lobbying politicians to block climate action. Australian farmers are busy generating carbon credits. They're valuable, but could be worth more. ""Corporate members who made big promises here at this COP have got to get their trade associations under control so they're not undercutting our work in Congress,"" said Mr Whitehouse, who was at COP26 with a bipartisan group of Congress members. He also told journalists that it was crucial to resolve a carbon price for carbon markets — one of the key sticking points in the negotiations. As with the COVID-19 pandemic, ""it won't be long before the entire population of the world is affected, directly or indirectly"" by climate change, said former prime minister Julia Gillard, now head of UK health charity the Wellcome Trust. Earlier at the conference, actor Idris Elba acknowledged that he had few credentials to speak on climate change, but said he was at COP26 to amplify the climate threat to global food security. Sitting on the same panel, climate justice campaigner Vanessa Nakate of Uganda implored the world to stop burning fossil fuels, the main cause of rising global temperatures. ""We are watching farms collapse and livelihoods lost due to floods, droughts and swarms of locusts,"" she said — all of which scientists say are being exacerbated by climate change. ""The climate crisis means hunger and death for many people in my country and across Africa."" Civil society leaders and representatives from companies like Unilever and PepsiCo spoke about corporate responsibility in making trade and commerce less of a burden on nature. Speaking about using satellite technology to monitor global landscapes, the director and founder of Google Earth Outreach urged better stewardship of the world's forests. ""We don't want to be writing the obituary of our planet in high resolution,"" Rebecca Moore said.

309,It's a 'priority' technology in Australia's net zero plan. Critics say it's a 'scam',environment," Science Carbon capture and storage: does it work, and does it mean we can keep burning fossil fuels? Does Australia have a bad reputation on climate change? Among the worst in the world, according to at least one survey of international media and social media content by intelligence and social analytics company Meltwater Australia. But heading into Glasgow, the federal government did commit Australia to a net zero target by 2050. Though light on detail, the government's net zero plan predicts that investing in ""priority low emissions technologies"" will achieve 40 per cent of our emissions reduction needed to get us there. One of those ""priority"" technologies singled out for focus by the government is carbon capture and storage, or CCS. Proponents of CCS, including Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor, argue the technology allows us to continue profiting from fossil fuels while also getting our emissions down. But critics say CCS is a failed technology that the government is using to delay the inevitable shutdown of our fossil fuel industries. As the name implies, CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide at the site of production, such as a gas liquefaction plant or coal-fired power station. The gas is then pumped deep underground where it can migrate into porous substrate, such as sandstone, and be trapped. There is also carbon capture use/utilisation and storage (CCUS), which usually involves a process known as enhanced oil/gas recovery, where captured carbon dioxide is pumped into depleted oil or gas reservoirs in order to force out any remaining fuel from the reservoir. Once the hard-to-recover fossil fuel is removed, the captured carbon dioxide then remains trapped inside the underground reservoir. Yes, to an extent, but it's complicated. CCUS has been in use since the 1970s, when it was known as enhanced oil recovery and its purpose was to increase oil yield rather than sequester emissions. But fossil fuel industries claim it has also proven effective since then in reducing a proportion of the emissions from some polluting industries. The first CCS/CCUS projects started out small but have become much more ambitious in recent years, according to Kathryn Amos, head of the University of Adelaide's Australian School of Petroleum and Energy Resources (ASPER). Chevron has provided funding for ASPER's carbon capture and storage research. ""There are a number of CCS projects that work really well around the world,"" Dr Amos said. According to the US Department of Energy's Carbon Capture and Storage Database, there are 43 active sites where carbon capture and storage is taking place worldwide, including enhanced oil recovery projects. That includes 10 in the US, five in China and four in Australia. However, only one of those Australian projects (Gorgon) is on a commercial scale. The other three are small-scale research studies not intended to make an impact on emissions reduction. Gas giant Santos has a $220 million CCS project in development at Moomba in South Australia, where it plans to store more than 1 million tonnes of CO2 each year, starting in 2024. That project has been made eligible for receiving carbon credits. Santos chief executive officer Kevin Gallagher says the project is a ""critical step in decarbonising natural gas"". Matthias Raab, executive director of CO2CRC, an Australian carbon capture utilisation and storage research company, says CCS can help make quick gains in getting our emissions down. ""We need to be genuinely open to what we can do to have the big wins as quickly as we can,"" Dr Raab told the ABC's Science Friction. ""In my eyes, carbon sequestration is a big, big winner."" But critics, including Mark Ogge from the Australia Institute, say carbon capture and storage is a government fossil fuel handout, which is putting our transition to proven clean technology in peril. ""[Carbon capture and storage in Australia has] been around for about 20 years and it's led to a huge delay in us doing anything serious about winding back fossil fuel emissions,"" Mr Ogge says. ""The amount of CO2 that's actually captured and put underground is minuscule. ""For every billion dollars of taxpayers' money that goes into this … every one of those dollars is a dollar not spent on things that are proven to reliably work and can be rolled out now and have huge abatement potential."" The Gorgon gas facility in Western Australia is the world's largest ""dedicated"" CCS project, meaning the captured CO2 isn't used to extract more fossil fuels. Despite having the financial backing of Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Shell, and $60 million from the WA government, the project has been racked by technical issues. Originally supposed to capture 80 per cent of its emissions over a five-year period, it's never reached full capacity and has only achieved storage of about 30 per cent of emissions with the remaining emissions  — estimated to be in the vicinity of 10 million tonnes of CO2 — being released to the atmosphere. For scale, it was estimated at one point by Climate Analytics that the Gorgon plant was releasing roughly the same amount of CO2 into the atmosphere each year as was being collectively saved by every rooftop solar panel in Australia. The company had talks in July with the WA government, which could result in Chevron needing to purchase around $100 million in carbon credits. Encountering problems is far from rare for carbon capture and storage projects. A study published in Environmental Research Letters last year found more than 80 per cent had either failed to launch, or failed after launch. Lead author of that study, Ahmed Abdullah from Carleton University in Canada, says there are some key reasons why they fail. ""The global record of deploying carbon capture is overwhelmingly one of failure when you consider the huge number of projects that have been proposed over the previous two decades,"" Assistant Professor Abdullah said. ""The question was, as engineers, can we learn from that failure?"" Paradoxically, they found that it was usually the smaller, less ambitious projects that succeeded. Of the 14 most expensive US-based projects they looked at, 13 were abandoned. ""It turns out that when government endeavours to fund these projects that are large, shiny and therefore cost a lot of money, but also employ the next generation of advanced technologies, well-advanced technologies often fail,"" Dr Abdullah said. Exact figures are difficult to come by, but Dr Raab estimates it's in the vicinity of 90 per cent for coal and higher for gas. ""Let's say 95 per cent plus is being captured and is then being stored geologically,"" he said. But senior scientist with Climate Analytics and lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 4th Assessment Report Bill Hare, says it's lower than that. Federal Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor has been speaking about carbon capture and storage technology this week as part of the Federal Government's push to overhaul clean energy investment in Australia. ""For projects in Canada, it's about 60 to 70 per cent,"" Dr Hare says. ""The capture [rate in] CO2 reservoirs also turns out to be not complete either. It's optimistically claimed to be 80 to 90 per cent, but I don't think there are any examples. ""For enhanced oil recovery, a significant portion of the CO2 comes back to the atmosphere, but it turns out there haven't been many studies published."" Where it was once thought that carbon capture and storage would play an important role in getting global emissions down, Dr Hare says green technologies have advanced to the point where that's no longer the case. ""There are a few sectors where if you'd asked me five or so years ago, I'd have said I can't see many options [other than CCS], like in cement, steel, fertilisers … but right now in 2021, that looks quite unfeasible,"" he said. ""Green steel is now quite famous [using hydrogen], fertiliser is also quite carbon intensive, but it's looking like you can make fertiliser with green hydrogen, you can make a green ammonia, and away you go."" The possibility of a leakage, and who is responsible for those emissions. is a major problem for carbon capture and storage, according to Dr Hare. A 3-kilometre-long crack was found near Statoil's Sleipner carbon capture and storage site in the North Sea in 2011, and the fracture was found to be leaking gases. While none of the sequestered CO2 was determined to be leaking, the discovery was a wake-up call that more rigorous screening of storage sites was needed. ""The storage of carbon underground is not as straightforward as it sounds,"" Dr Hare says. ""One of the most famous ones is the Sleipner field in the North Sea; that's been well studied and it turns out to have a lot of cracks in it — that's been a shock and a surprise. ""If anyone says it's easy and safe and the CO2 will stay underground for a long time, that needs to be treated very sceptically."" But Dr Amos says the technology is safe, and CO2 can be stored in the same wells where gas has been held for millions of years. ""Some of the targets of CO2 storage are depleted oil and gas reservoirs. We know they're pretty safe options for storage because those are the locations that were naturally storing gas."" Dr Raab agrees. ""We're looking at existing oil and gas reservoirs and the knowledge that we have about how they originated, how they were holding oil and gas and liquids for millions of years,"" he says. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. He says it's ""no secret"" there have been problems in the past, but that the industry has improved its practices. ""I think we need to make an assumption really here that the industry [has come] a long way,"" he says. ""There are certain measures that need to be in place to simply ensure the best practices."" Dr Hare says if there's a leak down the track, it's taxpayers that will foot the bill. ""If you look at the new, much-touted methodology for CCS, it's very weak for monitoring of storage and long-term security, and these issues are essentially put back onto the government,"" he says. ""The major proponents of CCS in Australia don't want that liability. It tells you they're not stupid, and it makes you wonder about the wisdom of the government accepting liability."" Dr Raab says liability won't be an issue. ""This is an extremely well-understood undertaking."" But Mr Ogge says focusing on the technology is a distraction from the bigger picture. ""It's a 50-year-old oil and gas industry practice of pumping CO2 into the ground to force out more oil from depleted fields, which increases emissions,"" he said. ""It's been re-branded as carbon capture and storage to basically greenwash it and allow the oil and gas industry to get taxpayer subsidies by presenting it as a climate abatement measure. ""It really is just a complete scam."" Editor’s note (9/11/2021): Some minor additions have been made to this article to provide further context.

310,"Summer hibernation, more disasters: What the future may hold for Australia’s children",environment,"  Coming to age in climate change Summer hibernation, sweltering days, more natural disasters. As the world watches Glasgow, is this the future for Australia’s children? Waking up to a blood-red sun, scorching temperatures, and the inescapable smell of smoke. It's a memory all too familiar to many people who lived through Australia's Black Summer. Palani and Anna's home in the western Sydney suburb of Blacktown wasn't directly threatened by flames — but for a family with two young daughters, those weeks were still frightening. Anna remembers her eldest child, five-year-old Hanshruthi, complaining that her skin was burning and begging to stay indoors because she was too hot. On the worst days, staying indoors wasn't a problem because parents were told to keep their children home from school due to the heat and smoke. ""That whole summer, everyone suffered a lot,"" Anna says. ""We thought, we have to do something for the children, otherwise they are going to feel the impacts more than us."" As diplomats gather around negotiating tables in Glasgow, Australian families are grappling with the knowledge their children will be living in an environment very different to the one we know — and asking, what, if anything, they can do to stop the increasingly dire projections playing out. For Palani, it was the birth of his first daughter that spurred his interest in climate action. Bolstered by what he witnessed during the bushfires, he's now become a regular at climate action protests. ""Despite being a developed country, we are suffering so much,"" the 37-year-old says. ""So think of similar things happening in developing countries, how much will they suffer? ""Climate change is the real judgement day. People are realising this, and that is what they are preparing themselves for."" As part of their preparations, the family have started by making small changes at home. They now use reusable bags for shopping, turn off lights when not in use and forgo plastic plates, utensils, and balloons at parties. ""We've learned so much and now we want to show our friends as well, so it's 10 people, not two people, trying to change something,"" Anna says. ""When we gather together [with friends] I share one or two points about climate change. It's my gift."" It's also rubbing off on five-year-old Hanshruthi, who has started teaching her two-year-old sister, Nuvali. ""One day I noticed her telling the little one, 'why you put [your rubbish] on the floor, that's not good, you need to take care of your stuff and put it in the bin',"" Anna says. ""She's learning from us what we are teaching her and she's actually happy to teach her sister."" This year's Conference of Parties, more commonly known as COP26, has been described as the world's last chance to avoid the worst of climate change. The COP26 deadline forced the Australian government to promise to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 — a year after Nuvali will have celebrated her 30th birthday. While the move has been described as a step in the right direction, it falls far short of what the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says is needed to achieve the Paris Agreement pledge to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celcius. Attention has now turned to 2030, with countries urged to reduce emissions by 50 per cent by the end of this decade — a commitment Australia is yet to make. ""I see people making minor changes, like not using straws, and those are quite important as well,"" Palani says. ""But unless major changes from the government happen, it's only going to make a small difference."" In less than 10 years' time, as the world enters the third decade of the century, the IPCC predicts we will already be well on our way to surpassing the 1.5C threshold. That's under the most ambitious scenario; it could also happen later this decade, depending on actions taken between now and then. And Australia will likely get there even sooner. Already our average temperature has warmed by 1.4C, according to the IPCC, and it's likely to be closer to 2C by the next decade. That's because land warms faster than oceans, putting a large landmass like Australia ahead of other nations. For the people living here, this means more heatwaves and higher extreme temperatures, something already happening in western Sydney where Palani and Anna live. On January 4, 2020, Penrith in Sydney's west was the hottest place on earth, recording temperatures of 48.9C. Already, heat kills more people in Australia than any other natural disaster, including floods, cyclones and bushfires. ""You get a disproportionate increase in the number of heatwaves for any given temperature increase,"" says Professor Mark Howden, a climate scientist and vice-chair of the IPCC. ""It's very likely we are going to exceed 50C days at that point, it's just a question of how many on average a year we are going to get."" To put a 50C day in context, it's halfway to water's boiling point or 10C lower than the centre of a perfectly cooked medium-rare steak. This level of heat is uncomfortable at best and deadly at worst,  but it will also have serious impacts on the food we eat. Higher temperatures are related to lower agricultural yields regardless of rainfall levels. Impacts from declining rainfall and more frequent droughts are also set to intensify under 2C of global warming, according to a study published this year by the Australian Academy of Science. More frequent storms and heavy rain in some regions will also ""likely lead to worsening erosion of grazing land and loss of livestock from flooding"". This is the decade that 15-year-old Maia Raymond will be entering her 30s. The teenager lives with her parents and two siblings at Crystal Waters Permaculture Ecovillage, a sustainability-focused community located about 90 minutes outside of Brisbane. The family's home is set on 640 acres of bushland and it's not uncommon to see kangaroos and wallabies hopping by. For as long as she can remember, Maia has been aware of permaculture — a practice of working with natural ecosystems to live sustainably — and the need to look after the environment. ""My mum's a permaculture teacher, we always have conversations about that stuff,"" she says. ""I was constantly telling my friends in primary school, 'oh you should turn that tap off'. It's only been in the last few years that I've realised that this isn't everyone's reality."" This has culminated in the launch of her own youth permaculture organisation which seeks to bring together eco-conscious teenagers from all over the world. She hopes to help young people make sense of a rapidly changing world and give them the tools to make positive changes in their communities. But despite her focus on practical climate activism — which she dubs ""practivism"" — Maia turns serious when asked what she thinks Australia will be like when she's in her 30s. ""There's going to be a lot of people displaced, a lot of natural disasters like the bushfires here two years ago, a lot of loss of natural environment and species."" ""What would be really great [in the future] is people starting to become more active and stand up in their communities … so we can all make a difference to the climate crisis together."" Maia's mother, Morag Gamble, was around the same age as her daughter when she first became interested in permaculture. At 52, she's a renowned permaculture educator with a long history of climate activism. It was having children, however, that brought the reality home. ""When you become a parent, it becomes intensely personal,"" she says. ""Regardless of how much you cared before, you just care 100 times more, 1,000 times more."" The ecovillage where the family and 79 other households live is in a valley ""wrapped in forest"", meaning bushfires are an ever-present threat. At 1.5C of warming, Queensland could experience week-long heatwaves three times a year, according to the Australian Academy of Science. While Morag and Maia's property was designed with bushfires in mind, using lakes as a natural defence, the possibility of disaster is a constant concern. ""If there's a massive, great fire, none of that is going to make a difference,"" Morag says. The possibility of more frequent and severe fires also poses a critical conundrum: planting more trees around the house is important to cool it down, but it also increases the fire risk. ""What could life be like at 50C? When there's massive displacement that happens, the war and destabilisation that's going to happen, it's really hard to face,"" Morag says. ""Sometimes I think I might be living in a bit of a bubble, because I poke my head out and I see things going on like business as usual. ""But actually when you start to open conversations with people, you scratch the surface a bit and it's not. ""So many people are asking these questions, so I think one of the most important things we can be doing is opening a conversation and making it more normal to express our concerns and fears."" Global temperatures will continue to rise until at least mid-way through the century, according to the IPCC. This means, by the 2040s, everything already being experienced in the preceding decades will get ""pretty much worse"", Professor Howden says. Longer and more frequent heatwaves will put the brakes on some economic activity, exercising outdoors may not be possible during the height of summer, and outdoor working conditions will have to be reimagined. With schools often closed during extreme heat, more disruption to education is also likely. By this stage, there's also uncertainty around what will happen to rainfall patterns, particularly in Australia's tropical north. ""One thing that is likely to happen is the variability of rainfall will increase,"" Professor Howden says. ""Dry years will become dryer, and potentially more frequent, and wet years may become wetter and more frequent as well."" Coastal erosion and inundation will also have continued, as oceans warm and sea levels rise. The IPCC report predicts sea levels will rise between 28cm and 55cm by the end of the century, partly due to the loss of ice from the Greenland ice sheet — the second largest body of ice on earth. Increases of up to two metres in the same time frame can't be ruled out. If sea levels were to rise by 1.1 metres, the federal government estimates between 157,000 and 247,600 Australian homes could be at risk of inundation. Maddy Serong, a mother-of-two from Victoria's Bellarine Peninsula, says future sea level rise has already factored into decisions about where she and her partner should raise their children. After recently selling their home to move closer to schools, finding a property that wasn't on low-lying land and vulnerable to coastal flooding was one of the family's biggest priorities. It wasn't possible within their budget. ""It's an imminent thing when you're trying to build or buy a home and make a safe place for your kids,"" she says. ""If things keep going the way that they are, then this home, we won't be able to live in it, we won't be able to sell it, and there goes whatever future you're trying to invest in for your children."" By the 2040s, both those children — Edward, 7, and Stella, 5 — will be celebrating their 30th birthdays. Like the other parents we spoke to, it has been since having children that Maddy has felt the call to speak up about climate change. ""It's no longer this thing of 'future generations', it's actually the one that I am raising right now,"" she says. She sees it as her responsibility to find solutions to instill hope in her children, even in the midst of frustration and despair. Making changes at home and contacting her local MPs has also given the 39-year-old a pathway to manage her own climate anxieties. But she's dismayed by the toll it's taking on the younger generations. Some of her teenage nieces and nephews have told her they don't feel like they can have children in the future given the imminent crisis. ""Becoming a parent and knowing how wonderful it is, it's devastating to know there are young people today deciding not to become parents because they don't feel they can build a safe home for their kids."" ""I want to be able to look my kids in the eye and say I'm doing everything I can to create a safe home for them."" By 2050, given the current trends, five-year-old Hanshruthi's pleas to stay indoors in the warmer months will likely no longer be a request — but a given. By then, Professor Howden predicts Australians will have adopted a sort of ""summer hibernation"", where things shut down simply because it's too hot to be outdoors. ""In 2050, it's pretty much a 2C scenario, and possibly a little bit more,"" he says. ""What we would see is increased stress on our agricultural and water systems, the tendency for really nasty cyclones … and particularly in southern Australia, the impact of increased fires."" But much of what we will actually experience in the future is difficult to predict, due to what Australian Academy of Science Fellow Ove Hoegh-Guldberg calls ""tipping points"". Could Australia become a renewable superpower by 2030? You decide. This refers to the stage after years of gradual changes when ecological systems completely shift or collapse. He says climate scientists generally consider 2C warming as the last call before things spiral out of control in unprecedented ways. ""As you go up in temperature, 1.5C, 2C, 3C, you're gradually losing the possibility of stabilising the climate,"" Professor Hoegh-Guldberg says. ""At 3C warming, which is where a lot of current global policy puts us, the climate from that point onwards could change for hundreds, if not thousands, of years."" Despite these dire predictions, all the families we spoke to remain hopeful it can be turned around. They say they've been buoyed by the activism of young people, who have led the way in starting conversations about what needs to be done. ""I really see them as hope,"" Palani says. ""I hope we don't have to wait for them to become leaders for the government to make changes."" They're also cautious about falling into hopelessness, instead focusing their energy on demonstrating individual responsibility to their children. Scientists, too, are eager to point out there is still time to make the changes needed to avoid disaster — we just have to act now. Under the IPCC's most optimistic scenario, which would see the world reach net zero emissions by 2050, warming could peak at 1.6C around the middle of the century, before dropping to 1.4C. ""If we go hell for leather and phase out fossil fuels over the next 10 to 20 years, there's a very good chance we will stabilise slightly above 1.5C,"" Professor Hoegh-Guldberg says. But, ""if we take all of our commitments as people come into Glasgow, it leaves us with a future temperature of at least 3C by the end of the century. In cautious scientific terms, that's a catastrophe."" Asked what she believes needs to happen for a brighter future, Maddy describes a scene in Finding Nemo. In it, hundreds of fish are stuck in a fishing net and struggling to escape as they are pulled up to the surface. It isn't until they agree to all swim downwards together that they are able to get free. ""I feel like everyone is trying to do something, but we're all going in slightly different directions,"" she says. ""We need a bipartisan approach to get people working towards the same solutions and the same goals.""

311,Alleged illegal logging in Victoria would now be permitted after government amends laws,environment,"  Victorian water supply to have less protection against logging after change to laws Victoria's water catchments will now have fewer protections against logging, after the state government changed legislation to allow the practice in previously off-limits areas. The change removes a strict ban on logging on steep slopes in those areas — a law experts allege was repeatedly broken by VicForests. Scientists say logging on steep slopes can result in soil eroding into waterways, which can pollute them, and even cause dangerous algal blooms. Since 2019, the ABC has reported a string of allegations that VicForests was breaching laws designed to protect Victoria's important water catchments, including the Thomson, which provides the majority of Melbourne's drinking water. On at least two occasions the Office of the Conservation Regulator confirmed breaches had occurred, but declined to take any regulatory action. The regulator said it was not able to substantiate the allegations of ""widespread"" breaches. Scientists alleged breaches occurred in hundreds of locations. Much of that alleged activity would now be legal. Victoria's state-owned logging company VicForests has put Melbourne's drinking supply at risk by illegally logging on steep slopes in an important water catchment. ""Instead of abiding by the law, what they've done is simply change the laws to make what was a widespread, illegal logging approach legal,"" said David Lindenmayer, a professor of forest ecology at the Australian National University. Professor Lindenmayer led research that alleged ""widespread"" and ""systemic"" breaches of the slope proscriptions. ""This is what you might expect to see in places like Indonesia or Madagascar, not in a developed first world nation like Australia,"" he said. When it proposed the changes, the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said it was doing so to clarify the intent of the existing law. ""Without this allowance, even a small hill or landscape variation could cause technical non-compliance, which was never the intention of these limits,"" the department said in an explanatory note. In a logging area, known as a coupe, of 40 hectares, the new law will allow an area about twice the size of the MCG to be logged beyond the slope limit. Under the change to the code, up to 10 per cent of any coupe in a water supply catchment can now be logged over 30 degrees. ""This is one of the most retrogressive changes to forestry practices I've ever seen,"" Professor Lindenmayer said. ""It makes the Environment Minister look very weak. It makes the Premier look very weak. It's the Victorian government kowtowing to the CFMEU and VicForests to cover up illegal behaviour."" Michael O'Connor from the CFMEU said: ""If the government was kowtowing to the union, then they wouldn't be shutting the native forest sector in 2030, which we think is a disgraceful decision. ""I think that the change to the regulations are taking on board all the responsibilities of managing the forest in a sustainable manner and protecting the values that need to be protected: economic, social and environmental."" A spokeswoman for VicForests said in a statement: ""VicForests takes its responsibility of sustainably harvesting coupes within our state forests for today and future generations extremely seriously."" ""We welcome the clarifications brought about by this review. As always, VicForests complies with the Code."" Environment minister Lily D'Ambrosio declined an interview request. A spokeswoman for the Victorian government said the changes to the law were needed because of errors in its drafting. ""Obligations under the new Code do not change in practice — the Code provides clarity making it more enforceable, and ensuring better environmental outcomes,"" the spokeswoman said. Victoria's chief conservation regulator Kate Gavens said the changes brought clarity to the law. ""Clarity in the law for us means it's easier to monitor compliance and it's easier to enforce compliance,"" she said. ""The key focus on these code proscriptions is to manage the risk of mass soil movement and the code proscriptions still require mass soil movement to be managed."" When the ABC caught state-owned loggers illegally chopping down trees on public land, they were compensated rather than punished. Now it seems they plan to do it again. Sarah Rees from conservation group My Environment said the claim that the changes were made to bring clarity to the law was untrue. ""The government can't claim this is a 'clarification of the regulations' when it results in more wood able to be legally cut,"" she said. ""The government has run out of wood due to fires and over-cutting, so now it's changing the rules to get more trees, rather than changing contracts to reflect the shortages. ""To weaken protections in Melbourne's most important water catchments for the government's own wood demands is dangerous."" Jordan Crook from the Victorian National Parks Association said the changes ""make illegal logging legal"". ""The world is going one way and the Victorian government is going the other way, which is the wrong way,"" he said.

312,'They die in agony': Insider speaks out over NSW kangaroo culling program,environment,"  NSW government under pressure over kangaroo culling as leaked documents reveal questions over the program's sustainability Ashley Neill has been shooting kangaroos for 40 years. He now runs a plant outside Hay in rural New South Wales, where carcasses are processed for the multi-million dollar animal trade. He said he operated along a strict commercial code, but not everyone was following the rules – and now was the time to speak out about what he called the ""dark side"" of kangaroo shooting in NSW. ""Kangaroos have been a livelihood for me,"" Mr Neill said. ""I do agree they have to be culled because the white man [came] out here and put watering points where they weren't before. But do it humanely."" Kangaroos are a protected species in Australia, but can be lawfully killed under certain circumstances. In NSW, graziers can apply for a licence to shoot kangaroos on their own land, where they are deemed to be a pest. Professional shooters also operate culls on behalf of landholders, to feed a multi-million-dollar commercial trade in kangaroo meat and skin products. But both programs are under fire after the first public examination of the industry in decades. ""I just thought this would be an inquiry into people's sensitivities,"" said NSW Liberal MP Catherine Cusack. ""I'm now completely 180 degrees from where I started. ""I'm now seriously alarmed that we have a big issue in relation to the sustainability of this species that's iconic to Australia."" Ms Cusack sits on the NSW Parliament's Planning and Environment Committee, which spent months examining the health of kangaroos in the state over three public hearings. ""It's actually quite distressing to me that our kangaroos could be in such a predicament,"" she told 7.30. The inquiry found there were ""grave concerns"" with the National Parks and Wildlife Service's oversight of kangaroo shooting by private land-holders, ""as evidenced by the fact that they could not provide accurate figures on how many kangaroos have been legally culled."" The committee wants the auditor general to assess whether the NSW government is meeting its own legal obligations under the Biodiversity Act. It also raised concerns about transparency and policing of the commercial program, which is managed by the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment. But some evidence never made it to the inquiry. Internal documents leaked to the ABC reveal the department's own staff have voiced concerns about the way the kangaroo management program is policed. A 2019 audit found it was ""impossible"" to work out whether the number of kangaroo carcasses processed at different points in the industry chain were ""true and accurate"". ""This is a significant finding, as it … may undermine any positions taken in relation to the legitimacy and sustainability of the industry,"" the audit found. If commercial shooters don't kill kangaroos with a shot to the head, it has to be reported. But the audit found in 70 per cent of cases where that happened, the department took no compliance action. There were no licence suspensions or prosecutions between 2015 and 2019, and infringement notices decreased fivefold over the same period, from an average of 50 per year to just 10. Animal welfare volunteers are devastated after 14 kangaroos were found dead on the New South Wales South Coast, but a sole surviving joey is on the mend. The department declined an interview with the ABC. In a statement, the department said it had issued 16 penalty notices in the 2021 financial year. Leaked emails from the department's senior management reveal there were 785 reporting breaches from licensed animal dealers in 2020. Only one was issued with a penalty notice. The department said in early 2021 it introduced a new approach where licensees were unable to renew licences unless their returns were up to date. In a statement, a department spokesman said its Kangaroo Management Program included ""quotas, compliance, animal welfare and population conservation"" measures. It said this ensured the program's ""integrity and transparency"" and that it was confident its scientific methods to estimate kangaroo populations were ""robust and precise"". The Kangaroo Industry Association's President, Ray Borda, said the commercial trade was committed to transparency. He said it was the department's responsibility to regulate the commercial program. ""The people that should be out there checking it are the people who make the rules and regulations – that's the Department of Environment, or safe food; they've gotta be out there policing people and fining them,"" Mr Borda told 7.30. ""If that information isn't shared with us, we can't do anything about it."" Ray Borda said it made no sense to only regulate the commercial trade, while farmers shooting kangaroos on their own land had open slather. ""There is no auditing and inspection, there is no traceability, there is no tagging, there's nothing there,"" he told 7.30. ""So I don't know how they can estimate how many animals are taken, whether they've been taken humanely or not."" Footage shared with the ABC from a landholder in central west NSW in 2018 showed a farmer wounding a female kangaroo in the body, with a joey visible in her pouch. The eyewitness who filmed the encounter didn't want to be identified, but said the farmer then dragged the wounded kangaroo behind his ute. Ashley Neill said he has also witnessed this kind of behaviour from landholders. ""I have a seen it with [my] own eyes: kangaroos with broken legs through shotgun, can't hop, can't get to water, can't feed,"" he said. ""They may survive for two or three days in the middle of summer. ""If they're female, nine times out of 10 they've got joeys. ""They suffer a hell of a lot and die in agony. ""And they will die of starvation and thirst."" He said the licensing program for landholders allowed cruelty at scale, and needed to be overhauled. ""The old-style farmer, he doesn't mind a few roos hopping around his farm,"" he said. ""If they're plague proportion, well, they do something about it, which is understandable, because they have to make a living, same as everyone else. ""But a lot of properties, in my eyes, they're not in plague proportion. ""And they cull kangaroos for the sake of doing it. ""I have spoken to kangaroo management about it, with no response. ""And this is why I'm sitting here today, to see if we can get a response."" The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service is the agency responsible for prosecution of animal cruelty against kangaroos from private landholders. It's under the same department that controls the commercial program and told the parliamentary inquiry it does not observe culls to monitor compliance. Over the past 10 years, the agency said one case of animal cruelty had been taken to court, and five warning letters had been issued. ""I don't understand how you can be issuing licences to destroy animals, to destroy wildlife without having an overall management plan for the future of that species,"" Ms Cusack said. ""You're not allowed to shoot a snake, but you can go out and knock over 2,000 kangaroos. ""You can do it as a social activity with all your mates on the back of trucks. ""And there's nobody checking you, other than probably concerned neighbours seeing what's going on, making reports to the department, which then doesn't appear to have any capacity to investigate."" Grazier Leon Zanker disagreed that landholders were resorting to cruelty. ""I absolutely reject that is commonplace among landholders, certainly that I know,"" Mr Zanker said. ""You're trying to highlight a very, very small percentage of what happens and blow it out of proportion."" The western district pastoralist has run cattle, sheep and now goats on his property outside of White Cliffs for the past 40 years, and gave evidence to the parliamentary inquiry. ""It's not about extinction or elimination,"" he said. ""It's purely about management of the number of kangaroos to be in sync with the ability of the landscape to support them."" If you have a tip, contact regionalinvestigations@abc.net.au. The parliamentary committee has asked Environment Minister Matt Kean to consider the kangaroo inquiry's recommendations before he signs off on the next five-year kangaroo management plan. In a statement, the minister's office said it would respond after it carefully considered all of the report's findings and recommendations. That response is due in April 2022. Ms Cusack wants the department to be stripped of the responsibility to manage kangaroo populations in NSW, and for the ""entire governance framework"" to be ""rethought"". ""We clearly need to recalibrate our policies, because the idea of losing this species of kangaroos and wallabies is just horrific."" Watch this story on 7.30 tonight on ABC TV and iview.

313,They're the giant fertilisers of the ocean — and they eat more than we thought,environment," Science Whales eat up to a third of their body weight each day, helping the environment more than we give them credit for Whales are the biggest animals on Earth, so it makes sense that they have big appetites. But their ability to suck up krill and tiny fish in their gullets as they glide through the oceans is much greater than we previously thought, a new study has found. Each day, baleen whales, which include species such as humpbacks, minke and the mighty blue whale, consume between 5 and 30 per cent of their body mass. That's three times more food each year than we've measured in the past, according to research published today in the journal Nature. By underestimating how much these giants of the sea eat, scientists say we may have also underestimated their role in maintaining healthy oceans today, as well as the impact extensive whaling in the early 20th century had on their food sources such as krill. ""Our results say that if we restore whale populations to pre-whaling levels seen at the beginning of the 20th century, we'll restore a huge amount of lost function to ocean ecosystems,"" said study co-author Nicolas Pyenson of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. ""It may take a few decades to see the benefit, but it's the clearest read yet about the massive role of large whales on our planet."" The more that whales eat, the more they poo. Whales act like giant fertilisers of the ocean, said Vanessa Pirotta, a marine ecologist at Macquarie University. ""Whales feed in one area, and poo in another … so they are able to move huge amounts of biomass from one area to another,"" said Dr Pirotta, who was not involved in the research. Their poo helps to suspend key nutrients such as iron on the surface of water, which in turn fuel blooms of microscopic organisms at the bottom of the food chain called phytoplankton. ""Some people refer to this as the iron pump,"" Dr Pirotta said. The humpback whales we see in Australia primarily travel to the Southern Ocean to feast on small crustaceans known as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). ""Antarctic krill is incredibly important for these animals as it provides their main food source,"" Dr Pirotta said. Between 1910 and 1970, whale numbers in the Southern Ocean plunged as a result of whaling. It had been thought that krill would explode as a result, but that didn't happen – a phenomenon known as the krill paradox. The decline makes no sense unless you factor in the role of whales as mobile fertilisers, said the study's lead author Matthew Savoca of Stanford University. ""These whales were seeding productivity out in the open Southern Ocean and there was very little to recycle this fertiliser once whales were gone,” Dr Savoca said. To get a better estimation of how much whales eat, the team tracked 321 whales spanning seven different species swimming in the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern Oceans. Using camera and motion sensor systems stuck on with suction caps, they monitored when the whales fed. They also used drone images of 105 of the whales to work out each animal's size. Each animal's length could then be used to estimate its body mass and how much water it sucked up through its mouth. Once they had located where the whales were feeding, the researchers used sound waves to estimate the size and density of the food swarms the whales were feeding on. According to their estimates, for example, an adult eastern North Pacific blue whale, which can grow up to 27 metres and weighs more than 45 tonnes, likely consumes 16 tonnes of krill per day during its foraging season. The team also looked back through historic records to calculate how much food whales in the Southern Ocean would've consumed prior to whaling. ""We calculate that pre-whaling populations of [baleen whales] annually consumed 430 million tonnes of Antarctic krill,"" they wrote. That's twice the current estimated total biomass of krill in the Southern Ocean and more than twice the global catch of marine fisheries today. A diet that big would've produced a whopping 12,000 tonnes of iron, 10 times the amount whales currently recycle in the Southern Ocean. In the pre-whaling era, observers noted the seas were red with krill and water spouts could be seen from horizon to horizon. The return of whales would help improve ocean ecosystems, Dr Pirotta said. ""If you have more whales feeding then you'll have the return of nutrients and that iron pump in the ocean, so in essence you'll have more fertilisation happening,"" she said. But the question is whether the number of whales — and krill —  can return to pre-whaling levels. When we think of marine biologists, we don't think of them shooting whales, but that's exactly what some are doing to study Antarctica's changing environment. Dr Pirotta said some species, such as the humpbacks she studies, have bounced back in Australian waters. ""Their numbers have fortunately recovered quite well, but there are still other populations of other baleen whales around the world which have not recovered post whaling,"" she said. ""There are a number of factors in that, one of those being food availability. But also us as humans, we are limiting their recovery due to anthropogenic impacts such as entanglements, fishing gear and ship strike."" Changing climate can also play a role in the movement of whales and the abundance of their food. ""We do know that climate change has the potential to change where prey is distributed, which will have flow-on effects for those animals that rely on those [prey],"" Dr Pirotta said.

314,"""Fire sale"" or fair price? Questions over Central Coast land sale",environment,"  Questions raised about Central Coast Council's sale of environmental land Environmental groups claim a large parcel of environmentally sensitive land on the New South Wales Central Coast may have been sold for millions of dollars less than its true value. The financially stricken Central Coast Council is in the process of selling 144 hectares of environmentally sensitive bushland on Thompson Vale Road at Doyalson as part of its asset sale program. The council would not reveal the price tag,  but RP Data recently had it listed for $5.5 million. The Community Environment Network (CEN) believes the land has potentially high biodiversity value and has questioned why it appears to be such a ""massive giveaway"". ""How can you sell a piece of land for $5 million when potentially it's worth $30 million?"" said John Asquith from the CEN. ""We are bewildered by it."" Council identified the land as a natural asset as part of its own biodiversity strategy last year. Mr Asquith believes this means it could be worth between $22 and $34 million in biodiversity credits, which may be used to offset other developments in the area. He said the calculations were based on a recent land sale in Western Sydney, where $69 million was paid for a parcel earmarked as a biodiversity offset. It is not the first time the Doyalson land, and its value have been under the spotlight. The site was initially bought by Wyong Council from the Terrace Towers group in 2015 for $7 million – more than double a NSW valuer-general valuation. The CEN has called on council to halt the sale and carry out a due diligence review. But according to its Administrator Rik Hart, ""it's too late"". ""Contracts have been exchanged and settlement is due next year"" Mr Hart said. He said he would not reveal the price until then but said it was an assumption that the land was being sold off cheaply. Mr Hart said the land zoning would not change and described the sale process as ""clear (and) transparent"". ""CEN has come to the party very late. It's been through the process,"" he said. The CEN disagrees, arguing Council's previous administrator declared that no environmental land would be sold-off. Suspended independent councillor and deputy mayor Jane Smith said she also raised concern about the land's sale at a council meeting a year ago. Locals were not happy when the administrator confirmed on ABC Local Radio that a buyer had been found for the property. ""It sounds like we're having a fire sale,"" Dennis said. Carrie texted: ""Council should know the history and environmental value of this land. Sounds very secretive."" John Asquith fears that if the land is developed, even with the best technology, the pollution running into Tuggerah Lakes would increase by 600 per cent. The CEN has raised the issue with the NSW Local Government Minister, Shelley Hancock, as well as the Commissioner overseeing an ongoing public inquiry into Central Coast Council's financial collapse.

315,World leaders agree to stop deforestation by 2030,environment,"  US, Brazil, Russia join more than 100 world leaders pledging to end deforestation by 2030 World leaders will conclude a two-day climate summit on Tuesday with a multibillion-dollar pledge to end deforestation by 2030, a date too far away for campaigners who want action sooner to save the planet's lungs. The pledge was to be issued at the UN's COP26 conference, which will continue for another fortnight to try to craft national plans to forestall the most devastating impacts of global warming. However, the summit's chair, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said the agreement on deforestation was pivotal to the overarching ambition of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""These great teeming ecosystems — these cathedrals of nature — are the lungs of our planet,"" he was expected to say in Glasgow, according to Downing Street. ""Forests support communities, livelihoods and food supply, and absorb the carbon we pump into the atmosphere. They are essential to our very survival. ""With today's unprecedented pledges, we will have a chance to end humanity's long history as nature's conqueror, and instead become its custodian."" The pledge, which includes Australia as a signatory, is backed by almost $US20 billion ($26.6b) in public and private funding, and is endorsed by more than 100 leaders representing more than 85 per cent of the world's forests, the UK government said. The leaders include those of forest-rich Brazil and Russia — both condemned by activists for accelerating their own rates of deforestation — along with US President Joe Biden and others. President Joko Widodo of resource-blessed Indonesia said his own archipelago's rainforests, mangroves, seas and peatlands were key to restricting climate change. ""We are committed to protecting these critical carbon sinks and our natural capital for future generations,"" he was reported to have said in a UK government statement. ""We call on all countries to support sustainable development paths that strengthen the livelihoods of communities — especially indigenous, women and smallholders."" The pledge to ""halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030"" encompasses promises to secure the rights of indigenous peoples, and recognise ""their role as forest guardians"". However, while Mr Johnson said it was ""unprecedented"", a UN climate gathering in New York in 2014 issued a similar declaration to halve the rate of deforestation by 2020, and end it by 2030. Nevertheless, trees continued to be cut down on an industrial scale, not least in the Amazon under the far-right government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Almost a quarter of all man-made emissions of carbon dioxide can be attributed to land use activity such as logging, deforestation and farming. Humans have already cut down half of all Earth's forests, a practice doubly harmful for the climate when CO2-sucking trees are replaced with livestock or monoculture crops. Greenpeace criticised the Glasgow initiative for effectively giving the green light to ""another decade of deforestation"". ""Indigenous peoples are calling for 80 per cent of the Amazon to be protected by 2025, and they're right, that's what's needed,"" said Greenpeace Brazil executive director Carolina Pasquali. ""The climate and the natural world can't afford this deal,"" she said. Many studies have shown that the best way of protecting forests worldwide is to keep them under the management of locals with generations of preservation knowledge. ""We will be looking for concrete evidence of a transformation in the way funds are invested,"" said Tuntiak Katan Jua from the COICA indigenous organisation. ""If 80 per cent of what is proposed is directed to supporting land rights and the proposals of Indigenous and local communities, we will see a dramatic reversal in the current trend that is destroying our natural resources,"" he said.

316,"David Attenborough issues hopeful message at COP26, says humans are 'powerful enough to save' the planet",environment,"  David Attenborough addresses world leaders at COP26 in Glasgow, saying humans are powerful enough to address climate change British naturalist and documentary maker Sir David Attenborough has issued a rallying cry to leaders at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, saying the world was looking to them to oversee the recovery of the planet. Sir David, who was a ""people's advocate"" to the COP26 conference, said he had witnessed ""a terrible decline"" during his 95 years of life, but was confident that the next generation could and should see ""a wonderful recovery"". ""Our burning of fossil fuels, our destruction of nature, our approach to industry, construction and learning, are releasing carbon into the atmosphere at an unprecedented pace and scale,"" he told the conference. ""We are already in trouble."" He called on the world leaders to step up. ""It's easy to forget that ultimately the climate emergency comes down to a single number — the concentration of carbon in our atmosphere,"" Sir David said. On our current trajectory, we will heat the world by 1.5C in less than a decade, the United Nation's climate change panel has found. And if we don't act now, cooling the world will be increasingly hard. ""The people alive now are the generation to come, [and] will look at this conference and consider one thing: Did that number stop rising and start to drop as a result of commitments made here? ""There's every reason to believe that the answer can be yes."" Sir David also raised the issue of inequality, saying people in developing countries ""who've done the least to cause this problem are being the hardest hit"". He said cooperation would be needed to tackle the issue. ""We are, after all, the greatest problem solvers to have ever existed on Earth,"" he said. ""If working apart, we are a force powerful enough to destabilise our planet. Surely working together, we are powerful enough to save it."" Read the full transcript of David Attenborough's speech: As you spend the next two weeks debating, negotiating, persuading and compromising, as you surely must, it's easy to forget that ultimately the emergency climate comes down to a single number — the concentration of carbon in our atmosphere. The measure that greatly determines global temperatures and the changes in that one number is the clearest way to chart our own story. For it defines our relationship with our world. For much of humanity's ancient history, that number bounced wildly between 180 and 300 (parts per million). And so too, did global temperatures. It was a brutal and unpredictable world. At times, our ancestors existed only in tiny numbers. But just over 10,000 years ago, that number suddenly stabilised and with it, Earth's climate. We found ourselves in an unusually benign period with predictable seasons and reliable weather. For the first time, civilisation was possible and we wasted no time in taking advantage of that. Everything we've achieved in the last 10,000 years was enabled by the stability in this time. The global temperature over this period has not wavered over this time by more than +/- 1 degree Celsius. Until now. Our burning of fossil fuels, our destruction of nature, our approach to industry, construction and learning, are releasing carbon into the atmosphere at an unprecedented pace and scale. We are already in trouble. The stability we all depend on is breaking. This story is one of inequality as well as instability. Today, those who've done the least to cause this problem are being the hardest hit. Ultimately all of us will feel the impact, some of which are now unavoidable. Is this how our story is due to end? A tale of the smartest species doomed by that all too-human characteristic of failing to see the bigger picture in pursuit of short-term goals. Perhaps the fact the people most affected by climate change are not some imagined future generation, but young people alive today. Perhaps that will give us the impetus we need to rewrite our story, to turn this tragedy into a triumph. We are, after all, the greatest problem solvers to have ever existed on Earth. We now understand this problem, we know how to stop the number rising and put it in reverse. We must halt carbon emissions this decade. We must recapture billions of tonnes of carbon from the air. We must fix our sights of keeping 1.5 degrees in reach. A new industrial revolution powered by millions of sustainable innovations is essential and is indeed already beginning. We will all share in the benefits of affordable clean energy, healthy air and enough food to sustain us all. Nature is a key ally, whenever we restore the wild it will recapture carbon and help us bring back balance to our planet. As we work to build a better world, we must acknowledge no nation has completed its development because no advanced nation is yet sustainable. All have a journey still to complete so all that nations have a good standard of living and a modest footprint. We again have to learn together how to achieve this, ensuring none are left behind. We must use this opportunity to create a more equal world and our motivation should not be fear, but hope. It comes down to this, the people alive now are the generation to come, will look at this conference and consider one thing: Did that number stop rising and start to drop as a result of commitments made here? There's every reason to believe that the answer can be yes. If working apart, we are a force powerful enough to destabilise our planet. Surely working together, we are powerful enough to save it. In my lifetime, I've witnessed a terrible decline. In your lifetimes, you could and should witness a wonderful recovery. That desperate hope ladies and gentleman, delegates, excellencies, is why the world is looking to you and why you are here. Thank you.

318,'I just threw up': Severe weather triggers terrified residents ,environment,"  Latest storms terrify Springfield Lakes residents a year after horror Halloween hail When Luise Manning heard what sounded like her new roofing rattling during a recent storm, she found herself hunched over, vomiting and dry retching from stress. ""When I heard crashing sounds, like [steel] roofing peeling off, I didn't know whether it was my neighbour's shed ... [or] my roof,"" Ms Manning told ABC Radio Brisbane. ""I couldn't go outside, and I just threw up. ""Literally vomited for a good five minutes. ""I could not stop that feeling. ""I know people have said that they get anxious when storms hit."" Twelve months ago, Ms Manning's Springfield Lakes home was among more than 2,000 damaged when giant hail battered the region, leaving a trail of destruction from Rosewood to Logan. Tennis-ball sized hailstones left 520 homes uninhabitable, according to Queensland Reconstruction Association's chief executive Brendan Moon. ""That number is now 21 and of those 21, 16 have works started on them,"" Mr Moon said. QRA's latest figures show that approximately 1,935 houses have been repaired so far. When Ms Manning and her family returned to their home directly after the event, they found the roof destroyed, shattered glass inside and outside, as well as water from the hot water system running through the house. Their furniture was damaged and their carpet soaked. ""I think the anxiety in getting the tarps on was high on my list and I ordered one through SES on the day it happened,"" she said. While she was able to get a tarpaulin on her house in a matter of days, others waited weeks for SES volunteers with the appropriate clearance to install them. She said the wait to get tarpaulins installed on houses frustrated residents with following rainfall and storms only exacerbating the problem. Ms Manning's roof had to be replaced and the inside of her house was left with severe water damage, made worse when a second storm hit on the day her roof was being repaired. She and her family returned to their home a few months ago but she said many of her neighbours were still wrangling insurance claims, tradespeople and declining mental health. ""I still have at least five people in my street, of 54 houses, that are still not back in their homes,"" Ms Manning said. ""You're talking about families who have to live through that process, constantly having rain coming into their houses and some of them, their houses haven't even been started. ""I think for some people who are living in homes that are damaged ... I think those people are quite concerned and wondering why it's taking so long to fix their roof. ""Without this feeling of shelter and feeling safe, many people in the community are very anxious, and are very concerned when a storm hits."" Ipswich Deputy Mayor, Councillor Nicole Jonic, is the head of the recovery task force for the event and urged community members who were struggling, to access the free financial advice and mental health support available through services such as Lifeline, Uniting Care, Salvation Army and Givit. ""I feel for everyone who is struggling from the trauma,"" Ms Jonic said. ""[Support services] are finding there is that there is a high need for assistance for people with mental health [issues], but the community is hesitant to ask for it."" Additionally, Mr Moon said there were safety nets in place for those in the community still working to finalise insurance and repairs. ""If people are unable to access assistance, you have the community recovery hotline and I would ask people to ring that hotline if you are still recovering from that event,"" Mr Moon said. ""Similarly, the Insurance Council [of Australia] also has a consumer hotline as well, if there is still difficulty with rebuilding, tradespeople [or] insurance assessments."" QRA have visited the site and residents every three months after the event, making a final visit in September to monitor the recovery. ""I'd say every event throws us a different challenge and this time around we had the impact of COVID and the availability of tradespeople ... also physical supplies, [such as] steel and timber,"" Mr Moon said. But the Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC) have previously warned many of these issues are likely to continue into this year's storm season as well. ""The Queensland Building and Construction Commission ... is aware of the ongoing shortage of some building materials and skilled trades in the residential construction industry in Queensland, and Australia-wide,"" the QBCC said in a statement. The QBCC said the shortage, which was amplified by the pandemic, had the potential to impact everyone in the supply chain, from suppliers and builders, to subcontractors, employees and consumers. With storm season already underway, residents are being urged to ""get ready"". The Insurance Council of Australia classed last Halloweens' hail event as a catastrophe, but state and federal government did not class it as a natural disaster and as a result, residents missed out on additional support that could have seen the community recovery sooner. Ms Jonic said to ensure history did not repeat itself, definitions of what constitutes a natural disaster needed to be revised. ""Our weather events are changing and classification of 'natural disaster' probably should naturally change as well,"" she said. ""So, if it went to a natural disaster from a federal level, then the army would have been out, instead of just the SES. ""A lot more roofs would have been tarped efficiently."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. In a statement, a spokesperson from QRA said local governments were primarily responsible for managing disaster events in their local government areas. ""If local governments identify gaps in their capacity or capability to manage a disaster, they can request support from their District Disaster Management Group (DDMG). ""This allows for the rapid mobilisation of resources at a local, regional or district level. ""If additional assistance or resources are needed, this can be provided by the state through the QDMC.""

319,Pope tells world leaders 'radical' action on climate change needed,environment,"  The political leaders who meet at the upcoming COP26 climate change summit must give ""concrete hope"" to future generations that they are taking action to effectively tackle climate change, Pope Francis has said. ""It is essential that each of us be committed to this urgent change of direction,"" Pope Francis said in a message broadcast on BBC Radio. ""The political decision makers who will meet at COP26 in Glasgow are urgently summoned to provide effective responses to the present ecological crisis and in this way to offer concrete hope to future generations."" The pandemic and climate change offered a ""real chance for change,"" he said. The pontiff is scheduled to meet US President Joe Biden at the Vatican on Friday (local time), where they are expected to discuss COVID-19, climate change and poverty. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she expected a ""warm and constructive dialogue"" between the two leaders. ""Climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed our deep vulnerability and raised numerous doubts and concerns about our economic systems and the way we organise our societies,"" Pope Francis said in the message. ""These crises present us with the need to take radical decisions that are not always easy. At the same time, moments of difficulty like these also present opportunities that we must not waste."" Francis warned against ""isolationism, protectionism and exploitation"", urging leaders to ""build together"". The government has committed to reaching net zero by 2050, and says it is on track to beat its 2030 emissions targets. But what will it take to turn Australia green? Prime Minister Scott Morrison has committed Australia to become carbon-neutral by 2050, a target already adopted by most nations heading to COP26. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the summit was unbelievably important, but the outcome was in the balance as talks would be difficult. Ahead of the last UN climate conference in Paris in 2015, Pope Francis released the first-ever ecological encyclical, in which he said the world's prevailing economic model had exploited the poor, ravaged Earth's resources, and turned the planet into an ""immense pile of filth"". The Vatican is sending a delegation to the summit, but the 84-year-old pope will not be going following surgery earlier this year.

321,Loved-up pair of nesting birds halts construction at Bunbury water park  ,environment,"  Discovery of tiny pied oystercatchers and their nest halts construction at Bunbury water park Construction on a water park in Bunbury has been delayed after a bird species made a nest on the site. A nest and eggs from a pair of pied oystercatchers was discovered before construction was set to begin on a new splash park at a popular foreshore. A statement from the City of Bunbury, which is coordinating the project, said construction would not start until the chicks were born and the family left the area: ""The development of the highly-anticipated splash park has come to a halt after a loved-up pair of pied oystercatchers decided it was the prime location to build their nest. ""The feathered duo has taken up residence at the site until the impending birth of their chicks. ""Works will begin once the family has taken flight. ""We will keep you updated!"" Sue Kalab is the convenor of BirdLife in Bunbury and said she was pleased with the decision to pause the construction. ""I'm full of admiration [for the city's decision]. It's wonderful news that they are giving the birds a chance,"" she said. ""Because they're ground nesters, they're particularly vulnerable and their eggs are very well camouflaged. ""I think it's quite a privilege to have these birds nesting around the place."" WA-based naturalist and bird expert Eric McCrum says the pause in construction was unlikely to be long. ""Usually birds who nest on the ground, their babies are precocial,"" he said. ""Which means that as soon as they hatch out of the egg, their eyes are open, they can walk and generally after being shown what to eat, they can feed themselves. ""Luckily for the construction people, as soon as they hatch, these birds will not be hanging around in that one local area. They will likely be 100 or 200m away walking along the beach.""

322,"Fiji welcomes Australia's net zero by 2050 target, but other Pacific countries are sceptical",environment,"  Australia's net zero by 2050 target wins praise from Fiji's PM, attracts disappointment from across the Pacific Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama has made it very clear that he doesn't want any more excuses on climate action from big emitters, including Australia, when they gather for this year's global climate talks in Glasgow. Mr Bainimarama has previously said that he, and other Pacific islanders, want world leaders to pledge carbon emission cuts of 50 per cent or more by 2030. However, he has now welcomed the new climate policy announced by his ""friend"", Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Mr Morrison announced on Tuesday that Australia will join the bulk of the developed word in pursuing net zero emissions by 2050, but its formal target for 2030 remains unchanged: a 26–28 per cent reduction in emissions. But Mr Bainimarama — who will be one of a few Pacific leaders able to attend COP26, the UN's global climate talks that start on Sunday — said he would continue to push for ""high-emitting nations to halve emissions by 2030"". He described that as ""the only goal that can keep 1.5 [degree Celsius rise in temperatures] alive and keep low-lying island nations above water"". Other Pacific leaders have been more critical of Australia's new policy, lamenting what they see as a lack of ambition. The President of the Federated States of Micronesia, David Panuelo, said Australia's announcement was too vague and ""not quite clear"". ""To me, as a leader [who] sees climate change as an existential threat to our entire Pacific population, it's somewhat hollow,"" Mr Panuelo told the ABC. ""The more you read of Australia's nationally determined contributions plan, the less you know what they are really going to do,"" he said. ""I'm deeply concerned that, if Australia doesn't have that measurable commitment, it's going to hurt the credibility and the livelihood of the Pacific community."" Next week's talks in Glasgow have been described as the ""point of no return"" and the world's last chance stop rising temperatures to avoid catastrophic climate events, such as severe sea level rises, droughts and intense storms. Australia plans to cut its emissions by 2050 through the use of future technology such as hydrogen power and carbon capture and storage. Some of those technologies, including carbon capture and storage, remain largely unproven. Mr Panuelo is not impressed with the Australian government's reliance on such future technology. ""Technology is great, but some technology amounts to, in my view, public relations,"" he said. Anote Tong, a former president of Kiribati, a low-lying atoll nation in the Pacific, said Australia's plan doesn't go far enough to prevent a climate catastrophe for Pacific countries. ""We remain disappointed [because] 2050 [is] still a long way away … I think Australia really is not showing any leadership on the climate issue,"" Mr Tong told the ABC. He said Australia's lack of ambition might set the stage for other countries to water down the commitments reached at the COP26 talks in Glasgow. ""What Australia is doing, is encouraging everybody else not to do what needs to be done,"" Mr Tong said. The government has committed to reaching net zero by 2050, and says it is on track to beat its 2030 emissions targets. But what will it take to turn Australia green? ""For the Pacific Island countries who really are on the frontline of this of the challenge, this is extremely disappointing. We would have expected a lot more."" However, the Solomon Islands' lead climate negotiator, Chanel Iroi, was more diplomatic, welcoming Australia's announcement. But, he said, there was still room for improvement. ""I want to encourage Australia to meet the necessary steps … to ensure they continue to take the ambitious actions … because our obligation and ultimate aim is for the global goal … to ensure the 1.5C [maximum rise in temperatures] is achieved,"" he said.

323,Court rejects councils' battle with minister over toxic soil,environment,"  Supreme Court dismisses councils' battle with Victorian planning minister over Westgate toxic soil A Supreme Court justice has dismissed proceedings brought by two Victorian councils against the state planning minister over proposals to dump toxic soil in their regions. The Victorian government picked three locations last year as potential sites to dump toxic soil from the West Gate tunnel project, including a landfill at Ravenhall in Melton, and a former mine site at Maddingley near Bacchus Marsh in Moorabool Shire. The soil was found to be contaminated with per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, better known as PFAS — dangerous chemicals that have been widely used in firefighting foam. The local communities held protests against the proposals, and the matter was further complicated by the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) withdrawing its approval of environment management plans for the Ravenhall and Maddingley sites. The councils of Moorabool Shire and Melton City launched Supreme Court action seeking a judicial review of planning minister Richard Wynne's decision to allow for the potential dumping of toxic soil at Maddingley and Ravenhall, citing the EPA's revocation of the environment management plans A landfill site at Bulla in Melbourne's north-west was eventually chosen in June to dump the toxic soil from the multi-billion-dollar transport project, which was meant to be finished next year. Despite the decision, Moorabool and Melton councils pressed ahead with their judicial review. Justice Melinda Richards dismissed the proceedings today, saying Mr Wynne's decision to amend the state's planning act in last November was still valid as it was not entirely reliant on the EPA report, and that there were allowances for the report to be updated. ""While the minister was mistaken, because the (EPA) approval was not valid, his mistake did not involve an error of law,"" Justice Richards wrote in her findings. ""In addition, I was not persuaded that the mistake was material to the Minister's decision."" A hearing to decide costs will be held at a later date.

324,'COVID has bought us three weeks': The grim reality of our global warming situation,environment," Science Despite stronger promises, the world is set to overshoot climate targets, UN gap report finds The world is on track to hit 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100 despite stronger emissions reduction targets, the United Nations has said on the eve of global climate talks. The annual UN Emissions Gap report, released today, compares our current trajectory with where we need to be to keep warming to well below 2C, as per the Paris Agreement. Despite 120 countries strengthening their emissions reduction targets as of September 30 this year, the report authors said this was still not enough to avoid dangerous warming. To get on the ""least cost pathway"" to limiting warming to between 1.5C and 2C, they said the targets needed to cut a further 28 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases per year, beyond that pledged by the current 2030 commitments. This effectively amounted to halving global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, the authors said. The report projected 2021 emissions had bounced back to just shy of 2019's record levels. But Mark Howden from the Australian National University's Climate Change Institute said the data used was a few months old and he thought 2021 emissions would actually hit a new record high. ""It's a bit sad, but I think they've actually understated it,"" Professor Howden said. ""We've seen a firming up of emissions that are going to be higher post-COVID than before."" A separate report from the UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO), released yesterday, found that global average atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations hit a record high of 413.2 parts per million in 2020 — higher than at any other time in the past 2 million years. Today's report comes as countries prepare to head to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, which has been dubbed the world's ""last best chance"" to cap warming below 1.5-2C. Australia has joined the world in promising to make the nation carbon-neutral by 2050, ahead of a global climate change summit. ""There was still hope that COP26 could become a turning point on climate action,"" the authors wrote. According to the report, 120 countries responsible for 51 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions had submitted new nationally determined contributions (NDCs) ahead of Glasgow. Despite the shortfall in the commitments, the authors said if all countries kept their net-zero pledges and brought their 2030 targets in line with those pledges, that could potentially shave a further 0.5C off warming this century. COP26 will be a huge test for the mechanisms put in place under the Paris Agreement and the world's capacity to keep 1.5C of warming within reach, according to Wes Morgan, a researcher with the Climate Council and a research fellow with the Griffith Asia Institute. The initial targets set by each country at Paris in 2015 had the world on track for warming of 3C, Dr Morgan said. ""But Paris set up a process where we'd come together every five years to set new targets — that's what's called a ratchet mechanism."" ""What gives you hope is that over the last 18 months 120-plus countries have pledged to achieve net zero by 2050. That now covers more than half the global economy and that sends a huge market signal."" Prime Minister Scott Morrison committed Australia to a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 on Tuesday. Global annual emissions dropped 5.4 per cent in 2020. However, greenhouse gas emissions are cumulative, and the COVID-19 downturn has made barely a ripple in slowing warming, Professor Howden said. ""People ask does the reduction in emissions during COVID make much difference in terms of emissions projections? ""Effectively, COVID has bought us about three weeks in terms of when we'll hit 1.5C [warming]."" ""We got the behavioural change, but we didn't get the structural change."" Professor Howden said many, many researchers and analysts suggested that stimulating economic recovery post-COVID-19 could help fuel a transition to low-carbon infrastructure. However, according to the Emissions Gap report, between just 17-19 per cent of total recovery investments to May 2021 had been spent on projects that would lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The lowest spending had been typically in low-income countries. The opportunity to lead a post-COVID-19 green recovery is being squandered and studies have found that investment in fossil fuels has actually increased, Professor Howden said. While much attention will be on emissions reduction pledges and net-zero targets at COP26, Professor Howden said there were other important negotiations taking place, including financial commitments to help developing countries transition to low-carbon economies and to build resilience. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. ""Then there's the agendas around the global emissions trading market and ensuring effective rules there,"" he said. Well-regulated carbon trading schemes, for instance, can ensure developing countries are financially rewarded for conserving ecosystems such as rainforests, which act as carbon sinks. Australia's own Pacific neighbours are some of those that stand to be worst hit by climate change, and form a strong voting block within the UN, Dr Morgan said. ""At the UN climate talks every country gets one vote, whether you're Tuvalu or China. ""Pacific Island countries — their slogan is '1.5 to stay alive' — they see Glasgow as something of a last-ditch in their struggle for staying below that threshold. ""It will be the Pacific island countries and major powers like the US and UK working together to heap pressure on the laggards, and that includes Australia."" Ahead of COP26, United States special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry has been pushing for more countries to increase their emissions reduction targets. Speaking from Saudi Arabia on Monday, Mr Kerry said the challenge to decarbonise was not about politics or ideology, but science, and that we needed to accelerate our efforts over the next few years.

325,Environment Minister admits NSW not doing enough for koala population,environment,"  Environment Minister Matt Kean says NSW not doing enough for koala population The New South Wales Environment Minister has been pressed in a budget estimates hearing to explain the delay in rolling out his much-hyped $193 million koala strategy. During questioning from Labor's Penny Sharpe, Matt Kean was asked why there had been no progress since it was announced in June's state budget. ""There is very little detail about the $193 million; can you give us a break down of the expenditure of the policy?"" Ms Sharpe said. ""We'll give you the break down as part of the koala strategy, but it will focus on things like protecting koala habitat, it will focus on things like research and counting koalas and translocations,"" Mr Kean said. ""We'll be releasing that strategy as soon as possible."" Ms Sharpe asked the Minister why only four of the 26 recommendations from a 2018 strategy had been implemented. ""All we are really doing is looking at koalas, we are looking where their trees are and we are saving their genetic material,"" Ms Sharpe said. Mr Kean acknowledged the government was not doing enough. ""I agree with the proposition that you have put; we have not done good enough when it comes to protecting koalas, they are massively under threat,"" he said. ""The government could do a lot more and we will be announcing a very comprehensive plan that has been developed with some of the best scientists in the country, and that plan will be fully funded."" Mr Kean also revealed he was seeking additional advice from the state's Chief Scientist on how to protect NSW's last healthy koala population from developers in the Cumberland area south-west of Sydney. Last month the Land and Environment Court dismissed a bid to overturn development approval for a new estate between the Georges and Nepean rivers. Want more local news? Sign up to the ABC Illawarra weekly email newsletter Environment groups have raised concerns the developer will ignore the recommendation from the Chief Scientist to create a 450-metre koala corridor. ""I have asked [the Chief Scientist] to go and clarify exactly what those barriers are that would preserve those corridors,"" Mr Kean said. ""I don't have that advice yet — but I am happy to provide it at an appropriate time. ""I continue to make it clear to Lendlease and all the developers down there that they need to act within the Chief Scientist's advice to save those koalas."" Ms Sharpe asked the Minister about the impact of the government's delay in reviewing a series of regulations, including the Private Native Forestry Code of Practice, the Koala State Environmental Planning Policy (SEPP) and the Land Management Native Vegetation Code. ""Are you concerned Minister that the lag time in adjusting all these issues is actually allowing more koala habitat to be removed?"" ""Yes, I am."" In response to further questions about the regulations, Mr Kean said any attempt to remove the prohibition on logging core koala habitat in the Private Native Forestry Code of Practice would be a ""line in the sand for me"". He said there were ""major sticking points"" in the negotiations over the remake of the code, but during questioning from independent MLC Justin Field he refused to say he was facing opposition from the Nationals. Mr Kean said he had signed the terms of reference for the review of the Land Management Native Vegetation Code, and said the review was now awaiting the signature of Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall for approval. Mr Kean praised investigative work by the media, including The Guardian, in highlighting serious failures in the state's biodiversity offset scheme. As a result, a parliamentary inquiry has been launched into the scheme and some actions have been referred to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Mr Kean said he had also implemented several internal government reviews. ""I think it's clear there needs to be root-and-branch reform of the scheme, both from a policy level and an integrity level, and we will be doing both.""

326,analysis: Reaching net zero carbon emissions to require Herculean effort,environment,"  Australian people and businesses have led the way on emissions reduction, but getting to net zero will take an even bigger effort Something to be proud of, huh? Now that we are hurtling towards a net zero emissions target by 2050, it's good to know we are easily on track to beat our 2030 Paris targets. And, if the numbers indeed can be believed, it's all down to the magnificent leadership from … er, you. Ordinary Australians and impatient business leaders years ago abandoned all hope of any kind of coherent energy and climate policy from Canberra and went it alone. The government has committed to reaching net zero by 2050, and says it is on track to beat its 2030 emissions targets. But what will it take to turn Australia green? Despite being one of the world's biggest exporters of fossil fuels, such as coal and liquefied natural gas, we somehow also took the mantle of the world's biggest uptake in rooftop solar energy generation. A quarter of Australian homes now produce electricity, for use at home and feeding back into the grid during peak times. Combine that with the early shutdown of some old, coal-burning steam engines in Victoria's Yallourn Valley and the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and that's the reason for the better-than-expected emissions reduction performance. The shutdown of the 1,700-megawatt Hazelwood plant in the Yallourn Valley in 2017 by French owner Engie created a political storm, but it was nothing compared to the war that erupted over the proposed scuttling of the 2,000-megawatt Liddell plant in the Hunter by AGL next year. Since 2012, almost one-third of our coal-fired power stations have shut. For a decade, the economics have rendered them obsolete. Even without Prime Minister Scott Morrison's historic capitulation to an emissions reduction target, there's almost no chance another would ever be built. Those that remain are likely to be shut down earlier than planned. You'll be hearing quite a bit about emissions targets and how we've performed against them in the next few weeks, months and years. Like all statistics, they can be manipulated any way you want to tell you whatever you want to hear. Take the Kyoto agreement in 1997: By threatening to walk out, we bludgeoned the conference into agreeing to a target that allowed us to dramatically increase our emissions — by 8 per cent — when everyone else committed to a 5.2 per cent reduction. The deal between the Nationals and the Liberals to secure a net zero emissions by 2050 target is mostly under wraps, but this is what we know about it so far and when we'll know more. The deal, known as the Australia Clause, was done in the final moments of the conference after the translators had left. We even moved our starting base on how to measure performance so the numbers would look better. The European Union back then called it immoral. It gets worse. We've since tried to use our better-than-targeted performance as a credit in the Paris agreement for 2030, which now is in force. But that was then. While the Prime Minister was short on details on how we will actually achieve net zero, the big positive out of his commitment to an emissions reduction target is that, for the first time in three decades, Australian climate and energy policy no longer is divided along party lines. Instead of an ideological weapon to be used as a cheap grab for votes, we are likely to have policy stability. While almost all the advancements in renewable energy technology and emissions reductions have been driven by households and business as an economic imperative, the removal of the federal government as a roadblock on the environment and on power generation will provide what has long been lacking: certainty and confidence. It will take an enormous amount of effort and investment to achieve net zero emissions. Hydrogen is expensive to produce, extraordinarily dirty to make, and the market is small. The easiest way to make it is by burning fossil fuels. The most expensive is by removing it from water — the 'H' in good old H2O — but it is the cleanest. And ,if you use electricity from renewables to drive the process, it's an incredibly clean fuel that can be transported and stored. Andrew Forrest went on a green hydrogen blitz this week, announcing multi-billion-dollar plans for renewable energy exports. But just how feasible are these grand plans? Two things have to happen. You need to get what is known as economies of scale because the more you make, the cheaper it becomes to produce. That also requires industry and consumers on a global scale to make the switch. None of this will happen overnight but, as America switches off its coal-fired power stations — which it is aiming to do completely within 14 years — the market will deteriorate and prices will slide, putting producers under pressure. Given we are the world's biggest exporter, a devastating decrease in demand will hit hard, whether we signed up for COP26 or not. Coal often is cited as a cheap form of energy, but that's only because the biggest cost is excluded; the devastating impact it has on air quality and the choking effect on climate. If we are serious about net zero emissions, the federal government needs to get cracking on how best to transition communities in coal regions towards other forms of energy export.

328,"Conservationists are buying back blocks in the Daintree, but not all the locals are happy",environment," Science Decades-old conflict to develop Daintree still flaring up in Queensland's steamy far north In the Daintree rainforest, cassowaries raise their chicks above the thick detritus of the forest floor. Elusive Bennett's tree-kangaroos make their homes in the canopies above, while crocodiles lie in wait in the estuaries and rivers that push into the forest from the Coral Sea. Home to an assembly of flora and fauna not found anywhere else on Earth and fringed in the east by a coral reef, the Daintree in far north Queensland is believed to be the oldest continual patch of tropical rainforest in the world, with some of its plants dating back to the earliest-known flowering plants, more than 110 million years ago. In 1988, after years of clashes between conservationists, police and developers, and in recognition of its unique and irreplaceable ecosystems, the Daintree was given World Heritage status, largely putting an end to logging and broadscale clearing. For many who had taken up the fight against the bulldozers in the early 80s, this was the culmination of years of struggle. And for those of us who have visited the Daintree since or admired it from afar, we'd be forgiven for thinking the conflict stopped there. But wheels set in motion by the Joh Bjelke-Petersen government in the 80s mean parts of the Daintree are still being sold off privately today. Conservationists are racing to buy the blocks to guarantee they can't be developed. But some locals say that's damaging their small community, and that they're having their lives dictated by people in cities far away. Driving a vehicle off the ferry onto the northern bank of the Daintree River, the patchy farmland of the south is replaced by lush, verdant forest. It's here that many people think the Daintree wilderness begins, says Kelvin Davies. ""When people go north of the Daintree river, they think they're in the national park. A lot of Australians are shocked to find that they're still on private land."" Mr Davies heads up Rainforest 4: one of several conservation groups raising money to try to stop the Daintree from being cleared. In 1982, the Bjelke-Petersen government backed the development of a subdivision of rural, residential land in the south-eastern Daintree. Mr Bjelke-Petersen, an outspoken critic of the conservation movement, said at the time that his government wanted people to go and see the area. ""We just don't want to leave it for hippies to go in there and grow their drugs. I have no intentions of delegating over to Canberra, or the World Heritage, part of our state,"" Mr Bjelke-Petersen said. The subdivision went ahead despite protests, Mr Davies says. ""They created 50 kilometres of road and the subdivision was created. It was 1,137 blocks that were carved up."" Many of those blocks were subsequently bought back by the Douglas Shire Council and under the Daintree Rescue Package: $23 million over three years provided by the federal and Queensland governments from 1994 to help protect the region. But living in the Daintree is hard — it can rain up to nine months of the year, and can be bone dry at other times. Many buyers bought but never developed. Others managed to clear a house pad or build a shed, but not much else. Since then, there has been a slow but steady trickle of the blocks back onto the market, being bought by both conservationists and private buyers. Rainforest 4, run from northern New South Wales by Mr Davies, has managed to raise enough funds to purchase 16 of the blocks in the past two years. And they're currently raising money for three more under contract. But COVID has seen a surge in southern investors outbidding them on the market, he says. ""There's been an enormous amount of people rushing up to the Daintree at the moment to buy these blocks,"" Mr Davies says. ""We're raising money, so it does take us a few months to buy the blocks, and if someone's got cash, they can out-compete us."" When Rainforest 4 did a study last year, they identified 207 blocks that still hadn't been developed. ""It's probably been reduced down to 190 with the buyback and others being cleared for development,"" Mr Davies says. They're aiming to raise money to buy as many, if not all the remaining blocks, and to hand them back to the Eastern Kuku Yalanji traditional owners. Rainforest 4 haven't been raising money alone. After fundraising for various rainforest and conservation charities over the past decade, James Stanton-Cooke and his partner Jess Clarke started their organisation HalfCut in 2017. As the name suggests, every August Jimmy HalfCut, as he's also known, and Jess raise money by joining with volunteers to shave, plait, dye, or follically alter anything from an eyebrow to half their body hair. ""The best we've seen is one bloke shaved right down half his chest, then got in the budgie smugglers and mowed half the lawn,"" Mr Stanton-Cooke says. ""Our whole thing is how do we get conversations started by being half cut? People are like, 'What's going on here?' And we're like, 'This is what's going on'."" In 2020, HalfCut were able to raise more than $360,000 for Rainforest 4, and in 2021, it's skyrocketed to just shy of $1 million. The fact that Rainforest 4 are handing the land back to Indigenous ownership is important to Mr Stanton-Cooke. ""Our question from here is, 'How do we get the rest of the Daintree back?' I think we can do it in seven years,"" he says. Lyn Johnson is a Jalunji woman and chairperson of the Jabalbina Aboriginal Corporation, which manages the native title of the Eastern Kuku Yalanji people. And she's a big fan of the work of HalfCut and Rainforest 4. ""There were two blocks, that was the initial [buyback], then it's gone from there … it's just multiplied,"" she says. ""Jimmy HalfCut and Kelvin and all the donors — they're the ones with the big hearts and we love them all, and they’ve got the heart of the Daintree with them that they love. ""I'm always surprised that people are so generous and without them, it wouldn't be possible."" After the momentous handback of the Daintree to the Eastern Kuku Yalanji traditional owners in a ceremony in September, Ms Johnson says they're still working through the details of how the buybacks will be incorporated into their management. ""There are a lot of special spots — some of those properties are for kurranji, which is our cassowary — so they get handed back to us, but also QPWS (Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service)."" ""So we'll be co-managing with them in the future."" But not everyone is happy with how the conservation groups have been going about buying back the land. Lawrence Mason is a cafe owner who runs tours around Cape Tribulation. He says he's fine with groups buying back some of the land that would have been conserved anyway, but rehabilitating developed blocks for conservation threatens the community. ""[Conservation groups] have written that on their Facebook page, that they want to buy back all the land in the Daintree. Well, my daughter is fourth generation and I wouldn't want that to happen,"" Mr Mason says. ""We've seen the school since my daughter's been there drop from 40 people to, I think it's 26. ""It gives the government excuses to provide the community with less funding — less funding for the school and medical support."" Mr Mason says conservation groups are regularly changing their names, making it difficult to keep up with who's who. And he's seen little evidence of what is being done with the blocks after they've raised enough money to buy them. The community is being hit from two sides, Mr Mason says. On the other, the influx of short-term rentals like AirBnB is squeezing the availability of housing for would-be residents. ""I would estimate that about 40 per cent of houses north of the river are now short-term accommodation. It's taking away from the community,"" Mr Mason says. ""We just had a teacher leave our school because he and his wife couldn't find a place to rent."" He says conservation groups like Rainforest 4 haven't properly consulted with the community, leaving some locals suspicious and fearful of what they're doing. Another local business owner, Jeremy Blockey,, has similar concerns. Again, he says he's broadly supportive of setting aside more land for conservation. There is no mains power north of the river, but Mr Blockey says conservation groups play on people's fears whenever there is talk of building a bridge over the river, or upgrading the electricity infrastructure. ""The broader green movement would have you think it's best to buy everyone up and move everyone out. ""People in Sydney and Melbourne, or London for that matter, people funding these things probably don't really care [about the community]. ""Some locals can get a bit miffed about people who don't live here telling locals how they're allowed to live here. That's offensive."" Mr Mason says fears the Daintree is under threat are misguided. The federal government projected in its 2021 budget that it would commit $19 million by 2024 to help build a microgrid north of the river. Local Mike Berwick, who has a long involvement with conservation in the Daintree, says the government needs to invest in restoring the Daintree, not in its development, and to empower the local community to do the same. ""We have the Australian government that once used its powers to protect this area, now promoting its development — 'let's get a road through the place as a short route to Cooktown', 'let's put the power on'. ""If we do that, it's going to change the face of Daintree forever."" When he was mayor of the Douglas Shire, Mr Berwick was instrumental in the buyback of blocks that were considered of high conservation value. He was also one of the people standing in front of the bulldozers when they arrived to push the coastal road through the Daintree in 1983 and '84. But Mr Berwick says despite some of the wins for conservation in the region, we can't afford to sleep on protecting places like the Daintree. ""All that being said, the more they buy back, the better I think. ""It really is the jewel in the crown of the wet tropics, and the wet tropics is internationally recognised as the second most valuable World Heritage area on the planet.""

329,Regional councils join bioenergy project to reduce waste and greenhouse emissions,environment,"  Regional councils promise cheaper bills after signing onto major bioenergy project Less waste, cheaper water bills and lower rates are some of the benefits thousands of residents in western Victorian can expect by 2024, as a biofuel revolution begins in six local government areas. The City of Greater Geelong, the Borough of Queenscliff, Colac Otway Shire, Golden Plains Shire, Surf Coast Shire and neighbouring Wyndham City Council, which have all signed a Heads of Agreement for a biofuel project with Barwon Water. Barwon Water's Regional Renewable Organics Network (RON) will push the state's circular economy forward by using organic waste from regional areas to create electricity, water and fertiliser, while also producing power for its treatment plant. And while water providers have been using biofuel for years to get off the grid, it will be the first time a project of its scale has reached regional areas in the state. The project proposes to build a state-of-the-art sustainable organics processing facility in Black Rock by mid-2024. When finished, Barwon Water will collect 40,000 tonnes of organic waste each year from the councils and turn it into enough electricity to power the equivalent of 500 homes. The water authority said it would reduce the region's carbon emissions by up 15,000 tonnes — the equivalent of taking more than 4,000 cars off the road. After the waste is processed, it will also produce by-products, including fertiliser, which the company will sell for agricultural use. Barwon Water general manager for infrastructure and technology Shaun Cumming said the project was perfect for the local councils because it solved a number of issues they were concerned about. ""We jointly identified three significant challenges that our region is facing in terms of needing to reduce waste going to landfills, reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with organic waste and our energy use,"" he said. ""If we work together on a solution like this, we can tackle those challenges jointly."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Ballarat's weekly email newsletter. Mr Cumming said reducing the company's running costs and creating a product to sell would result in lower water prices for residents. Golden Plains Shire Council Mayor Helena Kirby said under the plan, ratepayers would also save money because councils could reduce the cost of waste removal. ""The landfill levies are increasing every year, but if Barwon Water can make a return on the energy and the products, that hopefully resonates back down to our ratepayers,"" she said. ""It's all about trying to save dollars for the ratepayers."" Turning organic waste into energy is not a new concept in Victoria with projects operating at all scales. A previous project in Colac by Barwon Water was a major success and created the basis for the new RON. Chemical engineering expert Greg Martin says these projects have huge potential because of the various environmental issues they could solve. ""It's a technology that can be implemented now and can solve an immediate problem with raw materials that are available now,"" Professor Martin, from Melbourne University, said. ""It'll provide a much better option than what is currently often done, which is that the waste often goes to landfill."" Professor Martin said many people did not realise organic waste produced methane while in landfill. He said by turning it into bioenergy, the end product was a less harmful greenhouse, gas carbon dioxide. Professor Martin says multiple things need to be done to reduce greenhouse emissions, and bioenergy is one part of the solution. ""This is one of them, it's not a silver bullet, but I think it's a very sensible option.""

330,Pacific Island climate groups demand world leaders halt support for fossil fuel,environment,"  Pacific Island climate groups demand world leaders halt support for fossil fuel Pacific Island climate action groups have demanded countries including Australia end support for the fossil fuel industry during the COP26 Climate Change Summit in Glasgow. The Pacific Islands Climate Action Network (PICAN), which includes environmental activist group Greenpeace, issued a list of demands to world leaders on Friday, saying they must provide ""a safe and habitable future for the Pacific Islands"". It called on wealthy countries to pump billions of dollars a year into developing nations to help them tackle the effects of climate change and cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius. PICAN demanded wealthy nations provide developing states $US100 billion ($133.25 billion) annually until 2025 and increase that sum to $750 billion a year beyond 2025 so they can invest in technologies to help live with a changing climate. ""We do need finance and we're talking about billions … we need the technology,"" former Tuvalu prime minister Bikenibeu Paeniu said. Former Kiribati president Anote Tong told the virtual gathering of Pacific climate-action organisations the COP26 meeting would be the last chance to save Pacific Island nations from the worst effects of climate change. ""I think what I've always acknowledged — and I think we must also acknowledge — is for most of us in the Pacific, our days are already numbered because whatever happens, even if we cut emissions to zero tomorrow ... our future cannot be assured,"" he said. Pacific Island nations have become increasingly anxious about inaction on climate change and its looming consequences for their countries if the world does not reduce emissions. An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in August found the world had warmed by 1.1C  on pre-industrial levels. It found that on the current trajectory, the Earth was likely to hit 1.5C warming about 2030. Documents leaked to Greenpeace and obtained by the ABC, showed Australia sought to change a major international draft report on climate change to promote a future for coal-fired power. British High Commissioner George Edgar, who also spoke at the meeting, called on countries that had not submitted ambitious climate targets to step up. Worse fires, longer droughts, and more severe floods — the projections from one of the world's most significant reports on climate change make for scary reading. Let's break down what it all means. ""A growing number of countries have committed to ending overseas investment in coal, but we need to see an end to domestic investment as well and plans for the rapid phase out of existing coal-fired plants,"" he said. Former secretary-general of the Pacific Islands Forum, Meg Taylor, said she understood reservations about the shift away from fossil fuels but insisted the change would benefit communities in the long term. ""I understand the sentiments about the transition of economies from fossil fuel to carbon neutral. My own country will face that challenge itself,"" she said. ""In the Paris Agreement, it's very clear that in terms of the transition … economic development is very much part of the climate transition and countries are going to have to make those tough decisions themselves.""

331,"Nationals' demands for supporting net zero finalised, but will remain confidential",environment,"  Nationals' demands for Liberals over climate change policy finalised, taken to Prime Minister Scott Morrison The Nationals have finalised their list of demands of the Prime Minister, which will determine whether they can support a mid-century target of net-zero carbon emissions. Debate has raged in Canberra throughout the last sitting week as to what concessions will need to be offered to the junior Coalition party to get its members to back the policy. On Thursday evening, Nationals members and senators met to discuss their ongoing concerns about adopting the carbon emissions reduction policy, ahead of the Glasgow Climate Summit in less than a fortnight. ""The Nationals have been really clear what we are interested in ensuring and securing is a prosperous and sustainable future for our communities and the industries that underpin them,"" Nationals Senate leader Bridget McKenzie said after the meeting. ""Now the process is our leader will take that document and discuss it with the Prime Minister. ""It's obviously going to be confidential, as it should be, between two parties of government."" The exact details of the demands remain under wraps, but it will likely cost the federal government billions of dollars in extra funding for regional communities and initiatives. There are performances worthy of a theatre show being acted out at Parliament House at the moment. Senator McKenzie said her colleagues would meet again before Scott Morrison jets off for the G20 in Rome and the COP26 talks in Scotland at the end of next week, hopeful negotiations may have progressed. She said it was now up to Barnaby Joyce, the Deputy Prime Minister and Nationals leader, to sort out the finer details with Mr Morrison. ""Sunday afternoon is when our party room will be considering the matter further,"" she said. Some Nationals remain opposed to adopting a net zero target, with Queensland senator Matt Canavan chief among them. His position has not shifted during the week of debate and will not change regardless of any concessions the Nationals get. ""I don't think this is the right choice for Australia and that's what I'll be continuing to prosecute,"" he said. ""But I also recognise the good efforts of many of the people in the party room who are doing their best as well, for regional Australia."" Earlier in the week, Senator McKenzie warned things would get ""ugly"" within the Coalition if the Prime Minister took the net zero target to Glasgow without the endorsement of the Nationals. Beyond demanding more detail over a net zero emissions target, it is still unclear precisely what the Nationals want as part of any grand climate bargain. Senator Canavan was explicitly asked whether that ugliness could stretch to tearing up the Coalition agreement between the Liberals and the Nationals. ""The relationship we have with them is a business one and you only continue a business relationship while it's beneficial for both,"" he said. ""And if there comes a point where it's not beneficial for both — well, I've never had any compunction about saying, well, we go our own way."" Senator Canavan's position is not necessarily the view of the broader party room, with some Nationals more sober in their assessment about the possibility of a deal. Assistant Minister for Emissions Reduction Tim Wilson told the ABC's Q+A program regional communities with a reliance on traditional carbon-intensive industries will need to adjust as part of the net zero pitch. ""The plan is focused on what can we do to support those communities through that adjustment and how do we lead the investment and create the investment so that the skills, the value and of course the community that exists and the identity that exists in those communities is conserved,"" he said. Mr Wilson said he was not aware of what the Nationals were demanding of the government. ""Global warming and climate change is the biggest challenge facing the planet and the biggest economic opportunity facing the country, and the government of the day doesn't have a policy,"" Shadow Energy Minister Chris Bowen said on Q+A. Mr Morrison has ruled out boosting Australia's 2030 emissions target beyond the benchmark set by Tony Abbott in 2015, which is a reduction of between 26 and 28 per cent. The opposition argued climate change would only be mitigated through more ambitious short-term targets.

332,Joel dresses up as a polar bear in the Arctic and waits for wildlife to charge at him,environment,"  This 'extreme conservationist' dressed as a polar bear to understand the effects of climate change Around the world, many different people are helping to fight climate change in many different ways. For Joel Berger, this has involved dressing up as a polar bear and being charged by native wildlife in the frozen reaches of northeast Russia. Professor Berger, a conservation biologist with Colorado State University and the Wildlife Conservation Society, calls himself an ""extreme conservationist."" He travels to some of the planet's harshest environments and studies how animals there are coping with a warming climate. And, as the Australian government stumbles over new climate targets in the leadup to COP26, Professor Berger warns these animals are the ""canaries in the climate-change coal mine."" Over four decades, the American professor has studied animals across continents, from rhinos in Namibia to saigas (a critically endangered antelope with distinctly big noses) in Mongolia. In the last 10 years, much of his work has focused on musk oxen — little-known animals that are on the front line of our warming planet. ""They're very large, about 300-kilogram animals that live exclusively in the Arctic. They have long furry hair. They actually used to roam with woolly mammoths. Mammoths went extinct, musk oxen did not,"" Professor Berger tells ABC RN's Sunday Extra. He says climate change ""is breathing down the necks of all cold-adapted species,"" especially those in the Arctic, which is warming at a rate of almost twice the global average. Professor Berger became particularly interested in the musk oxen that live in northeast Russia, on a UNESCO World Heritage site called Wrangel Island. Around this region, melting sea ice has forced polar bears to spend much more time on land, meaning they have to hunt different prey, such as musk oxen. ""[One of the things] I wanted to find out was, do musk oxen know if polar bears are dangerous? Because if they don't, they're going to be toast,"" he says. ""And the hallmark of being a scientist is, you do experiments."" So, cue the polar bear costume. Professor Berger has dressed up as an animal many times in his career — ranging from a grizzly bear to a caribou — in order to approach and closely observe wildlife. So he decided to dress up as a polar bear and see how these musk oxen would respond. ""I was getting close to an animal with large, lethal horns that has killed bears before, so there was a degree of trepidation,"" he says. Professor Berger ended up having dozens of encounters with musk oxen while dressed as a polar bear, and was charged several times. There was just one problem. Professor Berger had to figure out how not to get killed. So he came up with a novel solution — a big reveal. ""Nobody's ever done this before. Nobody had any good suggestions for an escape strategy … So, I just popped the polar bear head off, tossed it up in the air and instead of being on all fours, I'd stand upright."" The musk oxen — no doubt extremely confused — backed off. ""And I'm still here,"" Professor Berger says. Not only did the extreme conservationist live to tell the tale, he also learned a lot about this species. Sunday Extra presents a lively mix of national and international affairs, analysis and investigation. ""[Over the years], we discovered that musk oxen in Russia figured out that polar bears can't chase them very far,"" he says. ""We don't know why the polar bears can't chase very far. They can run up to 40 or more kilometres an hour, then maybe they overheat … But we do know that the musk oxen keep going and going."" But it turned out that charging musk oxen wasn't his only problem in Russia. Professor Berger was arrested for a date error on his permit, which he points out was organised by Russian scientific authorities. ""In Siberia, I was interned, I had to wait a few days before I went to court. I wasn't totally sure what the interpreters were saying. But one of them said, just sign here, it's OK."" He signed the document and was told he had to leave Russia and not return for three years. After being banned from Russia, Professor Berger is now working in Chile and his mission remains unchanged. ""I'm still trying to understand how cold-adapted species respond to the loss of glaciers or the reduction in ice because of warming temperatures,"" he says. He says in Chile he's chosen to study ""the most endangered terrestrial mammal that we know of in the Western Hemisphere"" — the huemul. ""They look like a fat, chunky deer. But they're way more spectacular than that … And they live in the shadows of Patagonia's ice domes,"" he says. And just to stay busy, he's also studying the musk oxen's closest relative in North America — the mountain goat. Professor Berger says the experiences of these animals hold vital lessons and warns we cannot ""continue our ignorance"" around climate change. He says the Arctic has been hit by ""weather extremes, tidal-based flooding, less predictability of intensity and frequency of dangerous storms, and changing plant communities that affect the animals themselves."" ""Musk oxen have experienced and suffered from extraordinary warmth. They do not do well when the ice leaves, they have a more difficult time living."" According to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, the planet could be just 10 years from heating by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""The alarm bells are deafening and the evidence is irrefutable: Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk,"" United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres said when the report was released. Meanwhile, the WWF's Living Planet 2020 report warned that our biodiversity is ""being lost at an alarming rate."" It found there was a 68 per cent decline in global vertebrate species populations — mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish — from 1970 to 2016. Professor Berger says our biodiversity and climate change are inextricably linked. ""I'm not feeling so great about the future of the planet's life — our biodiversity. This is affected, of course, by climate change, and the responses I've witnessed from countries have not been strong enough,"" Professor Berger says. ""We need to do better.""

333,Wave data from buoys to shape SA coastline strategy,environment,"  Researchers release buoys to collect data for South Australian coastline erosion study Three buoys have been deployed off the coast of Adelaide to gather data to help predict the future of South Australia's coastlines. Since the 1970s, Adelaide's metropolitan coast has been artificially maintained by sand nourishment programs by the state government due to ongoing issues with coastal erosion. The problem, created by northwards wave-driven sand movement, has been exacerbated by historical seagrass loss which has increased sediment accumulation in the northern beaches and loss along the central and southern parts of the coast. Marine geology expert Graziela Miot da Silva said the two-year project would monitor any changes in conditions. ""The provision of accurate wave data is critical to improve our understanding of variations in the hydrodynamic processes that shape our coastlines,"" Dr Miot da Silva, a senior marine geology lecturer at Flinders University, said. ""This will inform best coastal management practices, drive the development of marine industries and help promote and support tourism."" While these buoys will monitor Gulf St Vincent, the researchers have plans to include other regional coastlines in the future. ""These buoys are going to better inform what's happening in Gulf St Vincent,"" Dr Miot da Silva said. ""We're hoping to expand this project and get other buoys and deploy them across the state in Port Lincoln, the West Coast and the South East."" As part of the project, two buoys were launched off Semaphore Beach and Brighton Beach in Adelaide during August. A third buoy was deployed in Investigator Strait in September to capture the largest waves entering the gulf from the Southern Ocean. Data from the three buoys will inform morphodynamic models to predict future changes in Adelaide's metropolitan coastline from climate change and sea level rise. The model will be used to develop coastal management practices, including seagrass and reef restoration. ""To help address the ongoing coastal sand movement, we need to better understand wave movement in much greater detail,"" Dr Miot da Silva said. There has previously been only one buoy measuring and providing wave data in South Australia, located off Kangaroo Island. ""Ultimately, this will benefit important ongoing coastal management initiatives — especially sediment nourishment practices to maintain the Adelaide metropolitan beaches,"" Dr Miot da Silva said. The project is a collaboration between Flinders University, South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI), SA Water, EPA and Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS). The study received $55,000 from the Department of Environment and Water to fund the buoys, mooring materials, licence to stream data in real-time and for deployment trips.

334,Turtle nests get extra protection against foxes,environment,"  Turtle nests at Wonga Wetlands given extra protection from hungry foxes A modest makeshift barrier made out of chicken wire and metal stakes has been installed in known nesting areas of eastern long-neck and Murray short-neck turtles in the Wonga Wetlands in an attempt to protect eggs from foxes. Both species are experiencing population declines and are found at the wetlands on the outskirts of Albury on the NSW and Victorian border. Experts believe hungry foxes, which can eat up to 95 per cent of the eggs, have contributed to the decline in juvenile turtle populations. Wonga Wetlands supervisor John Hawkins said he hoped the turtle nesting site, which cost about $500 to construct, would save up to 30 to 100 turtle hatchlings this year. ""The turtles can get under the barrier and nest, but the foxes will look at the chicken wire and wonder if it's a trap and not risk going under to get eggs,"" he said. Mr Hawkins said staff built the barrier on a gravelly beach about 20 metres away from water, where turtle nests had been spotted in previous years. ""I have been here for over 20 years, and you always see eggs dug up here, so we thought if we put it here and we get half a dozen of the nests to survive it will be a plus for the turtle population."" Mr Hawkins said it was probably too early to see turtle nests yet, but they should be visible soon. ""In September the turtles start to mate and a month or so later they start to lay their eggs but depending on the season, that could take anywhere from 65 days to 150 days for those eggs to hatch."" Mr Hawkins is optimistic the structure will save hatchlings. ""If we have half a dozen turtles under here, each nest may have five to 20 eggs, if those are saved that is a good number of small turtles that will get back into these waterways and eventually find their way back into the river."" Mr Hawkins said the structure would be dismantled at the end of the year, and set up again next breeding season. La Trobe University senior lecturer of biomedical science James Van Dyke is also hopeful the project will help the declining juvenile turtle population. ""It isn't an approach I have tried before, but as long as it prevents foxes from getting to the nests it has a good chance,"" Dr Van Dyke said. He said it was important that individuals and community organisations embraced projects like this to help turtle populations. ""Conservation work is largely driven by government agencies, and there is only so much money to go around. Little things that people can do, like reporting turtles on TurtleSAT (a website mapping the locations of freshwater turtles) and protecting their nests like this, help ease the financial burden of conservation work. ""There are a lot of basic things like this that anyone can do as long as they are careful, and every little bit helps."" Dr Van Dyke says both the eastern long-neck turtle and the Murray short-neck turtle populations are in decline. ""In the Upper Murray region the long-neck has declined by about 90 per cent and the short-neck has declined by about 60 per cent since the 1970s. ""Neither is listed as endangered yet, but the short-neck is listed as 'vulnerable' in both Victoria and New South Wales."" He says there is a chance of both species becoming endangered. ""I suspect the long-neck will eventually be listed as vulnerable in Victoria, and both could potentially be listed as endangered in South Australia."" Dr Van Dyke said foxes were a major threat because they ate about 95 per cent of turtle eggs. ""Lots of adult turtles also die on roads due to car strikes, and they have lost habitat due to our changes of the river systems."" He said turtles were important to the ecosystem because they acted as scavengers eating dead fish and other things in the water. ""They are the 'clean-up crew' that helps keep water quality clean even in blackwater events and fish kills,"" he said.

335,"Seven women, one man charged after Extinction Rebellion protest stops Adelaide CBD traffic",environment,"  Extinction Rebellion protesters glued to road in Adelaide's CBD call for climate change action ahead of UN summit Extinction Rebellion protesters glued their feet to the road in the heart of Adelaide's CBD this morning, causing major traffic delays for morning commuters. Police attended the scene at Victoria Square, at the intersection of King William and Grote streets, outside courts and other major buildings in the centre of the city. Eight protesters were later arrested by police. One said members of the group were ""glued or chained to be irremovable, symbolising how resolute they are"". ""Attached to prams that symbolise the future of our children are parents, grandparents,"" another said. The rally has been timed to coincide with the lead-up to the UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, which begins in Glasgow on October 31. About two dozen protesters were involved, holding placards reading ""Climate Crisis"" and ""Code Red"". ""It's a code red. It's about taking action immediately,"" one protester said. ""We believe the science on COVID. Why don't we believe and act on the science on climate change?"" COP26 is widely regarded as the most important climate meeting since the 2015 conference that led to the adoption of the Paris Agreement. While Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to commit Australia to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, some members of the Nationals are resisting the move. Irate drivers honked their horns at the group as they blocked the intersection, but the movement of trams and pedestrians was not impeded by the demonstration. ""The reality is we've got eight people here willing to sacrifice their civil liberties for the planet,"" one protester said. Gridlocked traffic stretched hundreds of metres, with one delivery driver on his way to work saying he was waiting for ""too bloody long"". ""I wish they were extinct,"" another said. The surprise sit-in began at 8:00am this morning and one of the organisers said police had since issued fines to all of those holding banners. The event ended about three hours later, after police carefully detached protesters' hands and feet from the bitumen. The eight arrested protesters, seven female and one male, were aged between 44 and 74 years old. They were charged with obstructing the path of drivers. Another 10 protesters were fined. In March, the activist group released smoke flares and members glued themselves to the road outside the head office of oil and gas company Santos in Adelaide's Flinders Street. The group also spray-painted words on the office building. Earlier this morning, there were also lengthy traffic delays on the South Eastern Freeway caused by a crash. A four-wheel drive collided with a truck and then hit a tree near Bridgewater about 7:30am. One person was taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital, but no serious injuries were reported.

336,Celebrities join Prince William for Earthshot Prize ceremony,environment,"  Prince William joined by celebrities in London for the inaugural Earthshot Prize Celebrities have joined Prince William in London for the inaugural awards ceremony of his Earthshot Prize, an ambitious environmental program that aims to find new ideas and technologies around the world to tackle climate change and Earth's most pressing challenges. The winners announced on Sunday included the government of Costa Rica, which was honoured for a project that pays local citizens to restore natural ecosystems, and the city of Milan, which was handed a prize for its Food Waste Hubs program which recovers food from supermarkets and restaurants and distributes it to those in need. Actors Emma Thompson, Emma Watson and David Oyelowo joined the Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, in handing out the awards at Alexandra Palace in north London. Guests were asked to ""consider the environment when choosing their outfit"". Watson arrived wearing a gown made from 10 wedding dresses from the charity Oxfam. The duchess wore an Alexander McQueen dress made for her in 2011, while Prince William wore a dark green velvet blazer and a black polo neck top. Prince William and his charity, The Royal Foundation, launched the Earthshot Prize last year, inspired by US President John Kennedy's 1962 ""Moonshot"" speech that challenged and inspired Americans to go to the moon. The prize, to be awarded to five winners every year until 2030, is billed as the most prestigious of its kind. Each winner will receive a grant worth 1 million pounds ($1.85 million) to develop their ideas and help them materialise. Prince William suggests entrepreneurs focus their resources on solving environmental problems on Earth, rather than competing in a commercial space race. ""There's been lots of amazing ideas over the past decades but it's the implementation that really counts. So, that's what this is all about. So, it's really a reason to be cheerful,"" Thompson said. The other winners were a land-based coral farm in the Bahamas that aims to restore dying coral reefs; a green hydrogen technology developed to transform how homes and buildings are powered; and an India-based technology that creates fuel from agricultural waste in a bid to stop crop burning. Prince William has said he wanted the initiative to inject some optimism into the climate debate. On Sunday he urged young people not to give up hope for the future. ""For too long, we haven't done enough to protect the planet for your future. The Earthshot is for you,"" he said. ""In the next 10 years, we are going to act. We are going to find the solutions to repair our planet."" The United States will host next year's award ceremony. This year's ceremony came just days ahead of the COP26 UN climate change summit in Glasgow, which begins on October 31. Prince William, his father Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth II are all expected to attend. Earlier this week, Prince William criticised the space race and space tourism, saying in an interview that the world's greatest minds should be focused on repairing Earth instead of ""trying to find the next place to go and live"".

337,Snake catcher finds more than 90 venomous rattlesnakes hibernating under woman's home in California,environment,"  Northern California snake catcher finds more than 90 rattlesnakes hibernating under house in Sonoma County Al Wolf is used to clearing one or two snakes from under houses but recently was called by a woman who had seen more than 90 rattlesnakes under her house in Northern California. Mr Wolf, director of Sonoma County Reptile Rescue, said he crawled under the mountainside home in Santa Rosa and found a rattlesnake right away, then another and another. He got out from under the house, grabbed two buckets, put on long, safety gloves, and went back in. He crawled on his hands, knees, and stomach, tipping over more than 200 small rocks. ""I kept finding snakes for the next almost four hours,"" Mr Wolf said. ""I thought, 'Oh, good, it was a worthwhile call' but I was happy to get out because it's not nice, you run into spider webs and dirt and it smells crappy and it's musty and you're on your belly and you're dirty. I mean it was work."" But the work paid off. He used a 60-centimetre snake pole to remove 22 adult rattlesnakes and 59 babies when he first visited the home in the Mayacamas Mountains on October 2. He returned another two times since and collected 11 more snakes. He also found a dead cat and dead possum. All the snakes were Northern Pacific rattlesnakes, the only venomous snake found in Northern California, he said. Mr Wolf, who has been rescuing snakes for 32 years and has been bitten 13 times, said he responds to calls about snakes under homes in 17 counties and has seen dozens of them in one place in the wild but never under a home. He said he releases the rattlesnakes in the wild away from people and sometimes in private land when ranchers request them for pest control. Mr Wolf said there are plans to return to the house again before the end of the month to see if any more snakes arrived. ""We know it's a den site already because of the babies, and the amount of females I found,"" he said. Rattlesnakes usually hibernate from October to April in the United States and look for rocks to hide under and warm places and will return to the same place year after year. The homeowners didn't remove any rocks when they built the house, making it an attractive place for the reptiles, Mr Wolf said. ""The snakes found the house to be a great place for them because the rocks give them protection but the house, too, gives them protection from being wet during the winter so, it's double insulation for them,"" he said.

338,'We're robbing from our children's future': Prince William blasts billionaire space race,environment,"  Prince William blasts space race billionaires finding 'new place to live' before repairing Earth Britain's Prince William has taken a thinly veiled swipe at the billionaires embroiled in a space tourism race, saying the world's greatest brains should instead be focused on solving the environmental problems facing the Earth. During a BBC interview at Kensington Palace, William appeared to criticise Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Briton Richard Branson, whose rival ventures are all vying to usher in a new era of private commercial space travel. ""We need some of the world's greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,"" William said of the space race. His comments come after Mr Musk spoke about missions to Mars, and Mr Bezos, who in July described his inaugural space flight as part of building a road to space ""so that our kids and their kids can build a future"". ""We need to do that to solve the problems here on Earth,"" said Mr Bezos, who celebrated sending Star Trek actor William Shatner into space in his New Shepard spacecraft this week. Speaking out on green issues has become a major feature of the British royal family.William, 39, is following in the footsteps of his late grandfather Prince Philip and his father, Prince Charles. Charles, the 72-year-old heir to the throne, has for decades called for action to stop climate change and environmental damage,  often facing ridicule along the way. ""It's been a hard road for him. He's had a really rough ride on that, and I think he's been proven to being well ahead of the curve,"" William said. ""But it shouldn't be that there's a third generation now coming along having to ramp it up even more."" The prince warned that people could be ""robbing from our children's future"" if the climate crisis is not tackled in time. ""For me, it would be an absolute disaster if [my son] George is sat here in 30 years' time, still saying the same thing, because by then we will be too late."" ""Now I've got children as well and speaking to other parents, it's a bit of a cliché, but you do start to see the world differently. ""I want the things that I've enjoyed – the outdoor life, the nature, the environment – I want that to be there for my children, and not just my children but everyone else's children. He said the key to tackling climate change is to ""bring people with us"". ""People have got to feel like there's hope, there's a chance we can fix this."" In an echo of his father's message earlier this week, William, said the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference COP26 summit in Scotland had to deliver. ""We can't have more clever speak, clever words but not enough action,"" William said. His personal response to the issue has been to create the Earthshot Prize, which aims to find solutions through new technologies or policies to the planet's biggest environmental problems.

339,Port Pirie lead remediation program extended by a decade,environment,"  Port Pirie lead remediation program extended for another decade after independent review The South Australian government and the operator of the Port Pirie smelter have agreed to extend lead abatement funding by a decade, conceding more effort is needed to address lead pollution. The Targeted Lead Abatement Program (TLAP) is intended to reduce exposure to airborne lead in the community associated with the Port Pirie smelter, which is one of the largest in the world. The program is due to expire in 2024 but the funding boost will see it extended until 2034. TLAP oversees initiatives to help bring down levels of lead in the blood of local children, including remediating residential properties, suppressing dust, wiping down public playgrounds and running awareness campaigns. ""We're providing a significant reduction in lead-in-air and lead-in-blood for the people of Port Pirie and surrounding districts — it's one of our government's highest priorities,"" energy and mining minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan said. Earlier this year, the government announced a shake-up of TLAP, creating the position of Executive Director and appointing Environmental Protection Authority veteran Peter Dolan to the role. It also gave the Port Pirie mayor, Leon Stephens, a position on the TLAP committee. The average blood lead level in Port Pirie children has been rising over the last few years, despite work by Nyrstar to reduce lead emissions. Mr van Holst Pellekaan said a long-running review of TLAP by former regulator and senior public servant Lewis Owens found more work was needed. ""The independent review by Mr Lewis Owens confirms that a concerted effort is needed to truly deliver on decades of promises to the people of Port Pirie,"" Mr van Holst Pellekaan said. Peter Dolan said short-term measures focused on community health like blood lead testing and supporting families with young children, whereas medium-term plans tackled removing dust from the environment. Long-term plans addressed greening strategies like planting more vegetation to minimise historical lead, he said. For its part, Nyrstar said it spent more than $25 million last financial year on initiatives to reduce lead in air emissions, including constructing a temporary dome over a storage area, improving road cleaning and re-cladding buildings. Cr Stephens welcomed the announcement that TLAP would be extended. ""We want to try and do things a lot better than we've been doing them in the past,"" he said. ""Council's at the table, the community is at the table -- it's about time we stop talking and [start] doing. Independent Member for Frome, Geoff Brock said securing the commitment from Nyrstar and the government was great news. He said he was pleased that Nyrstar will rollover any unspent money on the program into the next year. ""In the previous agreement that wasn't the case,"" he said. The details of the new agreement were still being finalised, and Mr van Holst Pellekaan said the full details of the program will be made available early next year.

340,Charges expected to be laid following climate protesters in southern NSW,environment,"  Charges expected to be laid after climate protest blocks road chip mill on NSW southern coast Police say charges will be laid over an unauthorised climate protest that blocked access to a chip mill on the NSW Far South Coast for more than five hours today. Extinction Rebellion Bega Valley has staged the protest at Edrom Road, south of Eden, blocking access to the Allied Natural Wood Exports (ANWE) chip mill from 7:00am. ""Officers attached to South Coast Police District were called about 7.45am, after approximately 10 people had blocked the roadway with a truck,"" a NSW Police spokesperson said. NSW Police alleged two women from Tarraganda, aged 26 and 62, sat on the truck for hours, refusing to come down. Police said the two women were safely removed from the vehicle and would be charged. ""The other protesters were given move-on directions by police and complied,"" the spokesperson said. The two women are expected to be charged with a range of offences, including failing to comply with police, unlawful assembly and failure to leave an area. The road has been cleared and the chip mill is now operating. Annabelle, a local member of the Extinction Rebellion, said the protest was targeting the chip mill to highlight the impact its processes could have on the environment. ""This is a pretty obvious and large-scale micro example of what we're doing to the planet as a whole,"" she said. ""[They] are extracting the value from the land regardless of the impact it has.""

341,This degraded river is Victoria's 'most stressed'. Now there's a plan to help its recovery,environment,"  New water plan hopes to improve health of Victoria's 'most stressed' river Wadawurrung poet, singer and storyteller Barry Gilson recalls how easy it was to find buniya, or short-finned eel, in the Moorabool River as a child. The 48-year-old has spent all his life living near the waterway now acknowledged as Victoria's ""most flow-stressed"". He hasn't seen the short-finned eel there since the early 1980s. ""There were maybe about 70 in the river when I went down there as a kid every time to have a look – now they're all gone."" The Moorabool, which runs from the Central Highlands near Ballarat to join the Barwon River in Geelong, experiences regular fish kills and algal blooms. A third of the water in the Moorabool Basin is used to supply cities and towns, and a further four per cent is relied on for agriculture. The Victorian government has outlined plans to restore water to the degraded river system and its Traditional Owners, the Wadawurrung people. ""The Moorabool to us is a special creation river,"" Mr Gilson said. ""[The name] is really about the creature calling from the reedbeds during the darkness. ""They may well be speaking about the curlew, as it's got a distinct blood-curdling cry and it's nocturnal, or the brown bittern, which is another bird associated with the river."" In its new draft sustainable water strategy for Victoria's Central and Gippsland regions, the government proposes to recover 2,640 megalitres for the Moorabool under dry conditions in the next five years. The strategy says that would reduce the risk of fish kills, help migratory native fish spawn, and keep the waterway flowing. Cameron Steele, a Bannockburn resident and coordinator of community environmental group People For a Living Moorabool, said it would halt the river's decline. ""But there is no sense that will really drive the river back into a healthy position,"" he said. However, the strategy sets a higher recovery target for the next decade to help native fish and platypus populations endure dry years, and a 50-year target to permanently protect ""priority environmental values"". Similar recovery targets are also proposed for the Barwon River. Mr Steele and his group have advocated for a restoration of flows to the Moorabool River since the Millennium drought, when ""there was kilometre-after-kilometre that was just dead dry"". ""You could see all the platypus burrows exposed and there was nothing left in the river,"" he said. Mr Steele said the draft strategy contained worthwhile initiatives and ""most importantly, there is recognition of the issues facing the river."" ""We need to see how much difference it will make, especially if the drying climate continues,"" he said. Paul Davis, CEO of the Wadawurrung Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation, said ""anything that goes towards improving the health of the river is going to be welcomed"". Along with the effects of climate change, Geelong and Ballarat have the highest projected levels of urban growth in regional Victoria over the next 15 years. Long-term water availability is already on the decline, with the Moorabool Basin 19 per cent down on baseline levels and the Barwon Basin recording an 11 per cent decrease. Current urban water supplies may already not be enough to reliably meet Greater Geelong's demand within a decade, the draft strategy says. The government proposes a small increase to the amount of water Geelong can take from Melbourne's supply, reducing its reliance on the stressed Moorabool catchment. Unlike Geelong, Ballarat is not connected to Melbourne's urban water system. However, Central Highlands Water will consider other options for the city's future, including connecting it to the water grid in northern Victoria. The government is also considering meeting its water recovery targets by using stormwater or recycled water for non-drinking purposes, and potentially to recharge aquifers in the Anglesea borefield. But to maximise the benefits, there's also work to be done to replace a cracked concrete channel at an old quarry on the Moorabool, where about five megalitres of water seeps away each day. Mr Steele said it was crucial to maintaining the river's connectivity with the Barwon and helping migratory species survive. Mr Gilson said a healthy river would create a healthy land, and in turn, healthy minds and healthy people. ""We learnt this over thousands of years, so we could pass that down to the next generation, so they could teach their next generations,"" he said. Outcome Cumulative water recovery target (ML/year) Timeframe Protect native fish and platypus, the highest priority ecological values Ensure the river continues to flow and does not dry out Provide enough water for other species' survival, reducing the risk of fish deaths Maintain water quality, and pool and riffle habitats Trigger spawning migrations for migratory native fish species, such as tupong, eels, Australian grayling and galaxiids. 2,640 under dry conditions (west branch) 700 (east branch) < 5 years Provide conditions to allow native fish and platypus populations to thrive in wet years, to increase their resilience in dry years 6,500 < 10 year Permanently protect priority environmental values 17,130 We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

342,Global energy crisis has Australian gas producers raking in $200m for one shipment of gas,environment," ABC Rural Australian gas producers rake in profit windfall as global energy crises send prices rocketing Energy crises in Europe and Asia are delivering windfall profits to Australian oil and gas producers, which are raking in up to $200 million for shipments of gas. Prices for natural gas have reached historic highs in recent weeks as surging demand for the fuel in the Northern Hemisphere collides with tight supplies to send the market soaring. The volatility has led to desperate buyers in Asian countries such as Japan and China paying up to $US150 million ($204 million) for a single cargo of liquefied natural gas. Mark Hanna, the chief executive of Perth-based Energy Market Strategies, said the prices were ""unprecedented"" and about double the previous record. One industry veteran also noted that LNG cargoes sold for as little as $3 million in 2000 during a period of oversupply. ""It's the first time this sort of phenomenon has happened,"" Mr Hanna said. ""It is a boon. ""If you can make $US100 million extra on a single cargo. I mean that's happy days. It's a lot of money."" Driving the recent market has been booming demand for gas in Asia, where the fuel is increasingly preferred as a cleaner alternative to coal. China, in particular, has been scrambling for gas supplies to prop up its power system after moves to clamp down on pollution caused by coal-fired electricity prompted power rationing and widespread blackouts. Mr Hanna said the market was being further propelled by events in Europe, where there had been a ""wind drought"", and Russia was suspected of withholding gas supplies to force through approvals for a new gas pipeline. ""We've come off COVID when demand for energy has been suppressed and investment in energy, therefore, has been low,"" Mr Hanna said. ""Economies have opened up quicker and perhaps stronger than people expected. ""There's geopolitics and weather involved. ""Energy is elastic – it doesn't take much to flick the switch and make prices go up when there's a shortage."" Despite the eye-watering prices, Mr Hanna said the ability of Australian producers such as ASX-listed Woodside and Santos was somewhat constrained. He said most of what those companies produced was sold to customers via long-term contracts, which were invariably set at more conservative prices. However, he noted the producers typically held back a certain amount of their output for the spot market, meaning they would still be capitalising on the situation. ""My prediction on prices is they're going to be wildly fluctuating,"" he said. ""And actually, you're going to see a lot of returns going to companies like Woodside and Santos. ""The biggest challenge for them will be how much of their portfolio do they keep open? ""As contracts roll-off, how much do they renew, and how much do they leave open to the spot market to take advantage of these things? ""So, with energy prices, in short, where'll they be is God knows. But they will be higher."" Woodside chief executive Meg O'Neill said the rise of Europe in the LNG market was responsible for much of the recent volatility. Ms O'Neill said the market also reflected the importance of gas as a balancing fuel in the switch to a renewable energy system, noting it could cushion the inherent intermittency of green sources such as wind turbines and solar panels. ""The fundamentals are that natural gas is in demand,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""This is in part because of the role gas plays in the energy transition – it can generate power with lower emissions than coal, and it can enable broader and more reliable use of renewables by stabilising power grids. ""This is why we expect demand for LNG to be sustained, especially in Asia. We expect that demand to underpin investment in new supply like Scarborough. ""The near-term volatility confirms the value of long-term gas contracts for both suppliers and customers, given the protection they offer against extreme price fluctuations. ""The long-term certainty they provide also supports market conditions that enable new projects to be sanctioned and developed to ensure a healthy balance between supply and demand. ""We know buyers require flexibility in longer-term contracts to manage demand fluctuations, and Woodside is able to provide that flexibility.""

343,"Got an old phone in a drawer? We need to farewell products that can't be recycled, experts say",environment," Science E-waste surges in 2021 as world sends goldmine to landfill The amount of electronic waste created globally has again increased this year, with the majority of it unlikely to be recycled. Perhaps in part because of COVID-19 and increased reliance on technology for home offices and entertainment, the amount of dumped e-waste is expected to total 57.4 million tonnes in 2021, according to the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Forum. That's an additional 2 million tonnes on last year and roughly equal to the weight of the Great Wall of China, the group said (though estimates of the weight of the Great Wall of China vary). Despite the e-waste containing anything from gold and silver to valuable glass and rare earth elements, only about 17.4 per cent will be effectively recycled, based on 2019 figures. That's in contrast to the public perception that 40-50 per cent of waste is recycled, according to the WEEE Forum. Today is International E-Waste Day: an annual event created by the WEEE Forum to draw attention to the growing problem of electronic waste. The group are using this year's event to push for the recycling of household e-waste, much of which is sitting unused in drawers and cupboards. ""We hope to raise awareness among citizens of the importance of returning electricals that are no longer functioning or are unused,"" WEEE Forum director-general Pascal Leroy said. ""In Europe, one out of seven electricals in the household is sitting in drawers because they are not used or not functioning. ""In France, 5 kilograms of [electrical] products per person are non-functional [while] 17kg are rarely used."" Making recycling options easy for people to access is one key to increasing the proportion of recycled e-waste, Mr Leroy said. ""Convenience is important, i.e. making it easy for citizens to return their electricals to shops or civic amenity sites."" But while the WEEE Forum's focus this year is on recycling, and recycling is an important part of diverting waste from landfill, experts say individual consumers shouldn't shoulder the responsibility for what is largely a systemic failing with systemic solutions. Currently we have a linear approach to manufacturing, ownership and disposal. Transitioning the world to clean energy is going to require a huge amount of different types of  metals. But where will we get them from, and what impact will that have on the environment? In other words, a company makes a product, and once we buy it, sole responsibility for that product (besides manufacturing faults), is handed to us. At its end of life, its disposal is the individual consumers' responsibility. In the best case, the product is recycled, but more often than not it's sent to landfill. But this model, which puts indefinite pressure on Earth's finite resources, is fundamentally unsustainable, according to Lisa McLean, chief executive officer of non-profit research and advocacy group NSW Circular. Instead, we have to transition to a circular economy, she says. Under the circular model, manufacturers still have responsibility for the end-of-life handling of the products they profit from. When a product — whether that be a kettle, a washing machine or even the clothes we wear — stops working or is worn out, it's returned to the manufacturer. The manufacturer, with the right incentives, is then tasked with either repairing the item, repurposing its working parts, or as a last resort, recycling the components for reuse. Considering a tonne of mobile phones contains more gold than an average tonne of gold ore, this last option isn't necessarily bad. As for materials that aren't recyclable, we have to transition to products that don't use those materials, Ms McLean said. ""We need to say goodbye to products that can't be recycled. Certain plastics and other products that can't be recycled, they have to be designed out,"" she said. Although there are already systemic changes taking place in parts of Europe toward a circular economy, industrial design expert Miles Park from UNSW says our e-waste problem is about to get much bigger if we don't move faster. ""A whole lot of new products are hitting waste streams in huge numbers — right now batteries and then in about 10 years [early] generation solar panels will be coming to their end of life,"" Dr Park said. ""[And] now we've got microchips and antennae in everything from our toothbrushes to our cars."" At the present rate of increase, the UN predicts global e-waste will hit 74 million tonnes per year by 2030. Short of conquering and mining other planets, Earth will run out of useful resources if we continue using them faster than they can be replenished. So although it sounds like a radical shift in the way we do things, moving to a circular economy is a matter of when, not if. There needs to be a ""carrot and stick"" approach by legislators and policymakers to help manufacturers drive the transition, according to Dr Park. Right now, technology manufacturers are locked in a race to create new and innovative products, which quickly make superseded models obsolete. Instead, there needs to be the right market incentives to develop products that last, or that are easily updated. One piece of the puzzle is for manufacturers to bear the responsibility for a product's end of life. ""From a product design point of view, there are well-understood approaches, but they're not widely applied,"" Dr Park said. ""First and foremost, if it lasts longer, you're going to displace increased demand for stuff. ""Throw into that you've got upgrade-ability, and instead of ownership, you've got shared schemes – car-share schemes for instance. ""You've got to create a landscape where businesses can flourish and take back [their products] in this whole ecosystem of a circular economy."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Climate change and Australia's need to move to net-zero emissions means the time to shift to a circular economy is now, according to Ms McLean. While transitioning to renewable energies and transport are needed to cut down Australia's emissions, that still leaves a lot of emissions in manufacturing, mining and waste disposal, she said. ""It still leaves around 45 per cent of emissions that are embedded in products and are embedded in waste,"" Ms McLean said. ""It's really critical to understand that we can't get to zero emissions without a circular economy."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

344,"Most Australians support a net zero target via renewables, Australia Institute reveals",environment,"  Most Australians support a net zero COP26 target via renewables, Australia Institute reveals As the federal Coalition negotiates a climate policy ahead of the Glasgow COP26 summit, a new report says the majority of Australians support a target to achieve net zero. The Australia Institute's Climate of the Nation report, which has been tracking Australian attitudes to climate change since 2007, revealed today 69 per cent of people support a target. The majority support a transition through renewables, while only 12 per cent support a gas-powered recovery. The progressive think tank surveyed more than 2,500 adults over a week in August. Richie Merzian from the Australia Institute said at 75 per cent, it was striking that concern for climate change was at an all-time high. ""Three-quarters of Australians are concerned about climate change, despite coming off the back of a major pandemic,"" Mr Merzian said. ""The appetite for policy solutions has only increased. We're seeing more confidence in Australians putting forward a desire for renewable-led recovery. ""We're seeing state governments take many of these policies forward, and I guess the question that remains is whether the federal government will follow. The survey showed there was still a lot of misinformation about the fossil fuel sector and its contribution to the economy, according to Mr Merzian. ""For example, people think that the gas and coal industry makes 55-times more revenue for the Australian Government than it actually does, or that there's 46-times more people working in the gas and coal industry than there actually are,"" he said. ""I think the politics has taken up the oxygen that would have otherwise existed to have a credible discussion around how we deal with climate change."" Despite that, the report found people are increasingly in favour of phasing out coal-fired power stations, even if it costs more in the short term. ""A whopping 82 per cent of Australians want to see a phase-out of coal power stations, and coal is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions when burned,"" Mr Merzian said. ""I think people have now clearly understood that we need to phase out our coal power stations."" Even in Queensland people's views on the future of coal has changed, with respondents who believe coal mining has a strong economic future dropping by 8 per cent on last year, down to 37 per cent. There were few differences between the states, or between regional and metro respondents. ""Whilst we have this idea, much like we do with the misinformation around gas and coal, that there is this huge divide between the bush and the city, we're still talking just slightly over the the error margin really,"" Mr Merzian said. ""The message is quite clear that there is strong support, regardless of where you are, regardless of your age, regardless of which state, and regardless of your political persuasion for policy solutions."" But public opinion on climate change does not necessarily equate to people changing their vote according to Rebecca Colvin from the Australian National University, who researches public attitudes to climate change. ""Even amongst people who say climate change is extremely important to them, it's not the decisive factor when they're voting,"" she said. But she said polls like this one can have more of an impact on everyday people. ""Having these results year after year — it's the Australia Institute's polling, the Lowy Institute's polling, a whole lot of public polling — evidence is telling us that we do have these big majorities and that is empowering for everyday Australians to feel like they're not alone,"" Dr Colvin said. ""We're seeing that the trends in Australia of increasing majorities being concerned about climate change is matched around most of the world."" It is not just public pressure mounting on the Australian government over its climate policy, but a shift globally to act faster to curb emissions. If Australia continues to lag behind there are fears exports could suffer, with the European Union and others considering carbon tariffs. A new report from the Climate Council predicts 50,000 jobs could be lost in Queensland, and 20,000 in New South Wales, if Australia's trading partners introduce carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAM). The Climate Council modelled how CBAMs in South Korea, China, and the G7 would impact Australia. Reliance on coal exports would see Queensland and New South Wales take the heaviest hits and lose a combined $15 billion in GDP and 70,000 jobs, according to the report. ""We become less competitive, we lose export markets. That flows through right across the economy. We lose jobs and growth,"" said lead author and former Deloitte partner Nicki Hutley. While the report looks at a ""worst case scenario"" where Australia takes no climate action, Ms Hutley said it was ""very feasible"". ""If we don't act and are prepared, we will have economic mayhem imposed upon us by others in ways which we're not comfortable and ways which we cannot adapt,"" she said. With COP26 looming, Ms Hutley said ""the whole world's moved on from net zero 2050"" and more ambitious medium-term action would be needed to avoid the worst impacts of CBAMs. ""What the COP26 talks is looking for is serious action and commitment by 2030, with 50 per cent reduction being the minimum,"" she said. ""[Australia should] divert funds from the fossil fuel sector, which is going to die out effectively, and put it into helping transition people, skills, and capital so that we've got these new opportunities of green hydrogen, green industries.""

345,"'Crimes against nature': Brazil's President should face probe over Amazon policies, lawyers say",environment,"  Climate activists call for investigation of Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro, over Amazon policies A group of climate lawyers has called for the International Criminal Court to launch an investigation into Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for possible crimes against humanity over his government's Amazon policies. The AllRise group filed a dossier with the global court alleging that Mr Bolsonaro's administration was responsible for a ""widespread attack on the Amazon, its dependants and its defenders"" that affected the global population. The call comes less than three weeks before the United Nations' 26th Climate Change Conference of the Parties, known as the COP26, starting on October 31 in Glasgow. The 12-day summit aims to secure more ambitious commitments to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, with a goal of keeping it to 1.5C compared with pre-industrial levels. The event also is focused on mobilising financing to fight climate change and protecting vulnerable communities and natural habitats. Since taking office, Mr Bolsonaro has encouraged development within the Amazon and dismissed global complaints about its destruction as a plot to hold back Brazil's agribusiness. His administration has also weakened environmental authorities and backed legislative measures to loosen land protections, emboldening land grabbers. ""Crimes against nature are crimes against humanity. Jair Bolsonaro is fuelling the mass destruction of the Amazon with eyes wide open and in full knowledge of the consequences, "" AllRise founder Johannes Wesemann said in a statement. ""The ICC has a clear duty to investigate environmental crimes of such global gravity."" It is not the first time opponents of the right-wing Brazilian leader have asked the ICC to intervene. Two years ago, a group of Brazilian lawyers and former ministers requested that the court investigate Mr Bolsonaro for allegedly inciting the genocide of Indigenous people and failing to safeguard the forests and protected lands they live in. Protests against President Jair Bolsonaro spread across Brazil on Saturday following his response to allegations involving corruption. Before Mr Bolsonaro took office in 2019, the Brazilian Amazon had not recorded a year with more than 10,000 square kilometres of deforestation in over a decade. Between 2009 and 2018, the average per year was 6,500 square kilometres compared with the average of 10,500 square kilometres during Mr Bolsonaro's term. But preliminary figures released last month by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research showed that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon dropped for the second consecutive month in August compared with the same period in 2020. Mr Wesemann, however, insists Mr Bolsonaro needs to be held accountable for the world in addition to Amazon communities. ""Our case aims to add an important international dimension to their struggle,"" Mr Wesemann said. ""The Amazon is theirs, but it is needed by us all.""

346,Sam swaps a tinny for an Antarctic adventure aboard the 'Swiss Army knife of ships',environment,"  How Sam Richardson went from a tinny on Coffin Bay to working aboard RSV Nuyina Sam Richardson first took to the ocean as a 10-year-old, exploring the sheltered waters of the Coffin Bay estuary in South Australia, meandering the bays in a tinny his dad gave him. Next week, he'll dock in Hobart aboard the world's leading polar research vessel, the RSV Nuyina, Australia's replacement ice breaker for the iconic Antarctic explorer Aurora Australis, which was decommissioned last year. The RSV Nuyina was built in shipyards in Romania and the Netherlands for the Australian government's Antarctic Division. The word ""nuyina"" means southern lights in palawa kani, the language of Tasmanian Aborigines. Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley said the Nuyina was a huge milestone for climate research, and the study of Antarctic and marine ecosystems. The Australian government is investing $1.9 billion in the ship, to cover its design and build as well as its operation and maintenance over an expected 30-year life span. Mr Richardson, who grew up in Coffin Bay on the Eyre Peninsula, landed a job on the ship after 10 years in the offshore oil and gas industry in Australia and overseas. His job aboard the Nuyina as an Integrated Rating is to carry out maintenance and lookout duties on deck and in the engine room, as well as cargo operations involving landing barges, vessels and helicopters. RSV Nuyina carries four helicopters, six smaller vessels and 96 20-foot containers. The vessel will be the main lifeline to Australia's Antarctic and sub-Antarctic research stations. Its research equipment makes it the world's most advanced polar research vessel. Twelve school kids win a trip to Antarctica for naming Australia's new icebreaker Nuyina, the Indigenous word for southern lights. ""It is three ships in one – cargo carrier, floating scientific research lab, and icebreaker,"" Mr Richardson said. There's also a sea ice access ramp that comes out of the ship to deploy quad bikes or for scientists to walk off onto the sea ice. ""It's been designed to operate in the roughest ocean with efficiency but powerful enough to break ice up to 1.65 metres thick,"" Mr Richardson said. ""The 160.3-metre vessel can also be incredibly quiet like a submarine to carry out scientific operations with little to no noise disturbance."" It can carry cargo, 32 crew and 117 scientists for 90 days. ""With so many capabilities, it's best described as a Swiss Army knife of ships."" Mr Richardson, who has been inspired by his father's fishing career, said it was his dream job. ""I loved going on adventures to the other side of the bay and always listened to his stories of the early tuna poling days and all his otherworldly adventures on the ocean,"" he said. ""It really instilled in me a sense of being able to find great adventures in choosing a career in going to sea. ""I was also always aware of the Aurora Australis, the vessel before this one and often use to think how cool it would be to work on it."" Mr Richardson joined the RSV Nuyina in August during its final fit in the Netherlands. He is among a crew of 37 making the 24,000-kilometre journey to its home port of Hobart. ""It makes me feel incredibly proud to be a part of RSV Nuyina, as the other ships before this one have been so dearly remembered and loved in Australia's Antarctic history,"" Mr Richardson said. ""It's just an amazing opportunity to be a part of Antarctica's future and also be cemented into its history."" Mr Richardson is excited about the research elements of the ship. ""We'll be working with a range of different scientists and carrying out everything from sediment coring in the ocean floor to trawling for krill and other marine species, to monitoring sea ice."" The trawling can be carried out in conjunction with a range of sonar and multi-beam echo sounders to target species at different depths. ""We have a moon pool, which is essentially a big opening in the middle of the ship that can deploy a Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) rosette that can capture water samples in 36 different 12-litre bottles throughout the entire water column. ""The scientists can then measure how fast sound can travel through the water at different depths to calibrate the various transducers on the drop keels to carry out acoustic mapping of the sea floor and measure the biomass throughout the entire water column. ""The moon pool is also very useful for deploying remotely operated vehicles, and the great thing about this is that it can all be done while the ship is surrounded by ice, so it acts as the gateway to the ocean below the ice. ""The ship is powered by a hybrid diesel/electric propulsion system and the machinery in the engine room from the smallest pumps to the diesel generators that power the advanced electric drives are all mounted on rubber mounts, on a frame, which is then rubber mounted to the ship. ""This is called double-resilient mounting and makes the ship acoustically silent."" Mr Richardson is looking forward to heading south. ""My first expectation is that it's going to be a lot colder than where I have previously been working for the past 10 years in north Australia and Asia,"" he said. ""I just expect to be blown away by the beauty that is Antarctica and I'm really excited to see my first albatross while heading south.""

347,Queensland will soon be a 'renewable energy superpower'. What could that mean?,environment,"  Queensland will soon be home to the world's largest green hydrogen manufacturing facility. Here's what that means Mining billionaire Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest yesterday announced that Central Queensland would soon be home to the world's largest hydrogen manufacturing facility. It is expected to make Queensland a ""renewable energy superpower"". The facility has been heralded as a ""breakthrough"" for Australia's green energy market, with predictions the plant will double green hydrogen production capacity across the globe. It comes as Mr Forrest's company Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) on Monday announced a major partnership with manufacturing company Incitec Pivot to produce green ammonia on an industrial scale in Brisbane. As part of a trial, a new plant will produce green hydrogen that will then be turned into green ammonia — a compound Mr Forrest described as a ""zero-pollution"" fertiliser. So what actually is green hydrogen? How does it work? And what on Earth is an electrolyser? Let's go back to basics. Here's a quick breakdown of all your science questions: Hydrogen is an element that can be found in water and the atmosphere. It has long been described as the fuel of the future, the energy source that could bring the world to net-zero emissions. It's cheap and clean-burning. It's also the most abundant element in the universe. However, on Earth, hydrogen doesn't appear pure in nature and requires energy to separate it from other elements. The most common way to separate it is to extract hydrogen from water, which is two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen (hence H2O). That's where electrolysers come in. This is the device used to extract hydrogen from water. This happens when an electrical current is passed through a tank of water, separating hydrogen from oxygen in a process known as electrolysis. If the electricity is generated from renewable sources, such as solar or wind, the hydrogen emits a vapour that has no carbon footprint. At this stage, it's unclear whether FFI will use solar or wind to renewably power the electrolysers. So, to recap, green hydrogen is essentially hydrogen made without fossil fuels. Once that green hydrogen is produced, it can then be burnt to produce heat or fed into a fuel cell to make electricity. Mr Forrest said the first stage of the project will be a hub that will build green energy infrastructure and equipment, such as cabling and wind turbines. More importantly, it will manufacture electrolysers. The facility is destined to be built on Queensland government-owned land near Gladstone in Central Queensland and is the first stage of a six-step, $1 billion-plus operation. Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the facility will double the world's hydrogen capacity. ""FFI will construct a facility with an initial capacity to manufacture up to two gigawatts of electrolysers annually,"" he said. That renewable hydrogen energy will then be exported from Queensland to countries around the world. Green hydrogen gives Australia an opportunity to slash our emissions — and if we get this right, the impact could be nothing short of nation-building, argues business leader Andrew Forrest. Mr Forrest described the overall operation as a ""$1 billion-plus"" investment. The first stage of the six-step project is to build the facility near Gladstone. That will cost about $115 million. According to Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, this major investment also has the potential to create thousands of skilled jobs in regional areas. Ms Palaszczuk said the plant was initially expected to generate more than 300 local jobs for the Central Queensland region and ""thousands of jobs"" into the future. The Palaszczuk government last year announced a $10 million fund towards hydrogen investment, in addition to an earlier $15 million pledge.

348,"COP26 in Glasgow gets the headlines, but another summit kicks off in China today —and it's tackling a different crisis",environment,"  COP26 in Glasgow is coming. But 'The Paris Agreement for Nature' — the other COP — hopes to halt the biodiversity crisis Today, representatives from nearly 200 countries are meeting in Kunming, China, to finalise what has been described by some as ""the Paris Agreement for Nature"". The Kunming Declaration and Framework — which will be worked out at the UN's biodiversity convention, known as COP15 — also aims to put an end to humanity's disruption of a crucial planetary system. Where the Paris Agreement seeks to stop climate change, the Kunming Declaration aspires to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. But this isn't the first decade-long plan to halt the biodiversity crisis. Experts say every single goal set from 2010 to 2020 — through the Aichi Biodiversity Targets — failed. Regardless, there is hope things will be different this time around, with scientists saying it is too late to fail for another decade. Nature is being destroyed at a rate never before seen in human history, that rate is accelerating and almost all of the destruction is caused by humans. If the world's population doesn't act, 1 million species could be lost, according to the most comprehensive report on the matter produced by the United Nations. Advocates for action on climate change urge further commitments to reduce Australia's emissions ahead of the UN climate conference. More than 40 per cent of amphibian, 33 per cent of reef-forming corals and a third of all marine mammals are now threatened. According to the UN, climate change is one of the biggest causes of biodiversity loss, but the majority is still caused by more direct human impacts. The biggest is changes in land use like clearing forests to make way for agriculture and mining. The next biggest is simply the direct exploitation of animals — like overfishing. Many people see nature as having an intrinsic value. But the loss of nature has a direct catastrophic impact on humanity too. ""The World Economic Forum [put] a value on the loss of nature as $44 trillion in terms of what we've lost so far,"" said James Watson, a Professor of Conservation Science from the University of Queensland. ""If we don’t fix it and take action on biodiversity now, the World Economic Forum forecasts this will have catastrophic implications for the world’s economy."" With so much attention on the upcoming climate conference (COP26) in Glasgow, the thought of another summit might be confusing. The Glasgow meeting in November is the Conference of Parties to the UN's climate change convention. COP15 is the Conference of Parties to the UN's biodiversity convention: the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Every UN member country has signed and ratified the convention except the United States. COP15 is being hosted by China, but will be a mixture of in-person and virtual meetings. The meeting was meant to go ahead in 2020, but, well, 2020 happened. It will launch this week with further negotiations to occur in April and May next year. Joe Biden has moved to recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement — the internationally binding treaty to combat climate change. So what does this actually mean? Just as the Paris Agreement, ratified in 2015, governed how the world would deal with climate change between 2020 and 2030, the Kunming Declaration will aim to govern how the world deals with the biodiversity crisis in the same period. The new agreement will replace the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which included ending illegal fishing and stopping the extinction of known threatened species. Professor Watson said none of the 20 targets was met. The final agreement is yet to be seen and won't be finalised until the next meeting, in April 2022. But the world will sign up to 20 targets as part of a ""framework"". Among the draft targets and milestones for 2030 so far are: On top of that, parties will also be asked to sign an overarching document that sets the broader agenda for the framework called the Kunming Declaration. The latest draft of the declaration includes a commitment for each country to ensure that global biodiversity is ""on a path to recovery by 2030 at the latest"". Nathaniel Pelle from the Australian Conservation Foundation said that's a great step forward. But he wants it to go further. ""We want [all parties] including Australia to agree to a global mission to reverse the destruction of nature, to set the world on a path to be 'nature positive' or to be in better health than we are now by 2030."" Professor Watson said there were two reasons why the Aichi Targets failed so badly. The first is that countries signed up to it but just didn't bother to act on it. The second was that there was no good way to measure progress, he said. ""So we didn't even know how things were progressing until it was too late to realise that we were failing."" It's one of the reasons he has some hope that the Kunming Declaration will be different. According to Professor Watson, measuring the final targets will depend on how the negotiations go at the meeting. But whatever happens, he said, satellite technology had come so far that measurement would be easier. ""I'm hoping that now that we've set some more ambitious targets, nations will have to act because it will be bloody obvious if they haven't done it. ""We'll be able to see because satellites don't lie,"" he said. But not everyone is optimistic. Environmental lawyer Michelle Lim, from Macquarie University, said she was worried that as none of the targets are binding, countries were likely to ignore them again. ""Almost every single article of the convention is qualified in terms of 'as far as possible' and 'as appropriate', or 'subject to national legislation'. And there's even a specific article clearly stating the sovereign right of states to do essentially what they like within their sovereign territory,"" Dr Lim said. For that reason, Dr Lim baulks at descriptions in the media of the agreement forged in Kunming as akin to the Paris Agreement. ""In terms of the enforcement mechanisms, or the coercion exerted by international law to meet particular targets, that's much stronger in the Paris as compared to what's occurring here."" There's a lot at stake for Australia. It is ranked third in the world for the most species extinction and number one when it comes to extinctions of mammals. More than a third of all mammal extinctions since industrialisation have occurred in Australia. A study this year found that 19 ecosystems in Australia are now ""collapsing"" — including the crucial Murray-Darling Basin and the Great Barrier Reef. While that's bad for the non-human species that live in those ecosystems, it is also devastating for the nation. Australians depend on forests for drinking water, on river systems for food production and places like the Great Barrier Reef are crucial for parts of our economy. Meanwhile, Australia has cut funding for nature protection and restoration by about 40 per cent since the Coalition came to power in 2013, according to analysis by the Australian Conservation Foundation. A spokesman for Environment Minister Sussan Ley said the government disputed that interpretation of the budget. But Nathaniel Pelle wants Australia to do more. ""Over 90 countries have signed the leaders pledge. Sadly, Australia isn't one of them,"" he said.

349,'Pack of peasants': Tempers flare as incineration stoush heats up,environment,"  Regional NSW treated like 'pack of peasants' in state's waste incineration plan Austin McLennan's family have worked on their 5000-acre Goulburn farm for three generations. But he claims his livelihood is now under threat — from a $600 million waste-to-energy incinerator proposed in his backyard. ""There is no way that we want this incinerator in our town and if you think that you are going to just waltz in and throw it up, then you've got another thing coming,"" Mr McLennan said. ""We are not afraid of a fight, and we are not used to losing them."" Waste-to-energy technology involves burning rubbish at high temperatures to create steam which is then used to power turbines and create electricity. Incineration also diverts millions of tonnes of waste from landfill — displacing potent methane gas emissions. Mr McLennan runs livestock and grows crops on his property 10 kilometres away from the Tarago landfill which currently takes 20 per cent of Sydney's waste. ""There seems to be a lot of unknowns, things that haven't been properly tried and tested,"" he said. ""The potential risk of micro particles to come from the proposed incinerator that would potentially fall down on our farming land."" Australia's biggest city is forecast to start reaching its landfill capacity by the end of the decade. The NSW government believes part of the solution is to burn its waste to create energy and reduce landfill. In 2018 the Independent Planning Commission rejected a proposal to build a waste incinerator in Western Sydney, citing uncertainty over the plant's impact on the environment and public health. The state government has now prohibited the construction of incinerators near high-density residential areas. Instead, Goulburn, Lithgow, Parkes and the Richmond Valley have been identified as sites for new waste-to-energy infrastructure. The proponent of the Tarago waste-to-energy facility has assured the Goulbourn community the incinerator will employ world's best practices and that the technology is safe. ""We have built 65 of these units around the world,"" said Veolia chief executive Richard Kirkman. ""It is a state-of-the-art technology, and it does protect human health and the environment."" These assurances have failed to mollify the locals. ""It's not good enough in Western Sydney but it's good enough here in Tarago,"" Mr McLennan said. ""I feel as if we are being treated like a pack of peasants."" ""Why should our lives matter less than the people of Sydney?"" Fierce opposition to the proposal from residents has forced Goulburn Mulwaree Council to oppose the construction of waste incinerators in the region. ""I think the problem is a Sydney problem and Sydney needs to deal with its waste management,"" said Goulburn Mayor Bob Kirk. ""We simply can't allow or support any development that might come to our area that potentially poses a threat to the health and wellbeing of our residents."" While in Lithgow Mayor Ray Thompson said his community has been treated as an afterthought. ""I'm very concerned, there should have been some consultation to let the community know exactly what's involved before they would come out and, and just say, this is where it's going,"" he said. The Australian waste-to-energy industry is in its infancy — with the first two large-scale waste incinerators south of Perth to begin operating in 2022. But there are concerns the world is moving away from waste incineration. The European Union burns 27 per cent if its trash and has moved to exclude waste incineration from receiving sustainable energy subsidies. This is in line with its commitment to a 55 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. ""The European Commission has developed policies and an agenda to decommission the waste incineration industry,"" said Jane Bremmer from Zero Waste Australia. ""They have recognised that waste incineration has compromised sustainable waste management."" One of the biggest users of waste-to-energy technology Denmark has promised to reduce the amount of rubbish it burns by 30 per cent, in line with its ambitious emissions reduction target. In recent years the country has been forced to import waste to keep its large expensive incinerators operational. Environmentalists believe Australia could soon find itself in a similar situation once the new incinerators come online, where the incineration economy becomes an impediment to more sustainable waste management practices. ""Australia has a unique opportunity to leapfrog to a sustainable zero waste and circular economy future if they learn the lessons from Europe, and don't go down the path of incineration,"" said Ms Bremmer.

350,Award for studying how prescribed burning helps native animals,environment,"  Riverland ecologist recognised for research into prescribed burning practices to protect wildlife A South Australian ecologist has been rewarded for her work researching how the survival rate of the environment's smallest critters can be improved in Australia's harshest landscapes. Heather Neilly is one of a team of researchers at Calperum Station in the state's Riverland region, a large wildlife reserve near the town of Renmark. Dr Neilly has worked on projects that focus on how disturbances affect the environment and the animals that inhabit it. Dr Neilly has now been recognised for her work by being named the winner of this year's Wiley Next Generation Ecologist Award by the Ecological Society of Australia. ""It gives me a great opportunity to present the work that we're doing on a national stage,"" she said. ""A lot of the information that we find out here can then be applied to other locations around Australia."" Dr Neilly is currently researching how fire prevention measures and livestock grazing effect the ecosystem in the Mallee woodlands — the scrub of trees and grasses set back from the Murray River's edge. The study involves observing how spinifex, a type of grass abundant in the area, operates as a thermal refuge for reptiles and small animals under various fire prevention programs. ""Mallee woodlands are actually adapted to fire — so fire is a natural and important part of that system and need it to regenerate,"" Dr Neilly said. ""When fire comes through an area it changes the structure of the vegetation, where animals live. ""So, fire is affecting the ability of animals to do the things they need to do, like finding food, to shelter, and for reptiles, regulating their body temperature."" Dr Neilly added the aim of her study was to find a back-burning method that both reduced the risk posed by bushfires while also ensuring valuable habitat was not burned away in the process. ""The reason these thermal refuges are really important is with climate change we're expecting to get a lot more extreme heat events, so having thermal refuges in a system is going to be more important for these animals,"" she said. ""Ultimately, what we'd like to be able to work out is the best way to do prescribed burns to make sure that we are having these thermal refuges for animals."" As a result of Dr Neilly taking home the award, she will give a plenary address on her work at Calperum to some of the most esteemed ecologists in the country, at the Ecological Society of Australia's annual conference in November. The wildlife reserve forms part of the Riverland's Ramsar wetlands site and recently was the location of a significant discovery of Aboriginal artefacts, in the form of rare shells. ""It's a wonderful place to work. I'm able to be on the property and out on the field every day seeing what's going on out there,"" Dr Neilly said. ""My science can help inform what they [the managers of the property] are doing with the management. ""Likewise I'm learning from the outcomes of the management, which feeds back into my research.""

351,"By hunting rather than farming, ecosystems remain intact. Is this the future of meat?",environment," Science Hunting animals for meat reduces greenhouse emissions compared to farming, study finds Putting a financial value on hunting can help preserve ecosystems under threat from expanding agriculture, according to new research. A study published today in the journal Nature found that the diets of people living on bushmeat — animals hunted from the wild — in Amazonia and tropical Africa, created far less greenhouse gas emissions than if they were to get their protein from farmed beef. Yet those same areas are under continual threat of land clearing for the expansion of cattle grazing. By putting a financial value on both the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions being saved by people living on bushmeat compared to beef, and the amount of CO2 being sequestered by allowing those ecosystems to remain intact, the researchers argue that we could create a financial incentive to protect those habitats in regions like the Amazon and Congo Basin. And the findings may also have implications for Australia. The researchers looked at the results of studies from 49 sites from countries across tropical Africa and the Amazon region of South America. Bushmeat hunting at the sites analysed was the main source of protein for about150,000 people in total. Researchers found that the bushmeat diet — mostly mammals and birds — produced 71 megatonnes less CO2 or CO2-equivalent emissions per year on average than a comparable intake of farmed beef. The data for the consumption of bushmeat from the 49 sites was compiled from studies conducted between 1973 and 2019. For perspective, they estimate that's worth around $US3 million per year in carbon credits. The UN's Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) is essentially a carbon-offsetting scheme where high-polluting industries can pay low-income countries to conserve forests. But according to the researchers, the REDD+ scheme looks at the amount of carbon stored in the physical forest without taking into account the offsets of the people living on those resources. Paying people to preserve their environment and enabling them to continue living a lower-impact lifestyle is a valid approach to conservation, according to conservation scientist Matthew Hayward from the University of Newcastle, who wasn't involved in this study. ""Those kinds of payments for ecosystem services are becoming more and more important,"" Professor Hayward said. Research published in 2019 by Professor Hayward found that hunting wild game for meat and body parts was the number one threat to more than 150 animal species. Kurt Cobain once sang, ""it's OK to eat fish, cos they don't have any feelings"". But is the cliche actually true? Elephants, gorillas and the Somali ostrich were among the megafauna directly threatened by hunting for bushmeat. And some methods of bushmeat hunting, like using snare traps, are extremely cruel, according to Professor Hayward. However, many people around the world rely on catching animals as their only source of protein, and it generally has a much smaller ecological impact than intensive agriculture. ""It's easy for us white people to have a go at bushmeat hunting because [food scarcity] is not a problem first-world people have to face,"" Professor Hayward said. ""A lot of people rely on bushmeat to get them through. ""The alternative to deriving protein from bushmeat is large-scale agriculture, which is what we perform, and that's completely ecologically devastating, creating monocultures."" He said there were ways to make hunting more sustainable, such as creating buffer zones around reserves, as well as education and raising the living standards of people in some of these areas. But even with current practices as they are, Professor Hayward said bushmeat was generally a better option than agriculture for people living in lower population densities. Agriculture in Australia is responsible for just under 15 per cent of our annual greenhouse gas emissions, and livestock alone for 11 per cent. Australia has several species of wild game that can potentially be substituted for red meat. Those include feral deer, goat and rabbit, as well as kangaroo. While there are a lot of factors involved in calculating the carbon emissions of food, such as the distance driven to acquire it and the amount of time spent in refrigeration, it is broadly true that a wild-caught goat or kangaroo will have a smaller carbon footprint than farmed cattle in Australia. An individual who is able to hunt their own food here is therefore likely to have a smaller carbon footprint than if they get the equivalent protein from beef. A second benefit to hunting in this way is the removal of pests from the environment. However, on the scale that hunting is a realistic option for Australians, it's unlikely to be viable for significantly reducing the national greenhouse gas budget or keeping our pests under control, according to environmental policy expert Richard Price from the ANU. ""The amount of invasive animals we have in Australia is way beyond hunters to be able to manage in numbers that are required to really reduce their impact on the environment,"" says Dr Price, who is also a portfolio director at the Centre for Invasive Species Solutions. ""We've got deer coming out of our butts right around the country. Hunters can only go out and shoot one or two … the number [of deer being removed] are just not there."" The key to hunting have any significant impacts in Australia is to establish a commercial market for their products, something Dr Price doesn't think will happen. ""You can't have all Australians going out and shooting their own animals. You have to have an industry if you're to get to [that scale] of eating,"" he said. ""With bush animals in Australia … there's just no demand there — it's a niche industry. ""Those who have got money won't keep that kind of product on their table night after night, but they will keep coming back to things like beef and chicken."" Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. But George Wilson from the ANU's Fenner School says there is potential for Australian farmers to be earning carbon credits from incorporating kangaroos into their productions systems. Professor Wilson's research interests include the sustainable use of wildlife on the rangelands and the production of low-emission kangaroo meat. ""With support from Agrifutures Australia, we are currently working on how that might be achieved,"" Professor Wilson said. ""Our investigations indicate that instead of replacing livestock that have perished in the drought, landholders should be making greater use of the kangaroos that have survived the drought and breeding them back in order to gain carbon credits. ""Improved kangaroo management and greater engagement by landholders in it can also lead to additional credits being earned under the revegetation methodologies under the Emissions Reduction Fund.""

352,"Sustainability is unrealistic and we need to go back to basics, say experts",environment,"  Sustainable development won't solve environmental crises, say these experts. It's simpler than that Sustainable development is a priority for anyone genuinely concerned about the environment. Unless we as a society rethink our use of global resources, life, as we know it, will one day cease to exist. The United Nations has made this an international imperative, setting out a series of 17 broad sustainability goals which it hopes can be met by 2030. The corporate world has also come on board, with an ever-growing number of companies developing their own green reporting standards and committing to a sustainable future. Meeting those objectives is now a trillion-dollar industry. The problem is, there's no consensus about what ""sustainable development"" actually means and how it should be measured. Some researchers believe it's little more than corporate ""greenwashing."" While others see it as a misplaced ideal that could exacerbate — rather than avert — social and environmental destruction. Academic Christopher Barnatt, from the website ExplainingTheFuture.com, describes sustainability as a ""dangerous"" concept. ""It gives the impression that we could all go on living exactly as we live today but sustainably — with this sort of magic thing wrapped around it,"" he tells ABC RN's Future Tense. Future Tense explores new ideas and new technologies. Sustainable development may be ""politically convenient"", he argues, but it has no real meaning in a world driven by exponential consumption and powered by unlimited extraction. ""As a physical concept, [sustainability] is impossible. Life itself is a physically consumptive process. ""The only way we can actually preserve things for the future and look after the environment is to change how we live, to use fewer resources, to value things in another way."" Climatologist Chirag Dhara agrees. While a focus on reducing fossil fuel use is laudable, he says, we have to be careful not to ignore the greater threat posed by the exponential consumption of resources. ""Our economy is highly extractive, whether it's agriculture [or] manufacturing. What's happening is our use of the raw materials, our material footprint, is growing in lockstep with the growth of GDP, our economic growth."" And that, says Professor Dhara, an assistant professor at Krea University in India, can't continue forever. Even renewable energy technologies eventually need to be replaced, he points out. While they might be better for the environment, they're not cost neutral. They consume resources over the course of their lifespan and through the systems constructed to distribute the energy they generate. ""All of this technology is made possible through principles of physics and chemistry and mathematics that allows them to happen, but the same principles inevitably limit them. ""That means that if we want to preserve the current paradise of limitless economic growth,"" he says, ""it has to be completely decoupled from the use of material resources."" And under the current system of global consumer capitalism, he warns, that's never going to happen. For Melissa Checker, the term sustainable development conjures up very different thoughts – ones of displacement and social inequality. ""The way it's playing out, it's undermining its stated intention,"" she says. And there are contradictions in its application. Building a perfect Green Star-rated building loses all sustainable credentials, she says, if the land it's built on is a converted wetland. An associate professor of urban studies at City University of New York, Dr Checker believes true sustainability and environmental justice are incompatible with dominant forms of urban development. ""Sustainability became a very useful concept in an effort to market New York city to more affluent residents and to promote the redevelopment needed to attract those upscale residents."" But, time and again, says Dr Checker, the end result has been a rise in property values which, in turn, has forced residents from lower socio-economic groups out of their homes and neighbourhoods. It's also led to growing inequality in the provision of services and opportunities, she contends. ""As some neighbourhoods are being greened, other neighbourhoods are becoming more brown. ""Neighbourhoods that are not slated for gentrification or redevelopment are getting more toxic facilities, more industrial facilities and no green amenities. They are being sacrificed for the sake of redevelopment in these other places."" Dr Checker argues the concept of sustainable development has been hijacked by corporate interests. In the case of New York, she cites the powerful real estate and development sectors. Her suspicions chime with recent research from Renard Siew, a climate change advisor with the Centre for Governance and Political Studies, headquartered in Malaysia. Dr Siew, who also advises the World Economic Forum, says a lack of global consistency in the way sustainability standards are measured has allowed companies to game the system by picking and choosing the assessment tools that best suit their corporate interests. ""It's not surprising to see common indicators, common criteria such as carbon emissions reported differently. Which means it's very difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison."" A lack of standardisation, Dr Siew says, is also an issue with the rating systems used to assess the eco-credentials of new and refurbished buildings. But at the heart of the problem, he says, is the voluntary nature of reporting. ""It should be made mandatory, with really detailed requirements of what is expected in terms of certain criteria, to avoid situations where a company can cherry-pick indicators that they want to report on to put them in a good light."" He notes that both the European Union and the UN are now making moves toward compulsory sustainability reporting measures. But progress is slow. Design expert Stuart Walker from Lancaster University advocates a return to the original concept of sustainable development. The UN's Brundtland Commission developed the term as a way of structuring international assistance to the developing world. It provided a framework to ensure future development in countries didn't inadvertently destroy people's livelihoods and the environment. It was a multi-faceted approach, says Dr Checker. ""They called for prioritising of ecological, economic and social sustainability. ""European cities really took it on. Also environmental justice activists really embraced the term as a way to think about the kind of calls they were issuing for racial justice and social justice along with environmental justice."" But, according to Professor Walker, the embrace of the sustainability ethos was soon corrupted and is now predominantly viewed through the lens of business and finance. ""It's very easy to create a nice, green annual report about all the environmental things a company might be doing – but what is that in proportion to the whole of their operation?"" he says. ""If you separate them out, you're not getting that holistic picture."" For Christopher Barnatt, the elephant in the room is modern capitalism and the theory of planned obsolescence, where objects are deliberately manufactured to be disposable in order to maximise the potential for future sales. ""Economics basically tells us to consume as much as we want and it doesn't cost-in the consequences: recognising there isn't an infinite supply of resources and that there are implications for the planet and the environment."" The answer, he says, is not only to consume less but to value more. ""We don't have to go back that far to find generations of people who saved up to purchase objects which they kept, in many cases, for a lifetime. They valued the things they had."" ""Consuming less doesn't necessarily mean having a less material world,"" says Dr Barnatt. ""It just has to be a material world in which we have the things we have for a longer period of time.""

353,analysis: Five reasons why Scott Morrison needs a net zero climate target,environment,"  Five reasons why the Morrison government needs a net zero climate target — not just a plan Prime Minister Scott Morrison may be warming to a net zero emissions target by 2050, but Australia is still far from adopting it – largely thanks to resistance from the National Party. Should Morrison fail to get the policy over the line, he will no doubt point to the government's low-emissions technology roadmap as evidence the government still has a climate plan. But a vague plan is not enough. That was confirmed by a recent analysis showing Australia's climate policies are insufficient and have inevitably led to investment in new fossil fuel projects. Reaching net zero emissions will require intense policy focus, private investment and clear accountability — conditions only a firm numerical target can provide. Here are five reasons the Morrison government must, at a minimum, set a target of net zero emissions by 2050. Australia's business community has been urging a national net zero target to create certainty for investors. In just one example, the $2 trillion Investor Group on Climate Change recently called on the Morrison government to adopt a stronger climate policy. As chief executive Rebecca Mikula-Wright told The Australian: ""We have to be able to invest with certainty for the long term if we're going to invest billions of dollars in capital."" The New South Wales Coalition government has set a target of net zero emissions by 2050, with an interim target of 50 per cent emissions reduction by 2030. It expects those targets will stimulate up to $37 billion in private-sector investment. Research into emissions reduction in South Australia shows how setting a strong emissions-reduction target provides a framework for government policy. As the Coalition debates the idea of a zero carbon emissions policy, what would it mean for a sector that feels let down by the climate debate? In 2002, the state's then-Labor government adopted a target of 26 per cent renewables generation by 2020. It marked the beginning of consistent and coordinated climate policy, making the state more attractive to investors than other states with weaker policies. The target was backed by government action. New laws encouraged wind farms in areas away from towns and homes, and the projects were underwritten by state government supply contracts. And as coal generators closed, the state government funded new employment opportunities for affected workers. The state now has a target of 100 per cent electricity from renewables by 2030 — one that has been embraced by the current Liberal government. It continues to create the market conditions for increased investment in renewables technology. Likewise, in NSW the net zero target has triggered supportive government policy, such as seeking private investment in pumped hydro storage schemes and planning for massive investment in solar and wind. A numerical emissions target means a government can be held to account. When targets are accompanied by the appropriate reporting mechanisms, it's clear if they're being met. Ten years ago Andrew Robb arrived at Parliament House intent upon an act of treachery. His plan would blow apart Australia's two great parties irrevocably just as they teetered toward consensus on climate change, the most divisive issue of the Australian political century. This accountability can be seen in the United Kingdom. There, a group of climate scientists recently warned the nation risked missing its 2035 emissions-reduction target by a long way because government policies were insufficient, and new commitments too slow. The UK has set a target of net zero by 2050, and missing its interim targets would put that longer-term goal at risk. Such targets act as a gauge against which government progress can be evaluated. In Australia, this happens in other policy areas such as regular Closing the Gap reports, which measure progress towards targets in areas such as Indigenous health, education, employment and life expectancy. And following delays in getting people vaccinated against COVID-19, Australia's vaccination targets now establish benchmarks against which governments are being assessed. If Australia continues to lag the world on climate policy, we will suffer a real economic cost. From 2026, the European Union will apply border charges to carbon-intensive goods from countries such as Australia without a carbon price or a 2050 net zero emissions target. Other nations are considering similar measures. Australia already has a poor reputation on climate action, dating back to the 1997 Kyoto conference where the Howard government demanded special treatment. Among the demands were a uniquely generous target whereby our national emissions would actually increase by 8 per cent above 1990 levels. Our international reputation as a climate pariah has only worsened in the decades since. Now, even key allies such as the United States and the UK are calling on Australia to lift its game. Australia must urgently change the way it's perceived on the world stage, by setting a net zero target that shows we're making a serious contribution to the global climate effort. Setting a net zero target would give the Morrison government some chance of restoring its credibility on climate policy before the next election. At the 2019 general election, the loss of Tony Abbott's seat of Warringah to pro-climate independent Zali Steggall sent a warning to Liberal MPs, even those in blue-ribbon seats, that they're vulnerable on climate policy. Rewriting our submarine deal required a willingness to take a difficult stand for a long-term objective. In the next six weeks, Scott Morrison has the chance to apply the same critical lens to climate change, writes Melissa Clarke. The 2019-20 bushfire season was a brutal reminder to Australian voters that climate change is happening now. The federal government is yet to show the community it understands the need to respond. Even if Australia adopts a 2050 target, however, it's not enough. The timeline is so long, today's politicians can get away with doing very little now. And by the time 2050 rolls around, it will be all but impossible to hold them to account for today's failures. Very few will still be in public life, if they're alive at all. So if the Morrison government does want to show it takes climate policy seriously, it must set a credible 2030 target. The current goal — a 26-28 per cent emissions reduction based on 2005 levels — is totally inadequate. A responsible target, with a finish line just eight years away, would give the Morrison government the laser focus it needs to get Australia on the path to net zero.

354,'The community is screaming out': Darwin aldermen fighting to save Lee Point despite government's refusal to budge,environment,"  Darwin council aldermen to move motion to save Lee Point despite NT government's refusal to budge Aldermen are calling for urgent action to protect one of the last vestiges of natural bushland in Darwin from urban sprawl in the form of an official motion to the City of Darwin Council. Bulldozers have swept through hectares of threatened cycad species and natural habitat at Lee Point, a northern suburb of Darwin, in the Northern Territory, as plans for 800 Defence Housing Australia homes forge ahead. But council alderman Rebecca Want de Rowe, who will be submitting the motion at next Tuesday's council meeting along with alderman Justine Glover, says the ""development completely goes against everything that council is fighting for"". Ms Want de Rowe said she is calling for the council to write to Environment Minister Eva Lawler asking to freeze construction until the NT Planning Commission completes a ""thorough area plan"". ""This is not a done deal, the Minister has the right to stop this,"" she said. ""It's an urban forest and recently the City of Darwin unanimously voted on a Greening Darwin Strategy, and the aim of that strategy was to protect our urban forest, to increase our tree canopy and to keep our city cool and green."" The project was approved by the Development Consent Authority in 2018. But Ms Want de Rowe said in 2016, at the time the project was given the green light, public consultation had been ""dismal"". She also said in the wake of a global pandemic, the importance of green space had been brought to the forefront. ""At the last council election, I was inundated with people saying they were concerned about the development at Lee Point,"" she said. ""The community is screaming out that they want a cooler, greener and more beautiful city, and that's what Lee Point is in a nutshell, so the destruction of it is just mindless."" The motion is expected to be supported by seven other aldermen and Darwin City Council Mayor Kon Vatskalis. Recently appointed alderman Amye Un, who will also be throwing her support behind the motion, has questioned the public benefit of the development and the location. ""This is a heritage we have to leave for the next generation, our children,"" she said. ""Why do we have to destroy [it] … the government has so much empty land everywhere. Why are they greedy about this one?"" She said the land should instead be protected and conserved as the birdwatching and tourism mecca it already was, attracting 80 per cent of the bird species of Kakadu and 80 per cent of the migratory shorebird species of Australia. Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner has consistently maintained it is ""too late"" to stop the development. Despite growing opposition, he said more houses were needed in Darwin, where vacancy rates are plunging, to entice workers into jobs. ""The blocks are both for sale and sold and the development is proceeding,"" he said. ""At the moment we've got jobs available during the recession … we want people to take up those jobs. People need to live somewhere."" The government said about one-quarter – or 21 hectares – would be incorporated into the existing Casuarina Coastal Reserve and a further 11 hectares would be set aside as open space. Environment Minister Eva Lawler said she was not ""into overturning decisions of independent statutory boards"", including the NT Environment Protection Authority and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. She said while she understands public concerns, ""the subdivision will go ahead"". ""I listen to experts … otherwise I could have developers coming to see me, lobbying me hard, wanting me to overturn decisions … it has to work both ways,"" the minister said. A recent City of Darwin Council study examining wild cats at Lee Point uncovered two endangered species: the black footed tree rat and the yellow spotted monitor. It is these discoveries, combined with rising temperatures as cities become concrete heat islands, and the projected increase in traffic congestion and car-related emissions, which have community members up in arms. The CSIRO last year said highly urbanised parts of Darwin might become high-risk areas for heat-related illness within decades and the number of days above 35 degrees Celsius could increase significantly by 2030. Ian Redmond, an avid birdwatcher and member of community action group Friends of Lee Point, said dissent over the development had been ignored by the government. ""There was inadequate consultation to start … everyone we speak to hates the development, [they believe] that they are going to lose something special,"" he said. ""It's a reserve that has a high level of biodiversity … most cities in the world would love to have a reserve like Lee Point on their doorstep. ""It (the development) is bad for the environment and it's bad for the economy."" Defence Housing Australia has been contacted for comment.

355,Australia’s Charles Darwin and the audacious plan to save the reef,environment,"  Charlie Veron's 'coral ark' biobank plan to futureproof the Great Barrier Reef Charlie Veron is practically a human fish. He would never come to the surface if he didn't run out of oxygen. He would live down there in an underwater garden at one with the fish and the other busy marine life. Dr Veron has spent the past 50 years diving around coral reefs, observing, absorbing, enveloped by nature, at home in some of the most remote places on Earth. And every single time he dives, ""I see stuff I have never seen before. It is unending."" A living reef, he says, is ""really noisy"". ""You can hear all the snapping shrimp and all the fish and other organisms communicating acoustically with each other. Things chatting away to each other. It's like being in the middle of a city."" Most of all, he likes it at night. Torch turned off, sitting alone on the bottom of the ocean on an outer reef when the Moon is bright. ""Everything is either silver or grey. It is just absolute, absolute beauty."" When he first started diving the Great Barrier Reef in 1972, Dr Veron says, it was an ""otherworldly experience"", a place teeming with life. Now, in places, it is silent, ""like a tomb. All you can hear are the bubbles from your regulator"". He was in a state of depression about the degraded, dying reef when, four years ago, he joined a scientific expedition to the remote far northern Great Barrier Reef, a 1,000-kilometre stretch from Port Douglas to Cape York. There, among all the dead coral, they found a perfect living coral garden. ""It is incredible,"" Dr Veron said coming out of the water. ""This place is not done yet that is for sure."" There was elation, there was hope and there was inspiration. There had to be a way of preserving the reef. Now Dr Veron is at the heart of a bold plan to collect one of every species of coral on the Great Barrier Reef to create a coral biobank or ""coral ark"". ""They can be used when the technology is right to repopulate the reefs,"" Dr Veron says. ""There's no plan B, that's it. If we don't do it, it's all over."" The federal government and scientists agree the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef is climate change. When the water is too warm it upsets the symbiotic relationship between coral and its resident algae, causing bleaching. The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states coral reefs worldwide will be mostly wiped out by a 1.5-degree Celsius rise in temperature. On current projections, that grim milestone will be reached in 2035. It makes preserving the biodiversity of the Great Barrier Reef all the more important. If the corals can be collected and kept alive in aquariums for posterity, they will not be lost. Great Barrier Reef Legacy managing director Dean Miller says coral is perfect for a biobank. ""Corals are very good at staying alive,"" Dr Miller, a marine biologist, says. ""They can do that for hundreds, if not thousands, of years under the correct conditions. They asexually reproduce or clone themselves. And so in six to 12 months, they'll double in size."" The 85 species of coral already collected are housed in a commercial aquarium in Cairns, with ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art facility in Port Douglas. Fragments of these corals are microchipped and sent out to aquariums throughout the world. For such a monumental conservation project, Dr Miller says: ""You need a Charlie Veron."" ""Without a Charlie, you have no idea what species of which you are bringing out of the water,"" Dr Miller says. ""Charlie is one of a handful of people around the world who can actually identify corals to a species level underwater. In fact, he is the best person on the planet to be able to do this. Dr Miller says Dr Veron is the ""rock star of the coral reef world"". ""We are never going to see that level of skill and expertise ever again,"" he says. Everything Dr Veron has done has brought him to this remarkable moment. Dr Veron has been awarded the prestigious Darwin Medal for his work on coral evolution, and he has discovered more than 20 per cent of the world's coral species. But it is a race against time. Not just the rate at which species are dying, but because Charlie Veron is 77 years old. ""He's very agile, like a young diver,"" Mr Miller says. ""Very old school and not much stops him, a tough old bugger. But he's not going to be able to do this forever."" For his part, Dr Veron — often called the godfather of coral — is only half joking when he says he has been trying to retire for ""at least 20 years"". And he says: ""It doesn't look like it's getting any closer."" As eminent a scientist and naturalist he is now, Dr Veron's life could have turned out very differently. For a start, his given name is John, not Charlie. He was born, he says, to love nature. ""There's never been an instant in my life where I didn't want to escape into the natural world,"" he says. It was an obsession from an early age and still is. As a child on summer holidays at the beach, he collected things from rock pools, even a highly venomous blue-ringed octopus. He named it Ocky. He kept ""everything under the Sun, fossils and snakes"" in the family garage. He would cause alarm by taking insects to school, including scorpions and once a funnel-web spider. ""She was called Spooks, this great big spider, and my teacher said, 'Charles Darwin, get that out of here.'"" From that day on he was called Charlie. But school was unmitigated hell. ""I mean really, seriously terrible."" He has always thought differently to other people. ""I was a walking encyclopedia, not only about the natural world, about anything that interested me. But I can't be taught,"" he says. He lived in his own world and couldn't pay attention. He was asthmatic and the stress caused him to stutter. ""So, I couldn't play sport. I was this kid who couldn't speak, couldn't play sport, was at the bottom of every class, my self-esteem wasn't too good. I didn't learn anything. I would have been better off never going to school,"" Dr Veron says. He became two people; one the hopeless school kid and the other the nature-loving kid who ""knew everything that was interesting"". That inner world was his home. After he barely scraped through the leaving certificate — ""I got the worst possible pass"" — repeated the year with similar results, there was the looming question of what he would do when he left school. ""Nobody had any idea,"" Dr Veron says. Fed up with failing exams, he didn't want to go when there was a group of psychologists running an IQ study with the chance of a university place. His father persuaded him to do the tests and Charlie performed brilliantly. He would be offered a scholarship to do anything he wanted at any university in Australia. ""We think you are a gifted child,"" he was told. Charlie thought they had the wrong person. He chose the University of New England because ""it was the closest thing to the bush"". Here he was ""reborn"", undertaking a Bachelor of Science in life sciences, zoology and botany. His stutter and his asthma vanished. He suddenly became athletic, taking up running. With no background in marine biology but having a scuba diving qualification, he won a research fellowship at James Cook University at Townsville, studying the Great Barrier Reef. ""I was absolutely stunned by it,"" he says. ""The whole thing was more alive than anything I had experienced before."" He was given free rein and a blank check to dive on the reef, a three-year job to monograph the corals, which were then virtually unknown. ""It was the job description from heaven. I probably saw more of the reef than anyone ever has before."" Taking diving field trips to every corner of the reef, his work was pioneering. Dr Veron has authored more than 100 scientific articles, including 14 books and monographs. In the early days, Dr Veron had thought the reef was indestructible. The 1975 declaration of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park saved it from oil mining and drilling. In the 1980s the major threats were pollution from coastal areas and crown of thorns starfish. ""I thought there wasn't any human threat. I felt it was big enough to look after itself,"" Dr Veron says. But the ominous signs were there. ""I saw coral bleaching on the reef in 1980. I knew what it was,"" Dr Veron says. Over the following decade, scientists made increasing links between climate change and coral bleaching. The summer of 1997-1998 was the hottest on record and by then the alarm bells were ringing. Dr Veron, who had briefly been a climate sceptic, says ""it scared the hell"" out of him. He did what he had always done: He read all the science, he joined all the dots and wrote another book, A Reef in Time, The Great Barrier Reef from Beginning to End. In 2009 he was summoned to an emergency meeting of the Royal Society in London, and introduced by David Attenborough to an audience of the world's most eminent scientists. ""That talk was the first of its kind in the sort of depth where it delved into all the known science and the projections, and I've realised for the first time that it wasn't just about coral reefs — it was about the entire ocean ecosystem going down,"" says friend and underwater cinematographer David Hannan. Dr Veron admits he lost some friends over it. ""Yes, I do ruffle feathers and I do get attacked for it, but I really don't care,"" he says. ""I'd care if I was wrong."" In a state of devastation, he was sounding the alarm in the media, to scientists, to politicians, across the world. The natural recluse felt he had no choice but to shout as loud as he could. It took a while for the rest of the world to catch up. World leaders are gathering in Glasgow next month for the UN Climate Change Conference, or COP26, in what is being hailed as ""the world's best last chance"" to get the climate emergency under control. Charlie Veron gets the same sense of joy and wonder being in a rainforest as he does on a reef; embedded in nature. ""And if someone else is going to start talking I just want them to go away because I want to be in the rainforest by myself,"" he says. In what he describes as a ""climate-change move"", he and his family have moved from Townsville and bought land in the Atherton Tablelands. ""We're going to be planting 20,000 to 40,000 trees"" as part of a corridor that connects the rainforest on their property to the adjoining World Heritage area. When not planting trees, he and partner Mary are putting together a website that captures his entire life's work. Dr Veron is trying to transfer his entire living career so that anyone can identify corals. Sometimes he wishes he hadn't started this enormous project. ""It's taken so much work"" and he struggles for funding. And there is the ""big, big"" job of selecting and collecting the corals for the biobank, the ""insurance policy"" for the natural world that has been failed by humans. ""It makes so much sense that it would be absolutely negligent not to do this,"" Dr Veron says. ""We're looking decades, centuries ahead. And that's what really counts. Everything is worth trying. It's one of the joys of my life to see this happening."" Watch Australia Story's The Godfather of Coral on iview and YouTube.

356,Orchid hunting is growing in popularity but there are fears the flowers are being 'loved to death',environment,"  Orchid hunting is growing in popularity but there are fears the flowers are being 'loved to death' Orchid hunter Mark Wapstra has spent his whole life chasing and documenting Tasmanian native orchids. The environmental scientist grew up searching for orchids with his parents and twin brother, and has spent 30 years collating a guide to flowering times. ""I just remember spending weekends hanging out the back of a two-wheel drive on a four-wheel drive track, orchid hunting,"" he said. The mystery and intrigue of the delicate flowers draws amateur and expert ""orchid hunters"" alike, who are attracted to the beauty and chase of finding a species they've never seen before. ""They're becoming more popular but they've always been popular because they are just incredibly pretty,"" Mr Wapstra said. ""Spring is a real season of flowering orchids and when some of the really special ones come out,"" he said. But Mr Wapstra is concerned the orchid is becoming loved to death. A Facebook group with 3,500 members has boosted the orchid's popularity and the sharing of information, but increased popularity comes with a price. ""With social media we've learnt so much, we've even had new species recorded from the state from that Facebook group,"" Mr Wapstra said. ""It allows many, many more people to get interested which is fantastic, but we're over-visiting some sites."" He pointed to a site in the Tasmanian Midlands last orchid season where a single flower lives, making it one of the rarest plants in the world. ""By the end of the season it had been trodden on, so now it won't set seed,"" he said. He said another popular Midlands orchid site was also damaged. ""We'd all flattened the grass looking at the orchid and photographing it,"" he said. ""We don't want to get to the point where we have to cage things off."" Mr Wapstra said orchid thefts from public reserves and verges was also becoming a problem — with some people digging out plants and taking them home. ""Most, if not all of them, will not survive,"" he said. ""They don't survive being dug up and put in a pot on your windowsill. ""You'll get a day of joy out of it and then hopefully weeks and months of guilt about what you've done."" He said the orchids needed fungus and pollinators to survive and thrive. ""The only reason to collect is if you've got a scientific permit,"" he said. Mr Wapstra said the best way to collect orchids was with a camera. ""My only urge to people is to be incredibly careful where you tread,"" he said. ""Go by yourself instead of with 20 people, you will cause a lot less damage."" For sensitive sites he said people should reconsider giving away locations on social media and never enter private property without permission from the landowner. ""We can all probably just enjoy it by the photos, we don't all need to visit."" Like his parents, Mr Wapstra became obsessed with documenting orchids and goes to great lengths to find the flowers. ""You have an orchid eye, you have to go out there and be focussed on what you're doing. Eyes to the ground,"" he said. He doesn't think his work will ever be finished. ""We've only just finished describing a new species,"" he said. ""We have others that we know we need to deal with, whether they are a new species or whether they are part of a species complex that we don't understand."" There are about 220 species of wild orchids in Tasmania, and many are endemic to only a small part of the state or even a specific forest. Almost 80 are formally listed as threatened. ""The north-west is super special to us orchid freaks,"" he said. ""It's got so many species that we call endemic and they don't just occur in Tasmania. They are endemic to that region and they occur no where else in the world but there. ""They are in these windswept coastal heaths, the harshest country in that part of Tasmania and you can find an orchid flowering at any time."" Tasmania's orchids range in size from 1cm tall, such as small helmet orchids, to one metre tall, like sun orchids and potato orchids. ""You can go just about anywhere in the state from sea level to the tops of mountains and you will find orchids,"" Mr Wapstra said. ""You can go virtually any time of the year and you'll find something."" He said the Freycinet Peninsula on the east coast was an orchid hot spot, with 85 species. ""You'll see them right by the tracks,"" he said. ""You won't have to walk further than a few metres from where you're sitting — if there's bush you'll find them."" The Three Capes Track area in the south-east is also an orchid stronghold. Mr Wapstra said he was involved in the flora and fauna surveys for the track, and recorded about 20 species. ""Since then, one of the host rangers has found an additional dozen species just by living on the track,"" he said. ""A lot of them popped up right next to the track and we recorded 15 species growing in the gravel of the track."" Some orchids flower for only one or two days, making a sighting all the more special.

357,Publican's plan for Great Lake tourism track stirs sleepy central Tasmanian town,environment,"  Publican's plan for Great Lake tourism track stirs sleepy central Tasmanian town In the heart of Tasmania lies yingina, the traditional name for Great Lake, Australia's second-largest freshwater lake. There, you'll find Miena, a small-shack town where many Tasmanians go on weekends for fishing, hunting and some peace and quiet. But a plan to create a 107-kilometre walking and mountain bike trail around the lake has met a mixed response. The man behind the proposal is James Johns, who runs the Great Lake Hotel at Miena. ""It (would be) a five-day bushwalk or, basically, a two-day mountain bike ride,"" he said of the trail. ""An ecologically sound attraction will benefit the whole Central Highlands, not just Miena."" Mr Johns says a feasibility study has been done and he hopes the 18-month build can start this time next year. While some permanent residents like the idea, shack owners are worried it could change their experience of the area. James Johns hopes the trail can attract more people to the region, capitalising on the success of mountain bike and walking trails in other parts of the state, and benefiting the permanent residents that live at the lake year-round. Planning is in the early stages, but is likely to include camping options along the trail. ""People will be coming up and going through towns such as Deloraine, Longford, Cressy .. .they will all benefit,"" he said. Resident David Meacheam agreed, saying it would attract younger visitors and ""even out"" economic benefits for the region. ""I just think overall it's an ideal form of development,"" he said. Robyn Taylor, who lives at Great Lake and manages short-term accommodation, is also supportive of the trail, as long as the environment doesn't suffer. ""The trees are habitats for animals and birds, and a lot of owls are coming back to this area,"" she said. ""Parks and Wildlife need to be on the ball and keep control of the area in terms of rubbish and camping."" The trail would mostly occupy land managed by Hydro Tasmania. In a statement, Hydro Tasmania said it was generally supportive of the yingina/Great Lake Trail. A spokesperson said Mr John would have to submit an environmental impact statement, public consultation report, risk assessment report and other documentation for formal assessment and approval. The exact trail is yet to be decided on and would also need to take into account the Indigenous heritage of the area. Mr Johns said he was consulting traditional owners. ""They've asked us to move the trail on certain occasions, which we've done, to take all of those things into consideration,"" he said. Josh Shutton has been coming to Great Lake since he was born. ""You could say it's in my blood,"" he said. He and his partner, Jenna Chartrand, have a shack about 15 minutes from Miena. ""We extensively fish and do quite a bit of hunting as well,"" Mr Sutton said. ""We are just really wondering how this bike and walking track can co-exist with us. I'm really worried that the traditional uses of this area might be pushed out."" For many shack owners, the Great Lake is an escape from a busier lifestyle. Phone service is hard to come by. Mr Sutton said he was worried the area didn't have the infrastructure to accommodate a rise in visitors. ""We've had the roads done up but we're right at the point of popping,"" he said. ""If you start introducing another 100,000 people into the area, a lot of things will have to change.""

359,'Inaccurate and dehumanising': How the word 'wilderness' erases the experience of Indigenous people,environment," Science 'Wilderness' evokes untouched landscapes, but can erase Indigenous people. Is it time to stop using the term? What image does the word ""wilderness"" conjure in your mind? Maybe it's damp moss encircling a giant myrtle-beech in takayna/Tarkine, or dry red earth and rocky outcrops deep in the centre of the continent. Or it might conjure nothing at all. We don't all perceive wilderness the same way, and for Wardandi and Bibbulmun woman Chontarle Bellottie, it's a totally foreign concept. ""Wilderness is not in my language. It's not in the way that I communicate,"" she says. ""Because for me, my interpretation of [wilderness] is untouched, whereas we know as traditional owners that we've cultivated and gathered and hunted for so many thousands of years ... in a way where we've been able to live off the land in a very sustainable way."" While some people might not associate wilderness with a complete absence of people, many do, and that's a problem, according to Wiradjuri scientist Michael Fletcher. Dr Fletcher, a palaeoecologist and geographer at the University of Melbourne, started exploring the idea when investigating the formation of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area landscape. ""I found it was people who were responsible for its present form and its form over the past 40,000 years,"" Dr Fletcher says. His analysis of sediment layers suggest that the lush temperate rainforest that we see today was, until colonisation, eucalypt savannah and grassland actively managed by Aboriginal people. ""So the term wilderness is not only inaccurate, the notion that wilderness carries, which is the absence of people, is dehumanising really to Aboriginal people."" It's time to strike terms like ""wilderness"" from our lexicon, he adds. ""While they're just words, they're actually very powerful."" The prevalence of the wilderness concept means global conservation policy and public perception still often overlook how biodiverse landscapes have been shaped by Indigenous people, Dr Fletcher argues in a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week. ""Globally, many places that are called 'wilderness' are either current home to Indigenous people who actively manage the landscape, or are former landscapes which Indigenous people were the managers of, and are still trying to get recognition and agency back into their territories,"" he says. ""And they're being inhibited by this notion of wilderness, which underpins many conservation efforts."" Dr Fletcher says excluding Indigenous people from places, whether under the guise of wilderness protection or not, has degraded the health of those ecosystems — especially in Australia. But there is disagreement over use of the term ""wilderness"" in conservation science, and it comes down to how you define it, according to James Watson, a conservation biologist at the University of Queensland, who was not involved in the study. Although Dr Watson agrees with most of what the paper suggests about the need to include Indigenous people in conservation efforts, he says the idea that scientists still use the term wilderness to imply an absence of people was ""nonsense"". Scientists who map wilderness areas around the world, including Dr Watson, don't consider those places untouched by people, and acknowledge the contributions of Indigenous people in their research, he says. ""We have been trying to work out where those places in the world that have no industrial level footprint are."" However, he acknowledged that the term ""wilderness"" is problematic. ""We've got to come up with a better term because people assume different things when they hear it. ""But mapping and trying to protect these places with local communities is still critical when you think about climate change and biodiversity conservation."" Reconciling the fact Australia's diverse ecosystems are not necessarily ""pristine"" is something ecologist Dale Nimmo has been trying to do since finishing university. ""I remember sitting on a remote hilltop where I did my PhD and looking out across the landscape and thinking how vast and beautiful it was because it seemed untouched,"" he says. ""And that was the kind of mindset that I had at that time."" Ngarrindjeri elders are teaming up with scientists to relearn lost Indigenous knowledge and help save the critically endangered swamps of SA's Fleurieu Peninsula. But after working across Australia with different Indigenous communities, Dr Nimmo, who's now based at Charles Sturt University, realised his perception of those landscapes was warped. ""They're not the intact, amazing thing that I probably thought they were,"" he says. ""They're actually landscapes that have had species go extinct. ""And they're also missing one of the most vital components, which is the people that would have lived and been a part of that ecosystem for many thousands of years prior to European colonisation."" As well as working with Indigenous communities, Dr Nimmo now tries to ensure that the concept of people as land managers is deeply embedded within his research and teaching. ""People are part of nature, so they need to be part of the equation when you're thinking about how ecosystems work,"" he says. ""You're taught to focus on the plants and the animals, and there's never enough acknowledgement of the missing components of these landscapes that are cultural."" Acknowledging that Indigenous people are part of the landscape you're studying is hard to fit within the western science system, according to Dr Fletcher. ""Science is rooted in cultural bias and in the perspective you bring to it. ""And if that's the notion that landscapes are in their optimal condition with maximum biodiversity and zero human footprint, then that guides the kind of experiments you do and the inferences you make from the data."" Simply engaging with traditional owners about conservation science or projects on their land is not enough, Dr Fletcher adds. ""We need Indigenous people right through to structure and governance, helping and making decisions,"" he says. ""These landscapes don't become less valuable because they're not wilderness. ""They become more valuable because they're people's lands."" Ms Bellottie, who works as the Aboriginal engagement manager at Bush Heritage Australia, says Aboriginal partnerships with the organisation are led and run by the traditional owners of the land with guidance from people like her. ""My connection to where I'm from really helps me work with other Aboriginal groups, supporting them to achieve what they want for their country,"" she says. ""And I feel that I'm walking in the ancestors' footsteps by carrying on our responsibility to continue that caring for country, because we're born with that. ""We get to do it side by side with the Western science way, but also of using our traditional ecological knowledge, and both systems are so important for conservation actions."" The Australian wilderness movement was fundamentally responsible for saving the southwest of Tasmania in the Franklin Dam debate, which Dr Fletcher acknowledges. ""It was partly because of the photos of Peter Dombrovskis, which captured the imagination of people and invoked this idea of wilderness,"" he says. ""But also at the time in the '70s, who gave a toss what a black person was saying about their country? There was no real Aboriginal voice there that had any power. ""So it's a good thing that the wilderness movement was able to do what it did."" And that magical allure of something wild and unfamiliar is inherently attractive to people, according to Pakana Tralwulway man Andry Sculthorpe from the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre. ""The term wilderness generates a mystique that is more marketable to people wanting to get away from their lives and into an experience with nature,"" Mr Sculthorpe says. But, when it comes to the Tasmanian wilderness at least, he says the emphasis is on facilitating tourists. ""I think the reality is that wilderness is still considered a place where non-Aboriginal people can go and enjoy themselves. ""There's not adequate facilitation or recognition of the views of the Aboriginal community who would like to also be part of the management of those areas and also begin to reoccupy some of those areas. ""All the effort and resources go into facilitating white visitation, which is still excluding Aboriginal people by not providing mechanisms and resources where they can under their own objectives and community structures enjoy the World Heritage area as well."" Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. In the World Heritage Area there are also questions of whether the term ""wilderness"" can still be used given proposed tourism developments. But could removing the word ""wilderness"" put places at increased risk of damage by humans. ""I think we're clever enough as a society now to move beyond 'it's not wilderness, therefore we can trash it,'"" Dr Fletcher says. ""But at the moment, you're not valuing Aboriginal people, and you're not addressing the core issues of what's causing the degradation of these landscapes, and that's removal of people.

360,"It's about 20 million years old, and about to fall: The Victorian beach that's too dangerous to walk on",environment,"  People banned from walking on Anglesea beach as cliff shows signs of imminent collapse It's one of Anglesea's most iconic landscapes, but the reason for its beauty is why it's now off-limits. A 2-kilometre section of coastline in Anglesea called Demons Bluff was temporarily closed in March but the risk to human life of an inevitable landslip has led the Great Ocean Road Authority (GORA) to make the closure permanent. The cliff line at Demons Bluff has eroded over tens of millions of years, creating the sandy beach below and towering red cliff face. Beachgoers have been banned from 100 metres north of the Anglesea Family Caravan Park beach access ramp to 300m past the popular surf break Grinders Point. The decision was not an easy one to make, GORA director Paul Jane said. But after three years of watching a crack in the cliff grow from a hairline to a gaping hole, the risk was too great to keep the beach open. While he hoped the public would stay away, Mr Jane said the authority would introduce fines if people continued to access the beach. ""We certainly don't want to do that, we want to take an approach where we are informing the community, acknowledging the risk and making sure people stay away from the area for their own safety,"" he said. Within the past 12 months there have been some significant falls, he said, but an even bigger collapse was approaching. ""As it stands there's a crack that runs for about 60 metres long down the cliff, so if we have a failure anybody under that cliff may be in significant jeopardy,"" Mr Jane said. The crack was detected by 10 local citizen scientists who have been monitoring the cliff with drones for three years. David Kennedy is an associate professor of environmental programs at the University of Melbourne who led the citizen science project and said erosion was what made Demons Bluff so ""spectacular"". ""The rock itself is about 20 to 30 million years old and it's right on what we would call rock; it has enough strength to hold up a cliff face but it's not hard enough to build anything out of,"" he said. ""It's really a soft material and because of that it erodes quite quickly."" And that erosion is what has created the sandy beach below. The cliffs at Anglesea have enough strength to stand vertically, but once waves erode the base, it cannot hold up the upper ledge for long. But erosion on the cliffs does not happen centimetre by centimetre, Associate Professor Kennedy said. ""It's one big event."" Which is why the cliffs pose such a danger to people walking underneath. The citizen scientists have watched a crack about 10 centimetres wide grow to 70cm over the past few years, and that part of the cliff ""is about to go"", Dr Kennedy said. The chunk measures about 30 metres by five metres, and has a volume equivalent to two Olympic-sized swimming pools. ""Water is dripping into those cracks and the runoff goes right down to low tide,"" he said. ""I wouldn't want to walk there myself now. It will fall as a pile of rubble and that rubble will run out right down to low tide so if anyone is there when it goes they're either going to be buried or hit by a pile of rubble."" GORA's Paul Jane said other solutions were looked at before the decision was made to close the beach. Netting was considered, similar to the nets covering parts of the cliff along the Great Ocean Road. But Demons Bluff's soft, almost sand-like rock would just fall through the nets, Mr Jane said, so it was ruled out. The next idea was a ""mechanical failure"" — blasting the cliff to get the fall over and done with. But the soft rock of the cliffs extends all the way into the township so blasting it may have just pushed the erosion closer to roads and buildings. ""We got expert advice and found out we wouldn't know where that would stop, it would be a mechanical failure and failure and failure,"" Mr Jane said. The last option considered was to block the space beneath the cliff ""with some sort of structure"". ""But we didn't want to do that. The structure would have to be significant to keep people back and it certainly wouldn't add to the amenity of the beach."" Mr Jane said local feedback had been mostly positive and new signs would be erected on the beach to make the beach closure clear. ""People understand the risk and understand the measures are there to protect them."" While walking on the sand is banned, people can still kayak along the waters and surf, as long as they don't enter the water at Demons Bluff. With the citizen science project continuing, there could come a time when the beach is opened again, Mr Jane said. ""If the cliff does fail and the risk is averted they can open up the area again."" While climate change is not playing much of a part in erosion at the moment, Dr Kennedy said sea-level rise could increase the energy in the waves hitting the base of the cliffs, forging bigger cracks at the top. ""But what has the biggest effect is rainfall,"" he said. ""So in the next 10 to 20 years there won't be a big effect from climate change but as we get to the 50 to 70-year mark, there will be a sudden rise in the rates of erosion. ""As the tropics are warming our waters are intensifying. That energy reverberates up the cliffs with every wave that hits them."" And eventually, Anglesea's township will start eroding. But not in the near future. ""In a few hundred years, eventually, the cliff will go back,"" he said.

361,"While we focused on kangaroos and koalas, native bees were disappearing due to the Black Summer fires",environment," Science Australian native bees eligible for IUCN Red List of threatened species in the aftermath of Black Summer bushfires Australia's native bees are among the hidden casualties of the devastating Black Summer bushfires, according to a new study. A team of scientists from universities across Australia assessed the impact of the fires on 553 native bee species. They found at least 11 species of bees met International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria to be listed as threatened, they report today in the journal Global Change Biodiversity. The 2019–20 bushfires decimated about 24 million hectares of land, and killed or displaced an estimated 3 billion animals. ""When we hear about wildfires in Australia there's been a lot of attention on vertebrates ... like kangaroos and koalas,"" said study co-author Stefan Caddy-Retalic, an ecologist at the University of Adelaide and University of Sydney. ""But we really don't have much of an idea how bushfires affect some of the less-known species."" Dr Caddy-Retalic said the findings showed more needed to be done to conserve Australia's bees in the face of threats such as frequent fires and climate change. ""It would be fantastic to see governments at all levels across Australia step up in collecting data that allows us to better understand threats. ""We need to build that fence at the top of the cliff rather than trying to rescue species once they've fallen off."" Australia has around 1,650 species of native bees that we know of. While some bees build their nests in stems of grass, others live underground. Three species are currently recognised by the federal government as critically endangered. Endangered: Vulnerable: There has been some research into the impact of bushfires on a handful of other species such as the spectacular green carpenter bee (Xylocarpa aerata). But not much is known about Australia's other native bee species. To find out, a team led by bee expert James Dorey of Flinders University pored over publicly available data about all known species from the Atlas of Living Australia and museums. They then cross-referenced the information about the bees with a range of government data about habitats, history of fires and fire intensity. The team then narrowed the list down to species living in high fire intensity regions and that had traits that made them more vulnerable. They found at least nine species met the criteria for the IUCN Red List category for vulnerable and two met for the category of endangered. The most endangered species on this list lost between 55 and 59 per cent of their habitat in the fires. But the list put forward to the IUCN does not include the green carpenter bee. This bee is listed by state governments as endangered in South Australia, where an estimated 95 per cent of its last remaining habitat on Kangaroo Island was lost during the fires, and extinct in Victoria. The analysis suggested it was less affected in New South Wales, but the researchers said more specific studies of local populations were needed. Dr Caddy-Retalic said the study showed the power of using publicly available data to assess the threat to different species. ""Sometimes scientists feel like we're paralysed by not having the data we need to be able to answer some of the big questions. ""But this shows in many cases we do have enough data to provide some assessment."" Tobias Smith, a native bee expert at the University of Queensland not involved in the research, said the study was an amazing use of existing data, but the findings were ""unfortunately unsurprising"". Fire is only one threat that bees face, along with climate change, invasive species and destruction of habitat. ""We know very little about Australian bees, but we know about the processes that can potentially affect them, and this confirms some of the things that we thought were going on,"" Dr Smith said. How many insects live in Australia? And even more importantly, how many have already been lost? Scientists are turning to technology to try to find out. He said trends seen in the study were probably even much more widespread. ""When they assessed all the known bee species in Australia ... only 30 per cent of those had enough data for them to do their analysis,"" Dr Smith said. ""That means 70 per cent of Australia's known bees don't have enough data to even do this broad level of analysis. ""So what's going on with those bees?"" And this is just the number of species we know about, he added. There are possibly up to 2,500 species in Australia. ""There's potentially another 30 per cent of bees we haven't discovered and given names to. ""If we know this little about these charismatic bees, imagine all those other insect groups that don't get as much attention as bees do."" A decision about the listing of the bees by the IUCN is expected by the end of the year. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

362,First kingfish in the water at controversial fish farm,environment,"  First kingfish in the water at farm neighbouring Whyalla's cuttlefish aggregation site Kingfish are being stocked at a new fish farm in South Australia's Spencer Gulf which has promised economic benefits but also stoked fears of environmental damage. The development by Clean Seas Seafood in Fitzgerald Bay, near Whyalla, will hold more than 4,000 tonnes of kingfish. ""Actually having fish in the water there is truly exciting, and I think a great endorsement and representation of our confidence in the species,"" Clean Seas chief executive Rob Gratton said. The fish farm has been controversial in Whyalla, and a petition against letting Clean Seas use the nearest marina drew 600 signatures. Locals have expressed a number of concerns about the project, ranging from the potential for escaped kingfish to become predators, to the volume of nitrogen discharged into the slow-flushing Upper Spencer Gulf. The Conservation Council of SA said it was paying particularly close attention to the project because of the annual aggregation of Giant Australian Cuttlefish off nearby Stony Point, a spectacular event drawing tourists from across Australia. ""The Conservation Council remains very nervous about what the impact will be of such a high level of stocking in Fitzgerald Bay,"" chief executive Craig Wilkins said. ""It's an area of low flushing, it's an area that has traditionally had low nitrogen levels, and we know that fish farms do increase nitrogen levels in the water and that does impact on the marine environment. ""So we want all sides, the company and the government, to watch this incredibly closely, and if there's any decrease in marine health then they intervene quickly."" Clean Seas has frequently addressed the concerns by saying the development was cleared by several government agencies and would be closely monitored by environmental authorities. It is not the first time the company has farmed kingfish in Fitzgerald Bay but says its practices have improved since the last attempt a decade ago. Mr Gratton said the Fitzgerald Bay development would enable the company to eventually triple its kingfish output. ""Those fish will be in the water for about 13 to 15 months for retail channels,"" he said. ""So we harvest those at about three and a half kilograms for retail channels, and then we grow them an extra 12 months for restaurant channels, so the restaurants want a larger fish, a higher-yielding fish and a more flexible fish."" Mr Gratton said Clean Seas had diversified its business beyond luxury restaurants since COVID-19 caused business to drop about 80 per cent last year. ""Prior to the pandemic, most of our business was into the high end restaurants all around the world,"" he said. ""The diversification started quickly, and within a couple of months we made some large shipments and the financial results that we reported at year end, we were actually trading up 17 per cent on pre-pandemic levels for that year."" He said the company was now trading 80 per cent better than it was before the pandemic. ""The turnaround has been substantial, the volumes are really exceptional and we're delighted with how well the fish is performing in all of these new channels and markets.""

363,analysis: Solar investors are feeling cheated. But battery subsidies could solve the problem,environment," Science Many rooftop solar investors are feeling ripped off. Could battery subsidies solve the problem? Australia's household solar uptake is the envy of the world, and one of the few areas of emissions reduction where Australia can claim to be ahead of the pack. Driven initially by generous subsidies and feed-in tariffs, our solar uptake has been so successful that it has left our electricity network scrambling to catch up. While it might seem like the best kind of problem to have, the fundamental reason for moving our system to renewables is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and minimise catastrophic climate change. But some solar owners are being told they can't export power to the grid or are being hit with solar export limits due to fears the network can't cope, meaning their excess clean energy is essentially being wasted. And now, with feed-in tariffs steadily declining, solar investors like Maciek from Brisbane are feeling cheated. After researching the market, Maciek says he found Powershop and Diamond Energy had some of Australia's best green energy credentials. ""I didn't like that AGL invest in a lot of fossil fuels, so I went with Powershop. After a while they dropped their feed-in credit, so I swapped to Diamond Energy. A few months [later] their feed-in credit dropped too. ""Now they are talking about charging people for having solar and providing energy. What the f***?"" There are many people with a range of energy providers with similar stories to Maciek. So is it time for governments to step in with greater subsidies for batteries, and how might this help people like Maciek to get more value from their solar panels, while also helping stabilise the grid? There have recently been a couple of changes that may have solar owners worried. The first has been a fairly consistent trend of reductions in solar feed-in tariffs. Australians with rooftop solar are growing increasingly frustrated as energy retailers slash financial incentives. Some households are hitting back by installing batteries, potentially killing the retailer's own market. In the late 2000s, solar owners were being paid as much as 60 cents per kilowatt hour for the energy they were feeding into the grid. Today, it's usually less than 10 cents. A recent letter to a Queensland solar owner from Energy Australia explained a cut to their feed-in tariffs from 8.5 cents to 6.6 cents per kWh thusly: ""As many households now have rooftop solar, there's more solar-generated energy going back into the grid. This has reduced the wholesale price of energy going back into the grid during the day when the sun is out."" The second change has been what Lachlan Blackhall from the ANU's Battery Storage and Grid Integration program describes as a fairly seismic shift. It's controversially been dubbed things like the ""sun tax"", and involves solar owners being charged a fee for feeding energy into the grid. Our electricity network was set up around a coal-fired power plant model, where energy was generated centrally and exported in one direction to consumers. Under that system, network fees could only be charged to consumers (houses), but not electricity generators. But now, with rooftop solar generation, we have a dynamic system with electricity flowing in both directions — which the grid wasn't designed for. So the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) proposed a change to the rules to allow energy exporters (houses with solar) to be charged a network fee to help pay for upgrades to the network. Part of their argument is that all electricity users shouldn't be charged to upgrade the grid infrastructure if it's only solar owners who are financially benefiting. On the other hand, some solar owners have argued that it's not fair that they are charged to export energy when they're competing in a market with big energy generators that won't be charged. Charging solar owners might also seem counterintuitive when we're trying to encourage more renewable energy uptake. The problem for solar owners is they're now feeding power into the grid at the same time as every other solar owner, and therefore their product isn't very valuable. Which is where batteries can play a role. By storing energy when the sun is shining, solar owners can then use that stored energy during peak periods when they would otherwise be paying a premium. In doing so, they are also reducing the demand on the grid during peak times. The upshot of this could be greater grid stability and fewer blackouts during days where people are blasting their air conditioners, for instance. And as a spokesperson for the Clean Energy Council pointed out, the biggest savings that solar investors receive are from retail electricity prices. ""Retail prices for electricity from the grid are typically three or four times more than the price paid for electricity exported to the grid."" But batteries are expensive. A 13kWh battery (the average Australian household uses around 18kWh per day) can cost $12,000 or more. States and territories like South Australia, Victoria and the NT already offer a few thousand dollars in subsidies for home batteries, and some New South Wales regions are eligible for interest-free loans. But that still leaves a cost of as much as $10,000 for a 13kWh battery, and take-up has been fairly slow. Increasing state or federal subsidies or incentives could help reduce this cost and drive further investment. While not a perfect solution, in part due to price gouging by manufacturers and installers, solar has shown that subsidies do work. But this is not to say that other incentives and models shouldn't be used in conjunction with subsidies to help drive battery uptake. The second option is increasing subsidies on electric vehicles. The technology now exists for electricity to run from an EV to a household and vice-versa, meaning EVs are essentially a battery on wheels. And not a small battery either. An average EV can store enough charge to run an average Australian household for two to three days between charges. Called V2G or vehicle-to-grid, it's an option already available to EV owners in places like the UK, and is being trialled in the ACT. Owners of electric vehicles may soon be able to get paid for simply plugging their car into the wall. But there are a few things to consider first. Ford claims its latest F-150 ""Lightning"" ute released in the US can power a home for three days with its vehicle-to-home technology. Although the first V2G charger has been approved for use in Australia, it's likely a few years off being rolled out wholesale here. But sustainable transport policy expert Jake Whitehead from the University of Queensland says EVs can be used right now to ""soak up"" the excess solar being generated on our rooftops, simultaneously creating energy demand and increasing value for solar exporters. ""You've got to increase your demand. What's the perfect other emerging technology right now to increase your demand? Electric vehicles,"" Dr Whitehead says. Basically, by increasing Australia's fleet of EVs and by introducing incentives to charge them during the daytime, we can further utilise peak solar generation periods. Unlike our rooftop solar uptake, Australia's embrace of EVs is not the envy of the world. In fact, Australia has one of the lowest rates of electric car ownership in the OECD, with just 0.78 per cent of new car sales being electric in 2020. However, Victoria has announced an electric vehicle target of 50 per cent of new car sales by 2030, and with the federal government seemingly edging toward some sort of net-zero emissions target commitment, Australia is going to have to get on board the EV wagon in a hurry. A number of Australian states have begun offering reduced stamp duty and cash rebates on electric vehicles this year. But at over $40,000 for the cheapest EV on the market, it's still out of reach for many car buyers. While subsidising home batteries and EVs is one part of solution, these subsidies disproportionately favour middle- and high-income earners. A third option that can be more equitable is the community battery. Community batteries are essentially medium-sized batteries that can be used to supply backup power to around 100 homes. There are a number of trials taking place with community batteries across Australia, and there's not likely to be a one-size-fits-all model of how they might operate. But, in general, it would mean that solar owners could feed in their excess power to community batteries during the day, and draw from them during peak periods. It would also mean that people without solar, such as renters, could also reap the benefits, and no individual has to shoulder the high cost that comes with household battery installation. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. ""Making sure we focus on all customers, including those who can't afford these assets, is a really important focus going forward,"" Professor Blackhall says. ""We need rapid decarbonisation and Australia can really contribute to that in our electricity system."" The solar boom in Australia is a rare good news story in our efforts to get greenhouse gas emissions down. But solar owners who have spent a lot of money can rightly be feeling frustrated as they see the diminishing returns on their investment. Especially because it was an entirely foreseeable consequence of increasing supply, which can be curtailed with greater investment in storage. As climate change forecasts become increasingly dire, it seems mad that we would squander the progress we've made on clean energy. And as solar has already shown, with the right incentives in place, the public is usually willing to jump on board. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

364,"The creation of a carbon price will happen either by us or to us, analysts warn",environment,"  Advocates urge further climate action in Australia ahead of Glasgow COP26 conference Australia's carbon reduction efforts are receiving global scrutiny — and in a grassy paddock on the Mornington Peninsula, outside Melbourne, the impact is being felt right now. Allison Hawke, director of development at renewable energy company Maoneng, gestures to where a $170 million battery will be built in the coming year to meet the needs of 40,000 households. ""The battery is intended to charge itself during the daytime, when there's rooftop solar and other forms of generation creating an excess of power in the grid, and then discharge it during that dinnertime peak period,"" she said. Ms Hawke would like to see hundreds of similar batteries across the nation but says Australia's targets for reducing carbon emissions are too weak to provide businesses with enough incentive to invest. ""The policy vacuum is slowing down the rate of transition,"" she says. ""Greater policy certainty would help increase the rate of the investment in the industry, in what will be a very big industry with all kinds of businesses involved."" Referencing the world's greatest sprinter, she adds that Australia's energy market — and its high carbon emissions — will have to change. ""We're sort of plodding along, we're really just sort of picking ourselves up and getting moving,"" she says. ""We really need to be going at more of an Usain Bolt pace."" She says because Australia has been slow to shift, other nations are gaining the advantages of investment in green technology: jobs and a better environment. It's a month until world leaders meet in Glasgow to discuss how to prevent runaway climate change from irrevocably altering the globe. Ahead of COP26, the United Nations' 26th climate change conference, the leaders of some of the largest countries on Earth have been lifting their commitments to reduce carbon emissions. ""This year has also brought widespread death and devastation from the borderless climate crisis,"" US President Joe Biden has told the United Nations general assembly. ""The extreme weather events that we have seen in every part of the world — and you all know it and feel it — represent what the secretary-general has rightly called 'code red for humanity'."" ""The scientists and experts are telling us that we're fast approaching a point of no return, in the literal sense,"" Mr Biden continued. ""To keep within our reach the vital goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, every nation needs to bring their highest-possible ambitions to the table when we meet in Glasgow for COP26 and then to have to keep raising our collective ambition over time."" Australia has endured more than a decade of toxic politics centred around putting a price on carbon pollution, arguably costing the careers of four prime ministers. We are turning up to COP26 promising far less action than similarly developed countries. ""We're faffing about here in Australia,"" Carbon Market Institute chief executive John Connor tells The Business. ""We need to recognise we've got carbon prices, we've got carbon markets. Let's put the political posturing aside, evolve and reform those markets."" ""Global capital is going to move away if we become a clunky and polluting economy that isn't facing up to the risks or the opportunities."" Investors are already making decisions based on climate action or inaction. Earlier this year, the Reserve Bank governor told farmers the conglomerates that were buying their products were already asking what they were doing to reduce emissions and offset the carbon. ""I participate in many international meetings, often kind of late at night time, and a very frequent question that comes up in those meetings is what is Australian business doing to decarbonise,"" Philip Lowe has told the Australian Farm Institute Conference in Toowoomba. ""You're relying on overseas markets and increasingly overseas investors are asking about the carbon content of production — and that's a trend that's only going to continue."" Australian exporters are set to be hit with a carbon border tax, with Europe the first domino to fall. Analysis from the Australian Industry Group says producers who don't clean up will be hit hardest. The federal government is already changing its tune, setting up targets closer to what its international allies are asking for and trying to prevent investors from withdrawing from Australia. ""We cannot run the risk that markets falsely assume that we are not transitioning in line with the rest of the world,"" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said last week. ""Were we to find ourselves in that position, it would increase the cost of capital and reduce its availability."" Mr Connor, from the Carbon Market Institute, says the creation of a carbon price — a concept that has bedevilled both major parties for more than a decade — will happen either by us or to us. ""We're effectively getting carbon prices through capital strikes (investors withdrawing) or higher financing costs,"" he says. Additionally, countries are beginning to put ""tolls"" on exporters that aren't paying to deal with carbon-intensive products like steel and aluminium. The most pressing is the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). ""Europe is looking to implement them, but also importantly we're seeing Japan, Korea, and other countries looking at that,"" Mr Connor says. ""So that's another way in which we're going to have carbon pricing imposed upon us if we don't make the reforms here at home that suit the Australian economy the best."" Projects like the Mornington Peninsula battery show the great potential for Australia. But there are huge difficulties too. We're the world's second largest exporter of thermal coal, which is used for making energy, and we're the largest exporter of gas. Both create substantial emissions. On a US visit, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said our role supplying fossil fuels to Asia for energy would eventually end. ""We have always been the primary exporter of energy into this region. Now that is going to change,"" he told The Australian newspaper. ""And we need to make sure we leap from one lily pad to the next in making that change."" But the federal government hasn't signed up to the target of net zero — achieving balance between the amount of carbon emissions produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere — by far-off 2050, much less targets for 2030 being pushed by business and advocacy groups. The former head of the Australian Coal Association, Ian Dunlop, says it's not submarines, China or COVID-19 that will dominate our lives in the next 20 years, but rather climate change. ""Emission levels globally have to drop extremely quickly, and at the moment they're going up at worst-case levels,"" he says. ""If we don't start to address climate change, the entire global financial system is under threat, threat of collapse."" The co-author of a report about the risk climate brings to banking, Degrees Of Risk: Can the banking system survive climate warming of 3˚C?, Mr Dunlop stresses the urgency of acting now.

365,"Young great white shark washes up on SA beach, providing 'rare opportunity' for scientists",environment,"  Young great white shark washes up on Fowlers Bay beach, providing 'rare opportunity' for scientists As the largest predatory fish in the ocean, it is rare to see a great white shark washed up on Australian shores. But last month, members of the community noticed a great white shark on the beach near Fowlers Bay, on South Australia's far west coast. The shark was about 2.5 metres long and experts believe it was about one year old when it died. National Parks and Wildlife Service South Australia marine coordinator Dirk Holman said with help from Fisheries SA, members of his team were able to retrieve the shark the following day. ""For a young one that looks healthy to wash up on a beach intact is really rare,"" he said. ""It's really unusual; normally if an animal, like a marine mammal, washes up it's because it's either sick or injured."" Mr Holman said the shark might have become stuck on the beach during a low tide. ""They are pretty sparse, there's not a big south-west population of sharks and they are spread and wide,"" he said. ""Potentially, he was patrolling the beach looking for salmon and might have got himself a bit high and dry."" The shark — which could have grown up to 6 metres long — was found with significant red staining around its mouth. Mr Holman said the discolouration could have been caused by a number of factors. ""It could have been a little bit of trauma from the sand if it was thrashing around on the sand as it died. It could have been a little bit of exposure to the sun,"" he said. ""Or it could be just part of the natural process of death, of the animal passing away and blood flow remaining near the skin surface and not circulating."" The discovery and quick retrieval meant the shark could be put in a freezer to preserve it for scientists at the CSIRO to carry out sampling and DNA retrieval. ""They will look at the stomach contents, they will look at the heart, and they will look at the DNA, which will provide valuable information for the CSIRO's population analysis,"" Mr Holman said. ""We are really grateful to the community members for reporting it to us as quickly as they did.""

367,'We're all going to turn to dust': Body composting a 'green' alternative to burial and cremation,environment,"  Body composting a 'green' alternative to burial and cremation In a suburban warehouse tucked between an auto repair shop and a computer recycling business in Denver, Colorado, Seth Viddal is dealing with life and death. He and one of his employees have built a ""vessel"" they hope will usher in a more environmentally friendly era of mortuary science. ""It's a natural process where the body is returned to an elemental level over a short period of time,"" Mr Viddal said, likening the practice to backyard composting of food scraps. Known as body composting, the process reduces human remains through a natural organic reduction process. ""This is the same process but done with a human body inside of a vessel and, in our case, in a controlled environment,"" Mr Viddal said. On September 7, Colorado became the second US state after Washington to allow human body composting. Oregon, further south, will allow the practice from July 2022. AJ Killeen, 40, is one of the people who have expressed an interest in having their body composted when they die. ""We're all going to turn to dust, basically. So this is just a little more natural,"" he said. ""They're going to control the humidity. They're going to control the soil amendments, and hopefully some worms and some mushrooms find a good home in me for a few months."" Mr Killeen said his concern for the environment played a large role in him considering the option. Flame cremation burns fossil fuels that can contribute to climate change, and the process also releases toxic, mercury-laden fumes into the atmosphere. Traditional burial takes up space in a cemetery that will use additional resources to keep the plot constantly watered and mowed. ""I always joke that I hope I expire on trash day if that's just easier for my family,"" said Mr Killeen, who composts food scraps and yard waste through the city's collection program. Mr Killeen is among a growing number of people considering more natural funeral options and he thinks the option will become more accepted once people get over ""the ick factor"". In Washington, the three businesses licensed to compost human remains have transformed at least 85 bodies since the law took effect in May last year, and more than 900 other people have signed up for the service as natural funerals have become more popular. Mr Viddal started building a prototype vessel in an industrial area soon after the bipartisan bill was signed into law. The insulated wooden box is about two metres in length, 90 centimetres wide and deep, lined with waterproof roofing material and packed with wood chips and straw. Two large spool wheels on either end allow it to be rolled across the floor, providing the oxygenation, agitation and absorption required for a body to compost. Mr Viddal calls the process an ""exciting ecological option"". And in death, he also sees life. ""Composting itself is a very living function and it's performed by living organisms,"" he said. ""There are billions of microbial, living things in our digestive tracts and just contained in our body, so when our one life ceases, the life of those microbes does not cease."" After about three months, the vessel is opened and the ""soil"" is filtered for medical devices like prosthetics, pacemakers or joint replacements. The remaining large bones are then pulverized and returned to the vessel for another three months of composting. Teeth are removed to prevent contamination from mercury in fillings. The vessel must reach 55 degrees Celsius for 72 continuous hours to kill any bacteria and pathogens. The high temperature occurs naturally during the breakdown of the body in an enclosed box. In six months, the body, wood chips and straw will transform into enough soil to fill the bed of a pickup truck. Family members can keep the soil to spread in their yards, but Colorado law forbids selling it and using it commercially to grow food for human consumption. It also only allows licensed funeral homes and crematories to compost human bodies. ""It accomplishes the conversion of the body back into a very beneficial substance — soil, earth,"" said Mr Viddal, who envisions building more than 50 body-composting vessels. Mr Viddal's company, The Natural Funeral, charges $US7,900 ($10,880) for body composting, compared with $US2,200 for flame cremation, and he notes that a traditional burial and service in the area can run upwards of $US10,000. The company has not yet composted any bodies, but several people have signed up and paid for the service. The Colorado Catholic Conference, a group of bishops aimed at moulding public policy, opposed the bill, saying body composting ""does not promote human dignity"". Some rabbis also are against body composting because they say it violates Jewish religious law, while other opponents fear there is inadequate research into the potential for it to contaminate food sources. Micah Truman, CEO and founder of Return Home south of Seattle, runs a 1,068 square metre facility that includes 74 vessels. So far, his company has composted 16 bodies in what he describes as an ""extremely precise scientific operation"" that takes only 60 days. Mr Truman said because the composting option was so new, ""it's really a matter of changing hearts and minds right now"".

368,Australian Antarctic division's new chief scientist Nicole Webster ready to plunge into the role,environment,"  Nicole Webster to head up Australian Antarctic Division as chief scientist Scuba diving around a dead coral reef off Queensland was the motivation the Australian Antarctic Division's newest chief scientist needed to move south, in a bid to better understand the impact climate change has on marine environments. Marine scientist Nicole Webster thought she had the wrong GPS coordinates when she went diving on the Great Barrier Reef to inspect a study site she'd visited many times before. ""It was actually just a field of coral rubble, Professor Webster said. After rechecking her location, she realised she was in the right spot but the reef was dead. ""Despite our very next dive only 500 metres away actually being on a relatively healthy coral reef, it still had that very visceral effect on me,"" she said. ""It just consolidated my thinking … this growing sense of urgency to use my skills to lead impactful science that can actually help us understand the challenges that we're facing under climate change."" After more than 20 years in coral reef science, the experience prompted her to apply for a role with the Australian Antarctic Division. She got the job. ""I know whenever I talk about the need to make a bigger difference it sounds really kitsch,"" she said. But making a bigger difference is exactly what she is hoping to do once she takes up the post at the division. Her boss, director Kim Ellis, is confident she can. ""She's looking at our science to see, are we delivering the right science? Are we delivering it in the right way? And are we communicating that science well back to the general public but particularly to the government?"" he said. Professor Webster said one of the big challenges in Antarctic science is the vulnerability of collapsing ice shelves due to warming oceans and atmosphere. ""Being able to do the science that can reliably estimate what sort of sea-level rise we're going to experience by 2100 actually enables us to be able to put in place adaptation measures as humans to be able to deal with rising sea levels attributed to climate change,"" she said. While Professor Webster has spent most of her career diving in tropical waters, she has experienced the icy depths of Antarctica. Her research on the impacts humans are having on microbes and sea sponges near Antarctic stations plunged her into minus-30-degree Celsius waters. ""When you get down to Antarctica you have to essentially drill a 3-metre hole through the ice,"" she said. ""We had to use a snow groomer to shovel almost a football-field-size area of snow off to let sufficient light through the ice hole. ""You're essentially immersing yourself in an ice slurry to get down through this 3-metre ice hole."" She said the sea life in Antarctic waters is comparable to a tropical coral reef. ""You've got light filtering through that just illuminates the most spectacularly coloured and intricate life forms,"" Professor Webster said. ""There's sponge gardens and sea spiders and echinoderms and fish."" But moving into the role of chief scientist will inevitably lead to less time in the water and more time at a desk. Professor Webster is the second woman to hold the position at the Australian Antarctic Division. It's hoped her appointment help drive greater gender equity within the organisation 'In our science areas … there is good diversity, we just don't have women in the leadership roles,"" said Mr Ellis. ""I am extremely passionate about equity and diversity in general and I've spent a lifetime of trying to assist women in science by mentoring an incredibly talented group of early career researchers,"" said Professor Webster. With a big job ahead, Professor Webster admits she never planned to be a scientist. Growing up she dreamt of becoming an author. But taking biology in her final year of school changed her mind and gave her glimpse of an underwater world she remains passionate about. After more than two decades in the tropics, she feels well-prepared for heading up Antarctic science. ""They're two of the fastest-changing environments under climate change,"" she said. ""They're opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of latitude, but really they're both experiencing dramatic impacts from ocean warming and from climate change in general.""

369,"A 'definitive' list of all the TV, podcasts and memes that are getting us through lockdown",environment,"  What to watch and listen to through lockdown after lockdown, according to pop culture experts Are you doom-scrolling? Are you OK? Are you over it? If your answers to those questions are yes, no, yes — Stop Everything! we're here to help. Nearly two years into a global pandemic — rolling lockdowns, remote learning, working from home, limited exercise and very little in-person contact with friends and loved ones — we're all feeling the pain. Maybe some days it feels like your main source of excitement is scanning for exposure sites in your local area. We're in the same position. So in solidarity, and with the novelty of homemade sourdough long since past, we (Stop Everything! presenters Beverley Wang and Benjamin Law who are riding out lockdowns in Melbourne and Sydney respectively) are sharing a few things from our audio, social and screen feeds that have helped keep us alive in 2021. For more pop culture coverage. Back to Nature Living in the middle of a big city during lockdown means access to nature is limited. Your options: local park where gym junkies furiously grunt through modified exercises on benches; playgrounds with screaming children; and dog parks absolutely strewn with animal faeces. Not relaxing! So Back to Nature (ABC TV and iview) – which sees novelist Holly Ringland (The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart) and actor Aaron Pedersen (Mystery Road) trek through Australia's vast landscapes – is an absolute balm. Think the sweet spot between ASMR (their hushed narration feels like a soft weighted blanket in winter) and slow TV, through all the places Australians can't visit right now – from Springbrook National Park on Yugambeh Country to down to North East Tasmania and tebrakunna country. BL Nature Track This long-form audio spinoff of RN's Off Track delivers on its name. These are beautifully mixed narration-free field recordings captured by Off Track presenter Ann Jones on her travels around Australia. Each hour-plus long episode provides a soothing alternative to generic white noise audio tracks for work or bedtime. You may even want to play it while soaking in a hot bath! There are time-stamped listening notes for each episode, so you can follow along and identify the birdsong and other sounds of nature recorded on location, from heavy rain in Wiluna, a town on the traditional lands of the Martu people in Western Australia, to lyrebirds in Gippsland on Gunaikurnai land in Victoria. However you choose to listen, you'll feel like you've rinsed out your ears with the lush sounds of nature. BW Nothing Much Happens This podcast specialises in calm, cozy, and dare I say, purposefully forgettable stories designed to lull you to sleep. ""Nothing much happens, you feel good and you fall asleep,"" is the tagline per creator Kathryn Nicolai, who writes and narrates all the stories set in the fictional village of Nothing Much. The focus of each story is deeply mundane, yet comforting: shovelling snow and drinking hot chocolate; adopting a puppy; the morning routine of the village baker, and so on. Nicolai reads each story twice, the second time very slowly. The result feels like a blend of mindfulness meditation and ASMR, all while drifting off to sleep. Nicolai is also a yoga and meditation teacher, and often begins episodes with a brief affirmation. My favourite is, ""You have done enough for today,"" because yes dammit, I have! BW Escape to the Country When I want to watch television without actually watching television, Escape to the Country (Binge) is my thing. Featuring tranquil scenery, period homes galore and the quietly quirky idiosyncrasies of its British house hunters, Escape to the Country verges on ethnography for people like me, who have extremely minimal knowledge of the British countryside and the ways of its people. It's mild and pleasantly formulaic, and unlike its ABC spinoff, operates at such a remove that it allows you to indulge in the universal pastime of being a property stickybeak without engaging in the stressful reality of the overheated Australian property market. BW Chopsticks or Fork? This ridiculously cleverly-titled ABC TV series sees comedian, journalist and pun-menace Jennifer Wong explore why every Australian regional town has an excellent Chinese restaurant, as she interviews the people behind each joint. Stories of being the only Chinese kids in a very white town, and one regional Chinese restaurant that survived catastrophic bushfires, hit especially hard. Culinary secrets to Australian Cantonese classics (think: honey chicken; sweet and sour pork; deep-fried ice cream) are on the table, but really, every episode will leave you calling your local Chinese takeaway instead. For this son of migrant restaurateurs, it also felt like a love letter to my family and childhood. Yes, I may have cried. BL Youn's Kitchen 2 I love Korean food, cooking shows and charming, beautiful people, so I love Youn's Kitchen (Viki). This slow reality TV show, set in the picturesque Canary Islands town of Garachico, follows a group of Korean TV and film stars tasked with running a pop-up restaurant. This isn't a competitive elimination show, there is no prize at the end. It's simply four surprisingly down-to-earth celebrities with exemplary work ethics busting their butts while Tenerife locals and tourists express wholesome wonder and appreciation of traditional Korean flavours. The 'Youn' of Youn's Kitchen is Youn Yuh-jung, who made history earlier this year with her Academy Award win for Minari. Despite telling me in an interview ""I'm a working woman, I don't cook,"" Youn spends most of the series in the restaurant's small kitchen, heroically turning out plate after plate of japchae, kalbi, kimchi pancakes and fried chicken. Those with an eye for male beauty will also appreciate cast member Park Seo Joon (Itaewon Class; Parasite), who radiates an inner luminescence reminiscent of a young and dewy Keanu Reeves. BW Nailed It The Emmy-nominated baking competition show Nailed It (Netflix) is brilliant family viewing, especially with young children. Host Nicole Byer and head judge Jacques Torres have a deeply endearing on-screen chemistry, and the amateur bakers' cake fails are second to none. BW Jessica and Oscar's steamy red carpet moment If you're looking for something to remind you that blood still circulates in your veins, this short video of Scenes from a Marriage co-stars Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain posing for photographers on the red carpet at the Venice Film Festival will do the job. BW Kingdom If you're a sociopath – like me – you might have counter-intuitively found that reading and watching stories about other pandemics is strangely engaging (""Hey, it could be worse!""). If that's you, and you've already read the great pandemic novels like Leave the World Behind, World War Z and Station Eleven, then watch the South Korean zombie thriller series Kingdom (Netflix). Think: Game of Thrones' production values, mixed with Korean history…and add zombies. It sounds mindless, but the final result – based on a hit graphic novel – is masterful, tense and very watchable. BL Beauty and the Geek For a reality competition show working a binary gimmick, the latest season of the Channel 9 show, hosted by Sophie Monk, serves up a surprisingly wholesome and transformational experience. I literally did laugh and cry watching the teams of Beauties and Geeks compete in challenges and form unlikely, endearing bonds of friendship. Unlike earlier versions of the show, the Geeks' lack of romantic and sexual experience never becomes the punch line. Overall, more friendships than romantic sparks are kindled over the course of the series. It's a welcome counterpoint to the toxic heterosexuality mined in shows like Married at First Sight. BW Hacks It's rare any TV show gets the much-coveted 100% fresh rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. But this HBO comedy (available on Stan) is an irresistible, smart and cracking show, the centrepiece of which is Jean Smart's Emmy-winning performance. On the surface, it's two comedians – one zoomer; one boomer – forced to work with each other. But beyond that, there's depth in what this show has to say about ageism and sexism in the comedy industry. Two more bonuses: its effortless, non-laboured queer representation; and a great side role for Meg Stalter, the actor, comedian and TikTok star who's left everyone saying, ""Hi, gay!""

370,Giant wall of lava spreads across La Palma in the Spanish Canary Islands,environment,"  Thousands of residents of La Palma in the Spanish Canary Islands flee giant wall of lava Residents of a small village in the Canary Islands are fleeing a wall of lava up to 12 metres high, which is flattening all in its path as it spreads. The lava, still spewing from Sunday's eruption in the Canary Islands archipelago off northwest Africa, is advancing slowly down hillsides of La Palma to the coast, where Todoque is the last village between it and the Atlantic Ocean. Experts said the lava could either take several days to cover the remaining 2 kilometres to the sea or it could instead spread more widely on land, burying additional residential areas and farmland. Residents hoping to save some belongings queued up so they could be escorted briefly into the village. Javier López said the house he had lived in for the past three decades appeared to be in the lava's path. He and his relatives had been staying at a friend's house with the few documents, photos and basic belongings they had grabbed as they were evacuated on Monday. ""I've put my whole life in a van,"" Mr López said. ""This is probably going to be the last time I see my home."" ""Or, in the best-case scenario, the house will remain isolated by the lava and inaccessible for who knows how long."" Fire crews worked non-stop to try to open a trench to divert the lava flow from as many houses as possible. ""It's hard to think straight about what you want to save, but we are only allowed in for one hour and you don't want to take longer because that would be taking time away from others,"" said Melisa Rodríguez, another Todoque resident. The eruption was following an ""expected pattern"" but there were still many uncertainties, said Vicente Soler, a volcanologist with Spain's top scientific body, CSIC. ""It is difficult to say if the lava will reach the sea,"" he told the BTC broadcaster. ""If the source remains active and with a steady flow, it will be easy for it to arrive at the ocean. But if there are new lava diversions, that will slow down the flow's head."" Authorities and locals took no chances. As the lava headed toward the island's more densely populated coast, 1,000 people were evacuated from Todoque, bringing the total number of evacuated on the island of La Palma to more than 6,800. Prompt evacuations have helped avoid any casualties. The few evacuees not staying with relatives or friends were relocated from military barracks to a hotel, with the most vulnerable being moved to a nursing home. Island officials announced a plan to purchase unused housing to accommodate those who lost homes due to the eruption. Speaking in New York after attending the UN General Assembly, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said he was confident that local, national and European authorities would contribute to emergency and the area's reconstruction. Authorities say more dangers lie ahead for residents, including more earthquakes, possible new lava flows, volcanic ash and acid rain. The lava, which exceeds 1,000 degrees Celsius, could cause explosions, trigger landslides and produce clouds of toxic gas when it hits the ocean. The volcanic eruption and its aftermath could last for up to 84 days, the Canary Island Volcanology Institute said, basing its calculation on previous eruptions in the archipelago that were also followed by heavy lava flows and lasting seismic activity. The lava has swallowed up around 320 buildings so far and now covers 154 hectares. The volcano has also been spewing out up to 10,500 tonnes of sulfur dioxide a day. It has ruined banana groves, vineyards and other crops. Life on the rest of La Palma, which is roughly 35km long and 20km wide at its broadest point, has been largely unaffected, with undeterred tourists landing for previously scheduled holidays, and air traffic remaining normal. The Canary Islands are a popular destination for European tourists due to their mild year-round climate.

371,Micro-flyers inspired by nature could be the next big thing in aerial surveillance,environment," Science Miniature airborne microchips touted as breakthrough for disease and pollution monitoring A new microchip roughly the size of a grain of sand that has the potential to glide across great distances is being touted as a breakthrough for aerial surveillance. Collaborating scientists from institutions including Northwestern University in the United States and Soongsil University in Korea have created what they believe are the world's smallest ever ""human-made flying structures"", which can be fitted with microchips and sensors and have the capacity to transmit data remotely. The microchips can be dropped from the sky and potentially used to monitor environmental impacts and the spread of disease. The researchers, who published their findings today in the journal Nature, developed the miniature flyers after studying the aerodynamics of wind-dispersed seeds from trees like the maple, dandelion and jacaranda. Using computer simulations, the team was able to establish which shape would fall the slowest and disperse the farthest while maintaining a controlled descent. And they think they've achieved a result that rivals anything in nature, according to Northwestern University's John Rogers, who led the development of the devices. ""We think we've beaten biology, in a sense,"" Professor Rogers told the journal. ""We've been able to build structures that fall in a more stable trajectory at slower terminal velocities than equivalent seeds."" However, he told the ABC that his team had an unfair advantage. ""Nature is optimising designs in a space [with many competing needs] and with severe constraints associated with growth conditions, energy expenditure, materials, etc,"" Professor Rogers said. ""We are not."" The micro-flyers the scientists created most resemble the star-shaped seed of the tristellateia vine, which have small blades that allow them to rotate and disperse far from the parent plant. Once they established and made the most efficient design, the micro-flyers were fitted with tiny sensors, a solar power source and antennae. The researchers have so far trialled the devices fitted with pH monitors and airborne particulate sensors; however, they see the application of the miniature flyers as potentially very wide ranging. From the groundbreaking and life-saving to the wacky and implausible, Dr Karl Kruszelnicki reveals some of the best moments in science. Part of the advantage in developing such a small device is that it keeps costs down, Professor Rogers said. ""Cost is an important consideration. ""The closest existing technology is in RFDI [Radio Frequency Identification] tags, which these days can be obtained for a few cents per tag."" Given their very small scale and relatively low cost, the idea would be to deploy thousands of the devices from the sky at a time, to gather data over a particular area. ""Our goal was to add winged flight to small-scale electronic systems, with the idea that these capabilities would allow us to distribute highly functional, miniaturised electronic devices to sense the environment for contamination monitoring, population surveillance, or disease tracking,"" Professor Rogers said. But releasing hundreds or thousands of the devices could create its own environmental issues. So the team has also been developing technology to allow the micro-flyers to degrade after deployment. ""We have the technology for environmentally degradable electronics,"" Professor Rogers said. ""We have been developing the materials, devices and manufacturing schemes for more than 10 years."" The biggest leap forward that this development represents is the capacity for dispersal, according to Nam-Trung Nguyen, who is the director of Griffith University's Queensland Micro and Nanotechnology Centre. Professor Nguyen's team has developed similar stationary devices that can be stuck to the skin or implanted into the body to monitor a patient's health. His team sometimes works with Professor Rogers, but he was not involved in this study. While the technology is much smaller today, Professor Nguyen said remote sensing was initially developed by the US military for use during the Vietnam War era. ""Mainly the military was interested in the technology for surveillance,"" he said. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Of course larger flying devices like drones can already capture video and images, and Professor Nguyen said the micro-flyers could probably also be fitted with the technology to stream footage. But as with any advances in technology, he said there was a need to consider the potential for misuse. ""If you look back to the '60s and '70s, the US used it in warfare to collect information. The police could use the same thing [today],"" he said. ""Of course privacy is an issue. Whoever owns it can collect information about anybody."" Professor Rogers said the next step in their research was to give the micro-flyers the capacity for powered flight. ""The other thing we're thinking about is how to add active flight capabilities,"" he said. ""So not something that just falls like a seed, but something that could fly away, like a housefly.""

372,Environmentalist fears $420k Adani legal bill could bankrupt him,environment,"  Environmentalist Ben Pennings fears Adani legal bill could bankrupt him Environmental campaigner Ben Pennings says he fears he could be bankrupted after Adani claimed a single day in court cost them $800,000. Adani — now rebranded Bravus — took Mr Pennings to court seeking compensation for business losses from his campaigns against contractors on its Carmichael coal mine in central Queensland with the protest group Galilee Blockade. It accuses Mr Pennings of trespass, intimidation, conspiracy to injure and inducing company insiders to breach contracts by leaking sensitive information. Mr Pennings was ordered by Queensland's Supreme Court to pay 60 per cent of Adani's costs in relation to a confidentiality application. Adani's lawyers said in letters that the one-day court application cost more than $800,000. The bill totals $844,945.79 but with discounts applied reduces to $701,006.19, meaning Mr Pennings is being ordered to pay $420,603.72. Mr Pennings has raised more than $366,000 from donations towards his legal fees. An Adani spokesperson said: ""We have previously made offers to Mr Pennings to settle the commercial damages matter to which this costs order relates. ""We are always open to constructive discussion that may bring these proceedings to a close. ""This is not about inflicting hardship on Mr Pennings or his family, rather we are enforcing our rights to carry out our business and give regional Queenslanders a fair go in terms of jobs and contracting opportunities. ""Mr Pennings' behaviour has put our employees, contractors and the anti-coal activists themselves in potential danger, although it has no immediate impact on the progress of our construction project. ""This legal action does not seek to limit free speech, we firmly believe that a diversity of views is an important part of democracy and we have stated this many times."" But Mr Pennings said he fears Adani could still end up bankrupting him as it has done with Indigenous activist Adrian Burragubba. ""If I have to pay Adani or anyone $420,000, we have to sell our house,"" Mr Pennings said. ""My lawyers have written to Adani to say 'can you justify this figure of 800,000?' and they're refusing to."" Mr Pennings believed it is a scare tactic. ""They want to scare me, they want to scare my family … they want others to be scared to go against them as well,"" Mr Pennings said. ""I'm loath to admit it, but it is working."" As part of its case, Adani sought orders to keep some of its evidence, which contained sensitive business information, secret from Mr Pennings. He fought the application. Last month Adani's lawyers, Dowd and Co, issued a letter demanding Mr Pennings agree to pay $420,603 as his share of costs. ""The offer to fix these costs will remain open for seven days, after which time we will take steps to commence the preparation of our clients' cost statement,"" a letter from Dowd and Co Lawyers said. Mr Pennings' solicitor, Marque Lawyers partner Kiera Peacock, wrote back saying Adani's alleged total cost was ""the extraordinary sum of $844,945"". ""We cannot understand how Adani could have reasonably incurred over $800,000 in respect of the application,"" she said. ""Adani had described its application as being for a 'commonplace' confidentiality regime. ""They prepared three lay affidavits for the application. The whole matter was heard within a single day,"" she wrote. Ms Peacock asked the firm to give a detailed breakdown of its work, including the ""hourly rates of every person involved"", which was ""the minimum we would have expected to be included in any offer"". In a letter, she said Adani was ""only entitled to costs which were 'necessary or proper for the attainment of justice or enforcing or defending the rights of the party whose costs are being assessed'"". ABC News asked Ms Peacock how Adani could have amassed costs of that amount so far. ""The amount of 800,000 for a single day application is extraordinary,"" she said. ""Our clients certainly can't understand how a party could incur, you know, that amount of costs on a one-day application,"" she said. In another letter, Adani's lawyers responded but refused to detail any further how the single-day application could have cost more than $800,000. Mr Pennings can ask the court for an independent assessment of costs. Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owner Adrian Burragubba was made bankrupt by Adani after losing his legal battles. Mr Burragubba said he spent five years mounting five Federal Court cases against the Native Title process and government approvals. ""That amounted to $680,000, so what they are asking from Ben Pennings at this point is a little bit extreme, just for, you know, one day in court,"" he said. ""It's a bit astronomical to say the least."" Adani applied to have him made bankrupt after he lost and could not afford to pay a portion of Adani's costs. ""Adani is using every means available to prosecute, persecute and criminalise those who oppose his mine,"" Mr Burragubba said. Last year Adani tried twice to get judges to approve its plan to raid Mr Pennings's home to seize devices or documents. For the applications, Adani hired a private investigator to do surveillance on the activist, photographing him walking one of his children to school. The company said it did this because it was obliged to minimise the impact of any proposed raid on members of his family. Both times the court refused to allow a raid. However, Adani managed to get orders that Mr Pennings remove social media posts, not publish certain statements or seek to use confidential information on Adani.

373,"In Tasmania, deer aren't classified as pests. That's causing problems for farmers like Julian ",environment,"  In Tasmania, deer aren't classified as pests. That's causing problems for farmers like Julian On a farm in Tasmania's northern midlands, Lucy Turnbull is looking through hundreds of photos and videos of deer. Each shot contains somewhere between one and 50 fallow deer. The thing is, she's not on a deer farm. Ms Turnbull is an honours student with the University of Tasmania (UTAS), and she's on farmer Julian von Bibra's 12,000-hectare property near Ross. His farm produces merino wool, prime lamb, beef and poppies. But the property is under increasing pressure from feral deer. ""If you go back to the 1960s and 1970s, there might have been a couple of hundred deer on the property,"" Mr von Bibra said. ""And then we get to now, where we're looking at well over 1,000 at various stages during the year. ""[There is] enormous pressure that they bring to the property in terms of grazing, damage to fences, preferentially ending up in the cropping areas."" Ms Turnbull is researching how fear could potentially be used to keep deer away from areas of conservation interest. UTAS research has already found that wild deer are most afraid of the sound of humans, compared with other predators. On Mr von Bibra's farm, Ms Turnbull has set up large speakers attached to camera traps, so that when animals walk past, they trigger the speaker to play the sound of humans and also record video footage. Preliminary data suggests it's working, and video footage shows large groups of deer fleeing as the sounds of ABC radio programs and podcasts are played. ""If my project works, we'll be able to start doing tests to see if it can keep them away [from certain] areas,"" Ms Turnbull said. ""The hope would be to use it almost like a big deer fence, like a sound barrier. ""So instead of spending all this money on deer fences that often don't work anyway, because deer can jump so high, we'd be able to use sound, which would be a much more cost-effective management technique."" But while Ms Turnbull's research is ongoing, Mr von Bibra is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year trying to control deer on his property. He has farmland to protect, as well as expensive revegetation and conservation projects. He's erected large deer fences, and he's caging eucalypt saplings to protect them. ""What worries me is where these numbers are increasing beyond what our traditional methods of control can cope with,"" he said. ""And then add to that, the deer is spreading."" Deer were introduced to Australia in the 1800s for hunting and meat. They have remained fairly small in numbers, until recent decades where populations have greatly increased. The most recent aerial survey by Tasmania's Primary Industries Department estimated the state's fallow deer population has grown by more than 5 per cent every year since 2006. They've also been reported in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. Annelise Wiebkin is Australia's first national deer management coordinator. She estimates there are now between 1 and 2 million deer across Australia. ""They're in every state and territory, but in greatest numbers on the east coast,"" she said. ""We know that they're spreading quite quickly. ""Some data in New South Wales has indicated that over the last five years, their spread has increased by about 35 per cent – so they have increased from about 17 per cent of the state of New South Wales to about 22 per cent of the state. ""And similar rates of spread are being seen in different parts of the country."" Sightings of feral deer around the Northern Rivers have shocked landholders who are using an app to ensure the pests are controlled. Mr von Bibra also brings recreational hunters onto his property to shoot deer. While other states and territories recognise deer as a feral pest, in Victoria and Tasmania, established wild deer are managed as a game resource and are partly protected. Victoria has made it easier for landowners to shoot problem deer. But in Tasmania, landholders have to apply for crop protection permits and hunters need a game licence to shoot during a limited season. ""When we're unable to shoot them because our permits have run out, then they come back again,"" Mr von Bibra said. ""So if we don't have that ability to have 12-month pressure, then we can't control them."" Scott Freeman is a third-generation hunter. He doesn't want deer declared a pest, but he believes game hunters should be playing a role in getting deer out of Tasmanian national parks, as they do interstate. ""A lot of that's done at night with night vision gear and we'll go in and get control of those areas and all the meat is recovered through those programs and taken home and utilised by the program participants."" It's not just rural areas with deer issues. In recent months, they've been spotted in inner Melbourne, given nude sunbathers a scare in Sydney, and one even ran across a junior football game in the Melbourne suburb of Bulleen. Johannes Wenzel has lived in the foothills of the Dandenongs for 35 years in what is effectively outer suburban Melbourne. About five years ago, he noticed something had been nibbling on his rose bushes and fruit trees. ""It took us quite a while to wake up [to the fact] that this was actually deer damage,"" Mr Wenzel said. ""And it has become a huge problem in our environment and not only for us, but for the neighbours and probably for other people much worse."" He started talking to local residents, organisations and businesses and heard reports of vegetation damage, deer on roads and damage to lyrebird habitat. Mr Wenzel joined a local group – the Cardinia Deer Management Coalition – which received a federal grant to undertake a thermal imaging helicopter survey of the local area. Results from the aerial survey estimated more than 1,600 deer in an area of 111 square kilometres – or a density of about 15 deer per square kilometre. Welcome to the new frontier of aerial surveillance and feral animal control. ""We were a bit stunned because we knew there are a lot of deer in the area,"" Mr Wenzel said. ""But the real number which we have now is much higher than we expected."" The surveyed area was near drinking catchment areas, including Melbourne's second-largest reservoir, Cardinia Reservoir. ""It really requires a concerted effort between all the players in the deer sphere in our area to get together to try to counteract the deer impact,"" Mr Wenzel said. In a statement, Melbourne Water said it would incorporate the survey's findings into its deer management program, which already includes regular monitoring and, where required, control activities. Mr Wenzel is now one of the driving forces of the Victorian Deer Control Community Network, a group trying to tackle the growing impacts of feral deer across that state. Ms Wiebkin is developing a national plan for controlling deer but said it was difficult to manage them in urban and peri-urban areas. ""[It's] partly because of the tools that we have to manage them,"" she said. ""The main tools for managing deer are really to shoot them or to trap them or fence them."" She said some overseas countries were having similar issues. ""Some countries such as New Zealand have been developing some of the technologies such as using thermal technologies and the way they do aerial control in a more advanced way that we probably haven't."" David Forsyth is researching cost-effective management options for deer with the NSW Department of Primary Industries. It's a five-year project, and four years in, he's found there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" solution to controlling deer. ""Ground-based shooting at night using professional contractors is effective, as can be some trapping and fencing,"" Dr Forsyth said. ""But in larger, more remote areas, for example, national parks and large pastoral properties, then aerial shooting is probably the most effective method."" A recent Senate inquiry recommended states and territories change legislation to: The Victorian government has developed and funded a deer control strategy and is investigating whether species that aren't established in the wild should be classified as pests. The Tasmanian government will release a wild deer management plan for comment later this year. It's being developed on the basis of deer remaining a ""partly protected"" species. Mr von Bibra believes the deer status needs to be considered. ""What if they were a pest species? That's certainly how much of the rural community view them the farming sector,"" he said. ""And that's perhaps the status they ought to land at, which is where they are on mainland Australia. ""We're getting them in peri-urban areas, we're getting them crossing highways, we're getting them in World Heritage areas and national parks air reserves. ""And that's where I'm really challenged, as to how a generation can let this happen.""

374,An invitation to understand Country,environment," Science Indigenous perspectives on Country feature in Back to Nature documentary Indigenous people often talk about the importance of Country. But what does it mean? Not far from the northern end of Tasmania's spectacular Bay of Fires, Jamie Graham-Blair is sitting in a black peppermint gum forest, where his ancestors lived for thousands of years. ""These trees … when I look around here, I’m seeing my mob,"" says Jamie, a trawlwoolway pakana man. ""I’m seeing my people."" Jamie discusses his relationship to Country — this place also known as larapuna — on the ABC TV documentary series Back to Nature. ""I really love the way that my old people viewed Country … they didn't view it as something separate from us."" Nearing the end of a Bachelor of Marine and Antarctic Science, Jamie also sees this kinship connection through western scientific eyes. ""Every molecule in our body, every atom, every protein, every acid comes from somewhere, right? ""Our physical being is made up of hundreds and thousands, millions and billions of little tiny components that we get from the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. ""Every plant you see here, every bird you hear singing … this stump that we're sitting on. ""It's very possible that we're sitting on atoms that were within my Old People, my actual ancestors."" Jamie collects twigs and branches from the forest and makes a fire for a smoking ceremony. ""This smoke is almost like an opportunity to reground yourself and connect here."" Jamie talks about how his ancestors were often cremated within the ""big scar"" trees in the forest, releasing their spirits to the Country and more. ""Their very physical being would be taken up by these trees,"" he says. ""So, when we smoke them, I’m physically and spiritually introducing you to those Old People."" Further south on a beautiful stretch of Tasmania's east coast, academic and trawlwulwuy woman Emma Lee looks out to sea. She tells of creation stories that reflect her people’s connection with this Country, tebrakunna. ""Ancestors came to Country, they fell to Country as stars. ""Women fell with their children into the water. ""They came down to trouwanna [Tasmania] and picked up some soil and they took it back up in the stars and they raised up our first person, palawa. Kangaroo man. ""There is no difference between us and kangaroo grandfather … no differences between us and our brother, Tasmanian devil. ""This is family. It's the ancestors that we are looking after. ""Kinship means that we can be gentle with each other."" The idea that humans are part of the environment, and the wellbeing of one depends on the other, is a recurring theme in the Indigenous voices of Back to Nature. Everything is connected and needs respect — not just humans, animals, trees and rocks — but land and sky, and past and present. Aaron Pedersen, a descendant of the Arrernte of Central Australia and Arabana people of South Australia, talks of the sense of belonging and revitalisation he feels on Country. ""The rivers, the mountains, the red earth of Arrernte Country, it's a part of me. ""I belong to this land, this Country, this planet, this cosmos. ""I'm connected to billions of stars and planets that are floating through space."" The remnant crater west of Alice Springs called Tnorala (Gosses Bluff) is a particularly special place for the Western Arrernte people, he explains. ""In the Dreaming, a group of sky women danced as stars in the Milky Way. ""One of the women placed her baby in a wooden coolamon. As the women continued dancing, the coolamon fell and the baby plunged into the earth. ""The force of the baby striking the ground drove these rocks upwards. And this crater was created."" For the Western Arrernte, that story still lives on today, Aaron says. ""The coolamon and the baby are falling from the Milky Way. ""The parents searching for their child, the mother, the evening star, and the father, the morning star."" Karlie Noon, a Gamilaraay woman, astrophysicist and astronomer who has studied the Milky Way, recalls something an elder once told her. ""What is on the land is reflected in the sky. ""And what is in the sky, is reflected on the land."" Karlie notes that the creation story told by Aaron fits with western accounts of the crater being formed by a space rock crashing there 142 million years ago. ""We're really looking at the same thing, just in a different way."" Nearly 3,000 kilometres east, behind Queensland's Gold Coast, is Yugambeh Country. It's home to some 2,000-year-old Antarctic beech trees, remnants of Gondwana. Yugambeh man and language researcher Shaun Davies says the Yugambeh people are taught to look after their Country through story. This includes acknowledging the existence of spirits that are protectors of an area. ""By telling its story, you respect the Country and you take care of it. And you take care of its wagoi, which is its spirit. ""And we believe that's made strong by telling the story."" Shaun tells of creatures like the Janjarri — ""that's the little hairy fellow and he lives in the bushland at the bottom of the ranges here"" — and the Bunyun. ""The Bunyun is a creature that's made of rock and it's quite tall and we actually say that they cause the landslides that exist on our Country. ""They’re there to keep things aligned. ""You know if you’re coming here to be very hateful and disrespectful, you’ll probably get a rock dropped on you. ""But if you’re coming here to annoy someone, Janjarri [will] probably take your keys. So they've got a cheeky aspect."" Under an hour from Melbourne, on Wurundjeri Country, is Organ Pipes National Park. It has basalt columns resembling organ pipes, which were formed a million years ago by one of the world’s largest ancient lava flows. This is the eastern edge of where the lava reached. Wurundjeri elder, Aunty Di Kerr, talks about how she feels about her Country. Family features strongly. ""My Country is my mother, so I belong to her. ""The land is her. The waterways are her veins."" This sense of reverence and connection extends beyond her own Country and wherever she goes in Australia, she finds out whose Country she's on. ""The main thing is to always acknowledge that you’re on Country, because acknowledging that and acknowledging their ancestors, it actually helps you feel safer on Country."" At Aunty Di's feet sits Indi Clarke. Indi is head of the Victorian Koorie Youth Council, whose ancestors are Mutti Mutti, Wemba Wemba and Boon Wurrung from across Victoria and New South Wales, and Lardil from north Queensland. But he feels a strong connection to this place, deepened by spending a lot of time with Aunty Di, who says she has known Indi ""since he was in nappies"". ""I discovered this place about two years ago and ever since, I've been here probably once a month,"" Indi says. For Indi, it’s the perfect salve for a chaotic busy life. ""There's so many times where we just need to press pause and really replenish our spirit. ""Aunty Di and other elders … have taught me that no matter where we go, our ancestors are always watching over us. ""You can come here, you can listen to the birds, the fairy wrens and watch them fly around and for me, it takes me to my family."" On Ngarigo Country, in the foothills of Mount Kosciuszko, the Snowy River twists through valleys and foothills a couple of thousand metres beneath its birthplace. Wiradjuri man Richard Swain, a river guide, echoes Aunty Di's respect for Country. He invites people to listen to the voice of the land, as Indigenous people have done for so long. ""You know if you're ever walking through the bush and you're really relaxed, birds are chirping, and you might get off track and you don't feel as good and the bush goes quiet? ""That's Country to speaking to you. And when you get back on track, things feel good again. ""The Country's crying out for people to listen to it."" Richard says he remembers nearly every day he's ever been on the Snowy River. ""Every river's the river of life,"" he says. ""Water is sacred. And it is alive. It's magical."" And before he takes a trip down the river, Richard likes to say hello to Country. As he stands on the bank, he takes a handful of sand and mixes it with the sweat in his armpits. ""I sprinkle it into the river to let the river know that I'm here, and to introduce myself to the land. ""You’ll have a better day if you introduce yourself to Country.""

375,"Parkside timber's plea for $25m 'evidence' industry knew future was in doubt, WA minister says ",environment,"  WA Forestry minster at loggerheads with timber company over $25 million grant request The WA Forestry Minister says a request for a $25 million grant from the owners of the state's largest native timber mill shows the industry knew the viability of native logging was coming to an end — a claim the company rejects. WA Forestry Minister Dave Kelly said Parkside Timber had approached the government with a proposal for the grant in August to assist with expansion plans of its three mills in Nannup, Manjimup and Greenbushes. In it, the proposal states unless the $25 million state government grant funding was secured, the company would be forced to shut its Greenbushes site by December 2021, and scale down operations at Nannup. Native logging in WA will be largely ceased by 2024 following a surprise recent announcement by the McGowan Government. Forestry Minister Kelly said the proposal laid bare the company's outlook of the native timber industry in WA. ""It does underline the questionable viability of the native forestry industry even before we made the decision we did,"" Mr Kelly said. ""They [Parkside] made it clear in their presentation, that without the grant from the government, their ongoing viability would be in question."" Mr Kelly said the grant request was denied. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Great Southern's weekly email newsletter. Parkside CEO John McNamara said the proposal, which was referenced in parliament last week, had been an ""internal draft"", submitted for feedback from staffers within the government's Forest Product Commission. Mr McNamara said references to the closing of the Greenbushes site had been ""a tactic"" by a Parkside director to ""give the government some incentive"" to approve the grant request and allow the company to expand. A second version of the proposal, viewed by the ABC, instead states: ""Without the grant investment, the WA timber industry will not achieve Stage 3 Whole of Forest value-adding."" He said the company was now considering its path forward following the McGowan government announcement. ""We can't rule out job losses in the future but we have no intention of closing the Greenbushes site,"" Mr McNamara said. ""The government has made the policy statement it has, but it hasn't been able to let us know what it all really means and what resources may be available post 2023.""

376,"Volcano erupts in the Spanish Canary Islands, forcing evacuation of thousands",environment,"  Volcano erupts on La Palma in the Spanish Canary Islands, forcing evacuation of thousands A volcano erupted on the Spanish Canary Island of La Palma on Sunday, sending lava shooting into the air and streaming in rivers towards two villages from the Cumbre Vieja national park. Authorities had begun evacuating the infirm and some farm animals from nearby villages before the eruption at 3:15pm local time on a wooded slope in the sparsely populated Cabeza de Vaca area, according to the islands' government. Two hours later, with lava edging down the hillside from five fissures torn into the hillside, the municipality ordered the evacuation of four villages, including El Paso and Los Llanos de Aridane. After nightfall, video footage showed fountains of lava shooting hundreds of metres into the sky, and at least three incandescent orange rivers of molten rock pouring down the hill, tearing gashes into woods and farmland, and spreading as they reached lower ground. One stream, several hundred metres long and tens of metres wide, crossed a road and began engulfing scattered houses in El Paso. ""When the volcano erupted today, I was scared. For journalists it is something spectacular. For us it is a tragedy. I think the lava has reached some relatives' houses,"" local resident Isabel Fuentes, 55, told Spanish television TVE. ""I was five years old when the volcano last erupted (in 1971). You never get over a volcanic eruption,"" added Ms Fuentes, who said she had moved to another house on Sunday for her safety. Spain's Civil Guard said it was helping to evacuate between 5,000 and 10,000 people. Canary Islands President Angel Victor Torres told TVE public television that no injuries had been reported so far. ""In no circumstances go near the lava flow,"" the municipality warned residents. ""If there is volcanic ash, stay in your houses."" Flights to and from the Canaries were continuing as normal, the airport operator Aena said. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez arrived in La Palma, the most northwesterly island of the archipelago, late on Sunday for talks with the islands' government on managing the eruption. Stavros Meletlidis, a doctor of volcanology at the Spanish Geographical Institute, said the eruption had torn five holes in the hillside and that he could not be sure how long it would last. ""We have to measure the lava every day and that will help us to work it out."" King Felipe spoke with Torres and was following developments, the royal household said. La Palma had been on high alert after more than 22,000 tremors were reported in the space of a week in Cumbre Vieja, a chain of volcanoes that last had a major eruption in 1971 and was one of the most active volcanic regions in the Canaries. In 1971, one man was killed as he was taking photographs near the lava flows, but no property was damaged. The earliest recorded eruption in La Palma was in 1430, according to the Spanish National Geographical Institute.

377,Secret government maps detail salmon farming expansion plans,environment,"  Tasmania's coastal waterways earmarked for salmon farming expansion plans There are fresh concerns that the Tasmanian government has secret plans to expand salmon farming to more areas of the state just days after releasing its 10-year plan to ensure the future sustainability of the industry. Community group Neighbours of Fish Farming (NOFF) says it has been given maps that show the state government plans to allow access to large parts of the state's north-west, north and east coasts to salmon farming. According to the maps, much of Tasmania's north and north-west coasts would be made available to fish farming, along with the east coast from the Freycinet Peninsula to existing operations at Storm Bay. ""We got those maps from within government, from people and industry who are deeply concerned themselves about where this salmon industry is going,"" said NOFF president Peter George after a public meeting in Cygnet, south of Hobart yesterday. ""They're as concerned as we are because they know what's going on, they see the information of what damage this industry is doing to our waterways and they want the public to know. ""It is the job of government to let people know what's happening, that's what transparency is all about."" The group says the maps were created in secret by the state government's Marine Spatial Planning Committee, which exists under Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) to identify zones for fish farming, and are vastly different to the ""grow"" and ""no grow"" maps that the state government released in 2017 outlining the industry's future. Former Greens leader Bob Brown said the maps showed much of Tasmania's coastlines were considered by the state government to be ""up for grabs"" for the salmon companies. ""Let's have the [state] government look at these maps and tell us they are not true, they're not going to happen, this expansion is not going to occur,"" Mr Brown said. ""The public is on the move here, we all have something to defend against this industry."" A state government spokesperson said there were no new or secret ""grow"" or ""no grow"" maps that had been developed. The concerns about the industry's potential expansion into more waterways come days after primary industries minister Guy Barnett announced a 10-year plan for the state's salmon industry in state parliament on Thursday. The plan, which will begin development over the next 12 months, pledges that there will be no net increases in water area leased to salmon companies, and there will be a focus instead on land-based and off-shore farming, including in Commonwealth waters. Under the plan, the industry will be regulated by an independent EPA and a new fin fish compliance director, and lease and licence fees paid by salmon companies will also be reviewed. The decade-long plan will begin in 2023, and there will be a moratorium on new leases opening up until then. But opponents to industrial salmon farming say the plan doesn't prohibit salmon growers from moving their operations. ""If you read very carefully, what this 10-year plan means is that the salmon industry can go on doing exactly what it's doing now, which is destroying waterways and then when it's finally finished ... it can move on, without paying any form of reparations, to another area of the state and do exactly the same thing all over again,"" Mr George said. ""These maps show that the vast majority of Tasmania's coastline will be open to industrial fish farming."" Julian Amos from the Salmonid Growers Association said the industry had no plans to expand beyond where it already existed. ""The idea that the map is a prelude to salmon farms springing up all around the coastline is nonsense,"" he said. Prize-winning author Richard Flanagan slams the Tasmanian salmon industry, describing it as disastrous for the environment, with overstated health benefits — and says expansion plans for fish farms around the state are much bigger than the public know about. Mr Amos said the map was drawn back in 2017 to suggest ""no go"" zones, but had been misinterpreted. ""The map has been more of a problem than it has been of assistance to everybody and it has given the wrong impression to those who are critics of the industry, that the industry is on a rampage. It simply isn't,"" he said. Government minister Sarah Courtney said the recently outlined 10-year plan would provide a ""blueprint"" for a sustainable salmon industry into the future. ""That plan outlines particularly in state waters that there's not going to be any net increase in the size of that footprint and we're going to continue to work with the salmon producers around Tasmania about making sure that we can have a sustainable future,"" she said. ""What that plan does is provide certainty for local communities. It also provides certainty for the salmon industry so they can get on with their planning for the future. ""Wherever we are going to have salmon farming, whether it is off-shore or on-land there will still have to be, and there will be strict environmental restrictions around that to make sure that it is done in a sustainable way.""

378,UN chief warns of 'catastrophic' path if nations don't make bigger promises to cut emissions,environment,"  Antonio Guterres says nations need to step up climate change action to avoid 'catastrophic' path The world is on a ""catastrophic pathway"" toward a hotter future unless governments make more ambitious pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations (UN) chief. A new UN report reviewing all the national commitments submitted by signatories of the Paris climate accord until July 30 found they would result in emissions rising nearly 16 per cent by 2030, compared with 2010 levels. Scientists say the world must start to sharply curb emissions soon and add no more to the atmosphere by 2050 than can be absorbed if it is to meet the most ambitious goal of the Paris accord — capping global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees by 2100. ""The world is on a catastrophic pathway to 2.7 degrees [Celsius] of heating,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Experts say the planet has already warmed by 1.1 degrees since pre-industrial times. ""We need a 45 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 to reach carbon neutrality by mid-century,"" Mr Guterres said. Some 113 countries including the United States and the European Union submitted updates to their emissions targets, also known as nationally determined contributions or NDCs, by the end of July. Their pledges would result in a 12 per cent drop in emissions for those countries by the end of the decade — a figure that could more than double if some governments' conditional pledges and assurances about aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050 are translated into action. ""That's the positive side of the picture,"" said UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa, whose office compiled the latest report. ""The other one is more sobering."" Dozens of countries, including major emitters such as China, India and Saudi Arabia, failed to submit new pledges in time for the report. Ms Espinosa called for leaders at next week's annual UN gathering in New York to put forward stronger commitments in time for the global body's upcoming climate summit in Glasgow. ""Leaders must engage in a frank discussion driven not just by the very legitimate desire to protect national interest, but also by the equally commanding goal of contributing to the welfare of humanity,"" she said. ""We simply have no more time to spare, and people throughout the world expect nothing less."" Ms Espinosa added that some public pledges, such as China's aim to be carbon neutral by 2060, had not yet been formally submitted to the UN and so were not taken into account for the report. An update, which would include any further commitments submitted by then, would be issued shortly before the Glasgow summit, she said. Still, environmental campaigners and representatives of some vulnerable nations expressed their disappointment at the findings. Strip out the politics, and the climate change story is very different to the one we've been told. ""We must ask what it will take for some major emitters to heed the scientific findings and deliver our world from a point of no return,"" said Aubrey Webson of Antigua and Barbuda, who chairs the Association of Small Island States. ""The findings are clear – if we are to avoid amplification of our already devastating climate impacts, we need major emitters and all G20 countries to implement and stick to more ambitious NDCs and make strong commitments to net-zero emissions by 2050."" Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, said meeting the Paris goal would only be possible with ""courageous leadership and bold decisions"". ""Governments are letting vested interests call the climate shots, rather than serving the global community,"" she said. ""Passing the buck to future generations has got to stop — we are living in the climate emergency now.""

379,Earth's ozone layer hole larger than Antarctica,environment,"  Southern Hemisphere's ozone layer hole 'larger than usual' this year Scientists say the hole in the Earth's protective ozone layer over the Southern Hemisphere is larger than usual this year and already surpasses the size of Antarctica. The European Union's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service said that the so-called ozone hole, which appears every year during the Southern Hemisphere's spring, has grown considerably in the past week after an average start. ""Forecasts show that this year's hole has evolved into a rather-larger-than-usual one,"" said Vincent-Henri Peuch, who heads the EU's satellite monitoring service. ""We are looking at a quite big — and potentially also deep — ozone hole,"" he said. Atmospheric ozone absorbs ultraviolet light coming from the sun. Its absence means more of this high-energy radiation reaches the Earth, where it can harm living cells. Mr Peuch noted that last year's ozone hole also started out unremarkably but then turned into one of the longest-lasting ones on record. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a ban on a group of chemicals called halocarbons that were blamed for exacerbating the annual ozone hole. Experts say that, while the ozone layer is beginning to recover, it's likely to take until the 2060s for the ozone-depleting substances used in refrigerants and spray cans to completely disappear from the atmosphere.

380,Bunji the koala gets tucked in to a warm bed every night. He's one of the lucky ones,environment,"  Bunji the koala gets tucked in to a warm bed every night. He's one of the lucky ones Sarah Eccleston doesn't leave home without her handbag stuffed with medication, gum leaves and a koala joey the size of a coke can. She hasn't been out to a cafe in months, because she's a 24/7 carer for Bunji the baby marsupial. Ms Eccleston has dedicated the past 22-years to the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, caring for koalas domestically and overseas. She has no plans to slow down, even though she hasn't slept a full night since May. Bunji is one of a number of animals living with Ms Eccleston, but he is the highest maintenance. ""He sleeps in my bed ... he's spoiled rotten,"" she said. At only 240 grams, he needed a lot of food and sleepless nights from Ms Eccleston to get him up to a healthy 812 grams in four months. ""At first he was being fed every two to three hours... but now it's every five hours,"" she said. ""It's exhausting, it really is. I'm sleep deprived."" Despite sleeping 20-hours a day, Bunji has scheduled his own play time in the dead of the night. ""His time to shine and run around and be crazy is three [in the morning],"" she said. ""He gets the zoomies like you wouldn't believe,"" she said. Bunji came into care after his koala mum took a fall and injured her abdomen, which dried up her milk production. ""He was turning into a little skinny-minnie in her pouch,"" she said. ""When we checked we realised it was time to move Bunji out and get him some care and that's when I got the call up."" Wildlife caring is something Ms Eccleston says she was ""put on this earth to do."" ""It's just in your blood,"" she said. ""It's not something you think about, you just do it."" Inside the handbag, Ms Eccleston also keeps a toy koala alongside a fistful of fresh gum leaves. Bunji would be considered a ""backrider"" in the wild, meaning he would be climbing onto his mother's back. ""It's really important, even as a hand raised animal, that I replicate that same sort of behaviour,"" she said. Ms Eccleston has come up with a creative alterative. ""I look like a crazy person walking around with a stuffed toy with leaves poking out the top, but it's really important for his development at this stage. The pair get a lot of attention at the sanctuary and out in public, but it wasn't love at first sight for everyone. ""He wasn't the cutest when I first got him. People were like 'is that a rat?',"" she said. Now, Bunji is an ""ambassador animal"" at the park, along with 50 others. She hopes his cuteness will help raise awareness of the plight of his species. Ms Eccleston says in thirty years, Gold Coast koalas could be completely extinct. ""It's a pretty tough gig the koalas have... they don't have a hugely great outcome"" she said. ""We've got our threats to our animals here in our local community especially in Currumbin and Elanora."" Fires, disease, cars, pools, dogs, and development are high on the list of concerns for the survival of the marsupial. ""Our younger generations, our koala conservation champions of the future, we're teaching them how to conserve our koalas,"" Ms Eccleston said. ""The grim outlook is that by 2050 we could be looking at local extinction of our koalas which just makes me want to cry. ""To think that our future children and children's children wouldn't be able to engage with a koala would be a sad, sad world."" September is Koala Awareness Month at the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, but that's every month for Ms Eccleston. The hospital and sanctuary have seen record numbers of patients over the past year. ""Last week, we had 18 koalas on one particular day come into care,"" she said. ""Last year, we saw over 600 koalas come through our wildlife hospital, so we are thinking this maybe this year is going to be really scary."" In the meantime, Ms Eccleston and Bunji will continue to advocate for conservation of the species across the nation.

381,Endangered fly with 'legs for days' named after drag queen RuPaul,environment,"  Soldier fly species with ‘legs for days’ named after US drag ‘glamazon’ RuPaul RuPaul Andre Charles – the 'Glamazon' of television series RuPaul's Drag Race – once said, ""I believe in using all the colours in the crayon box."" RuPaul's iconic quotes and glitzy gowns have since inspired CSIRO researchers to name a soldier fly after the performer, due to the unique iridescent colours. Just one of 150 species to receive celebrity status in the past year – the Opaluma RuPaul hails from Lamington National Park in Queensland, which suffered extensive fire damage in 2019-20. ""I wanted to do something quite spectacular,"" CSIRO entomologist Dr Bryan Lessard said. ""I think this fly can give RuPaul a run for her money on the runway because it's got legs for days and this glamazon look to it"" Dr Lessard said naming species was key to protecting them, while attracting the attention of citizen scientists and policy makers tasked with the bushfire recovery efforts. ""I've worked with conservation scientists to formally list them as endangered species – they're some of the first flies in Australia to actually get this listing,"" Dr Lessard said. ""That allows citizen scientists, conservation scientists and even policy makers to go out there and protect them so we can enjoy them for future generations. ""We don't want endangered species to sashay away into extinction."" Flies aren't the only species receiving fabulous new titles. The CSIRO has also named new orchid species while three rare beetle species have been named after their Pokémon and Digimon lookalikes. Dr Lessard said describing and naming Australia's native species played an important role in strengthening biosecurity. ""Naming helps our biosecurity officers to more rapidly detect what species are in the country and which ones we need to focus on to prevent from coming in from overseas."" Dr Lessard said a recent project in the Northern Territory traced the origin of a mosquito species that was known to transmit the Japanese encephalitis virus to East Timor through DNA testing. ""We think that these mosquitoes were windblown from Timor-Leste, or hitched a ride on shipping vessels or aircraft,"" Dr Lessard said. ""This mosquito was initially confused with an unnamed Australian native mosquito so it's really important to know what we have here, so we can separate them from pest and exotic species.""

382,Slaughter of dolphins on Faroe Islands sparks debate over hunting traditions,environment,"  Slaughter of dolphins on Faroe Islands sparks debate over hunting traditions The slaughter of 1,428 white-sided dolphins over the weekend has reignited a debate on the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic. Warning: This story contains graphic images. The dolphins were killed as part of a 400-year-old traditional drive of sea mammals into shallow water where they are killed for their meat and blubber. The hunt is allowed and it is not commercial, with meat and blubber shared on a community basis. But environmental activists say it is cruel. Some people in the Faroes who defend the traditional practice have worried this year's hunt will draw unwanted attention because it has been larger than previous hunts. Heri Petersen, the foreman of a group that drives pilot whales toward shore on the central Faroese island of Eysturoy, where the killings took place, said he was not told about the dolphin drive and ""strongly dissociated"" himself from it. He told the news outlet in.fo. that there were too many dolphins and too few people on the beach to slaughter them. Islanders usually kill up to 1,000 sea mammals annually, according to data kept by the Faroe Islands, a self-governing archipelago that is part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Last year, that included only 35 white-sided dolphins. Olavur Sjurdarberg, chairman of the Faroese Pilot Whale Hunt Association, feared the slaughter would revive the discussion about the sea mammal drives. ""We need to keep in mind that we are not alone on earth,"" he said. ""On the contrary, the world has become much smaller today, with everyone walking around with a camera in their pocket. ""This is a fabulous treat for those who want us [to look bad] when it comes to pilot whale catching."" Faroese Fishery Minister Jacob Vestergaard said everything was done by the book in the dolphin hunt. For years, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has opposed the sea mammal drives that date from the late 16th century. On Facebook, the organisation described the weekend's events as ""an illegal hunt."" The white-side dolphins and pilot whales are not endangered species. Each year, islanders drive herds of the mammals — chiefly pilot whales — into shallow waters, where they are killed. A blow-hole hook is used to secure the beached whales and their spine and the main artery leading to the brain are severed with knives. The drives are regulated by laws and the meat and blubber are shared on a community basis. The Faroe Islands are made up of the 18 rocky islands about halfway between Scotland and Iceland.

384,'Not very pretty': Whale carcass to be recovered by SA Museum as big 'stench' heats up ,environment,"  Decomposing sei whale to be recovered by SA Museum as big 'stench' heats up The smelly carcass of a rare whale, which has been mauled by sharks and left to rot on a northern Adelaide beach, will be cut up and removed by SA Museum staff and the local council. WARNING: This story contains graphic content that readers may find distressing. Sei whales, which typically spend most of their time well out to sea, died after being caught on the bow of a cargo ship before being pushed into Outer Harbour last month. Onlookers were in awe as great white sharks mauled the carcass close to shore, but the feeding frenzy also made it difficult for the National Parks and Wildlife Service to secure a rope around the whale so it could be towed back out to sea. It has since floated with the tides to various locations, including Section Bank (known as Bird Island), before getting beached on the mudflats at St Kilda from where residents have been complaining about an increasingly strong smell. ""This has been very sad — what a way for young people to see their first whale,"" City of Salisbury Mayor Gillian Aldridge told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""It's now come up on the beach and we consider it partly our responsibility to do something about it for the sake of our residents. ""Certainly, I believe the stench is really nasty."" Adelaide's maximum temperatures are forecast to reach 26 degrees Celsius on Thursday and 27C on Friday, which is expected to result in an increased smell. Mayor Aldridge said the council had previously tried with SA Museum to tow the whale away but it did not work because the whale had deteriorated too much. She said museum staff would now cut up the whale to extract its bones in a clean-up that would take three to four days. ""We've moved in some heavy machinery and we've got staff down there building the ramp … we're doing it as quickly as we can to make everybody's life a little easier,"" Ms Aldridge said. SA Museum senior mammals researcher Doctor Catherine Kemper said her staff were excited to be dealing with the ""very special"" species in a first for SA. ""They will collect hopefully the whole skeleton, which is fantastic for us as this may be only the second [sei whale] specimen in an Australian museum,"" she said. ""They're probably not terribly common in Australian waters."" She said its bones would be sent to the museum's Bolivar warehouse to be macerated in ""warm water for probably up to a year"". ""Most of our specimens go into scientific collection behind the scenes,"" Dr Kemper said. ""It's unusual that things would go on display, but we'll see, even if it's just to put the skull out after it's all prepared."" ""But our collections are used by researchers and other people from around the world … [who] either come here or we provide them photos or information data."" SA Museum mammals collection manager David Stemmer said it would not be an easy task to recover the whale skeleton, due to its advanced state of composition. Weighing 15 tonnes and smelling like a mix of mouldy cheese, seaweed and rotting meat, the process of preserving a whale can be uncomfortable work. Warning: Graphic content. ""The principal of getting into it will be the same,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide's Spence Denny. ""We need to remove the blubber first and then the soft tissue underneath, the muscles, the organs, and once we get to the bones, we will be cutting them out one by one to remove eventually the entire skeleton. ""The skeleton, which won't be very pretty once it comes out of the rotting carcass, will come to our Bolivar preparation facility where it will be macerated in our big outdoor tank."" He said the smell was ""pretty strong"" but most of his helpers had been around rotting carcasses before, although ""not of that size"". ""It's just matter of breathing, and you get used to it and eventually you don't notice,"" Mr Stemmer said. Dr Kemper said researchers would try and determine the whale's sex and age but a post-mortem was unlikely to be carried out due to the advanced state of decomposition. She said it was common for whales worldwide to be killed by cargo ships. ""The whale may be sleeping or a little bit dozy at the surface, and a huge container ship comes in a at a fair rate of knots and the whales gets hung up on the bow and dies,"" Dr Kemper said. ""It would be awful if it were a slow death."" She said that while SA Museum would remove the bones, the council has arranged to remove the rest of the carcass, which will be composted.

385,Wild 'de-extinction' plan aims to bring woolly mammoths back to life,environment,"  Bioscience company plans to bring woolly mammoths back from extinction It is the elephant in the genomics room: Can extinct species be resurrected? New bioscience company Colossal insists they can, announcing plans to restore the woolly mammoth to the Arctic tundra. The proposal is part of wider ""de-extinction"" or ""rewilding"" efforts that attempt to reintroduce extinct animal species in their natural habitats. Proponents say the emerging technology has the potential to help restore damaged ecosystems and slow or even halt the effects of climate change. Colossal chief executive and co-founder Ben Lamm said his company planned to ""harness the power"" of de-extinction technology to ""rebuild ecosystems, heal our Earth and preserve its future"". ""In addition to bringing back ancient extinct species like the woolly mammoth, we will be able to leverage our technologies to help preserve critically endangered species,"" Mr Lamm said in a statement. The bioscience firm has raised $US15 million ($20 million) from investors to develop techniques, including CRISPR gene editing, for de-extinction. Critics say the money could be better used to save endangered animals and also address the root causes of extinction. Woolly mammoths roamed much of the Arctic, and co-existed with early humans who hunted the cold-resistant herbivores for food and used their tusks and bones as tools. The animals died out about 4,000 years ago. For decades, scientists have been recovering bits and pieces of mammoth tusks, bones, teeth and hair to extract and try to sequence the mammoth's DNA. Colossal says it aims to insert DNA sequences of woolly mammoths, collected from well-preserved remains in the permafrost and frozen steppes, into the genome of Asian elephants, to create an ""elephant-mammoth hybrid"". The woolly mammoth's vast migration patterns were seen as critical to preserving the Arctic region's environmental health. Company co-founder George Church, a geneticist from Harvard Medical School, said creating mammoth hybrids could help revitalise these areas. ""Technologies discovered in pursuit of this grand vision – a living, walking proxy of a woolly mammoth – could create very significant opportunities in conservation and beyond,"" Mr Church said in the statement. But some experts say plans to resurrect mammoths are unrealistic and misguided. Jeremy Austin, an evolutionary biologist from the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide, said the millions of dollars raised for de-extinction projects could be put to better use. ""It's a ridiculous waste of money to try and reconstruct the genome of an extinct animal or plant and attempt to bring it back to life when other species are slipping through our fingers almost on a daily basis,"" Dr Austin said. ""The amount of money and resources used to even attempt to bring one species back from extinction could be used to save … possibly tens of threatened species from actually going extinct themselves."" In Australia, there are more than 400 animal species that are threatened or extinct, according to the Department of Agriculture. Scientists have proposed bringing some of them, like the thylacine, back by using similar technology proposed by Colossal. Euan Ritchie, a wildlife ecologist at Deakin University, said conservationists could learn valuable information through de-extinction science. ""Trying to resurrect these extinct species does give us more information about the genetics of species,"" he said. But Dr Ritchie added causes of extinction also need to be remedied. ""If it was possible to resurrect recently extinct species and care for them better in their environments, then I think that's a worthwhile thing doing, but not if we're going to continue business as usual,"" he said. Would the woolly mammoth and Tasmanian tiger be happy living in the 21st century? ""We do need to change our ways that are causing so many extinctions, and things are still continuing to get worse."" There is also doubt about whether mammoths or other extinct species could survive in modern environments. Dr Austin said it was either humans or habitat destruction that caused their extinction in the first place. ""You don't have to be a highly trained scientist to know that the Arctic, in general, is suffering terribly due to climate change,"" Dr Austin said. ""What are you going to do with a pair of woolly mammoths, apart from put them in a zoo and charge people large amounts of money to come and look at them?""

386,Extraordinary footage of whale super pod off NSW coast,environment,"  Super pod of 80 whales filmed feeding off NSW's Sapphire Coast Incredibly rare footage of a super pod of whales in a feeding frenzy has been filmed off the Sapphire Coast in New South Wales. The mass congregation of more than 80 whales was filmed several days ago. It is only the second time only that an event of this kind has been filmed in Australian waters. A super pod was also filmed last year feeding at the same spot. Whale expert Dr Vanessa Pirotta said the vision was extraordinary and rare. ""Last year was the first time that this was ever documented in Australian waters, and in addition to that, bubble net feeding behaviour was also documented last year,"" she said. ""Now, this has happened again around the same time as it did last year, and as you can imagine, the whale world and people like myself as marine scientists are so excited to bring this to you. ""What's happening in the environment right now in this area is so exciting. Something is going on that we need to investigate as scientists to learn more about our big beautiful marine environment."" Dr Pirotta said while it is still a mystery why the whales have returned to this section for a second year, the footage holds incredible scientific value. ""This is really a great opportunity to work out that there's something going on significantly and environmentally,"" she said. ""We don't actually know what it is about this area of the New South Wales south coast."" The stunning images were captured by scientists and wildlife tour operators Sapphire Coastal Adventures. Simon Miller, from the tour company, said whales were feeding on baitfish. ""The whales work collaboratively together to herd the bait into a really tight-knit ball,"" he said. ""At one stage they started herding it towards the boat, and when it gets to the boat it stops and the whales were lunging into it, so we're very lucky we could get out there and see it."" The wildlife tourism business, like many others, has been affected by COVID-19 restrictions but continues to head out on the waters with no passengers. In seeing that many whales, it's easy to lose sight of the scale of the event. ""If you can just picture yourself being in the bus, that's the size of a whale,"" Dr Pirotta said. ""If you have hopped in a car today, that's the size of a baby whale. ""There's a boat there, that boat is pretty big. I would say maybe around 30 metres or so and to have a whale almost the size of that, you're talking an animal the size of 17 metres long. They're massive."" Part of the excitement around this footage for the scientific community is that it captures the whales' bubble net feeding. Dr Pirotta explained how the animals blow bubbles around their prey to catch them. ""All the krill or the fish they're feeding on are scrambling to ball up really tightly packed and then the animals will come from underneath and then engulf it, open their throat like an accordion or a slinky for the younger generation, and then they'll come through and then they'll engulf that prey,"" she said. ""These whales are turning on their side, opening up their side, they don't have any hair, the white on the underside, that white there is their throats opening up and the pointy bit, that's the top of their mouths. ""They'll use their plates, [which] if you have ever seen Finding Nemo is those long hair-like structure plates hanging from the roof of their mouth and engulf both their prey as well as water. ""Then they'll use those plates … to then expel the water, so it's very sophisticated."" Dr Pirotta said it was possible the footage may help determine whether the Sapphire Coast is emerging as a significant area. ""We're seeing a whole group of whales taking the opportunity to have a feed before they go back to Antarctica,"" she said. ""If this is a significant area, maybe they are using Australian waters as an additional feeding ground to Antarctica to help top up that supply."" Dr Pirotta also said humpback whale population numbers have continued to climb since the whaling ban. ""They're growing at around 11 per cent each year, and there's probably 35,000-plus humpback whales in this very population,"" she said. ""We might be seeing behaviours that were there before whaling, now re-emerging.""

387,Forest drill 'bringing forward evolution' one hollow at a time,environment,"  Drill invention fast-tracks creation of tree hollows for wildlife displaced by fires An innovative drilling technique that fast-tracks the creation of hollows in tree trunks aims to create a million homes for wildlife displaced by the Black Summer bushfires two years ago. As catastrophic infernos destroyed more than 5.5 million hectares of wildlife habitat, millions of animals that relied on tree hollows for shelter and breeding became displaced and vulnerable to prey. Vaughan Kirky, whose Pillar Valley property on the North Coast narrowly escaped the disaster, said he noticed increasing numbers of animals seeking refuge on his land following the fires. ""It was a heartbreak to realise these animals had been displaced from their original areas and were flocking to our estate,"" he said. Mr Kirky said he and his family had tried many fauna-housing solutions, such as nest boxes, to provide shelter for the homeless wildlife but none were as effective as the natural tree hollows the animals were used to living in. Now, his property is home to 80 tree hollows created using a new drilling technique, called the Hollowhog, that speeds up the natural hollow-development process — which normally takes up to 70 years. ""Tree hollows are not affected by extreme temperatures and are a lot less obtrusive,"" Mr Kirky said. ""As the tree grows and matures, then so those hollows will actually mature with the trees and they will become even more like a natural habitat."" Inventor of the Hollowhog, Transport for NSW environment officer Matt Stephens, said 15 per cent of Australia's wildlife, including 300 species of birds, reptiles and mammals, relied on hollows for shelter. ""Animals prefer them because of their small entrances, which allow them to tightly squeeze through and avoid threats from larger predators,"" he said. Mr Stephens' invention has excited conservationists who have been battling to mitigate the loss of so much natural habitat. ""What the Hollowhog allows us to do is to rapidly form a hollow in a tree, and sometimes multiple hollows in a tree, and speed up that natural process,"" Mr Stephens said. ""We are bringing forward evolution here."" Prior to the Hollowhog, the only hollow-carving technique involved the use of a chainsaw and the removal of a large patch of the tree's outer layer – the tree's living tissue. Mr Stephens said the new technique only required drilling a small hole the size of a finger into the living material by using a uniquely designed drill head. ""This technology allows us to keep the rest of the tree's structure intact and carefully enter and remove some of the deadwood in the centre of the tree,"" he said. Since June, Transport for NSW has installed more than 800 hollows in bushfire-affected areas under a pilot habitat replacement project. Transport for NSW senior environment and sustainability officer Kate Dallimore said the new shelters had aroused strong interest from forest dwellers. ""We have had uptake by some lorikeets, bush rats and antechinus,"" Ms Dallimore said. ""Within 20 minutes of installing a hollow, a tree creeper flew around and inspected the hollow. ""This project has been the highlight of my career."" Mr Stephens said another 600 new hollows had been commissioned, amid growing interest among conservationists. Landcare and Southern Cross University have contacted the Hollowhog inventor for collaboration using the technique. ""My hope is that this technique can be used not just in New South Wales but across Australia and internationally,"" Mr Stephens said. ""I call it the one-million-hollow project, where I aim to make a difference to conservation activities and help house displaced animals.""

The carcass — which was later identified by the Department for Environment and Water as a type of baleen whale known as a sei — was shifted by several high tides to Section Bank, off the northern end of Torrens Island, between Outer Harbor and St Kilda. It is currently about 400 metres from St Kilda embedded in shallow tidal mudflats. ""Its current location has made it difficult to access and remove,"" the department said in a statement. ""Several attempts have been made to tow the whale carcass out to sea when it first became stranded within Port River shipping channel. ""These were unsuccessful due to safety concerns as the carcass was being mauled by several large great white sharks."" St Kilda kiosk owner Robyn Cook this morning told ABC Radio Adelaide she was concerned about the odour emanating from the animal, especially as the weather gets warmer. ""It's drifted over to St Kilda and now it's stuck on the flats,"" she said. ""I'm not looking forward to summer if they can't move it. ""They were trying to move it, but they've left it too long now and now it's stuck. ""I was told yesterday that the jaw is actually embedded, and those jaws are pretty heavy."" Ms Cook said she remembered the time, in 1989, when the remains of a blue whale — the bones of which are now in the SA Museum — became stuck at St Kilda. ""They had to cut it up out there, we had whale blubber up the channel for weeks,"" she said. ""It drifts around to this area and then the flats out there are too shallow. ""It stunk to high heaven. It was terrible."" Senator Rex Patrick is also pushing for the sei whale to be removed. ""If this rotting whale were lying off Glenelg or Henley, it would've been removed by now,"" he tweeted this morning. ""Because it's only the 90 St Kilda residents and children who visit the local renowned playground that have to endure the stench, nothing's been done."" Earlier this week, a dead whale surrounded by a pack of hungry sharks washed up into Adelaide's port. So, what happens when a whale dies at sea and is washed ashore? But the environment department said one option was now leaving the whale to decompose, after a ""number of attempts"" to move it from its current location had failed. ""A plan was established to attempt to move the whale so that the South Australian Museum could take tissue samples and reclaim the skeleton, as they do not have samples of this species in their collection,"" a spokesperson said. ""These [attempts] were unsuccessful due to the shallow waters and state of decomposition meaning it will not float. ""In the case of a whale carcass becoming stranded and immovable, it is normal practice to leave it to return to nature unless it becomes a hazard."" The spokesperson said the department was continuing to work with the SA Museum and the local council on options to remove it, including engaging ""commercial operators with specialist equipment"".

389,live: NSW Now: Treasurer says he wants to cut red tape to allow outdoor dining as part of COVID recovery,environment,"  Here's what you need to know this morning. The NSW government will help reduce red tape for local councils to support outdoor dining as COVID-19 restrictions ease, NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet says. Mr Perrottet said he was preparing to release details of an economic recovery program in October, after the release of the government's road map out of COVID this week. He said an outdoor dining taskforce was considering options. ""Ultimately, one thing is the government spending money, the other thing is government cutting back red tape and regulation, and allowing businesses the opportunity and ease of trading again,"" he said. ""Councils will obviously play a role to ease those restrictions, and I also understand that sometimes they are politically contentious, but I think we have to get the balance right."" NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard will travel to Wilcannia in the state's far west today to meet with community and Indigenous leaders who are managing the COVID-19 outbreak. There have now been 100 confirmed cases in the town. About 20 of them have recovered and are now out of isolation. From today, those who have tested positive will start isolating in one of the 30 motorhomes sent to Wilcannia over the weekend. NSW Health has also set up an emergency management hub for support staff including health workers, police, Rural Fire Service, SES and staff from the Australian Defence Force. Michael Kennedy, chairperson of the Wilcannia Aboriginal Land Council, said it was important for Mr Hazzard to see the situation firsthand, and hear from locals about what more was needed. ""It will be a matter of what the Health Minister can do, how quickly can he act and get things together for us,"" he said. ""The motorhomes and stuff like that are short term, but long-term stuff as well. We struggle out here with housing, and overcrowding. So maybe a long-term fix for some of that sort of stuff."" The New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is pushing to keep departmental legal briefings to Premier Gladys Berejiklian under wraps because they are ""directly relevant"" to its widening investigation into her former secret partner Daryl Maguire. ABC Investigations has revealed the ICAC is scrutinising written briefings that informed the Premier that two ministerial advisers had come forward to provide information in the wake of Mr Maguire's resignation from the Liberal Party in July 2018. Several NSW Upper House politicians are pushing to release the documents to the public, claiming they reveal Ms Berejiklian could have breached the Act by failing to report Mr Maguire's conduct. But an email from the ICAC's solicitor, obtained by the ABC, says the memos should remain confidential because they are ""directly relevant"" to the commission's investigation. The NSW government has set a zero extinctions target for the state's national parks, in a move it says will protect about 85 per cent of the threatened species that live in these areas. Environment Minister Matt Kean said it was time to put an end to Australia having the worst mammal extinction rate in the world. ""Just as we have a net zero emissions target, we now also have a target of zero extinctions for our national parks,"" he said. Mr Kean has declared 221 sites, which he said were home to a number of at-risk species, as assets of intergenerational significance (AIS) — meaning these areas are now afforded strong legal protections. The ""game-changing"" announcements come on Threatened Species Day. Earlier in the year, the Wollemi Pines in the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area were the first site in the state to be declared an AIS.

390,"Severe winter storms have smashed this holiday paradise, sparking fears for its future",environment,"  Rottnest Island erosion sparks concern about the future of WA's holiday paradise A community group set up in the 1980s to protect Western Australia's island paradise, Rottnest, says it is appalled by the erosion damage to the dunes at one of the island's latest tourist developments. Pinky Beach has been closed since mid-August to allow the operator of the luxury ""glamping"" resort on its doorstep to replace access stairs and rehabilitate the dunes, following severe winter storms. But the Rottnest Society, which was set up in 1984 in response to plans for an international hotel and marina on the island, is not satisfied that the sensitive bay on the island's northern side is being adequately protected. ""I've been deeply concerned about the state of Pinky's,"" long-time society treasurer Trish Bevan said. ""I could see the destruction of the dunes coming."" The society has written to WA Tourism Minister David Templeman, saying the resort should never have been approved at the beachfront location. It has argued far more ""active management"" needed to be carried out by the Rottnest Island Authority to protect the area, given the additional visitors the resort is attracting to the beach. ""Rottnest Island can only be retained as a tourist icon if its sensitive environment is protected,"" the letter said. Ms Bevan and society deputy chairman Ian MacRae, a retired town planner, visited Pinky Beach last week to try to survey the erosion damage firsthand. But they were promptly shown the door by a ranger who explained the beach was closed to allow for the construction work to be carried out on the new access stairs. Ms Bevan, who has led dozens of tree planting expeditions to Rottnest over her 14 years with the group, was not impressed. ""I think the beaches belong to everybody and to be pushed away, with no signage to stop us, was appalling,"" she said. It is not the first time the dunes and stairways have taken a battering at Pinky Beach. Within a few months of the resort opening for business in March 2019, a storm caused erosion damage and forced the closure of the stairways built to keep beach-goers off the dunes. Resort operator Discovery Rottnest Island said this year's severe winter weather meant most of the northern side of Rottnest had been impacted by coastal erosion. In a statement, it said it was replacing the access stairs with others that could better withstand severe weather events and was also putting in place extra measures to protect the dunes, including additional balustrades, matting and replanting of native vegetation. ""The site is, in fact, better cared for than prior to the development,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""The environmental protection of Pinky Beach and the land upon which our property sits has always been of the utmost importance to Discovery Rottnest Island and central to all development and design decisions."" While authorities aim to reopen Pinky Beach by September 10 ahead of the busy school holiday period, just around the corner at Thompson Bay South, the erosion is severe. The state government has allocated over $1.7 million to build a sea wall at the erosion hotspot, with construction planned for April 2022. Professor Charitha Pattiaratchi of the UWA Oceans School said this year's conditions had been unusual. ""They have been almost continuous, one after the other, so it is not giving beaches any time to recover and be prepared for the next storm to come,"" he said. Professor Pattiaratchi warned erosion along the entire WA coastline was only going to get worse with rising sea levels and more frequent severe storms forecast for the coming decades. ""The state and federal governments do not have enough money to protect all the beaches where we are going to have erosion,"" he said. ""So somewhere we have to make a business decision and a social decision to say, 'well this beach is going to be far too expensive to protect for the next 50 years,' and walk away,"" he said. That is not an outcome Ms Bevan and the Rottnest society want for the island or Pinky Beach. In the society's latest newsletter to members, it said that while there seemed to be plenty of money for other projects, environmental work seemed to be a low priority for the Rottnest Island Authority. Ms Bevan, who has been visiting Rottnest since she was a child, said she was saddened by the way the island was heading. ""I think it's our island and it's being taken away from us with expensive development,"" she said. ""There is less and less interest in the environmental side. ""I feel that it's becoming impossibly expensive for the average family to be part of Rottnest and that saddens me. Neither the Rottnest Island Authority nor the Tourism Minister were available for an interview. In a statement, Mr Templeman said the authority was working on a number of projects to better understand and manage coastal erosion on the island, including monitoring erosion, developing a coastal hazard risk management plan, developing site-specific plans and conducting dune stabilisation work.

391,"Red list reveals Komodo dragon, sharks and rays are in danger, while tuna recovers",environment,"  Komodo dragon, sharks and trees make IUCN endangered species red list, tuna on the 'path to recovery' The world's sharks and rays have seen declines in their population and more are now threatened with extinction, according to a new red list released at a global conference aimed at protecting dwindling species. The Komodo dragon is now listed as endangered, notably because of rising sea levels and rising temperatures in its Indonesian habitat. Ebonies and rosewoods threatened by logging were among trees put on the list for the first time this year. There are signs of hope, too – fishing quotas have allowed several tuna species to be put on the ""path to recovery,"" according to the announcement from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Some 37 per cent of the world's sharks and rays are considered in danger as of 2021, up from 33 per cent seven years ago, the IUCN announced. Overfishing, a loss of habitat and climate change explain the upward trend, it said. Oceanic shark populations have dropped by 71 per cent since 1970. But the progress in reviving tuna populations and some other species ""is the demonstration that if states and other actors take the right actions … it is possible to recover,"" IUCN director Bruno Oberle told reporters in the southern French city of Marseille. The IUCN Red List Unit reassesses hundreds of species each year. Of the some 138,000 species the group tracks, more than 38,000 are threatened with extinction. Several recent studies have shown that many of the planet's ecosystems are severely strained by global warming, deforestation, habitat degradation, pollution and other threats. More than half of all bird of prey species worldwide are declining in population, and 18 species are critically endangered. Warming temperatures and melting ice are projected to imperil 70 per cent of Emperor penguin colonies by 2050 and 98 per cent by 2100. Actor Harrison Ford made an impassioned plea to safeguard biodiversity at the opening of the World Conservation Congress in Marseille on Friday. ""It's hard to watch the rise of nationalism in the face of a global threat that requires global cooperation, global action,"" he said. ""It's hard to read the headlines, floods, fires, famines, plagues and tell your children that everything is all right. It's not all right. Damn it, it's not all right."" ""C'mon everybody,"" he said. ""Let's get to work."" Environmental groups are urging governments to take bolder actions to protect the oceans, the Amazon and other crucial ecosystems. The conference runs until September 11. Among topics are the links between climate change and biodiversity loss, and the ethics of genetic enhancement to increase species' chances of survival. The talks are also meant to inform the UN's global climate summit, the COP26, which will be held in November in Glasgow, Scotland.

392,This school was built in six days and could last for 100 years — and it's resistant to earthquakes,environment,"  Earthquake-resistant school built from recycled plastic in Indonesia Three years after the Indonesian island of Lombok was devastated by earthquakes, a team of Australian and Indonesian charity organisations have set up Asia's first sustainable and earthquake-resistant school on the island. Entire villages were destroyed, more than 550 people were killed and 417,000 displaced when two earthquakes hit the island on August 5 and 19, 2018. Infrastructure like businesses, homes and schools were wiped out, and as part of the rebuilding process, a new eco-friendly and earthquake-resistant school, SDN 4 Taman Sari, was constructed in June. It's located in Taman Sari village, 10 kilometres north of the provincial capital Mataram. The key to the school's sustainability and resilience to earthquakes is the use of 'eco-blocks', which are made from recycled plastic mixed with wood. They're lightweight, sturdy and easy to assemble — it only took six days to build the SDN 4 Taman Sari school. After laying the foundations, the blocks can be formed into walls by stacking them by hand. Then the roof and windows are added. The blocks are designed to avoid causing fatal injuries in an earthquake. Due to their elasticity, they are less likely to crumble or cave in. Seismic resistance, or the ability to withstand an earthquake, is increased because walls made of eco-blocks flex rather than snap. Their light weight, and the way the blocks fit together, also means they can tolerate much more movement than conventional bricks and mortar. Duncan Ward is the founder and CEO of Classroom of Hope, the Australian charity organisation that led the eco-block school project in Lombok. He started Classroom of Hope in 2012 with the mission of helping children living in poverty gain access to education. So far, the organisation has built more than 75 schools throughout Asia and Africa. SDN 4 Taman Sari is the first school made from eco-blocks, though Mr Ward said his organisation has plans to build many more. ""[These schools] are so much more durable, they're lightweight, they're cost effective, and they're going to last 100-plus years, and they're cleaning up the environment,"" Mr Ward said. Classroom of Hope collaborated with a number of partners, including local government as well as the Pelita Foundation charity. Pelita, which means 'shining light' in Indonesian, is a not-for-profit local charity in Lombok that supports education across the island. Pelita's CEO Satriawan Amri said the initial reaction to the idea of an eco-block school was mixed. ""When I brought up the idea, [people] were a bit unsure,"" he said. ""But afterwards, I showed them a few examples of similar buildings. I explained the materials and how [this project] would be good for the environment since it would use recycled plastic."" By the time construction began, most were eager to see the new school completed. ""When the community started to see the materials arriving and the school beginning to take form, the children couldn't wait to start having classes there,"" Mr Amri said. Marizal has been teaching physical education in West Lombok for 11 years. He is now at SDN 4 Taman Sari. With the establishment of the new school, he has seen an extraordinary transformation. Subscribe to The Bright Side with Sabra Lane, a fortnightly collection of stories that aim to inspire, engage and create hope. ""Our school, which used to be a temporary pop-up school, with plywood walls and dirt floors, has now become a beautiful, clean and tidy eco-block school,"" he said. Pazila Aulia, a year five student at SDN 4 Taman Sari, was excited to resume learning at the new school. ""I loved seeing the building go up, with its walls arranged like lego. It looks very neat – it's beautiful,"" she said. ""It looks a bit like bamboo … I'm really enjoying this school, I'm more enthusiastic about learning because it's not too hot anymore."" The idea of an eco-block school first arose in 2018, when Classroom of Hope was providing support in Lombok after the earthquakes. At the time, Mr Ward was living in Bali with his family, after they moved from Perth. ""We got rocked here in Bali. I remember waking up, running to grab my daughter and running outside to the rice paddies with my wife because the whole house was shaking,"" he said. ""The next morning, I was inundated with phone calls from people I know who live on Lombok, on the Gili islands, expats, locals — people I care about — whose homes had been destroyed."" Mr Ward travelled to Lombok and Classroom of Hope became involved with the recovery effort shortly after. ""We were part of the first response in trying to raise money from a disaster relief perspective, for search and rescue, water, food, and just getting people to safety in the first instance,"" he said. Together with Pelita Foundation, they set up 23 pop-up schools, which allowed 4,000 children to return to school. But it wasn't a permanent solution. ""The whole place was like a war zone,"" Mr Ward said. ""The government spoke to us and asked if we could build permanent structures. I said, 'No, we can't, because all your permanent structures are in rubble.' ""That started sending my mind to — how can we build permanent structures that are earthquake resistant?"" Mr Ward contacted Block Solutions, the Finnish company that is responsible for the eco-block technology. It was already using eco-blocks to build low-income housing projects in Africa. Block Solutions uses recycled plastic, breaking it down into granules and then mixing it with wood fibres. That mixture is then processed by an injection-molding machine to create the eco-clocks. According to Mr Ward, this is the ideal material to rebuild permanent schools in earthquake-prone areas. ""For every classroom you're building, you're removing two to three tonnes of plastic waste [from the environment],"" he said. ""Indonesia being the second biggest polluter in the world, it makes sense … and it aligns with what the government is trying to do."" By mid 2021, the planning process was finished and the materials had arrived in Lombok from Finland. It then took six days to build. Marizal hopes this method will be used more widely to provide education to communities still recovering from the earthquakes. ""I think these eco-blocks are a very fitting solution to set up a safe and comfortable system of building schools,"" he said. Classroom of Hope's next goal is to build a factory in Indonesia so that plastic waste can be gathered from the local area — rather than from Finland – and processed locally. With the help of an Indonesian branch of Block Solutions, Classroom of Hope could soon construct other buildings, such as houses for people whose homes were destroyed in the earthquake.

393,Mystery surrounds why 380 seabirds dropped dead in the water,environment,"  Chemical pollution suspected as seabirds drop dead in the water in Mackay Hundreds of seabirds have died or fallen ill off the coast of Mackay, with authorities investigating whether a slick or pollution event is to blame. A flock of black noddies took refuge on a boat during stormy weather near Penrith Island about 75 kilometres off the coast. The birds hitched a ride back to the Mackay Marina, where they congregated on a rock wall earlier this week. Local resident Shane said he saw the sick animals. ""Some of them were dropping dead in the water and floating off,"" he said. The Department of Environment and Science said officers removed more than 240 dead birds from the marina on Thursday. The focus of its investigation has shifted off shore, after a further 140 birds were found dead at Bushy Island. The island is about 90km from Mackay and is a known roosting site for black noddies. A helicopter survey of the ocean between Bailey, Derwent, Penrith, Bushy, Scawfell, St Bees and Keswick islands was carried out on Thursday. The department said no obvious pollution event or slick was seen. Michael Short from the department said a number of live and dead birds were taken to a local vet for assessment. He said a light, greasy film was found on their feathers ""which might be an indication of some sort of chemical"". The film compromised the ability of feathers to thermoregulate and keep the bird warm, he said. ""The birds have a normal body temperature between 39 and 41 degrees Celsius, so with current sea temperatures around Mackay, probably around 25C. ""The birds get really cold and they can actually die from hypothermia. ""They certainly stop feeding and drinking."" Mr Short said it was likely the birds took shelter on the boat as they were in pain. ""With the storm activity when the fishing vessel was moving through the area, they probably sought refuge to get out of the weather … because they were suffering badly,"" he said. An investigation is underway to determine what pollutant could be affecting the wildlife. ""We're certainly working closely with a number of laboratories like Biosecurity Queensland looking at disease processes,"" Mr Short said. ""We do have people who are collecting samples in the field, both water samples and animals, up around Penrith Reef where we believe the incident initially occurred."" Mr Short said a priority was to care for the sick birds. ""The process is to certainly look at why the animals are getting sick, what are some of the causal factors there, so we can actually meet whatever the health needs are for the animals. ""That's in terms of is there some issue happening internally that we need to get some special treatment to, to try and better understand where we can care for these animals to try and rehabilitate them.""

394,"Hot and gusty spring arrives, but don't pack away the winter woollies yet  ",environment,"  Hot and gusty spring arrives, but don't pack away the winter woollies yet Enjoy the warm temperatures while you can but keep your winter woollies handy because a cold front is on the way. Wide parts of the country are experiencing above-average temperatures, with the Nullarbor especially hot, registering temperatures 12 to 14 degrees above September averages. Catastrophic fire danger is forecast for the Eucla for the rest of Wednesday and extreme fire danger for the South Interior fire region. These warm temperatures are being driven by air drawn down from northern Australia ahead of a cold front. As the front moves east, severe weather warnings have been issued for South Australia and Victoria on Thursday. But according to Jackson Browne, from the Bureau of Meteorology, it is a false start to spring. Hot and gusty conditions are expected ahead of the front but in its wake temperatures are expected to drop. ""On Friday, large areas of south-western WA [will be] 6 to 8 degrees below average,"" Mr Browne said. For anyone attending the Red Centre NATS this weekend beware: Alice Spring's maximum temperature is expected to halve from 33 degrees on Thursday to just 16 degrees by Sunday. ""This week's weather is stock-standard spring weather,"" Mr Browne said. ""We're seeing wild variations of temperatures around the shop."" But not everywhere is enjoying the warm start. Mr Browne said north Queensland and south-west Western Australia were experiencing wet and cloudy conditions with below-average temperatures. ""Just remember, keep in the back of your mind that spring is a transitional season,"" he said. ""We're going to have episodes of very warm temperatures and episodes of very cold."" In Australia, we typically use the meteorological seasons, which split the year into four sets of three calendar months, centred around the coldest part of the year for most of the country. Using this system, spring started on Wednesday, on September 1. But it is important to remember that there is nothing really ""official"" about the seasons. They are based on conventions. Some places around the world still use the astronomical calendar to mark the seasons, with spring starting on the spring equinox. The equinoxes mark the point in the Earth's rotation around the sun when the days and nights are of equal length. This year the southern hemisphere's spring equinox is on September 23. In other parts of the world, like the tropics, the four-season calendar makes little sense. Indigenous communities around Australia have their own systems for marking the seasons. The Yawuru people, native title holders around Broome in Western Australia, have six seasons.

395,Richardsons show others how to successfully live sustainably ,environment,"  Couple create a sustainable sanctuary in Mount Gambier with ample passion, persistence Alan and Denise Richardson's property is both a serene scene and a sanctuary of sustainability. Chickens cluck and strut through an orchard filled with trees that are ripe with fruit. A neat veggie garden has been rigged with a hose irrigation system and tanks of rainwater supply the house and garden year-round. Tucked away on the roof are glossy black solar panels, while a futuristic-looking battery works in tandem with the panels. Mr Richardson said when the couple first moved into the Mount Gambier home in 2000, the property looked very different. ""It was basically a brick veneer house, a fairly standard house … nothing special about it,"" Mr Richardson said. Two decades after settling into the property, Mr Richardson is still tinkering away, turning it into a truly special, sustainable sanctuary. ""I've always admired people who have been self-sufficient in their living,"" he said. ""Like, I suppose, in the hippie days. ""I like the idea that you could actually live by yourself … and without impacting the environment too much,"" Mr Richardson said. For decades, Mr Richardson has been a strong advocate for sustainable living. The eco-whiz was involved in the Mount Gambier organisation Community Action for Sustainability for many years, although the 70-year-old has now taken a step back. ""That was all about encouraging others to be more sustainable, and to try [to] encourage the adoption of sustainable practices by the community and by governments,"" Mr Richardson said. ""I mean, my son, who lives in Townsville, is a builder and building designer ""I'm constantly trying to persuade him to design buildings that are more sustainable and suited to the environment,"" he said. In a world of fast fashion and fast food, the Mount Gambier couple are proud to be living at a slower pace. When the pandemic hit, Mr Richardson saw it as an opportunity to take on some new ""COVID projects"", including creating a concrete-reinforced preserves cellar. ""We have a large orchard and quite a large veggie garden, so we've always got surplus produce,"" he said. ""I'd always thought that every house in Australia should have a cellar … it's a great way to keep things cool and in a nice, dark environment, which is good for preserving,"" Mr Richardson said. The cellar helps the couple cut down on food waste, while a passion for purchasing secondhand equipment and materials keeps the costs down and brings new life to old discarded items. ""Don't tell my wife, but I love going to clearance sales,"" Mr Richardson said. ""So, if I buy something, it usually ends up in the workshop with a few modifications. ""It really is better than the original in many cases."" His most recent ""COVID project"" sits proudly in the backyard of the home: A treehouse for the grandkids, made of almost entirely used materials. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC South East SA's weekly email newsletter. However, Mr Richardson insists it does not take much to make a home more environmentally friendly. ""LED lighting is another obvious one, they've come down in price quite dramatically,"" he said. ""These sorts of things are making it easier and more affordable for people … to adopt. ""A lot of people are very aware now about the issues of climate change and they, hopefully, believe that they need to take action, not just governments.""

396,Wildlife Photographer of the Year entries tell a story of life under pressure,environment,"  Wildlife Photographer of the Year highly commended images tell a story of life under pressure It's a story of life under pressure. That's the tale told in thousands of images submitted to the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition, according to UK Natural History Museum director Doug Gurr. The competition, developed and produced by the Natural History Museum, London, received more than 50,000 entries from photographers in 95 countries for this year. Organisers have released a selection of highly commended images that Dr Gurr said highlight the urgent environmental challenges the world faces. One example is an image of water in a Romanian valley turned a vibrant orange and blue as a result of heavy metals from mining.

397,Animals prepare for 'sugar fix' as Fraser Island's fire recovery continues,environment,"  Animals prepare for 'sugar fix' as Fraser Island (K'gari) recovers from bushfire There are more encouraging signs on Fraser Island (K'gari) as hundreds of grass trees begin to bloom after last year's devastating fires. More than 87,000 hectares of land on the World Heritage-listed island burned for two months before heavy rain helped douse the flames. There were concerns about how the bushfires would affect the island's flora, but as spring approaches positive signs have sprouted. Tour guide and photographer Peter Meyer, who has been watching the recovery, said the grass trees ""seem to like fire"". ""They are certainly the first plant to come back after fire."" Each spring, an annual bloom boom provides a sweet feast for island wildlife as hundreds of grass trees (Xanthorrhoea sp.) fill with nectar-rich flowers. Mr Meyer, who has lived on Fraser Island (K'gari) for 26 years, said he had observed the spear-like flower stems starting to emerge from the charred plants. ""Generally, the season after the fire, they all produce a flower spike and every nectar-feeding organism turns up to get their sugar fix,"" he said. Some of the plants, which grow at a rate of about 2 centimetres a year, stand up to 3 metres in height in the island's forests. Mr Meyer said the blooms were emerging en masse around the island. ""Right now, you can drive for hours and see grass trees flowering everywhere,"" he said. ""It's a compound flower-head, so it looks like a coral polyp. ""It looks like hundreds of coral polyps on a spear and each one has a little dollop of nectar."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Wide Bay's weekly email newsletter. The grass tree bloom plays an important role in feeding the island's animals. At night bats and sugar gliders dine out, while during the daylight hours honeyeaters and rainbow lorikeets feed from the spikes. Mr Meyer said he had even seen the abdomen of ants swell from gorging on the grass trees. ""We have this one type of ant called spider ants. ""Their abdomen is usually thin and black, and they swell like a honey ant. ""There is just a vast amount of sugar in these plants."" Mr Meyer said the new growth showed how resilient Australia flora was. ""Australia is a tough place to live, it's either on fire, underwater or in a drought,"" he said. ""Anything that is surviving now has been for a long time and has strategies and they are tough. ""Grass trees, wattles, eucalyptus and banksia are certainly the ones coming back and dominating.""

398,Beloved dolphin's death sparks probe into declining Port River population,environment,"  Probe into poor health of Adelaide's Port River dolphins amid 'worrying' population decline An investigation has begun into the declining health of Adelaide's Port River dolphins after a trick-turning male was found dead and two of his friends went missing. After showing signs of emaciation and poor skin health, a 12-year-old dolphin known as Talulla — renowned for tail walking across the surface of the water — was found dead in the Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary (ADS) on the weekend. Two other Port River dolphins, Twinkle and Doc, are missing after presenting similar symptoms and are now presumed dead. SA Department for Environment and Water (DEW) Minister David Speirs said he had ordered an investigation into the failing health of dolphins in the sanctuary. ""The loss of any dolphin in the ADS is an unfortunate and sad occurrence,"" he said. ""Given recent events, it is important that we take a closer look and we hope to learn more about the possible causes of death of the dolphins through necropsy [animal autopsy] procedures and further testing."" Mr Speirs said the SA Museum was assessing the recent dolphin deaths and undertaking additional testing. The 118 square kilometre dolphin sanctuary encompasses the Port River and adjacent Barker Inlet, and stretches north into the Gulf of St Vincent to the Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary. The Port River dolphins once numbered in their 40s, with about 30 remaining almost entirely in the river area, but in recent times the main river population has declined to about 10, with a further 10 coming and going from the gulf. Whale and Dolphin Conservation volunteer and ADS researcher Marianna Boorman said she was deeply concerned about the dwindling population. ""We've had some terrible years with a number of calves dying,"" she said. ""We've lost 10 young calves and eight adult females in the past four years, so that's very worrying and, in that time, there's only been three new calves that have survived."" Ms Boorman said boat strikes, fishing line entanglements and shark attacks were constant threats to the dolphins, but the reason behind the recent deaths was unknown, which made it ""very worrying"". ""It's certainly possible that pollution is causing the calves to pass away, but whether the pollution is being passed on in the mother's milk, we don't know enough about that,"" she said. She said the deaths could also be due to a virus, and if that was the case, ""there's not much we can do"". ""And all three dolphins [Talulla, Doc and Twinkle] were scavenging and picking up discarded scraps of fish, which was very concerning behaviour,"" Ms Boorman said. A SA Museum spokeswoman said the post-mortem on Talulla would be undertaken this week, but an investigation into the cause of his death could take up to six weeks to finalise. ""Once the post-mortem has been completed, the museum will work with DEW and the University of Adelaide to analyse the findings and a report will be publicly available at this time,"" the spokeswoman said. Ms Boorman was also concerned that the leaking of hypersaline water at St Kilda, where it has killed mangroves and salt marsh, could be linked to the dolphins' failing health because Talulla, Doc and Twinkle were known to spend a lot of time in the adjacent Barker Inlet. Mr Speirs said consideration would be given to ""inform further areas which may require investigation"". ""DEW will lead the investigation and will be seeking input from a dolphin expert reference group which is made up of independent, qualified veterinarians and experts with experience in the management of marine mammals, as well as researchers and other relevant government departments,"" he said. In 2019, a dolphin named Star died after becoming tangled in fishing line and having hooks in its throat for nearly three weeks. Another dolphin, Marianna — named after Ms Boorman — was found dead in October last year, with a necropsy revealing he had most likely died due to blunt force trauma caused by a boat strike. Doc himself had to be rescued from an entanglement just three days before he was last seen alive on July 27. Ms Boorman said Doc started exhibiting ill-health symptoms in October last year and appeared to improve slightly before deteriorating again. She said Talulla and Twinkle started showing symptoms about three weeks before they were last seen alive  on July 7. ""It is very fortunate that Talulla's body was able to be collected [for necropsy] because Doc's and Twinkle's bodies disappeared, so we sort of had no answers,"" Ms Boorman said. Many male dolphins in the ADS, such as Talulla, Twinkle and Marianna, have female names because it can take enthusiasts years to learn that a dolphin who might have originally appeared female was actually male. Ms Boorman said Talulla learnt how to tail walk from his mother, Wave, who was among other dolphins that learnt the skill from another dolphin, Billy. Billy had returned to the Port River after being released from Marineland, a West Beach aquarium and wildlife park that closed in 1988. ""Talulla's mum, Wave, used to do it regularly, and then Talulla started copying the behaviour, so it's an amazing site to see and certainly spectacular when you see a dolphin walking backwards on its tail,"" Ms Boorman said. ""We also knew Twinkle very well because we had to rescue him four times due to entanglements, and Doc was regularly seen playing around and people were able to watch them from the land at Garden Island. ""They brought so much joy to so many people, they are unique and special and we've certainly got to be doing what we can."" In 2019, the state government reduced boating speed limits in key areas of the ADS, from unlimited speed to seven knots, and it is illegal to feed dolphins or discard fish litter in SA waters.

399,NT Senator wants Labor to rethink its position on $50m Beetaloo grants program,environment,"  NT Senator announces opposition to Coalition's $50 million Beetaloo fracking grants program Northern Territory Senator Malarndirri McCarthy says she is concerned by the ""questionable"" process behind the awarding of public grants to gas companies in the Beetaloo Basin and has urged her Labor colleagues to rethink their stance on the federal government program. Senator McCarthy wanted her party to vote with the Greens against a $50 million grants program A senate inquiry has examined the links between grant recipients and government ministers Coalition senators have dismissed the inquiry's concerns as 'overtly political' Senator McCarthy, a Yanyuwa woman and declared traditional owner from near Boroloola, said she was concerned public funding was being given ""when parts of the grants process remain questionable and not transparent."" The $50 million grants program, announced in December 2020, aims to expedite gas exploration in the Northern Territory's Beetaloo Basin. So far, $21 million in grants has been awarded to Imperial Oil and Gas to support three exploration wells that Resources and Water Minister Keith Pitt said would ""create thousands of jobs"". This week the Greens had proposed a disallowance motion in the Senate which, if passed, would block the grants program. It is scheduled to be considered today. Senator McCarthy asked her Labor colleagues to vote with the Greens against the grants program, but Labor's Caucus has decided to vote with the government. ""I urged the Caucus to rethink its position and vote against allowing $50 million in public funding being given,"" Senator McCarthy said. ""Of concern is the decision to award grants on a first-come first-served basis rather than a merit-based process, particularly when the only company approved for funding has extensive connections to the Liberal Party,"" she said. The Beetaloo grants program is currently the subject of an inquiry by the Senate's environment committee. The inquiry released its interim report on Tuesday, and recommended an immediate review into ""perceived conflicts of interests"" between grant applicants, the Liberal Party and two federal government ministers. The 11-person committee overseeing the inquiry, chaired by Greens Senator Sarah Hanson Young, has a Labor majority. Seven Labor members sit on the committee, including Senator McCarthy, The inquiry heard evidence representatives of Empire Energy, the parent company of Imperial Oil and Gas, met with Energy Minister Angus Taylor on two separate occasions before Imperial was awarded the $21 million grants in July. Mr Pitt, not Mr Taylor, is the decision-maker under the scheme. The inquiry heard evidence Empire Energy paid $4,500 to attend a Country Liberal Party fundraising event in Darwin in October 2020 with Mr Taylor. It also heard Empire Energy representatives then flew on a charter plane with Mr Taylor to visit Empire Energy's Beetaloo site. Mr Taylor's register of interests declared ""a return charter flight and hospitality with Empire Energy"". The inquiry also heard evidence the grant program was not merit-based but ""first-in first-served."" ""These meetings and the close ministerial relationship appear to have provided Empire Energy with a crucial advantage in early lodgement of its application and as a result, its wholly-owned subsidiary has been the only entity to have so far received approval for grant funding,"" the interim report said. During the inquiry, Empire Energy rejected suggestions it had tried to lobby the minister by taking him on a charter flight. ""We wanted to show him the activities we were carrying out in the Beetaloo,"" Empire Energy CEO Alex Underwood told the committee. ""It is on the public record that the government is following this gas-fired recovery strategy, and we wanted to show that we are working hard to lead the development of this basin."" The company also said the funding would create economic benefits for local businesses and traditional owners. The two Coalition senators that sit on the inquiry, which includes Northern Territory Country Liberal Senator Sam McMahon, dismissed the interim report, labelling it ""political"". Developing the Beetaloo Basin gas resource could threaten Australia's ability to meet its Paris targets, according to internal government emails obtained by Background Briefing. ""[The report] is characterised by overtly political and ideological selection of evidence, resulting in biased conclusions and recommendations being made on the basis of unfounded imputations,"" they wrote. They also dismissed the concerns about the relationship between Empire Energy and Mr Taylor and said it was common for mining companies who operate in remote areas to provide transport for stakeholders. ""Coalition senators note that Minister Taylor is not the decision-maker for grants under the Program and that he made appropriate declarations of interest regarding the visit to the Beetaloo with Empire,"" it said.

400,"When a dead whale washes up, it's like the beach has won the lottery",environment," Science When a whale dies it becomes a stinky feast for sharks, tiny shore animals — and scientists Earlier this week, a dead whale surrounded by hungry sharks washed up into Adelaide's port. South Australian authorities are still deciding about what to do with the carcass, but in the meantime scientists have taken samples for research. Originally thought to be a humpback whale, the identity of the carcass is still a mystery, but at this time of year there are plenty of whales near the Australian coast. Currently, southern right whales are breeding in the warmer waters of the Great Australian Bight before travelling back to Antarctica. Humpback whales are also about to start their annual migration down the east and west coasts of Australia from calving grounds in the tropics. Most whales will make it from their breeding grounds back to their summer destination south of Australia, but sometimes a whale will perish along the way. We're more likely to see carcasses wash up when whales are travelling closer to the coast, says shark and whale scientist James Tucker. “Stranding will increase along migration routes due to recovering populations [after whaling],” Dr Tucker says. They can also collide with ships. The poor condition of the whale carcass that washed up in South Australia suggests it was likely hit in international waters and carried on the bow of the ship for some distance, according to a spokesperson for South Australia's Department for Environment and Water. ""Whale deaths and carcasses are an unusual occurrence in South Australian waters; however, this is not an uncommon incident globally. ""Whales can be hit by large ocean-going vessels and then carried on the bow of ships until they reach their harbour destination."" Although it's a gory sight, a dead whale offers the feast of a lifetime for sea creatures — and scientists. From flying drones over sharks feasting on bloated carcasses, to analysing the chemicals whales leak when they are buried in the sand, Dr Tucker has been up close and personal with whale remains as they are nibbled and chomped to oblivion by a long guest list of marine diners in the sea and on the shore. ""It's like the beach has won the lottery,"" Dr Tucker says. ""It's a huge amount of food and nutrients in a relatively barren environment."" But leaving a whale to decompose on a beach can become a stinky, shark-attracting and sometimes explosive problem. Just how the rotting carcass is dealt with has consequences for us and the myriad of creatures that depend upon its wealth of energy and nutrients. Sharks are one of the first animals to arrive at the buffet when a whale dies at sea. A whale's skin and blubber is so tough that Dr Tucker always has someone on hand to continuously sharpen his knives when he is dissecting a dead animal. While this blunting flesh might be daunting to some, sharks come prepared. ""[Tiger sharks] can move their top jaw separately from the bottom jaw, and they saw back and forth through the blubber, which is amazing,"" he says. From his drone footage, Dr Tucker has found that bull sharks, tiger sharks and white sharks are the heavy hitters at the dead whale buffet. Smaller shark species will take a bite, but it is a shark-eat-shark world out there so ""when those big boys come in, the smaller sharks tend to disperse pretty quickly,"" he says. ""The more we understand about large predators, the more we understand how much of a role scavenging plays in their diets."" All this feasting gets messy. ""As sharks munch away on [a whale], they tear off sections, so a lot of stuff will float off and become food for smaller organisms,"" Dr Tucker says. The sharks create holes in the blubber, allowing smaller animals, such as seabirds, to get at the flesh beneath. These birds will perch themselves on the floating, gas-filled carcass and peck away at their gory life raft. In most cases, the sharks will eventually burst the carcass and the whale will sink to the deep-sea floor, becoming a ""whale fall"". In the depths, a hyper-specialised group of scavengers will pick over it for decades. However, in some cases, winds or ocean currents will drive the carcass into shore before it sinks. It is then met in the shallows by a host of new creatures ready to take a bite. As the carcass drifts into shore, large terrestrial scavengers descend: scientists. ""You have the scavengers coming in, but you also have the researchers; all these specimens [they collect] are feeding into their research projects,"" says Sandy Ingleby who is the collection manager of mammals at the Australian Museum. ""The specimens are like little time capsules. They are physical embodiments of the conditions in the environment at the time they were collected. ""For the next 100 years or more, people can come and use these samples for their research."" With sharks circling, scientists need to get inventive to score their samples safely. To get blubber specimens from a fin whale carcass floating in a bay in New South Wales in 2018,  one of Dr Ingleby's colleagues enlisted a pole-mounted saw normally used for lopping trees. ""He leant out [from the rocks] with his colleagues holding him so he wouldn't fall in,"" she says. It's not only scientists who sniff out the boon offered by a carcass, explains Shane Ahyong, an invertebrate expert at the Australian Museum and University of New South Wales. ""There's what is called a scavenging guild, and they are like your clean-up team,"" Professor Ahyong says. This cluster of hungry creatures includes crabs, fish, worms and a host of small crustaceans called isopods and amphipods. ""They will turn up and start shredding and stripping anything they find; its gruesome, but it's quite amazing."" If you have ever dug your hands into the sand at the beach and been greeted by hopping sand-coloured creatures, you have met amphipods. ""Sometimes they're called sand hoppers, or sand fleas,"" he says. ""The ones that are slater-like are isopods; you don't often see them, but if you throw a bit of dead meat in the water, they will show up. ""The other big component of the scavengers are the beach worms, and they come and attack from below."" Eventually waves push the carcass onto the beach and above the tide line, where a new group of scavengers will greet the increasingly putrid feast. Diners include ghost crabs, rove beetles, flies, more birds and in some areas, goannas. ""The ghost crabs are big enough to start picking at things and the rove beetles get into small gaps and can find their way into almost anything,"" Professor Ahyong says. It's at this stage scientists return, sometimes taking more than the lion's share. ""[The museum] usually end up getting something from each [carcass],"" Dr Ingleby says. ""Usually the skull, sometimes a flipper or a foetus."" Occasionally. Dr Ingleby and her team will take an entire carcass and compost it in a secret bushland location. After composting, the skeleton will be ready for display at the museum. But most carcasses are not destined for display or analysis. Leaving a whale carcass on the beach to decompose has the benefit of continuing to nourish the surroundings. But as the carcass breaks down, it oozes a decomposition product called leachate. If this gets into water, it may lure sharks. This raises the question of how to dispose of the whale. ""If it's in a location with very little foot traffic, where there are not many water users and the risk to people is low, I'm always going to recommend the most natural option,"" Dr Tucker says. While leaving a whale to rot benefits the beach, carcasses are often removed by being towed back out to sea, buried or chopped up and taken to the tip. Dr Tucker says towing rarely happens because the floating carcass can become ""navigational hazards"" to boats. Beach burials take care of the smell and the sight of decaying whale, but there are concerns this method could attract sharks to the beach. However, research by Dr Tucker suggests this method can be safe if the whale is buried in the dunes far away from streams or ground water. ""It's a natural option, and if it's done correctly it takes away most of the risk, but it still allows that nutrient to be on the beach."" The last option — being chopped up and taken to the tip – removes any risk of attracting sharks. But does removing a whale carcass unbalance the ecology of a beach? In the deep sea, intricate and specific ecosystems spring up around whale falls. If whales no longer rained from above, these species would likely go extinct. This is not true for the animals that flock to a dead whale at the beach, Professor Ahyong says. Beach scavengers tend to be generalists, having evolved to take advantage of whatever turns up, he explains. While whale carcasses ""provide a huge energy input"" for these scavengers, Professor Ahyong says sandy beaches are facing a host of threats more serious than removal of a single animal. These threats include development, pollution, runoff from cities and beach grooming. Beach grooming involves removing (for aesthetic purposes) all the seaweed and dead animals that have washed up onto the beach,  thereby removing the food source for all the scavenging denizens. ""It's a way of starving the beach,"" he says. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

401,The tortoise and the tern: How a tiny bird got chased down by the world's slowest predator,environment," Science Giant tortoise filmed hunting and eating tern chick. Yes, it's as slow as you'd imagine With one foot propped on a decaying log, a lumbering giant tortoise drags itself towards its next meal. But it's not the tortoises's usual fare. Caught on camera for the first time, in the woodlands of Frégate Island in the Seychelles, this giant tortoise has its eye on a noddy tern chick that has fallen from its nest. The dark-bodied, white-capped chick flaps its wings in futile display as the tortoise approaches slowly, but deliberately. Make sure you've got a cuppa before watching what could be the world's slowest hunt. Eventually, the tortoise opens wide its beak and snaps at the chick, which teeters out of reach and continues to flip-flop along the log. Eventually there's no log left to traverse, and the tern chick wobbles on the spot as the tortoise slogs across the 10 centimetres between them. All the chick has to do is make a dismount and waddle away. Instead, the chick topples forward ever so slightly in the direction of the tortoises' outstretched mouth. At this climatic moment, a section of log crumbles under the weight of the huge reptile. The tortoise drops directly onto the chick, biting its head. What happens next isn't in the video: the tortoise climbs down and swallows the bird whole. The pursuit and meal has taken seven minutes. An eyewitness account of the hunt is described in the journal Current Biology today. Anna Zora, Frégate Island's deputy conservation and sustainability manager, starting filming when she noticed the tortoise was acting ""strangely"". ""It wasn't just roaming around and feeding, but it was looking at this chick, and pointing at it,"" she says in a video published with the study. ""It started going toward the chick, and it was really at that point that I said we should stop and look at what's happening."" People have seen tortoises eat dead birds before, but this is the first time a tortoise hunting a bird has ever been caught on camera, according to study co-author Justin Gerlach of the University of Cambridge. ""When [Anna] sent the video I was amazed at what I was watching,"" Dr Gerlach said, conceding he was also slightly horrified. ""There's no doubt at all; it's deliberate hunting in order to kill and eat the bird."" Short answer: protein. Herbivores will often take a bite of any meat they come across for the extra protein and different minerals, Dr Gerlach said. A podcast that opens a window on the beautiful sounds of the Australian wilderness. But often that's in the form of carrion, so why the live bird? ""Presumably the tortoises found the tern colony a good source of protein: dead birds, dropped fish etc, and have then learned that they can also eat live flightless chicks,"" he said. ""Does it provide an important part of their nutrition or is it just a rare tasty snack?"" Herbivores are often limited by their diet when it comes to getting enough minerals, according to reptile ecologist Arthur Georges from the University of Canberra, who was not involved in the study. ""It takes quite a bit of energy to extract the necessary resources from a vegetarian diet, particularly if you're trying to build egg shells or you're trying to deposit yolk,"" Professor Georges said. So a meaty snack every now and then is a real windfall of nutrients, which lots of animals will take advantage of. ""Freshwater turtles that are primarily herbivorous will really fall on carrion,"" Professor Georges said. ""If something dies in the water, they'll be all over it, even though they're herbivores, because they're getting that windfall benefit. ""And it's an opportunity for evolution, too, because you can see if they get a great benefit from it, they get an advantage over their fellow tortoises. ""Then it's an opportunity for them to evolve into carnivores over millions of years."" We don't know. According to the researchers it's first time it's been captured on camera, but it may be more common. Tortoises will aggressively snap at each other in conflict and their sharp, horny beaks have no trouble slicing through a bird. Professor Georges wonders if the tortoise learned this hunting trick from watching another of its species stalk a bird. ""If one of them starts [hunting birds], do the others get into it as well?"" he said. Dr Gerlach also wondered if this was a learned behaviour. ""Seychelles giant tortoises are much more sociable and complex than most people think,"" he said. He said even if it had escaped the tortoise, the noddy tern chick would never have survived outside of its nest. ""I have to admit I'm on team tortoise, but objectively the chick was doomed anyway,"" he said. ""If it wasn't the tortoise, a lizard, a crab or a snake would have killed it in the night.""

402,A tale of two rooftops: Study finds solar panels on green roof more efficient ,environment,"  Study finds green roofs make solar panels more efficient Two identical office buildings side by side in Sydney's Barangaroo provided a perfect opportunity for solar energy researchers to test a long-held hunch. Would surrounding rooftop solar panels with green plants make them more efficient? The answer, as it turned out, was yes. The study was led by Peter Irga from the University of Technology Sydney and funded by the City of Sydney Council. ""For the first time we had the opportunity to compare these two buildings against each other,"" Dr Irga said. On top of one of the buildings was a conventional photovoltaic solar system. On the other, researchers surrounded the solar panels with plants and foliage. They then compared how much energy the two solar systems produced over an eight-month period. What they found was that the ""green roof"" improved performance by as much as 20 per cent at peak times and by 3.6 per cent over the length of the experiment. Dr Irga said that solar panels actually worked better when they were not too hot. ""We are blessed in Australia to have so much sunlight but temperatures above 25 degrees make photovoltaic panels less efficient,"" he said. Jock Gammon is the co-founder of Junglefy, the company that installed the green roof. ""We had heard of anecdotal evidence there was improved performance but we have seen up to 3.6 per cent increase in solar panel output,"" he said. ""Now that doesn't sound like a lot but with solar panels at the moment to even get a one or two per cent increase is a big deal."" Over eight months the green roof generated an additional 9.5 MWh or $2,595 worth of renewable energy. The extra energy could be sold back to the grid resulting in a cost saving for the building. Lucy Sharman, sustainability manager for Lendlease, which owns the building said the study proved ""something that's been a bit of theory for a while"". ""As the results started to come through about how much more efficient the solar panels were, how much cooler this roof was that was really exciting."" On hot days, the surface temperature on the green roof was up to 20C lower compared with the roof with no plants. Mr Gammon said green roofs had a role to play in future-proofing cities against the damaging effects of climate change. ""If we're able to keep our hard surfaces non-absorbent, they're not releasing that heat back into the air at night and we're not then having to use a lot more electricity to reduce those temperatures."" As well as cooling the building, the green roof absorbed almost nine tonnes of greenhouse gases. During storms,  the plants soaked up heavy rain, reducing the amount of storm water run-off and decreasing the risk of flash flooding. ""We're looking at 600 litres per second sequestered into the green roof as opposed to going into the system,"" Dr Irga said. For those involved in the study, one of the most exciting outcomes was the increase in biodiversity in the heart of the city. In just a few months, the rooftop has attracted a wide range of insects, birds and native bees. ""Very quickly the wildlife up here was amazing,"" Ms Sharman said. ""That's the thing that's been most positive. Even a small amount of green space can make actually quite a significant difference."" Researchers said they even found evidence that predatory birds were using the rooftop. ""To attract any animals that high up in the middle of the CBD is quite astounding,"" Dr Irga said. In the cities of the future, green roofs could also provide valuable outdoor space for humans. ""Particularly in the middle of lockdown, we are really craving green and open spaces and there are lots of little nooks and crannies in cities that are not being used,"" Ms Sharman said.

Although preceded by Australian mining giant BHP in the petroleum game, Woodside rose to become the local champion of an industry that fuelled much of the world's economic activity. Such was Woodside's financial and political importance in Australia, in 2001 the then treasurer Peter Costello famously torpedoed a takeover bid by Royal Dutch Shell on national interest grounds. But as the ground shifted underneath the fossil fuel industry in recent years and investors began spurning fossil fuels, a little-acknowledged reality began dawning on observers. Woodside was — without the successful execution of a last-gasp LNG development — seemingly a company without much of a future. That was until this week when news of a proposed tie-up between Woodside and the oil and gas arm of mining giant BHP led analysts to say the company now had a path forward. The deal would involve the merger of the two businesses in a transaction valued at $41 billion. Crucially, Graeme Bethune from consultancy EnergyQuest said the agreement would pave the way for the planned $US12 billion Scarborough LNG development off Western Australia's north-west coast. Doubts had been growing about whether Scarborough would go ahead given BHP owns 26.5 per cent of the project and had been tight-lipped about when or whether it would commit to a final investment decision. Mr Bethune said the proposed new Woodside would own 100 per cent of the project and have few qualms about proceeding. ""Getting other joint venture partners across the line on major investment decisions is always tough,"" Mr Bethune said. ""So, certainly, Woodside having 100 per cent of Scarborough will make it much easier to go ahead with the project."" As part of the deal, Woodside will acquire what Mr Bethune said was a raft of high-performing oil and gas assets around the world including some in the Gulf of Mexico. He said these assets were ""major generators of cash"" and would significantly boost Woodside's financial firepower. However, Mr Bethune said that, while Woodside would roughly double in size thanks to the BHP deal, the window of opportunity for big new ""greenfield"" oil and gas developments was closing. Provided Scarborough went ahead, Mr Bethune said, it could be the last major LNG project of its kind developed in Australia. ""The cheapest kinds of expansions in LNG are brownfield projects, either incremental expansions of existing projects and backfilling them too,"" he said. ""I don't think we should be in a search for brand new projects. ""I think we've got a good basis for incremental expansion of our existing projects."" Recent uncertainty about the fate of Scarborough stands in contrast to the record of the gas industry over the past 15 years, when $300 billion was spent on giant new projects around the country. Alison George, head of research at responsible investment firm Regnan, said concerns about the oil and gas industry's carbon emissions were making it much harder for new projects to go ahead. Ms George said such concerns might have ensnared Scarborough but the BHP merger would ""clear a path"" and buy Woodside ""time and money"" to figure out a life beyond fossil fuels. She noted Woodside itself had identified hydrogen and ammonia as other options to pursue as the world shifted towards net-zero emissions. ""The existing fields Woodside operates were starting to decline and had an outlook of decline,"" Ms George said. ""So, they were really looking for what were the next assets they could develop that were going to continue to let them operate the infrastructure they have. ""The pathway to that was narrower. There were fewer choices for that. ""Now, with this much more diversified asset base, there are many more opportunities."" According to Ms George, the BHP deal clarified Woodside's position as an oil and gas ""pure play"" while elevating it to a league among the world's biggest producers. Ms George noted this could make it easier for Woodside to attract money from overseas investors but there were potential downsides as well. She said that, by becoming a major oil and gas player internationally, Woodside ""may be sticking its head above the parapet"" regarding its environmental performance. ""With the scale that it's bringing to Woodside, it's going to bring it to the attention of a lot of investors who may not have necessarily paid attention in the past,"" she said. ""It's also going to bring it to the attention of climate activists in a new way. ""So, while Woodside has certainly heard strongly from its local institutional shareholder base on the climate transition in recent years, I think this move may well make that more intense and those conversations more diverse globally."" This week, Woodside's chief executive, Meg O'Neill, said the deal — which would be paid for by issuing scrip to BHP shareholders — took account of BHP's liabilities for decommissioning declining assets in places such as Bass Strait and Western Australia. Ms O'Neill said the fact Woodside was not assuming any debt as part of the deal also meant it would be well placed to chase ""low carbon opportunities"" in the future.

405,Officials rejected offer to waterbomb Fraser Island days into devastating bushfire. Internal emails reveal why,environment,"  Queensland Parks and Wildlife initially rejected QFES waterbombing offer for Fraser Island bushfire, documents reveal A Queensland parks agency rejected an initial offer to waterbomb a bushfire on a world heritage-listed island after a senior official deemed the blaze was ""not that bad"" and people were ""wishing to indulge their profession"". Internal emails, obtained by the ABC under Right to Information, revealed two weeks after waterbombing efforts began on Fraser Island (K'gari), another senior Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) bureaucrat wrote ""we are probably burning more $$$ than anything else"". The bushfire scorched about 85,000 hectares — more than half of the island — threatened townships and culturally significant areas, and made international headlines. Sparked by an illegal campfire on October 14, the fire burned until mid-December when heavy rain doused the flames. A review of the bushfire showed Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) had proposed early on to waterbomb the blaze, but QPWS declined the offer for several reasons. These included discussions ""about no threat to life and property"" and concerns about the ""ability to extinguish the fire in a remote location"". Internal emails released to the ABC shed further light on the discussions inside QPWS at that time. On October 18, four days after the blaze started, as the bushfire burned near the township of Orchid Beach, a principal ranger emailed a Queensland Parks official stating that QFES was ""wanting us to consider the use of waterbombing fixed wing aircraft (salt capable)"". ""I said I would run this past you to gauge Exec thoughts re: cost/environment/cultural issues,"" he wrote. “I’m not sure that we need this level of resource given the good preparatory work around Orchid Beach township but … QFES have flagged concern about ember attack of Orchid Beach township. ""… our line could be, we don't believe it is required but … happy for QFES to engage (and fund) as backup"". Three hours later, the regional director of Coastal and Islands replied and looped in other officials, saying he thought waterbombing with salt water ""should be reserved for a critical situation, which we aren't at yet"". ""I know there have been concerns raise previously with salt impacts on vegetation but I'm not sure how much of an issue this actually is,"" he said. “As previously mentioned, I’m happy to look at options but would need to know costs … and have some level of certainty of its effectiveness…” Discussions continued, culminating in an email from Damien Head, a QPWS executive, to then assistant director-general Neil Cambourn. ""I am not supportive of waterbombing mainly because you won't put it out in the swamp,"" Mr Head wrote. ""And if you could, well the fire isn’t that bad to warrant such action. I feel this is a case of people wishing to indulge their profession. Aka 'do something'. ""There is only another 36 hours of northerly before the southerly kicks in again and pushes the fire back on itself all away from Orchid Beach"". Backburning started within the first week of the fire igniting. As the intensity of the blaze increased, waterbombing operations began on November 9 but it was not enough to contain it. The IGEM report, released in May, said QFES advised that aircraft alone could not extinguish fires and rather, are used as part of a suite of response capabilities. In response to media interview requests on November 23, Mr Cambourn told colleagues the fire was ""not doing anything that's even remotely newsworthy from one part of the day to the next"". ""There really is no news other than what we have provided already day in day out – yes it's a fire, there's smoke, it's travelled 50km, it's in remote areas of the island, nothing is at risk, and we are using water bombers to try to suppress it,"" he wrote in the email. “The large [water] bomber costs us about $12k an hour, so we are probably burning more $$$ than anything else.” Four days later, on November 27, QFES took control of the incident due to the ""escalating potential threat to life and property"". Fraser Coast Mayor George Seymour believed control should have been handed over far earlier. ""It should have been handed over well before physical assets were in danger,"" he said. ""K'gari Fraser Island is not heritage listed for its built assets, it's heritage listed for the environmental and cultural significance. ""We need to make sure this never happens again."" General manager of the Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation Veronica Bird said it was ""absolutely devastating"" for traditional owners that half the island burned. ""It's difficult to understand the reasons why, why did it get to that point?"" She said. ""We were the same as everybody else as to wanting to know the reasons why it was taking so long."" The IGEM report found arrangements between QPWS and QFES over cost sharing and use of firefighting assets “was the source of some confusion”. It noted QPWS bushfire operations could benefit from a review of protocol and “pre-determined” financial delegations and approvals for incident controllers. Happy Valley Rural Fire Brigade sector commander Winston Williams, who has had a property on the island for 36 years, said Fraser Island was a ""very unique place"" and fires could react differently due to the landscape, weather conditions and vegetation types. ""The dunal structure allows the fire to be like 'fingers of fire,' rather than just a fire front,"" he said. ""The problem with Fraser Island is also accessibility"". He said hazard reduction burning should have no requirement for air operations, but if fires become uncontrollable then aerial support should be requested immediately to support ground crew for containment. ""I would belt everything at it ASAP,"" he said. He said authorities took the fire seriously enough, but didn't manage it effectively. Shadow minister for Fire and Emergency Services Dale Last said what unfolded on the island was ""simply unbelievable"". ""To think that fire could have been extinguished in the early stages, and because of bureaucracy, because of egos, because people thought they knew better, that island burnt,"" he said. ""It is an absolute miracle that no one lost their lives as a consequence of that fire."" According to the IGEM report, several factors contributed to the fire spreading, including high temperatures, strong dry northerly winds, difficult terrain and limited access constrained by dry, loose sand tracks. In a statement, a Department of Environment and Science (DES) spokesman said the Inspector-General Emergency Management's report canvassed these matters earlier this year and the state government supported all 38 recommendations. The spokesman said any fire was challenging and plans changed as information came to hand on weather conditions, vegetation type, and effectiveness of ground control efforts. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. ""This was particularly relevant as the trajectory and accessibility of the bushfire changed significantly throughout the two months of the fire,"" the statement said. ""The weather was the single most important aspect of how we managed this fire and despite every effort, both on the ground and in the air, this was a difficult fire to fight. ""Aerial waterbombing was an important aspect of the fight. ""At one time there were more than 30 aircraft in the air attempting to contain the fire on K'Gari. ""The decision to deploy, and the effectiveness, of waterbombing is dictated by the prevailing weather conditions, smoke presence, assets under risk and vegetation types."" Last month the state government secured a large air tanker for the next four bushfire seasons, which touches down this month. The DES spokesman said they had internally reviewed how QPWS handled all aspects of the fire and it was inappropriate to discuss individual staffing matters. The ABC also approached QFES for comment, with a spokesperson saying it would be inappropriate to comment on another agency's operations or management of an incident.

406,"Councils around Australia are going green, but will households pay the price?",environment,"  The councils leading the charge on climate change to reach net zero emissions by 2030 As the climate wars drag on at a federal level, local councils across the country are taking the initiative and doing it for themselves. Local governments, best known for the three ""Rs"" of roads, rates and rubbish, are adding a fourth ""R"" to the list – risk from climate change. More than 100 councils across the country have declared a climate emergency, while dozens more are investing in renewables and setting ambitious targets for cutting emissions. ""Our community has been telling us this for a long time, they want to take action on climate change,"" said Karen Vernon, the mayor of Victoria Park, a small local authority bordering Perth's Swan River. ""Everyone has to take action on climate change, and we've got to do it together. ""It can't just be left to one level of government."" In a video to ratepayers on the council's Facebook site, the mayor stands on the roof of the council's headquarters, surrounded by 250 solar panels, announcing a new climate emergency plan. ""This is a blueprint for how our council, as an organisation, will get to net zero emissions by 2030,"" Cr Vernon told the ABC. The battle is already well underway, not just to cut the council's footprint but to encourage residents to get onboard for the journey. The community is being urged to help double the town's ""tree canopy"" to cool down the streets at the height of summer, as well as capture carbon. The council has pledged to hit its target — as much as possible — by what's called ""direct action"" rather than relying on carbon offsets. Even for this small council, the predicted impacts of climate change – more extreme heat, bushfire and floods – are a major concern. ""We've got over six kilometres of Swan River frontage so it's really important that we manage that, because rising sea levels is another indicator of climate change,"" Cr Vernon said. A few kilometres up the road, at the City of Canning in Perth's southern suburbs, the council has teamed up with the operators of a data-driven app to educate residents on how to measure and reduce their emissions. Household emissions are said to make up around one-fifth of Australia's total. The City of Canning is one of 28 councils across Australia which have partnered with the app program, according to its founder Vanessa Rauland. ""The average footprint of a household is around 15 tonnes [of greenhouse gases],"" Ms Rauland said. ""But there are so many things you can do to reduce your emissions. The Dudney family are doing what they can to combat climate change — but the impact is limited compared to the power of businesses and government. ""I think it's super encouraging seeing how many councils are really stepping up and taking the lead on climate action."" It is nearly five years since Darebin City council in Melbourne became the first in the world to declare a climate emergency. Since then, Darebin has become certified as carbon neutral. This year,  it struck a deal to collaborate with 45 other Victorian councils to source all its power from wind energy. ""Effectively, it's the same as taking 90,000 cars off the road or about 45,000 houses off the fossil fuel grid,""  said Darebin councillor Trent McCarthy, who led the council to declare the climate emergency back in 2016. But not all climate-conscious councils are opting to join the emergency declaration movement. City of Canning mayor Patrick Hall said the council had been working behind the scenes to reach a target of net zero by 2030. ""We don't feel it's our role to be declaring a climate emergency, we let others work in that space,"" he said. The mayor said the local authority was already saving 350 tonnes of greenhouse gases per year through investing in solar at 12 of its council buildings, among other low-carbon projects. But Cr Hall said the council would need more support to meet the massive upfront costs of some of the measures, including changing nearly 9000 street lights around the suburbs to energy-efficient LED lamps. ""Now if we changed those over to LED, and we hope to do that at some stage, it would save us more than $400,000 a year by year 4,"" he said. ""It's an enormous saving — not only to the community, but for the environment — but we simply can't fund it by ourselves."" It is believed many councils — especially small, regional local authorities — will need significant financial help to become carbon neutral, without passing the cost on to ratepayers. The Australian Local Government Association wants a $200 million federal fund over four years to help more of the country's 537 councils adapt to climate change. Karen Vernon of the Town of Victoria Park said the council had estimated that it would cost around $8 million to become carbon neutral by 2030. ""I wouldn't like people to think that us addressing a climate emergency is something that only comes at a cost of higher rates,"" she said. ""I believe it doesn't have to…we just need to be innovative and agile about how we do it. ""As time goes by there will be new innovations that we can look to adopt that will hopefully drive even greater efficiencies in how we deliver our climate emergency plan."" As more councils set targets to lower their emissions, there is a push for greater leadership and support from the state and federal governments. Portia Odell is director of the Cities Power Partnership, a coalition of 147 councils nationwide who are committed to climate action. ""Councils would really like to see the federal government step up, implement strong climate policy and really super-charge local action, unlock funding and drive new investment,"" Ms Odell said. That investment would be money well spent according to Brad Pettitt, a WA Greens MP who was previously the mayor of Fremantle — a council that became carbon neutral a decade ago. ""We've seen local governments take the leadership on climate change in a way that state and federal governments can't, partly because local government is not mired in party politics,"" he said. ""It's actually about local communities getting on and doing things."" WA government agencies do offer grants to local councils for a range of climate action measures including tree planting, making street lighting more energy-efficient and reducing waste to landfill. But Mr Pettitt said both the state and federal governments needed to do far more by partnering with councils on clean energy projects. ""We've seen in Fremantle the investments in clean energy, we've actually seen our electricity costs come down so whilst there is that initial upfront cost, the pay back is really quick, just a number of years,"" he said. ""It brings down costs for ratepayers, reduces our carbon emissions, it's a win-win."" The West Australian Local Government Association (WALGA) says LGAs representing 93 per cent of the state's population have committed to taking at least one significant action to address climate change. ""There are two key hurdles local governments face,"" said WALGA president Tracey Roberts. ""[They are] lack of resources to take action — especially for small local governments in the regions — and lack of knowledge, skills and expertise to address the challenges of climate change."" Among many other initiatives, WALGA is lobbying for funding to plant 600,000 trees at a cost of $20 million.

407,Floating houses and green walls. Some councils are already adapting to climate change,environment,"  Climate change means more floods, fires and heatwaves. Some communities are already adapting Climate scientists have warned Australia that it must pick up the pace on its climate adaptation efforts. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, described as a ""code red"" for humanity, has forecast global warming will likely hit 1.5 degrees Celsius by about 2035 if nothing changes. However, Australia's land areas have already warmed by about 1.4C since 1910, according to the report. IPCC vice chairman and director of the Australian National University Climate Change Institute Mark Howden says adaptation needs a greater focus. ""We are actually heading towards this very, very quickly and we do really need to start thinking and considering ... action, not just in terms of emission reduction but also in terms of adaptation for those futures we can't avoid at this point."" The latest IPCC report does not make for particularly uplifting reading. But if you are keen to delve further into the details, it does say quite a bit about Australia. The IPCC defines adaptation as ""the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects"". The goal is to take steps to protect communities and reduce their vulnerability to the harmful effects of climate change. There is concern Australia is well behind in its efforts to adapt to the effects of more intense and frequent weather events, according to Sarah Boulter, associate professor in Climate Adaptation at the University of Tasmania. ""There's been a lot of discussion about where climate change is going and where our responsibilities lie in terms of mitigation and it has put a bit of a shadow over the ability to think clearly around adaptation,"" she says. There are signs of a shift though. ""In the past 12 to 18 months, there really has been, certainly at the federal level, a real effort to start changing that conversation,"" she says. Indeed the federal government is currently developing a new National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy ahead of the Glasgow Climate Summit, which begins in late October. But Professor Boulter says the IPCC report has made it clear that it's time to act. ""The longer time goes on, the harder it becomes to decide what it is we're going to do and how much work we have to do. ""So I think for Australia we are really at a critical point, we need to start getting on the ground and taking some action."" So who's thinking ahead and taking action? Across the country, there are many interesting and innovative approaches to adaptation already underway. Heavy rainfall, river floods and bushfires are projected to worsen across Australia. In March 2021, New South Wales experienced its worst flooding in six decades. On the NSW Mid North Coast, elderly residents at the Dunbogan Caravan Park were stranded by floodwaters rising faster and higher than expected. And in 2019 many of those residents, most of whom are vulnerable pensioners, were forced to evacuate as bushfires narrowly missed the caravan park. Owner Cicely Sylow has engaged an architect and engineers to design a unique fire-resistant floating home that could replace the current mobile buildings in the caravan park. ""We have really elderly people who don't want to be in homes that are 3 metres above the ground given the amount of stairs you would need to climb to get into your home every day,"" she says. ""So we are looking at a home that could be .... close to ground level that could respond to a flood event by floating ... and would be constructed with bushfire resistant materials and design."" James Davidson, from climate adaptation architectural firm JDA Co, is looking at ways to float the cheap, portable homes found in caravan parks that are not typically flood resilient. ""The idea is not to allow people to stay during a flood, they've got to evacuate — but if they do get caught, then hopefully they will be safe."" Davidson was inspired by floating portable homes on the Mississippi River in the US. ""It's been done before so it's not a totally crazy idea. We've just got to get the engineering right."" Innovative ideas like this can make a big difference, according to Professor Boulter. ""There's always that question of whether we should be living in certain places or not, but there are certainly some building design things that can be done to manage the risks from extreme events,"" she says. Brisbane Airport's second runway, which opened last year, was one of the largest aviation construction projects undertaken in Australia. Like most of the nation's airports, it is based on the coast and is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including sea level rise, storm surge, inundation and rising temperatures. Accordingly, the new runway was built 1.5 metres above the minimum regulatory requirements, channels were designed to reduce tidal flooding, and a seawall was constructed to buffer large waves. Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) project director Paul Coughlan, who oversaw the construction of the $1.1 billion second runway, says climate adaptation was incorporated into the design from the outset. ""For our board, climate change adaptation was a really critical requirement ...  I can't remember how many times I had to brief them and really convince them that their investment [was] a good investment,"" he says. Start each day with comprehensive coverage and analysis of national and international events, and hear interviews with the people who matter today — along with those who'll be making news tomorrow. Now BAC is assessing its older airport infrastructure, while the implementation of the climate adaptation work has attracted interest from other domestic and international airports. Professor Boulter says the design life of most transport infrastructure — airports, ports, roads, rail and bridges — will be impacted by climate change. ""If it was meant to last for 80 years, under increasing climate change it might only be fit for purpose for 60 years,"" she says. ""There's an economic problem then."" Climate change is making heatwaves longer, hotter and more likely. They are also becoming more dangerous. According to the Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA), heat stress kills more Australians than all other natural disasters combined. Climate activist Greta Thunberg says we can still avoid ""the worst consequences"" of climate change, but only if we treat it as ""a crisis"". For example, in the 2009 heatwave in South Australia and Victoria, 500 deaths during that period were attributed to heat stress. One of the key ways to counter the effects of climate change and make our cities more liveable as temperatures rise is through urban greening, says GBCA chief executive Davina Rooney. She points to studies in Western Sydney that show that having more trees in a street can lead to temperatures 10C lower. Professor Boulter agrees. She says finding new ways for urban areas to stay cool is a critical part of how we adapt to extreme temperatures. Queensland's Logan City, south of Brisbane, has been recognised for its urban greening efforts. They increased the city's tree canopy by 12 per cent, going from 41 per cent in 2016 to 53 per cent in 2020. Deputy Mayor Jon Raven says the city has made climate resilience a priority. ""The way the community sees that is by more tree canopy, more trees planted and having an environment which feels natural and welcoming, rather than just being a concrete heat sink,"" he says. Sydney company Junglefy is famous for its breathing walls and rooftop gardens, both great examples of urban greening. Owner Jock Gammon explains that plants can reduce the urban heat island effect — in which hard surfaces absorb heat during the day and release it in the evening. ""It requires a lot of energy to cool that air back down, and typically our cities are four to seven degrees hotter than the surrounding bushland,"" he says. ""The plants stop those hard surfaces from heating up and they also release moisture. ""If you think of those leafy suburbs, they are always cooler and more inviting than some of those newer suburbs that don't have that green canopy."" There are other good examples, says Rooney, including Brisbane's Urban Forest project which will plant 1,000 trees and 20,000 native plants, and a plan by City of Melbourne to plant 3,000 street trees with an aim to lower the temperature by 4C. ""But there's a huge opportunity for us to increase the number of trees,"" she says. Australia's 36,000 kilometre of coastline is home to the vast majority of the population. It's also under threat from climate change. The Australian Coastal Councils Association (ACCA), which has 200 members, is calling for a coordinated national approach to managing the impacts of rising sea levels, extreme weather events, storm surges and riverine flooding. In a recent member survey, 90 per cent of the 100 respondents had been impacted by coastal erosion hazards in the past five years. ACCA chief executive Alan Stokes says coastal management is largely being left to local councils — the least resourced of all levels of government — and some are struggling. ""We heard of one small council in South Australia that was spending more than 30 per cent of its budget on coastal management. Now that's just unsustainable,"" he says. For some communities, the only option will be a managed retreat, one of the few adaptation responses available. Retreat is an emotionally charged and politically difficult option. It also raises vexed questions of who pays. The small Tasmanian beach town of Snug, 30 kilometres south of Hobart, is facing such a prospect. Kingborough Council environmental manager Jon Doole says modelling predicts the area will be inundated by 2100 and difficult decisions will have to be made. ""What we've got to work out is what may be the future of those houses [under threat]. Can they be protected or do we need to think about retreat?"" he says. He says the community will need to be consulted about the risk it faces. It will be a difficult but important conversation. ""In the upcoming year for Snug, we're really hopeful that we will get a grant that we've applied for that will really help us put more resources into having community forums."" Professor Boulter says there has been a lot of good planning by councils but there is only so much that can be done to preserve the coastline. ""If we want to protect our coastline, then we have to make decisions that are very expensive and are also likely to change [its] character,"" she says.

408,China will plant trees across an area the size of Belgium every year until 2025,environment,"  China announces tree planting pledge to increase forests and bring down carbon emissions China will plant 36,000 square kilometres of new forest a year until 2025 as a measure to combat climate change and better protect natural habitats, a senior forestry official says. Tree planting has been at the heart of China's environmental efforts for decades and is a major part of plans to bring carbon emissions down to net zero by 2060. The total area pledged to have trees planted each year is greater than the size of Belgium and is being described as ""land greening"" by Li Chunliang, vice-chairman of the State Forestry and Grasslands Commission. ""By 2035, the quality and stability of national forest, grassland, wetland and desert ecosystems will have been comprehensively upgraded,"" Mr Li said. China aims to raise its overall forest coverage rate from 23.04 to 24.1 per cent by the end of 2025, according to its forest and grassland five-year plan published this week. The plan warned that China's forest and grass resources were inadequate, especially in drought-prone regions in the north and west. Mr Li did not say what type of trees would be planted but the document said the strategy would rely in part on ""natural reforestation"", implying different types of trees would be planted according to the local environment. Following the destruction of major ecosystems during decades of rapid economic growth, China has promised to create ""ecological security barriers"" and protect as much as a quarter of its total territory from human encroachment. Over the next five years, China will also expand its national park system, create corridors to alleviate habitat fragmentation, and will crack down further on illegal wildlife trade, according to Chen Jiawen from the Chiense State Forestry Administration, who was lead author of the five-year plan.

A team of 29 scientists from across Australia has warned that a number of frog species will go extinct in the next two decades if no action is taken. Eight species are at ""high risk"" of extinction in the next 20 years, but four of those are likely to be already lost, according to the research published in the journal Pacific Conservation Biology today. The study ranked the extinction probability for Australia's threatened frogs to identify the species most in need of intervention, according to study author Graeme Gillespie of the Northern Territory Department of Environment, Parks and Water Security. Dr Gillespie said frogs would soon follow the path of Australian reptiles, mammals, birds and plants that have already become extinct, adding to the country's already dire biodiversity record. ""The evidence is there, the patterns are there, this study tells us we're about to lose more,"" he said. The study's lead author, Hayley Geyle of the NESP Threatened Species Recovery Hub, said urgent action was needed to protect these unique species. ""Current resourcing and management is just not cutting it in terms of preventing declines,"" she said. The amphibian disease chytridiomycosis (or chrytrid), caused by the fungal skin pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has likely already driven four species extinct, according to Dr Gillespie. ""This disease has been responsible for the extinction of hundreds of species of frogs around the world, including in Australia, and the decline of many others,"" he said. ""For the species which we believe are extinct, chytrid is probably the exclusive factor."" But for many of our other critically endangered frogs, the threats of climate change, invasive species and habitat loss are also at play. ""What these things do is they reduce the overall resilience of the species to cope with a new threat,"" Dr Gillespie said. ""If a frog occurs on one mountaintop like Kosciuszko, there is a chance for the entire species to be knocked out by one event like a fire."" Climate change may be impacting lowland frog species too, according to Ed Meyer of the Queensland Frog Society, who has been involved in monitoring frogs in groundwater dependent wetlands. ""We think the rainfall deficits we've had in south-east Queensland have resulted in the local extirpation of populations of some of those species,"" Dr Meyer said. Dr Meyer said the study clarified just how dire the situation was for a large number of Australian frogs. ""We risk losing additional species in a very short time space, perhaps shorter than people realise,"" said Dr Meyer, who was not one of the authors. After the Black Summer bush fires tore across Mt Kosciuszko in 2019/20, a rescue mission was launched to see how the critically endangered southern corroboree frogs had fared in their protected enclosures in the alpine bogs. Several enclosures were destroyed and close to two-thirds of the frogs died, but scientists hope frog numbers could bounce back thanks to an extensive captive breeding program for the species. But there isn't adequate data on the ecology or populations of many other frog species at risk of extinction, let alone captive management programs. ""There's definitely a big disparity in those frogs on the list in terms of the amount of investment that's gone into securing their future,"" Ms Geyle said. ""So one of the key actions would be to put in place more research and monitoring of the populations."" Dr Meyer agreed that because some species receive more attention than others, we don't have a good understanding of their vulnerability to threats. ""We perhaps don't appreciate just how how much of a knife edge they're on, until they fall over the other side,"" he said. Even for species that do have captive management programs underway, their release into the wild is not immediately guaranteed. The Kroombit tinker frog that lives in rainforest streams in central Queensland is the species most likely to go extinct by 2040 according to the new study, after the four species already believed to have disappeared. Dr Meyer has been studying the frog since the mid 1990s and has witnessed its decline in the wild. He said his team faced political and funding challenges when they set up a captive breeding program for the Kroombit tinker frog 13 years ago, but they've now successfully bred the frog in captivity. ""We're currently putting together a formal captive release plan strategy to make sure that we get [the release] right,"" he said. ""We're going to give it a red-hot go and hopefully we can buy the species some time and maybe give it a brighter future."" Captive breeding programs are expensive, time-consuming and the last resort, said Dr Gillespie, but there are other things that can be done. ""We can build resilience in these species by addressing management issues that we do have some control over,"" he said. ""In some cases, it's just a matter of putting in appropriate fencing or undertaking appropriate pest management. ""We know how to control pigs. It's not technologically very difficult."" Relocating frogs to safer habitats or even wild refuges is another potential solution. Dr Gillespie also thinks crisis funding for threatened species could be put to better use. ""If the resources that were being thrown around in response to those [2019] fires had been spread out uniformly over the previous 10 years, we would've had a better outcome,"" he said. ""We would have been more informed about the likely impacts, and there would have been more resilience in the system. ""But a big bag of money gets thrown at it, it gets spent in a short period of time, and then it goes back down to being inadequate until the next crisis."" A spokesperson for the federal environment department said they welcomed the research findings, and that the government was committed to recovering threatened species. They said government programs were ""increasingly incorporating monitoring for on-ground projects to better assess the outcomes of Australian government investment and to inform future actions"".

410,Baby bats babble just like human toddlers. What does this mean?,environment," Science Baby bats babble just like human toddlers. What does this mean? Deep in the jungles of Costa Rica and Panama, Ahana Aurora Fernandez eavesdrops on bat conversations from dawn until dusk. Armed with a microphone and sound recorder, Dr Fernandez is capturing the squeaky sounds of baby bats learning how to talk. And it turns out these bat babbles have remarkably similar patterns to human baby talk, according to a study published today in Science. Like babies and toddlers, bat pups learn how to ""talk"" by copying adult sounds and repeating them to a regular beat. While bats and humans appear totally different on the surface, Dr Fernandez said the findings could offer clues about how human speech and language evolved. ""It's striking that two mammalian species with different evolutionary histories have the same vocal practice behaviour that leads to the same end product: to learn the adult vocal repertoire. That's amazing,"" said Dr Fernandez, one of the study's co-authors at the Natural History Museum in Berlin. While it can be enough to drive some parents crazy, babbling allows babies and toddlers to begin mastering speech by learning how to control their tongue, lips and jaw to form their first words. They start making this chatter at around four months old, starting with making sounds that imitate vowels, like ""coo"" and ""ga"". At around six months, babies begin slipping consonants into their babbling, blurting out sounds like ""ba"" and ""da"" in repeated sequences that have a regular beat, such as ""da-da-da"". Every ""coo"", ""ba"" and ""da-da-da"" brings infants one step closer to stringing full sentences together,  Dr Fernandez said. ""Without vocal imitation, we wouldn't be able to speak or learn a language."" But humans aren't the only animals to babble their way to mature conversation. Songbirds, such as zebra finches, also learn how to sing by babbling and copying the songs of adult birds. But it's tricky to use babbling birds as models for exploring the development of human language because their anatomy is vastly different to ours. Enter the greater sac-winged bat (Saccopteryx bilineata), a species found in the rainforests of Central and South America. ""These bats are very special because they really learn a part of the adult vocal repertoire from scratch through imitating their adult tutors,"" Dr Fernandez said. What Dr Fernandez and her team wanted to know was whether the babbling produced by bat pups followed a similar pattern to human baby talk. To find out, the researchers spent three months recording the babbling behaviour of 20 bat pups from eight wild colonies across Costa Rica and Panama. A podcast that opens a window on the beautiful sounds of the Australian wilderness. They also ploughed through the literature to compile a list of human babbling features to see whether the bats' babbles followed a similar pattern. The team analysed over 55,000 syllables from 216 babbling bouts produced by the bat pups. While syllables in human infant babbling consist of consonant sounds that transition into vowel-like sounds (""ba"" and ""ga""), bat syllables are defined as tones surrounded by silence. The bat pups proved to be a chatty bunch from a young age, babbling away in the trees from just three weeks' old. By the time they were 10 weeks' old, the pups were spending nearly half of their waking hours giving their vocal skills a workout, with a single babbling session lasting for up to 43 minutes. Much like human babies learning how to combine vowels and consonants, the bat pups' babbling consisted of a mash-up of syllables their parents use. ""The pups produced syllables from the adult territorial song, followed by syllables from the adult courtship song,"" Dr Fernandez said. ""They completely mix them up."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. While the pups were from different colonies and locations, they all picked up the same syllables, just as humans produce similar babbling sounds regardless of the culture they are growing up in. And just like a human baby saying ""da-da-da"", the bat pups spent most of their babbling time repeating the same syllables to a clockwork-like beat. Dr Fernandez suspects the bat pups babble repeatedly to get their communication skills up to speed and learn how to use their vocal apparatus properly. But it's not all hard work. “While you're babbling, you're happy,"" Dr Fernandez said. ""It's not only practising and learning, but also having fun and just babbling away. It's a comfort behaviour."" Nicola Hanrahan, an ecologist at Charles Darwin University who has studied social communication in bats, welcomed the study and said it would be interesting to explore babbling behaviour in other bat species. ""The behaviour demonstrated by greater sac-winged bats is unlikely to be restricted to this species, with a number of bat species already shown to use vocal learning,"" said Dr Hanrahan, who was not involved in the study. And while few studies have explored social communication in Australian bats, some of our native species would be good candidates for exploring babbling and vocal learning, Dr Hanrahan said. For instance, the ghost bat (Macroderma gigas) is a very talkative species that uses its complex vocal repertoire to communicate during foraging and roosting. ""Studies into the social communication of Australian bats are few, although increasing,"" Dr Hanrahan said. ""We have yet to delve into investigating the presence of vocal learning or babbling."" The next step for Dr Fernandez and her team is to explore what is happening in the bats' brains while they are learning how to talk. ""What is really exciting about bat pup babbling is that it shows you when learning is taking place,"" Dr Fernandez said. ""Seeing what is happening in the mammalian brain during vocal learning could also tell us something about what is happening in our brain when we are vocally learning.""

411,Climate change is its greatest threat. So can the Antarctic Treaty protect this fragile region?,environment,"  Can the Antarctic Treaty protect one of the world's last great wildernesses from climate change? It's one of the world's last great wildernesses. Antarctica, the world's southernmost continent, is known for its penguins, polar expeditions and icy beauty. But it's not quite as pristine as the brochures would like everyone to believe. Environmentalists say the region is facing multiple pressures from climate change, increased tourism and countries jostling for strategic positions. And all that protects this majestic area is a single treaty, negotiated more than six decades ago. So is the Antarctic Treaty robust enough to protect the 'Great White Continent'? Does it need to be updated? Or is it working as it should be? At its heart, the Antarctic Treaty is about keeping the peace. Most land claims over Antarctica were made before World War II. After the war, there was a renewed focus on polar research and something was needed to reduce the potential for conflict over Antarctica, says international law expert Donald Rothwell. By the 1950s, seven nations — Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom — had claimed territorial sovereignty over areas of Antarctica. And many others, including the United States and the Soviet Union, had been exploring the area. ""The treaty's genius was that it actually stopped those sovereignty and territorial disputes in the 50s, and during a critical period in the Cold War,"" Professor Rotherwell, from Australian National University, tells ABC RN's Counterpoint. The treaty was signed in 1959 by 12 nations including Australia, United States and USSR and came into force on June 23, 1961. While the treaty effectively neutralised territorial claims, Australia never relinquished the Australian Antarctic Territory, although this isn't recognised by many other nations. The 5.9 million square kilometre area, equivalent to 80 per cent of the size of Australia, is about 42 per cent of the continent. And Australia has three research bases: Casey, Davis and Mawson. Interestingly, the only piece of unclaimed land on Earth is in West Antarctica. The 1.6 million square kilometre section of icy terrain and glaciers, known as Marie Byrd Land, remains unclaimed due to its remoteness and lack of resources. The treaty bans military activities, nuclear testing and the disposal of radioactive waste in the region. It outlines a vision for peace and freedom of scientific research with nations cooperating and exchanging research plans and personnel. There are also provisions for nations to inspect each other's ships, stations and equipment. Over the past 60 years, Australia has conducted 10 inspections in Antarctica — the most recent included visiting two facilities run by China and stops at bases run by Germany, Russia, Korea and Belarus last year. Checks are usually to verify compliance with the environmental and non-militarisation principles of the treaty and to ensure scientific research is taking place. Membership to the treaty has grown over time, with any member of the United Nations eligible to sign on. It now has 54 signatories but only 29 countries — either original signatories or those who are conducting substantial research on the continent — have voting rights to decide the continent's future, protection and enforcement of rules. Decisions require consensus between the 29 nations. Professor Rothwell says, by all standards the treaty is ""very old"". ""It has never been amended or modified [but] it's certainly been expanded."" He says that, in addition to the original treaty, there is a patchwork of agreements and protocols on issues like mining, management of protected areas, the environment, tourism, fishing and preservation of historical sites, which make up the Antarctic Treaty System. ""There's always been a bit of a question mark over it, in terms of whether it will remain good as a treaty regime into the future, given emerging geopolitical tensions,"" he says. Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition executive director Claire Christian says the treaty's mission to ""permanently demilitarise an entire continent was a huge accomplishment"". ""It was also quite important that the original signatories prioritised scientific research rather than economic exploitation,"" she says. Christian says the addition of the Madrid Protocol in 1991 ""refocussed"" the treaty on environmental protection by banning mineral extraction. It also requires Antarctic Treaty parties to undertake environmental protection measures including environmental impact assessments and protected areas. In some ways, Christian says, the protocol and the treaty are still ""revolutionary"" by prioritising environmental protection and international cooperation rather than national interests. Antarctic campaigner Alistair Allan, who has visited the region five times with the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, says this part of the world faces serious challenges. Climate change is the ""absolute biggest threat"" to the region. Allan, from the Bob Brown Foundation, points out that the 29 countries with voting rights over Antarctica are among the world's greatest emitters of greenhouse gases. He believes these countries could make a real difference to the future of Antarctica — and the world. He's calling for a ""stronger shared care for the Antarctic environment"" and for countries to make ""real changes back at home"". Tourism is also a growing concern in the region. Before the coronavirus pandemic, there was a surge in cashed-up visitors all keen to explore the continent. ""When they wrote the treaty, that wasn't even a thing. There was no anticipation for the biggest industry in Antarctica to be tourism,"" Allan says. Increased visitors put further pressure on the ecosystem with more ship and aircraft movement, more people on the ground exploring sensitive areas like penguin rookeries and the potential for invasive species to be introduced. ""Every little activity by itself doesn't necessarily harm the environment,"" Allan says, but adds that it all has a cumulative impact. It depends on who you ask. Professor Rothwell says at face value the treaty is achieving its aim. Humans have accessed more than two-thirds of the Antarctica and the proportion of places not impacted by people is shrinking, say researchers who are calling for greater protection of wilderness areas. ""It's not only holding the peace but it's keeping scientific research going, which has always been critical on the continent,"" he says. ""The scientific research has evolved to have an increasing focus on climate change, so you can't say that the research is not relevant and contemporary and focussed."" Allan isn't so sure. He describes an atmosphere akin to a ""moon race"" between countries ""jostling for territory"" by proposing large infrastructure projects. For instance, Australia has plans to build a 2.7 kilometre concrete airstrip to receive planes all year round. Allan says the project near Davis Station is an example of a country trying to shore up its territorial claim. ""Due to climate change, the ice runway in summer is actually melting and they can't land the planes ... but the real reason is about huge strategic imperatives,"" he says. Both Allan and Christian agree the treaty's core is solid but there are weaknesses. ""There are plenty of scientists and government officials who understand what needs to be done [to protect the region] and have good ideas for implementing it but they are too often blocked by one or two countries,"" Christian says. Enforcement of the rules is another issue. For instance, when South Korean and Russian fishing vessels were caught fishing illegally in the area, they avoided the consequences after their respective countries couldn't agree on how to enforce the regulations. Allan says there needs to be stricter regulations and more countries involved in making decisions. ""The foundation is strong in terms of no-military, cooperation, natural reserve, peace and science ... What it needs now is stricter control regulation and potentially also bringing more people into that conversation. ""At the moment, it is still the 29 voting countries that primarily get to choose what happens and there's not much say from the rest of the world. ""What happens in Antarctica affects all of us.""

412,"analysis: If Morrison treats the Glasgow climate talks as another negotiation, we're in trouble. Here's why",environment,"  Australia is at risk of taking the wrong tack at the Glasgow climate talks, and slamming China is only part of it Buried within the Prime Minister's response to the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is just about everything we're at risk of getting wrong at the Glasgow climate talks in October. After slamming China — where emissions per person are half of Australia's — for not doing more to cut emissions, Scott Morrison said the Glasgow talks were the ""biggest multilateral global negotiation the world has ever known"". If he treats the talks as just another (big) negotiation, we're in trouble. The way the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade usually treats negotiations is hold something back, hold out the prospect of ""giving it up"", and then only make the concession if the other side gives something in return. Even if holding back damages Australia. Cars are a case in point. From an economic point of view, there is no reason whatsoever to continue to impose tariffs (special taxes) on the import of cars — none, not even in the eyes of those who support the use of tariffs to protect Australian jobs. Australia no longer makes cars. The pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the Coalition is rising, writes Melissa Clarke. Yet the tariff remains, at 5 per cent, making it perhaps $1 billion harder than it should be for Australians to buy new cars (although nowhere near as hard as it was in the days when the tariff was 57.5 per cent). The tariff seems to be in place largely to give the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade something to negotiate away in trade agreements: for use as what the Productivity Commission calls ""negotiating coin"". Here's how it worked in the 2014 Australia-Korea Free Trade Agreement. Australia agreed to remove the remaining 5 per cent tariff on Korean cars, ""with consumers and businesses to benefit from downward pressure on import prices"". But Australia didn't remove the tariff on car imports altogether, which would have given us a much bigger benefit but denied the department negotiating coin. The next year the department did it again, agreeing to give up the tariff on imported Japanese cars in the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement (but not on other cars) so Australians could ""benefit from lower prices and/or greater availability of Japanese products"". Two years later, it did it again, with cars from China. When the UK and European agreements are negotiated, it'll do it there too. Eventually Australians will get what they are entitled to. But the point is that rather than advancing the cause of free trade, the department has held back, treating a win for the other side as a loss for us, when it wasn't. Worse fires, longer droughts, and more severe floods — the projections from one of the world's most significant reports on climate change make for scary reading. Let's break down what it all means. The Centre for International Economics believes the much bigger earlier set of tariff cuts lifted the living standard of the average Australian family by $8,448. Had our trade negotiators been in charge, we would still be waiting. Instead the Hawke and then the Keating governments pushed through unilateral reductions, asking for nothing in return. As former Trade Minister Craig Emerson put it, this gave Australia ""credibility in international trade negotiations way beyond the relative size of our economy"". Does that sound like the sort of thing Australia might need at Glasgow, to have enough credibility to urge even bigger emitters to deliver the kind of cuts on which our futures and future temperatures depend? The Prime Minister is right to say that China is the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter, even though its emissions per person are low. Its high population means it accounts for 28 per cent of all the greenhouse gases pumped out each year. The next biggest emitter, the United States, accounts for 15 per cent But China's status is new. Until 2006 it pumped out less per year than the United States. Because the US has had mega-factories and heating and so on for so much longer, it is responsible for by far the biggest chunk of the greenhouse gasses already in the atmosphere: 25 per cent, followed by the European Union with 22 per cent. China might reasonably feel that countries like the US that have done the most to create the problem should do the most to fix it. Like Australia, the US pumps out twice as much per person as China and has much more room to cut back. On the bright side, China knows that being big means it is in a position to make a difference to global emissions in a way that other countries cannot on their own. And that's a position that can benefit its citizens. China's latest five-year plan, adopted in March, commits it to cut its ""carbon intensity"" (emissions per unit of GDP) by 18 per cent. If it beats that five-year target by just a bit (and it has beaten its previous five-year targets) its emissions will turn down from 2025. It is aiming for net-zero emissions by 2060. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds that Australia is especially susceptible to global warming. We're facing less rain in winter, longer heatwaves, drier rivers, more arid soil and worse droughts. We are right to want China to do more, but the worst way to achieve it is to say ""we won't lift our ambition until you lift yours"". Hardly ever a worthwhile strategy, it is particularly ineffective when we don't have bargaining power. The only power we've got is to set an example, unilaterally, as we did with tariffs. And to ramp up our ambition. If Australia said it would do more, and didn't quibble, it might just count for something. It's all we can do, and it's the very best we can do.

413,Almond industry on the rise but beekeepers say they're struggling to keep up ,environment,"  Apiarists concerned they'll run out of bees to supply South Australia's blooming almond industry South Australian apiarists are worried their bees are being overworked trying to keep up with demand from an expanding almond industry. Bees are vital to the life cycle of almond orchards and are brought in during winter to pollinate trees which leads to the colourful, white bloom which occurs around August. The process is beneficial to bees as well, with the opportunity to pollinate the orchard key to strengthening the hive. Meningie-based apiarist Bill Brown typically sends 70-100 per cent of his hives into the Riverland each winter. But the demand from the growing industry in SA has him concerned both he, and the bees, will struggle to keep up. ""If you put the bees under pressure for 12 months of the year it does cause the weakening of the hive,"" Mr Brown said. ""Since pollination demand has become so strong we've just had to be very careful that we don't extract our bees too late in the season to allow the bees to build up hive strength and enough pollen pre-winter. ""Up until I'd say two years ago, there was enough supply to meet the demand, but just with the new plantings it's becoming increasingly harder to supply the numbers."" While the cross pollination for almond orchards benefits both the crop and bees, the timing of it is less than optimum. Bees tend to work hard for nine months of the year along with the rest of the hive, but then during the colder months — when almond orchards bloom — they like to hibernate and conserve energy. This means apiarists need to ensure they look after their bees in a way which makes sure they're fit to go when almond blossom comes around. Mr Brown said this often includes investing in technology which puts an extra expense on apiarists. ""As the almond industry expands we're going to become a lot feeder of bees,"" he said. ""Like sheep feed lots and cattle feed lots, we're going to have to supplementary feed the bees to be able to keep them strong enough. ""Beekeepers themselves are going to have to look at different means of maintaining their hive strength pre-almond flowering."" Australian Bee Services managing director Danny Le Feuvre said there could be issues with getting enough bees as almond plantations mature and demand for pollination continues to rise. ""Many beekeepers would say we're at capacity now,"" he said. ""Native flora isn't as reliable as it used to be due to climate change, it will definitely limit the availability of bees."" The total area of almond plantings in Australia has exploded since the turn of the century, going from 3,500 hectares in 2000 to 58,000ha in 2020. The industry is worth $1.6 billion Australia-wide, and in SA it is worth more than $220 million and creates more than 1,100 direct and indirect jobs. Outgoing Almond Board of Australia CEO Ross Skinner said while SA producers bring in local bees during pollination as a priority, hives from interstate are used to fill the gap. ""The beekeepers do a great job in preparing their bees to go in to do the pollination for almonds and when they have strong hives they certainly benefit from their time on almond orchards,"" he said. The current demand for the 2021 pollination season is around 270,000 hives across Australia, with this expected to grow to around 350,000 hives in the coming years. ""There is an opportunity for beekeepers to meet this demand for pollination services,"" Mr Skinner said. ""The almond industry is certainly supportive of the beekeeping industry to increase their hives in Australia, but the big challenge is for beekeepers to gain access to floral resources."" But Mr Le Feuvre says it is not just about being able to breed more bees. ""It is pretty easy to breed more bees, but the problem is having somewhere to put them,"" he said. ""Access to appropriate good, high-quality resources is one of our biggest limitations. ""Almonds go for maybe three or four weeks of the year, and then we've got to maintain them for the rest of the year.""

414,High tides and coastal erosion expose ugly piles of litter along Geraldton coastline,environment,"  High tides and coastal erosion expose ugly piles of litter along Geraldton coastline A high tide event has uncovered rubbish buried in sand dunes at a Geraldton beach, with erosion at Separation Point exposing tyres, electrical cable tape and food packaging as well as other litter. Geraldton resident Irene Ghannage regularly clears litter from the beach in Geraldton's south and said she picked up a week's worth of trash in one day following the weather event. ""Some of it was sticking out of the embankments that were created by the carving out of the dune,"" she said. ""It was strewn nearby and all along the high ride line. ""The high tide line was actually so bad as to be overwhelming."" In late July, the tidal level around Geraldton reached highs of more than one meter for nearly a week, according data from the Bureau of Metereology. In the second weekend of August, the ocean again reached a metre high. Ms Ghannage said she was concerned about the amount of rubbish littering Geraldton's beaches, particularly with high tides. City of Greater Geraldton mayor Shane Van Styn said some of the rubbish in the dunes was building rubble placed there decades ago to prevent coastal erosion. ""Coupled with that, all these storm events have washed in fishing industry debris into the shore,"" he said ""That's where you're seeing a lot of those plastics and the like, and the City will be going down there and assisting with cleaning up a lot of that plastic waste. ""We just ask residents to pick up a few pieces of plastic every time that they go to play their part in keeping our beaches clean."" He said the City regularly patrolled its beaches for rubbish. ""Every day, we are working throughout our community collecting waste and rubbish,"" he said. Ms Ghannage has been clearing rubbish off of local beaches for more than a decade. ""Considering 12 years, if anything it's building, it's not getting better, it's actually getting worse,"" she said. Though she recognised there are various clean up initiatives, Ms Ghannage did not believe that enough was being done to manage the problem. ""That's not to have a dig at anybody, it's a mammoth job. "" I think it's actually a little bit unmanageable"" she said. ""It's a big problem that we don't know how to deal with.""

For the best part of every month she coaxes her Navara ute up remote muddy bush tracks, doing her best not to get bogged, so she can survey for threatened owls and other birdlife in the area. She gets up at 4:00am — at sometimes minus 5 degrees Celsius – and is on the go for 12 to 14 hours. Not only is her workday long, it's very solitary. Find owls without leaving home! Listen to audio from across Australia and see if you can hear any hoots (or barks!). ""I don't really interact with anyone outside of a petrol station,"" says Ms Larkin, who is doing a PhD at the University of New England. As part of her work, she has microphones hidden in trees to pick up the sound of owls, which are usually hard to detect because they are only active at night. She's on the hunt for the lesser-known Australian owls like the elusive and under-studied barking owl whose calls are often confused with the woofs of a dog — and even the screams of a human. Ms Larkin is also collecting data on the country's smallest and most widespread owl, the boobook or ""mopoke"", and the barn owl – which in Australia lives in hollow trees and caves rather than barns. She hopes to get a handle on how many owls like these are out there, so we can better protect them. You can help scientists like Ms Larkin search for owls by identifying their hoots in the ABC's interactive Hoot Detective. While all owls are hard to find, barking owls are particularly tricky because in states like NSW, they're thin on the ground, Ms Larkin says. They don't like coastal or urban areas like the larger and better-known powerful owls. Instead their preferred habitat is remote dry open eucalypt forest and woodland, which can also be home to koalas and quolls. The problem is so much of this habitat has been cleared for agriculture or burnt by bushfires, and concern is mounting for species like the barking owl. ""We don't know how many are left,"" Ms Larkin says. And, unfortunately, to protect a species from going extinct, you have to have firm numbers showing it is actually in serious decline. ""We can't protect it better if we don't know what we have."" Not surprisingly, the barking owl got its name from the short, sharp, double hoot it makes, usually predawn or just after dusk, which can sound like a ""woof woof"". ""It really does sound like a dog,"" Ms Larkin says. And both male and female barking owl hoots can set dogs off barking, says Steven Debus, Ms Larkin's co-supervisor at the University of New England. But the barking owl also, although only rarely, screams — and this has also been known to confuse people. Sometimes it's a wailing sound, but reports have also referred to a ""blood-curdling shriek"" that people have mistaken for a human and ended up calling the police. ""There is a bit of a history or folklore about such things going well back to early last century,"" Dr Debus says. ""It's been called the 'screaming woman owl', which is a bit sexist, I suppose."" He says he is yet to come across a recorded example that is as human-sounding as he has heard. ""[The recordings are] not the shrill scream … which I've heard right overhead at 4:00am while camping in a tent in some remote bushland,"" says Dr Debus, who has written a number of books on birds of prey. ""I knew what it was, but my companions didn't."" The barking owl's hoots declare their territory, Ms Larkin says, but hooting also plays a courtship role. Male and female owls have different pitched hoots and can sometimes be heard performing an increasingly frantic duet. ""You can actually audibly hear the birds get excited when their partner gets close,"" she says. Ms Larkin is strategically surveying potential barking owl habitat that remains in strips of government-owned land called travelling stock reserves. These green corridors that criss-cross otherwise cleared farming land were once used by drovers on horseback, who herded sheep and cattle from one stock watering place to the next. Today in NSW, travelling stock reserves form around 2 million hectares worth of remnant bush habitat. ""They're like little Noah's arks floating around,"" Ms Larkin says. ""We're finding a lot of really threatened species using them to move through the landscape."" Ms Larkin put 50 sound recorders out in the field in 2019 and has constantly tended them since. ""I need to drive around and change the SD cards and batteries nearly every month."" Sometimes she finds the recorders have been damaged. ""Often ringtail possums will chew the microphone – they'll rip the foam off them."" But perhaps the biggest challenge lately has been the weather. ""We've gone from extreme drought and bushfire … to non-stop rain,"" she says. So Ms Larkin must learn a lot about getting out of tricky situations in the bush by herself. ""You're getting bogged on these tracks that nobody uses and you're out on your own, so you've got to get yourself out."" Her 4WD ute is kitted out with gear for emergencies, including a winch. Ms Larkin also narrowly escaped losing her equipment in the 2019 bushfires. More recently, the pandemic has caused a few problems too. As well as tracking owls via their hoots, she has also been trialling a hand-held thermal imaging camera that picks up the heat of animals in the night, particularly in winter. It turns out the thermal technique works for some species, but not others, because birds with a thicker feather coat are harder to detect. And she's been comparing this technique with other survey methods, including the more traditional way of looking for night creatures, which involves spotlighting with head torches. The torches have a switch that converts their white light to red light, which is less damaging to the birds. ""You're typically scanning with white light and then converting to red light when you spot an animal."" Ms Larkin has accumulated months' worth of audio so far, and is using it to ""teach"" machine-learning algorithms — so-called acoustic recognisers — to automatically pick out calls of different owl species. From the symphony of nomadic birds on their journey across the continent, to the silencing of our forests by bushfires, ecoacoustics could help scientists track environmental change. ""I've annotated some files where I could find calls and seeing if the recogniser picks up what I've done manually."" As she corrects any mistakes made by the recognisers, she helps improve their accuracy. Ms Larkin is working with recognisers developed by the Queensland University of Technology, which will eventually be used to identify the location of owl species including barking owls across Australia. These are the same recognisers that citizen scientists are also helping to train in Hoot Detective. In processing her data so far, she only picked up a handful of pairs of barking owls, and the evidence suggests they did not reproduce last year. ""We couldn't see any confirmation of breeding, and the nest hollows were all inactive,"" she says. She hopes to find more soon, but predicts when the final numbers do come in, they won't look good. ""In five or 10 years' time, this will be the flagship raptor we're trying to save."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

416,Buildings destroyed in northern Turkey floods as the death toll rises to 44,environment,"  Northern Turkey 'disaster' floods death toll rises to 44, hundreds evacuated from affected areas The death toll from severe floods and mudslides in Turkey's Black Sea region has climbed to at least 44, as the country grapples with its second natural disaster this month. The floods, among the worst Turkey has experienced, brought chaos to northern provinces just as authorities were declaring wildfires that raged through southern coastal regions for two weeks had been brought under control. Torrents of water tossed dozens of cars and heaps of debris along streets, destroyed bridges, closed roads and cut off electricity to hundreds of villages. The Disaster and Emergency Management Directorate (AFAD) said 36 people were killed in Kastamonu, seven in Sinop and one in Bartin. It said nine people were still in hospital in Sinop. ""This is the worst flood disaster I have seen,"" Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said late on Thursday after surveying damage. ""The infrastructure in Ayancik (district) has completely collapsed. The sewage system is destroyed. There is no electricity or water,"" Sinop Mayor Baris Ayhan told Reuters. The floods and fires, which killed eight people and devastated tens of thousands of hectares of forest, struck in the same week that a UN panel said global warming was dangerously close to spiralling out of control, and warned that extreme weather would become more severe. About 45 centimetres of rain fell in less than three days in one village near the worst-hit region, Kastamonu's Bozkurt district, AFAD cited meteorology authorities as saying. Footage of the flood's first moments in Bozkurt showed the river there overflowing in a fast-moving deluge, which tore up trees and dragged away vehicles. The small town of Bozkurt lies in a valley along the banks of the Ezine river in Kastamonu province, 2.5 kilometres from the Black Sea. Experts in Turkey say interference with rivers and improper construction also were contributors to the massive damage in Turkey’s floods. Geologists have said that construction narrowed the river bed and the surrounding alluvial flood plain of the Ezine stream in Kastamonu’s Bozkurt district, where the damage was most severe. Residential buildings were built along the waterfront. During severe rains, the contracted stream has limited area in which to move and can overflow. Speaking in Bozkurt, President Tayyip Erdogan declared the three provinces a disaster zone. ""Our country has been grappling with natural disasters for a while, as are many places in the world. This is not just our country but the United States, Canada, Germany and many other European countries,"" he said. About 2,250 people were evacuated across the region before, during and after the floods, some lifted from rooftops by helicopters. Many were being temporarily housed in student dormitories, authorities said. Five bridges had collapsed and many others were damaged, leading to road closures, AFAD added. Parts of the roads were also swept away.

418,In the pipeline: $22m 'water cocktail' project underway at Lake Wyangan,environment,"  Hopes $22m water project for Griffith's Lake Wyangan will improve water quality A $22 million project to improve water quality in Griffith's beleaguered Lake Wyangan is underway, but the local council warns it will take years to complete. A federal government grant of $3.475m for the lake project was announced this week as part of the National Water Grid Connections program. Griffith City Council will match the federal funding, kickstarting the first stage of the multi-million-dollar plan for the waterway, which was formed in the 1950s using the remains of a gypsum mine and a natural swamp area. In recent years, the lake —  in the heart of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area — has been affected by salinity, fish kills and large-scale blue-green algae outbreaks, which are being investigated for potential links to motor neurone disease. Griffith City Council general manager Brett Stonestreet outlined how the council hoped the lake's water quality could be improved by mixing water from several sources. He said the first stage of the project would include building a pipeline from the city's water reclamation plant to south Wyangan Lake, in a bid to retain the northern portion of the lake for recreation purposes. Mr Stonestreet said the south lake would be used as a ""working lake"". ""We're going to essentially use that as a mixing pond,"" he said. ""The water from the reclamation plant will come into the south lake, there'll be some fresh water coming in from the Murrumbidgee irrigation supply network and there'll also be some shandied water coming in from the north lake into the south lake. ""It's essentially a shandying of various water sources and then getting the salinity level down in that mix of water to a point where farmers will be able to use the water for irrigation of crops."" The Griffith City Council has been working on the proposal for around four years and Mr Stonestreet has described the project as a complex solution to a complex problem. ""Certainly the level of salinity (sic) is too high and that needs to be reduced to have meaningful improvement out there,"" he said. ""There's also an issue with a lack of circulation in the north lake, which does contribute to more likelihood of blue-green algae outbreaks there."" Mr Stonestreet said the second stage of the project would involve building pipelines to nearby farms for irrigation, as well as controlling sediment. ""We've already had an indication from the government that they will provide significant assistance towards preparing the detailed business case,"" he said. Mr Stonestreet said while funding for the first stage of the initiative was now secure, construction was still a way off. ""Environmental impact statements will certainly need to be carefully undertaken, detailed design … and engineering works will have to be undertaken, but we're looking with the next couple of years to have the project on the ground,"" he said. Mr Stonestreet said the $22m project would have numerous benefits. ""There's going to be economic outcomes for farmers because they'll be using water out of the lake,"" he said. ""There'll be environmental outcomes in terms of improving the water quality, there's going to be recreational outcomes for the community to enjoy that lake again and just the ecology in general.""

419,Rare metals needed to fuel our high-tech future are in our hands right now,environment," Science Where and how will we get the metals to feed our future technology needs? If you had a tonne of ore from a gold mine, and a tonne of iPhones, which is likely to contain more gold? What about silver? You've probably guessed the reason for the question is that the answer is surprising. And yes, in both cases, it's the devices that are a richer source of the precious metals. In fact, the metals for all Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic medals came from recycled e-waste. Over two years, the organisers gathered enough gold, silver and bronze from small electronic devices to make the almost 5,000 medals awarded to the athletes. And it's not just our computers and phones. Everything from electric cars to wind turbines and solar panels — things we need to transition the world to net-zero emissions — require an array of metals, like silver, palladium, platinum, copper, aluminium and rare-earths, such as neodymium. So where will we get them from? Will we have enough? And what role can recycling and reuse play in ensuring we can supply our technology needs into the future? With the US under Joe Biden aiming to have its electricity sector ""carbon-pollution free"" by 2035, the nation is already ramping up a suite of clean energy projects. Last week US Wind Inc put in a bid to build up to 82 wind turbines off the coast of Maryland to supply the grid with an extra 1.2 gigawatts of power. That's part of a plan to install enough wind turbines to supply the US with 30 gigawatts — enough to power 10 million American homes — by 2030. Each wind turbine contains several hundred tonnes of materials, including anywhere between 2.4 and 6.7 tonnes of copper per megawatt, including the distribution and collector cables, according to the Copper Alliance. Other metals in turbines include steel, aluminium and iron, as well as cobalt and rare-earths. And those figures are just to supply a fraction of the US grid's power. Natural resource and mining consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimated in 2019, before the Biden administration ramped up climate goals, that globally we'd need more than 5.5 million tonnes of copper to build wind turbines alone over the following 10 years. For reference, Australia's entire annual copper exports are under 1 million tonnes. And the amount of copper-per-megawatt in solar power plants is only marginally less than wind. Then there are the world's cars. Scientists agree that to limit catastrophic climate change, we need to get to net-zero emissions globally by 2050 at the absolute latest — ideally, well before then. That means a transition to 100 per cent electric vehicles. But of the roughly 63 million cars sold worldwide in 2020, less than 5 per cent were electric. When we start to consider all the metals involved — nickel, cobalt, lithium, rare-earths and silver among them — to build the world's electric vehicles, solar panels, smart phones, computers and batteries, the numbers start to get pretty staggering. Broadly, we can think about two categories of metals: major metals that we already mine and use in large quantities, and the more niche metals, such as cobalt and rare-earths. Major metal supply probably won't be an issue, according to Eleonore Lebre of the Sustainable Minerals Institute at the University of Queensland. ""In terms of mining, you will require much more mining of major metals because the [demand is] much higher,"" Dr Lebre said. ""We don't have a scarcity of [major] metals. That's not the problem."" But supply could become an issue for the more niche metals, said Richard Corkish,  a solar energy researcher at UNSW. ""If we're really going to replace the world's fossil fuels, then really dramatic [niche metal] production is going to take place, much more than recently,"" Dr Corkish said. He said solar technology uses a lot of silver, as well as a very niche type of low-iron sand to achieve its highly transparent glass. ""The industry is learning to use less silver, but [solar] production is expanding. ""I'm even starting to wonder about the [supply of] sands that go into the cells."" Given that renewable energy supplied just over a quarter of Australia's energy mix in 2020, Australia alone is going to have to roughly quadruple the capacity of its clean energy infrastructure (including hydro-electricity and battery storage) to get close to net-zero. Dr Lebre said that rather than supply, she's more worried about the impact that such intensive mining will have on the environment and vulnerable societies. ""I am not really concerned about the supply itself. I'm concerned about the consequences,"" she said. ""At the moment, the way mining is done, they're not very good at working with local communities and what they do with the mine itself after it closes. ""That's the problem."" Currently, most of the world's copper comes from Chile, followed by China and Peru, according to Australian minerals exploration company Taruga. Cobalt, which is in many batteries including those from leading electric car manufacturers, mostly comes from Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where child labour and other human rights abuses, as well as environmental degradation, are rife. ""Cobalt is currently being mined in the DRC, which is a bit of a problem,"" Dr Lebre said. However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk last year announced a move away from using cobalt in the company's car batteries, although it's still used in many smartphones and other battery-powered devices. One of the leading battery alternatives to cobalt is nickel, with the largest reserves of nickel lying in Indonesia and Australia, according to the US Geological Survey. Then there are rare-earths — elements like neodymium and yttrium which we use in smartphone displays, LED lights, flat-screen televisions and computer displays. The lion's share of rare-earth reserves are in China. ""China is very much keeping a monopoly over rare-earths,"" Dr Lebre said. ""If they wanted to constrain supply they could. There have been other countries that have done stuff like that."" But across China and inner Mongolia, rare-earth mining has left behind toxic tailings dams and evaporation ponds. In some cases, they have overflowed into waterways and leached into groundwater. A podcast that opens a window on the beautiful sounds of the Australian wilderness. There are significant rare-earth reserves in Australia too. Although Australia has stricter environmental compliance than countries such as China, mining here can still have significant environmental impacts. An Australian company, for instance, has run into local opposition in Malaysia. That company mines rare-earth ores in Western Australia and exports them to Malaysia, where their processing leaves behind slightly radioactive waste. If mining of rare-earths and other metals such as lithium and copper is going to expand in Australia, Dr Lebre said the industry as a whole needs to improve its environmental accountability. ""It's worse in countries that have poor governance and don't have good safeguards. But it's also the case in Australia,"" she said. ""In Australia, you have tens of thousands of abandoned mines — abandonment of mines still happens now. You have mines that are put on 'care and maintenance' and that's it."" There's a pervasive myth that renewable energy technologies like solar panels can't be recycled. Like most myths, it's based on a kernel of truth, according to Dr Corkish. The difficulty in recycling solar panels comes down to the clear coating that encapsulates the panels — ethylene vinyl acetate. However, there are several methods — thermal, chemical and mechanical — of removing this coating. The major issue though, especially as the cost of solar panels continues to drop, is that it's cheaper to buy new panels than recycle the old ones. The solution, as is the case with recycling many types of materials, needs to be policy-driven. There are plenty of models to achieve this, including a levy scheme already being used in Europe, Dr Corkish said. ""The general idea is that customers pay a levy when they buy a product, and that goes into a pool to pay for the end of life of the product."" Although our initial transition to clean energy can't be achieved through recycling alone, reusing those materials once they've been dug up will be crucial to achieving any sort of sustainable future, according to Veena Sahajwalla from the University of New South Wales. Professor Sahajwalla's team at the Centre for Sustainable Materials Research and Technology (SMaRT) has developed e-waste ""microfactories"" which, she says, can be rolled out at a community scale for local resource recovery. ""Technologies developed and being developed by the SMaRT Centre can recycle and reform many of the materials from electronic waste that contain copper, manganese, zinc, gold and various rare-earth elements,"" Professor Sahajwalla said. Professor Sahajwalla is one of many advocates of a transition to a circular economy — where the costs of recycling are factored into the cost of production and we move away from a linear model of putting constant pressure on virgin materials. ""With the growth in electric vehicles, wind turbines, domestic solar systems, and so many batteries ... it is often overlooked that almost all of the materials needed to electrify our world are finite in supply."" Other options to recycling include repurposing, such as installing electric car batteries into home storage systems once they're no longer viable in vehicles. Fundamentally, though, if we're going to achieve any sort of environmentally sustainable, socially responsible future, we must consume less in the first place. Second, according to Professor Sahajwalla, is to reimagine the concept of ""waste"". ""We need a change of mindset that values our materials and challenges our throw-away mentality,"" she said. ""New government policies pleasingly include rare-earths (such as neodymium found in computer hard drives) as a national priority and there is also a renewed focus across all levels of government to better manage our waste, recycling and manufacturing resources.""

420,"As the planet warms, these farmers are adapting to an uncertain future",environment," Science Farmers on SA's Eyre Peninsula adapting to climate change with water-saving research and renewable technology If the climate becomes drier, farmers in some parts of the Eyre Peninsula could find it harder to make a living. But they're already adapting to an uncertain future of climate change and dwindling townships. Bruce Heddle stands in the middle of a paddock and squints against the bright sunshine. Around his feet, planted in neat parallel furrows, bright green blades of wheat, each no longer than a pen, flutter in the wind. ""The seeds are planted in two precise rows with the fertiliser placed right in the middle, between them, very precisely,"" he says. ""And when it rains, the water is funnelled to the bottom of the furrow, where the seeds and fertiliser are."" Three steps to his left, the ground looks a bit different. This section of the paddock was tilled — that is, the soil churned, turned and levelled — before the wheat seeds were planted. At the moment, the young plants in the tilled soil look just as vibrant and healthy as their counterparts in furrows, with no weeds in sight. Whether that's still the case come harvest time towards the end of the year, only time will tell. This is an experiment Bruce is running on his farm, just outside the town of Minnipa on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula. It compares the current super-precise style of farming with an adaptation of the more old-fashioned approach of tilling the soil before seeding. Tilling to control weeds has the benefit of using less herbicide, but also has a trade-off — disturbing the soil risks erosion, not to mention losing precious water to evaporation. While Bruce's tilled-vs-no-till experiment is more to satisfy his own curiosity than anything else, a short drive down a dirt track takes us to another paddock, one that's part of a larger project across the Eyre Peninsula. This paddock is rigged up to an array of probes and monitoring systems. A solar-powered transmitter beams soil moisture information straight to Bruce's smartphone. Because out here, soil moisture is everything. The Minnipa area is classified as a low-rainfall zone. It receives an average of less than 350 millimetres each year. The soil's ruddy hue is an ever-present reminder that we're on the edge of the outback. Yet the western region of the Eyre Peninsula manages to churn out around 10 per cent of the state's total wheat and barley production. And how it will cope under a changing climate is, at least for now, up in the air. Half an hour down the Eyre Highway, in the town of Wudinna, a massive granite statue — the ""Big Farmer"" — faces towering white silos on the other side of the bitumen. The statue represents the good years as well as the bad, according to the plaque. ""On the female side, the seven missing grains from the wheat head symbols symbolises hungry years, hardship and battle for survival."" Hardship is right. Before European settlers could harvest crops from the cleared land, they needed to harvest water. There were very few rivers around here. Digging dams was a futile exercise. The soil simply did not hold water. But 1.6-billion-year-old granite domes rising gently from the landscape would offer a source of sorts. This is Kokatha country, and the circular pools that dot the top of these huge monoliths served as water sources for First Nations people for thousands of years. In the early 1900s, settlers built low walls around a handful of domes to funnel run-off into underground tanks and natural granite bowls, like the basin at one end of Polda Rock, just north of Wudinna. Around this time, the newly laid railway line bearing water tankers sealed with tar started bringing the precious liquid from down south — but this wasn't fail safe. Your allotted tanker sprung a leak on its journey north? Too bad. You got what was left in it. And sometimes the water smelt and tasted so strongly of tar not even the horses would drink it. These days, a concrete pipeline runs along the now-disused railway line to supply towns along the Eyre Highway. And the Polda Rock reservoir still provides water to the town of Wudinna today, with a little help from a solar-powered pump, says Eleanor Scholz, mayor of the district. Eleanor grew up in Minnipa and knows how hard life can be on these drier fringes of cropping country. In dry years, relentless gusty winds whipped up topsoil and drove it across the land, turning the sky red. ""I always remember we had a huge dust storm as a little kid,"" she recalls. ""The sky went dark, and the older kids told us it was the end of the world — and we believed them."" She gestures to the fresh new growth surrounding Polda Rock. It's late June, and hard to imagine thick, soupy dust storms looming over the region just a month earlier. ""This year, we've had … really dry conditions and as the soil moisture goes, and as the wind starts blowing, the dust just blows again,"" Eleanor says. ""But … a good rain and everything, within a week or two, is turning green again."" ""Good rain"" is somewhat of an understatement. Mention the recent rains at the Minnipa pub, and locals effusively chime in and rattle off a bunch of statistics. Minnipa's average June rainfall is 35 millimetres. Last year, they barely got half that. This year, the Bureau of Meteorology registered 72 mm for the month … and some farms were drenched with nearly twice that. It's not over either. Veils of rain continue to drift lazily across the horizon. The fickle nature of rainfall year to year means farmers must trap as much as possible in the soil, even from the thunderstorms that roll in over summer, months before any seeds are planted. They do this by leaving as much of the previous crop's residue, such as old, dead stems, on the surface, and kill summer weeds, which suck up and whisk away precious water stored below. This means a brown paddock strewn with scraps of last year's crop is not necessarily a dry one — at least, not once you get below the surface. But even with the best water-trapping measures, if there's no rain, there's no soil moisture. Gareth Scholz has felt this pain. (Just a note on the Scholzes: there are quite a few in the area, all related, if only distantly. That's because in 1914, two Scholz brothers moved to the area to farm. Each had six sons, and they all became farmers too.) Gareth and his wife Roanne run 2,600 hectares of cropping and grazing land just north of Minnipa. He calls his first years of farming ""a bit of a baptism of fire"". ""When I first started going out and farming on my own, we had three of the worst droughts — some of the worst droughts my father had ever seen — in a row in 2006, 2007 and 2008,"" he says. Those years, they were lucky to harvest the amount of seed they sowed. But in 2009, the drought broke — in a big way. It was the best year in living memory and kicked off a golden run that lasted until 2016. Rainfall-wise, 2016 to 2020 were on the drier side, but soil-moisture-retaining techniques meant crop yields were about average. ""Everyone has a go at the Bureau of Meteorology for getting the rainfall wrong, but you can't predict it,"" Gareth says. ""There's so many times where your neighbour will get twice as much rainfall as you. ""And that rain might be the one that comes at the right time."" Gareth's property straddles what's known as Goyder's Line — a boundary drawn back in 1865 by then-Surveyor-General George Goyder. He was given the job of mapping the extent of the Great 1860s Drought, which devastated much of South Australia. Some 50 years before the township of Minnipa was proclaimed, Goyder made his way on horseback across the state. Guided by chats with graziers and the presence of hardy, scrubby, desert-dwelling plants like saltbush and mulga, Goyder traced his ""line of rainfall"" on the map. Goyder's Line eventually became considered the border between safe cropping land to the south and riskier cropping land to the north. And back in the day, farming on the wrong side of the line could potentially put a dampener on your social life, says CSIRO climate applications scientist Uday Nidumolu. ""There are stories of families not wanting their daughters to marry farmers north of Goyder's Line."" But as the decades wore on, it became clear that Goyder's Line was less a precise perimeter and more of a guide. Now, in some areas, farmers successfully grow crops a good 100 kilometres north of the line. In 2012, Dr Nidumolu and colleagues from the CSIRO and South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI) found that if they drew a line based on the ratio of rainfall and evaporation, it more accurately reflected the real cropping boundary of South Australia. In the same paper, they mapped how their line might shift under two projected climate models — one modelling a wetter future and the other, a drier one. Should the conditions that feed into the drier model come to pass, their line might start to shuffle southwards, making it more difficult to grow profitable crops in the Upper Eyre Peninsula. Dr Nidumolu says it's important to note that we don't know how far south this line may shift — or if it will shift at all. ""There's a range of things that can happen,"" he says. ""The future lies somewhere in between the extremes."" Because that's the thing about rainfall and climate change. While climate scientists are very confident that average temperatures will change — things will heat up — there is less confidence around changes to rainfall in the coming decade, according to Peter Hayman, a climate applications scientist at SARDI and study co-author. ""Climate science would bet an expensive bottle of wine that the next decade will be warmer, but probably a cheaper bottle of wine that it will be drier,"" Dr Hayman says. Warming is a real concern, he adds, ""especially as it increases the chance of hot days in spring when crops are vulnerable"". The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report found warming has already reached 1.4C in Australia. You might expect electorates with a high climate risk to want more action on climate policy, but that's not always the case. But changes to rainfall patterns are most worrying — and most uncertain. ""A low level of drying in coming decades is something farmers can adapt to, but more severe drying, say greater than 15 per cent, will present a major challenge,"" Dr Hayman says. Indeed, water security is important to three-quarters of full-time Eyre Peninsula farmers, according to the Rural landholder social benchmarking report 2020. This is despite only 43 per cent of those surveyed agreeing that climate change poses a risk to the region. This finding echoes the Australia Talks National Survey 2021, which tells us people in rural areas are generally less likely than those elsewhere to think climate change is a serious problem that needs to be urgently addressed. Well before the threat of climate change reared its head, farmers adapted to make the most of their land. European settlers quickly realised farming techniques used in Britain simply wouldn't work on the Upper Eyre Peninsula, and adjusted their practices accordingly. They diversified, too. Decades ago, most farms here only grew wheat. Now, come September, rippling paddocks of wheat and barley are interspersed with blocks of golden canola flowers or low rows of shrubby lentils. And still others — such as Tim Scholz, a farmer in the Wudinna area — are keen to use the land to produce something entirely different. ""We produce energy currently off of our land — we do it in the form of food,"" he says. ""It's human energy, human food, but it still takes the sun and the wind and the rain to produce that. ""And we have a lot of latent energy that falls on our land every day, and nothing happens with it."" That latent energy, Tim envisions, could be harvested by solar panels and wind farms, then be used to make green ammonia from water and air. Ammonia — a gas made of a nitrogen atom bonded to three hydrogens — is a strategic choice for a couple of reasons. First up, it can be cooled and compressed into a liquid, then shipped off around the world. When it gets to its destination it can be separated into nitrogen gas and — crucially — hydrogen gas. With the rise of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles, and a prediction that hydrogen may comprise a quarter of the world's energy demands by 2050, the market for green hydrogen is strong — especially in Europe and Asia, Tim says. Ammonia could also literally go back into the earth on which solar and wind farms stand, as zero-carbon fertiliser. A focus on green ammonia and zero-carbon farming in a region where many farmers don't consider climate change to be a risk, Tim adds, isn't a matter of pitching ideologies against each other. ""It's really saying there are new economics happening here. And the world has decided, rightly or wrongly, that it wants a low-carbon future — and certainly needs to. ""The reality is, for the past 300 years, we've dug up a whole lot of carbon that was sequestered in an earlier time in history, and now we're putting it back in the atmosphere. ""So we must make some changes."" The region's ability to continually adapt and improve has its downsides. In a way, it's become a victim of its own success. Over the decades, farmers have switched to no-till farming, used machinery capable of seeding entire farms in a matter of days — not weeks — and planted fast-growing, more productive crop varietals. As yields increased, so too have expectations, Bruce Heddle says. ""What was a good crop for my dad would be regarded as a pretty average one these days."" New technology allowing farms to be bigger than ever, paired with low interest rates, means farmers are only too happy to buy out and absorb their neighbours, if the offer is there. This trend of ever-growing farms isn't going to stop either, Bruce says: ""We're not going to turn this back. No, the genie's out of the bottle."" And as families sell up and move away, towns like Minnipa have been shrinking. Gone are the days when multiple buses, chock full, would ferry students to and from the local school. Today, fewer than 60 students attend the school, which spans primary and secondary year levels. Younger people don't tend to stay in the area, and the population of Minnipa is ageing. At the 2016 census, the median age of Minnipa residents was 51 years old. The state's median age is 40. But perhaps Minnipa's dwindling population is best illustrated by the town's footy and netball clubs. This season they aligned with clubs from Elliston, a town 90 kilometres south as the crow flies. While Bruce says he has only 10 or 11 crops left in him — his beard is more salt than pepper these days — Gareth Scholz, on the northern side of town, has at least a few dozen. Gareth is optimistic that he and his family will make it work, whatever hand they're dealt. ""We're always working around the climate and we're constantly adapting to that if we can,"" he says. ""Even if the climate's remaining the same, if we can utilise our resources like water better, we can be more productive anyway."" He's one of many farmers to embrace technologies such as drones, and is keen to trial cattle ear tags or microchips, which could let him and Roanne keep their herds within ""virtual fences"" and monitor the animals' health. And when he's ready to hang up his boots, would he like to see his kids take over? ""Oh, definitely,"" he says with a grin. ""I'd always like to get the next generation to come through and teach them. ""Yeah, I think there's a bright future in agriculture.""

421,700yo Aboriginal Maternity Tree set alight in Victoria,environment,"  700-year-old birthing tree damaged by fire, devastating Dja Dja Wurrung community A 700-year-old red gum birthing tree was set on fire in Talbot, Victoria, earlier this week, devastating the Dja Dja Wurrung community. Thousands of Aboriginal women are believed to have used the Maternity Tree. Dja Dja Wurrung woman Racquel Kerr said she was distressed when she heard about the incident. ""This is something that has provided cultural security, a legacy, to Dja Dja Wurrung people, for generations,"" she said. ""It symbolises the regeneration of life, the continuation of Dja Dja Wurrung people."" Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation Rodney Carter said keeping the tradition and the sacred site alive was immensely important. ""It is a form of immediate connection to our history and to our past,"" he said. Police say someone or several people set the Maternity Tree, off Pollocks Road in Talbot, on fire on Thursday night sometime between 6:00pm and 10:00pm. Witnesses reported seeing an as yet unidentified vehicle in the area. Victoria Police acknowledged the distress the incident caused. ""Police are actively engaging with Aboriginal stakeholders and an investigation into the incident is ongoing,"" they said. One its limbs has broken off, but the tree will recover, Mr Carter said. ""It's had to have a couple of slots cut into [another] one of the limbs,"" he said. ""But for the most part the integrity of the tree's been saved."" Anyone who witnessed the fire, saw a suspicious vehicle in the area or has any information that could assist police with their enquiries is urged to contact Crime stoppers on 1800 333 000. Ms Kerr said the focus now was on educating the community and preserving the sacred site. ""It's really about how we can make this a learning experience for other people,"" she said. The tree has a 15-metre-girth and its hollowed-out centre was used as a shelter by the Dja Dja Wurrung clan, particularly by Dja Dja Wurrung women giving birth. It is recorded as a Significant Tree on the Register of the National Trust. Local Aboriginal leaders say they are grateful they have not lost the tree and want to focus on preserving sacred sites like these. ""It's a remnant of my culture,"" Mr Carter said. ""There's so much that's been intruded upon, modified and removed from our landscape. ""This is such an important connection to the past.""

422,"analysis: The giant centipedes roaming Phillip Island eating 3,700 seabird chicks each year",environment,"  Giant bird-eating centipedes exist — and they’re surprisingly important for their ecosystem Giant bird-eating centipedes may sound like something out of a science-fiction film — but they're not. On tiny Phillip Island, part of the South Pacific's Norfolk Island group, the Phillip Island centipede (Cormocephalus coynei) population can kill and eat up to 3,700 seabird chicks each year. And this is entirely natural. This unique creature endemic to Phillip Island has a diet consisting of an unusually large proportion of vertebrate animals including seabird chicks. As large marine predators, seabirds usually sit at the top of the food chain. But our new study, published in The American Naturalist, demonstrates this isn't always the case. We show how large, predatory arthropods can play an important role in the food webs of island ecosystems. And the Phillip Island centipede achieves this through its highly varied diet. This centipede can grow to almost one foot (or 30.5cm) in length. It is armed with a potent venom encased in two pincer-like appendages called ""forcipules"", which it uses to immobilise its prey. Its body is protected by shield-like armoured plates that line each of the many segments that make up its length. On warm and humid nights, these strictly nocturnal arthropods hunt through thick leaf litter, navigating a labyrinth of seabird burrows peppered across the forest floor. A centipede on the prowl will use its two ultra-sensitive antennae to navigate as it seeks prey. The centipede hunts an unexpectedly varied range of quarry, from crickets to seabird chicks, geckos and skinks. It even hunts fish — dropped by seabirds called black noddies (Anous minuta) that make their nests in the trees above. Soon after we began our research on the ecology of Phillip Island's burrowing seabirds, we discovered chicks of black-winged petrels (Pterodroma nigripennis) were falling prey to the Phillip Island centipede. We knew this needed further investigation, so we set out to unravel the mystery of this large arthropod's dietary habits. To find out what these centipedes were eating, we studied their feeding activities at night and recorded the prey species they were targeting. We also monitored petrel chicks in their burrow nests every few days, for months at a time. We eventually began to see consistent injury patterns among chicks that were killed. We even witnessed one centipede attacking and eating a chick. From the rates of predation we observed, we calculated that the Phillip Island centipede population can kill and eat between 2,109 and 3,724 petrel chicks each year. The black-winged petrels — of which there are up to 19,000 breeding pairs on the island — appear to be resilient to this level of predation. And the predation of black-winged petrels by Phillip Island centipedes is an entirely natural predator-prey relationship. By preying on vertebrates, the centipedes trap nutrients brought from the ocean by seabirds and distribute them around the island. In some sense, they've taken the place (or ecological niche) of predatory mammals, which are absent from the island. Up until just a few decades ago the Phillip Island Centipede was very rare. In fact, it was only formally described as a species in 1984. After an intensive search in 1980, only a few small individuals were found. The species's rarity back then was most likely due to severely degraded habitats caused by pigs, goats and rabbits introduced by humans to the island. The removal of these invasive pests enabled black-winged petrels to colonise. Their population has since exploded and they're now the most abundant of the 13 seabird species that breed on Phillip Island. They provide a high-quality food source for the Phillip Island centipede and have therefore likely helped centipede population to recover. Ancient bone deposits in the soil suggest that prior to the black-winged petrel's arrival, Phillip Island was home to large numbers of other small burrow-nesting seabird species. It's likely the Phillip Island centipede preyed on these seabirds too. Now, thanks to the conservation efforts of Norfolk Island National Park, the island's forest is regenerating alongside endemic species like the centipede, as well as the critically endangered Phillip Island hibiscus (Hibiscus insularis). As a driver of nutrient transfer, the persistence of the Phillip Island centipede (and its healthy appetite) might just be key to the island's ecosystem recovery. But we'll need to do more research to fully understand the intricate links in this bustling food web. Luke Halpin is an ecologist from Monash University.

423,Pristine outback sites near Broken Hill ruined by 'parasites' dumping rubbish,environment,"  Pristine outback sites near Broken Hill ruined by 'parasites' dumping rubbish Despite the threat of fines and jail time – people continue to illegally dump rubbish on remote properties near Broken Hill. The frustrated owners of the properties say they are fed up with it and want something done urgently. ""There's sheeting scattered along the Nine Mile Road for two or three kilometres,"" according to landowner Greg Lawrence. ""It's happened more than a couple of times it's happened. ""It makes you wild. Someone's got to clean it up. They're just ratbags. ""They're just parasites, they're scumbags to me."" Landholders like Mr Lawrence say they've had furniture, sheeting and green waste dumped more than a handful of times. ""They've got no brains, it's cost them more in fuel to go out there and dump that rubbish,"" he said. ""They're thinking they're saving money by going out and doing that, but they're just making a huge mess for the environment that someone's got to clean up. ""We've got a cactus problem, and that all started with some idiot dumping their rubbish. ""Just because people have a station, with a lot of space doesn't mean it gives anyone the right to dump rubbish on their yard,"" according to Barrier Police District Inspector Tom Aylett. It's an issue that is more widespread than Nine Mile Station, although the isolated area north of town is the most common site. Police are confused about why people continue to illegal dispose of waste, when the cost of using the tip pales in comparison to any fine if caught. ""It just defies me that people would forego paying $15 for the risk of getting a fine for $4,000,"" Inspector Aylett said. ""There's a fine of $4,000 that can be issued by police or $7,000 that would be issued by the EPA. ""If you get a second fine within a five-year period the fine can go to an amount of $15,000. ""You can get two years' jail. He said there had been an example about two years ago when the EPA prosecuted a person for at second dumping offence and they were jailed.

424,Forest logging agreement ranging from Sydney to Queensland to be challenged in court,environment,"  Forest logging agreement ranging from Sydney to Queensland to be challenged in court An agreement that allows coastal logging to continue between Sydney and the Queensland border is to be challenged in the Federal Court. The North East Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) was signed in 1999 and renewed in 2018 for another 20 years. Chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office (EDO), David Morris, said it would argue the Commonwealth made the decision without regard to endangered species, the state of old-growth forests, or the impacts of climate change. ""[It] allows forestry to go ahead on the basis of an assessment that was carried out 20-plus years ago,"" he said. ""We're using that assessment to permit continued native forest logging for another 20-plus years."" Mr Morris said the situation was like ""having a media policy which didn't refer to the internet"". The EDO is acting on behalf of the North East Forest Alliance (NEFA). The NEFA's Susie Russell said it was potentially a landmark case, and the first time an RFA had been challenged in New South Wales. She said the federal and state governments relied on the RFA to exempt forestry operations in the region from the usual Commonwealth environmental assessment and approval requirements. ""It's basically a get-out-of-jail-free card for the logging industry where they are exempt from federal environmental law,"" she said. ""So if our case is successful, that exemption will no longer apply. ""Both governments have effectively rubber-stamped ongoing destruction of our forest ecosystems. ""It is appalling that in the face of the twin global crises of rapidly changing climatic conditions and biodiversity decline that all they could do is agree to more of the same without considering the science."" The NSW branch of the Australian Forest Products Association issued a statement that labelled the challenge as time-wasting and inappropriate. Chief executive Sue Grau said the High Court and the Federal Court recently rejected similar claims in Tasmania and Victoria. The 2018 NSW-Commonwealth agreement that will govern logging in native forests until 2039 and beyond is being criticised as a step backwards. ""Australia's rigorous RFA framework has withstood these claims, with the courts holding that RFA forestry operations operate with strong environmental controls and in parallel with the Environment Protection Biodiversity and Conservation (EPBC) Act,"" she said. ""During the current COVID crisis and building boom across NSW, many families are struggling to get enough timber to meet market demand for construction. ""If we don't use sustainably sourced hardwood from northern NSW ... inevitably this shortfall will have to come from places with often far less sustainable forestry practices."" Ms Grau said the native hardwood industry used the equivalent of six trees out of every 10,000 and those were then replaced through regeneration.

425,Macquarie Island sits on a 'highly active tectonic environment'. Now there are calls to assess its tsunami risk,environment,"  Quake and tsunami safety concerns for Macquarie Island expeditioners In 1989, a magnitude-8.2 earthquake on Macquarie Island shook expeditioners out of their bunks. It captured the attention of geophysicists around the world and has been touted as the largest intra-oceanic earthquake of the 20th century. It is not often we think of tsunamis occurring near Australia, especially near Tasmania. But Macquarie Island — located about 1,600 kilometres south-east of Tasmania — is a particularly volatile tectonic environment. The island sits on the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the Australian Plate, which continues to the north as the Alpine Fault on the South Island of New Zealand. Motion along this plate boundary in the Macquarie Island region and on the Alpine Fault is similar. It is for that reason one marine geophysicist is concerned about the occurrence of tsunamis affecting Australia's research station on Macquarie Island. The federal Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment is currently looking into modernising the Macquarie Island research centre. The station sits close to the water on an isthmus — a narrow piece of land connecting two parts of the island. After a detailed planning phase, it was concluded renovating rather than replacing the current station was the preferred option. But the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works began taking public submissions on the matter and has just finished. If approved, the renovation is set to begin this year and includes removing older redundant buildings, renovating the main living and science buildings and removing asbestos. Renovations are expected to take seven years to complete. Among them is a submission from recently emeritus professor at the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) and marine geophysicist professor Mike Coffin. Macquarie Island is home to millions of penguins and up to 80,000 seals, but did you know it was briefly considered for a penal settlement? Professor Coffin writes that the risk of a tsunami to the station from underwater landslides is currently ""unassessed"" despite the island's ""highly active tectonic environment"". He says he ""strongly recommends"" modernisation of the scientific research station on Macquarie Island ""be deferred until such potential hazard and risk are modelled and assessed"". Professor Coffin wrote the ""elevation of a modernised scientific research station"" should be ""confirmed or adjusted"" so it is suitable to ""mitigate tsunami hazard and risk arising from both submarine mass-wasting and earthquakes"". Speaking to the ABC, Professor Coffin said there were two major ways a tsunami could be triggered — an earthquake, or a submarine (underwater) landslide. He said smaller earthquakes took place in the Macquarie Island region. But there had been bigger ones too. He said the most-recent magnitude-8 earthquake was in 2004, and the most notable earthquake in recent history was the 1989 event. The tsunamis they generated were to the order of tens of centimetres. Professor Coffin said his main concern was that while Geoscience Australia had undertaken risk assessment in relation to tsunamis caused by earthquakes, it had not done so for those caused by submarine landslides, which also occur frequently in the Macquarie Island region, and can be similarly hazardous. He said assessing risk would help ""ensure the safety and wellbeing of everyone who works on Macquarie Island"". Once a risk assessment is carried out, planners would be able to decide whether the station should be put on higher ground. ""The bulk of the island is on a plateau, a couple of hundred metres above sea level, so I'm pretty sure you'd be safe up there,"" Professor Coffin said. ""But I think pretty much everything that's been designated as possible for rebuilding the station is pretty low lying."" He said without a risk assessment, ""we'd be much less confident that the people on the island are safe at low elevations above sea level"". ""As the Japanese [Fukushima] experience showed in 2011, the highest tsunami generated from that was about 40 metres above sea level. So, the risk is there,"" he said. ""They have tsunami warning systems on the island from earthquakes, but landslides don't necessarily get triggered by earthquakes, landslides can just happen on their own, so an earthquake monitor might not tell you when a tsunami is going to be generated on the island."" Professor Coffin said there was so far no evidence to suggest whether there had ever been a notable tsunami on the island. ""But absence of evidence does not equate to evidence of absence,"" he said. Geoscience Australia senior seismologist professor Phil Cummins said it was likely Macquarie Island had some tsunami risk associated with it. ""I would say it's something we should be concerned about, and it merits investigation,"" Professor Cummins said. ""It's near a plate boundary, there are large earthquakes that occur nearby but what has been recently identified in a marine survey is that there are some large marine landslide scarps underneath the ocean nearby Macquarie Island and those can potentially generate large tsunamis,"" he said. ""It has a very pronounced topography, and a very high slope that's sustained over a considerable distance so that does immediately make one question whether there could be large landslides."" He said the likelihood of a large tsunami on the island was not known. ""There's certainly potential there but how frequently does it happen and how big do they get, those are still open questions,"" Professor Cummins said. The general manager of assets and infrastructure at the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD), Rob Bryson, said it was ""not aware of any studies on the prevalence of underwater landslides in the area, but would consider any recommendations from this type of research"". He said work on the current station infrastructure ""needs to start immediately to improve the condition of some of the station's aging infrastructure"". Mr Bryson said over the last decade, the AAD had undertaken several tsunami mitigations, including but not limited to regular drills and training for expeditioners, the development of a rapid emergency response plan and a Tsunami alarm system on station. A tsunami cache is also stocked with food to last 40 expeditioners for 10 days. The project to upgrade 73-year-old sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island station began in 2016, with a $50 million commitment from the Federal Government in 2018.

426,This wasp has only ever been seen once. It may already be extinct,environment," Science The quest to catalogue Australia's insect biodiversity using AI technology To be clear, this wasp has actually only ever been seen once. So, it does seem a little futile to be scouring the side of the mountains in Namadgi National Park looking for a very particular, very small insect. But that's what insect scientist Dr Juanita Rodriguez and her team from CSIRO and the Australian National Insect Collection are doing. ""It's called Epipompilus namadgi,"" she says across the hillside on Ngunnawal country in the Australian Capital Territory. ""It's about one centimetre long, then the legs are reddish, and the forelegs are kind of enlarged, like kind of muscly."" But this spider wasp is very rare;  it was scientifically identified from a single specimen that was discovered in 2018. That means only one individual has ever been found. Catalyst explores the forefront of science and technology. Catch up on the latest episodes on iview. ""This area of the park hadn't been burnt for a while, they hadn't even done prescribed burns. It was very pristine,"" Dr Rodriguez says. ""So we decided to come here and collect. ""And we found a specimen that looked nothing like the other ones that had been described before. ""So we named it Epipompilus namadgi, based on the name of the national park."" But that individual was collected just before the fires burnt almost 80 per cent of Namadgi in Black Summer. The fire roared through the area where the spider wasp was found, leaving swathes of trees still standing as sticks across the hills on all sides. Now scientists are looking for the spider wasp, hoping it has survived the fires; hoping that one specimen was not the first, and the last, Namadgi spider wasp to be seen by modern scientists. Insects play a vital role in our ecosystems. But they are declining around the globe at an alarming rate, so it's vital that scientists catalogue how many insects we have so they know how many, like the spider wasp, we've potentially lost. Using tent-like traps stretched between trees, and sweeping huge insect nets across the grass, the scientists collect hundreds of tiny insects, midges, flies, moths and wasps, along with a plethora of mosquitoes that took their last buzzes into an instantaneous ethanol death. Bryan Lessard points to one of the delicate mozzies, sodden but preserved in the alcohol. ""This one is particularly interesting to me,"" Dr Lessard says, knowing full well that every single mozzie and fly in the tray is of particular interest to him. ""There's 400 mosquitoes in Australia. But only half of them have been named."" A podcast that opens a window on the beautiful sounds of the Australian wilderness. That many named species means there is an enormous amount of work ahead for taxonomists like Dr Lessard, who says it takes something like two years' work to name just one species. ""The reason why we know there's 200 undescribed [mosquitoes] is because there was a worker in the '80s called Pat Marks and she actually allocated all these new species, but passed before she could actually get around to naming them,"" he says. Dr Elizabeth Nesta ""Pat"" Marks, AO, described 38 new species of mosquito across her career, an epic contribution to our knowledge of Australian insects. ""So my work is kind of picking up where Pat left off to name these species,"" Dr Lessard says. ""But of course, in 40 years technology has changed. And now we're able to get DNA out of our museum collection. ""And if we could tell that to Pat in the '80s, that we can use DNA to confirm her new species, she would be blown away. ""It's kind of going back to the future almost."" And that's not the only thing that Pat would be surprised and delighted by. Inside the corridors of the National Insect Collection headquarters in Canberra, the air feels solid with the smell of naphthalene mothballs. Dr Lessard walks through a room the size of a basketball court full of compactus, in turn full of lockers, which in turn are full of drawers, which are full of boxes. Enclosed within this temperature-controlled environment of pins and ethanol, there are 12 million individual insects, forming a priceless (quite literally) record of Australia's biodiversity since colonisation. One of the treasures in the collection is a small bug collected by Charles Darwin. Each year, the collection grows by another 100,000 specimens. ""This is a group of flies called Boreoides,"" Dr Lessard says. ""The females are wingless so they're quite distinctive. There's three species known in this group, but in the past five years we've discovered 23 new ones. ""No-one's actually worked on the group for 100 years. And look how big these flies are; they're quite obvious. ""It's surprising no-one's taken the time to actually look at them."" But time is something that's not on the side of the taxonomist. A legend of the field like Pat Marks got to name 38 species of mozzie in her career, so to deal with this sort of scale of data available to them today, the scientists are going to need some help. Dr Lessard walks through a labyrinth of ticks, ants, butterflies and katydids to a tiny room full of cameras, computers, and intensely concentrating scientists. This is the high-resolution stack imaging system that the CSIRO is using to digitise the National Insect Collection. By taking hundreds of images at different focal lengths, this set-up produces astonishing resolution images of the specimens, showing their tiny details, which are imperative to identifying their species. ""Digitising isn't new. It's been around for a few decades. But the fact that we can produce these quality images with so many specimens — that's quite novel,"" Dr Lessard says. ""These images essentially unlock our collections. And anyone in the world can access our specimens from a computer. ""We're aiming at imaging all of our specimens in the collection. And because there's so many, we physically can't look at them ourselves. ""So we're feeding them into artificial intelligence programs to rapidly identify them for us."" At this stage, like first-time parents, the scientists are teaching the algorithm how to behave. ""I take this specimen and the first thing that we need to do is teach the machine what each feature is,"" says Dr Rodriguez, sitting in front of a bank of monitors. ""So I go ahead and label it, kind of like drawing around it with a pencil. I tell the computer this is an antennae. And I have to do that for many, many specimens. As the scientists trace more and more antennae, the machine learns to identify antennae, to identify sections of carapace, to count hairs and measure sizes. And in this way, the machine will then be able to flag what it thinks the specimen may be — whether that be a known species, or something new. ""It's something that would take us days because we would have to look down into the microscope, use the scale bar to measure each antennae [and] write it all down on a table,"" Dr Rodriguez says. ""[Whereas] the computer will do it automatically for us, instantaneously. ""This could make species discovery much quicker. And that will really speed up our knowledge on insect diversity. 'And also we're using AI not only to discover the species that we haven't described, but also to be able to identify the ones that have a name already on them. ""Our collection is like a library of life. So it has to be a good reference library."" One thing the technology can't do (yet) is walk the sides of the mountains at Namadgi. Despite all the preparation and catching literally hundreds of insects for the National Collection on this trip, there was no sign of the Namagdi spider wasp in the hills. ""We know so little about it; maybe it's something really simple, like we're here at the wrong time of year,"" Dr Rodriguez says. ""So, we'll just have to keep on searching.""

427,'Drawing attention': Climate activists occupy heart of Zurich financial district,environment,"  Climate activists occupy heart of Zurich financial district, block Credit Suisse and UBS buildings Swiss police have been forced to clear climate activists from the heart of Zurich's financial district after they blocked entrances to two major banks. They were protesting against lenders' financing of fossil fuel projects that damage the environment. Swiss police led away singing and chanting activists after they refused to disperse on Monday. They had taken up positions at the entrances to Credit Suisse and UBS in the Paradeplatz square in the Swiss financial hub. ""Credit Suisse and UBS have so far done anything but respond adequately to the climate crisis,"" Frida Kohlmann, spokesperson for the Rise Up for Change group, said in a statement. ""That is why the climate justice movement is occupying the Credit Suisse headquarters and the nearby UBS office today to draw attention to the consequences of the Swiss financial institutions' inaction."" Activists had staged a hoax outside Credit Suisse's headquarters last week. Dressed in formal business attire, they posed as representatives of the Swiss bank and announced over a microphone in Zurich's Paradeplat that its funding of fossil fuel would end. Credit Suisse declined to comment. The protests comes amid a wave of civil disobedience by activists in Switzerland. The European nation has seen the climate warm at about twice the pace of the global average, changing its famed mountain landscapes. Protesters say they plan to set up a ""climate camp"" in Zurich until August 6, inviting financial sector representatives to an open dialogue on Wednesday. Another protest addressing central bank policies is planned for August 6 in Bern.

428,'It's about capturing our voice': Tapping Ngarrindjeri knowledge of Coorong in Landcare partnership ,environment,"  Coorong Landcare project embraces Ngarrindjeri knowledge, cultural connection The Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal Corporation is sharing cultural knowledge of the Coorong with the Department of Environment to help manage the significant waterways into the future. The wetland is an area of enormous cultural significance to Ngarrindjeri, who have occupied and managed the land and waters for thousands of years. The database will target new areas of research, including breeding cycles of the jumping mullet, the significance of freshwater soaks and wells, and more. CEO of the Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal Corporation Tim Hartman said that it was vital to have a Landcare project with Ngarrindjeri actively taking leadership, to strengthen the broader community's understanding of cultural values. ""It's about capturing our voice, as Ngarrindjeri people, to ensure that our perspectives and values are included in the decision making and ongoing management of the Coorong,"" Mr Hartman said. ""We have significant storylines which talk about the creation of the land, the waters, the plants, the animals … and we've got a long history and experience on how to live sustainably within that natural environment. ""It's such a rich biodiversity landscape. It has such a long history as part of our creation stories."" Mr Hartman said the research would happen over the next 12 months but said it will be a challenge – with so many environmental variables a factor in the health of the Coorong. ""The current health of the Coorong, as well as the whole Murray Darling Basin, is completely dependent on water availability,"" he said. Want more local news?

429,Wonder of nature: Huge flocks of budgies in Australia's red centre,environment,"  Outback sees biggest budgie event in 10 years Thousands of brilliant budgerigars are flocking to the Australian outback thanks to perfect breeding conditions across the country. Mark Carter, Alice Springs bird watcher and trained zoologist, said that the region has not had a budgie event this big in 10 years. ""There was an event in 2016 which was localised to certain areas,"" Mr Carter said. ""This event involves huge number of birds across the landscape,"" he said. Mr Carter said it was hard to comprehend how many birds there were out there at the moment. ""If you do the maths on how many budgies are out there across the landscape, it's mind-boggling,"" He said that there are a few factors as to why the numbers have exploded. ""It's a combination of things: We had rain at the perfect time here and they bred up in other parts of Australia and gathered here,"" he said. Mr Carter said that those budgies subsequently have stayed and continued to breed resulting in extraordinary numbers across the region. He said that there was an abundance of food thanks to low cattle numbers and the budgies have ""cashed in on that"". ""The amount of grass seed out there has helped. ""I really do think that it was that the fact that the grass wasn't being eaten straight away, it was allowed to seed,"" he said. At dawn, budgies are flocking in their thousands to drink at water holes or dams across the red centre. ""It's got to be one of the most iconic sights in the outback… one of the great natural wonders of the world is these huge budgie flocks,"" he said. Mr Carter said that these parrots were very intelligent were at their most vulnerable when they were drinking. ""They feel a lot of safety in numbers. ""Any predator that decides to turn up here to try an ambush, [the budgies] have got a real advantage."" He said that budgies were extremely paranoid. ""They're in this group, they're really relying on the birds around them to spot trouble. ""If a bird of prey does come through and give them a fright, they react in the blink of an eye."" Once the food resources start to dwindle, the numbers of budgies will drop. ""The budgies are just going to move on. They're going to go and look for pastures new.""

430,It got so hot in Portland that its 20yo metro system started to warp. It could be a sign of things to come,environment,"  Portland's roads melted during last month's heatwave. So what does this extreme weather event tell us about climate change? Ever imagined a city so hot that the road melts and parts of the transport system start to warp and twist? What about an unprecedented cold snap that froze power lines in the usually balmy state of Texas? Or bushfire smoke travelling more than 4,000 kilometres from America's west coast to New York City, causing air pollution nine times the recommended level? And Germany recording roughly double the amount of rain expected for the entire month of July in just two days. This is now the lived reality for many parts of the world as severe weather events become more and more frequent. And it's prompting many of these communities to now ask themselves: how do we adapt to the new normal? According to climate scientist Bill Hare, it will require a dramatic shift in approach. ""Above all, it means future-proofing infrastructure and teaching people how to deal with extremes,"" he said. ""In some places, you're talking about simply giving up. In some places it will not work to build a seawall – five years later, it will be gone."" But before we get deep into how communities are going to have to completely re-think how they interact with the world, let's take a closer look at what happened in Portland. In short, it was very hot. The city's usually moderate summer broke records in June, literally melting through its hottest day ever. And as it maxed out at 44 degrees Celsius, Portland's relatively modern, 20-year-old metro system started to warp. A power cable twisted around some metal hardware and scorched, wires that run above the track expanded and sagged so much they risked touching train cars. The trams, powered by 100 per cent renewable energy, are exactly what the United States needs to reduce carbon pollution, but they were clearly built for another age. The heatwave was caused by an unusual weather phenomenon. Usually, hot air expands and rises, which then cools the planet's surface or helps create thunderstorms. But a high-pressure system sitting on the atmosphere trapped the hot air, causing a so-called heat dome. When the air tries to rise, the system nudges it back to the surface — and during that process, the air becomes denser and hotter. It can't escape the cycle, so it just circulates up and down, getting hotter and hotter. According to experts, the Portland example is a rare phenomenon and considered a one in 1,000-year event. But meteorologist Andrew Hoell from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the question scientists were now trying to answer was whether climate change is making these kinds of extremes more frequent. ""There are really two considerations here when it comes to events like that,"" he said. ""The first one is, how will climate change affect the weather patterns? So, the specific pattern that produces that type of warmth. ""The other question is the background warming that climate change produces, which is on the order of maybe two or three and perhaps even four degrees Fahrenheit. ""That's really an emerging area right now, that the community is trying to understand, is whether a pattern like that is now more likely to happen in a changing climate."" There's little doubt extreme weather events are increasing in intensity and frequency, but scientists are still trying to determine how climate change could influence the anomalies. ""Some folks are arguing that the weather patterns are becoming stronger and more amplified because of climate change,"" Mr Hoell said. ""And they're linking that to changes in the Arctic, so changing sea ice cover and land ice cover, and also the temperatures in the Arctic, and how that may affect the weather pattern say over North America and over Europe. ""That right there needs a lot more vetting, it needs a lot more research, but there is that hypothesis, out there right now that we need to test more thoroughly."" Mr Hoell said scientists use their knowledge of the weather, climate observations and model simulations to determine if extreme events like what has happened in Texas and the Pacific northwest are becoming more likely. ""If a certain event is going to become more likely, whether it's a heat event or cold event or an extreme precipitation event, you want to be able to plan for that,"" he said. ""And we want to use our best information possible."" Climate change isn't affecting all parts of the globe equally and the effects tend to be region-specific. Australia's horror bushfire season last year was arguably the country's most recent display of the impacts of climate change. ""The bushfires in Australia were exceptional. Now they were linked to some forms of what we call natural variability,"" Mr Hoell said. ""So, there was a pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies in the Indian Ocean, that were very closely related to that."" Mr Hoell said it also sparks a number of questions, such as whether that pattern of sea surface temperatures is now more likely in the changing climate. ""So did that feed into the exceptional fires but also, when it came to those fires, was the ground more arid because of climate change?"" he asked. Mr Hoell said the bushfires which transpired in Australia and the heatwave in Portland were events which only occur every 500 to 2,000 years but that was changing. He said if climate change is going to make some events twice as likely — for example, a one in 100-year event becoming a one in 50-year event — then that could have serious implications for current infrastructure. Take a bridge, for example. Instead of experiencing a rare weather event once during its lifetime, Mr Hoell said going by that model, it could now expect to experience it twice. ""So now it's twice going to have twice as much stress on it just because it's two events as opposed to one,"" he said. In North America, millions are being forced to confront a string of inescapable disasters as the nation endures a summer of record-breaking drought, heatwaves and megafires exacerbated by climate change. Groundwater and streams vital to both farmers and cities are drying up and fires are devouring entire neighbourhoods and livelihoods on an ever-increasing scale. While summer monsoon rains have brought some relief to the south-west, 99.9 per cent of Utah is locked in severe drought and reservoirs are less than half full. US President Joe Biden recently announced a mega $3.3 trillion dollar infrastructure plan designed to future-proof the nation's homes for weather extremes while also reducing carbon emissions by investing in clean technology. It's part of his plan to undertake the gigantic task of shifting the United States to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. ""It's actually a pretty intelligent thing to do, just because you're trying to use your best possible information to inform certain infrastructure,"" Mr Hoell said. ""Because if you don't do that, then you may experience a weather event or climate event that will ruin your infrastructure, then you have to do it all over again. ""The reason why this is such a priority with this administration and even was a priority with the Trump administration is because all the infrastructure that was built was built 50 to 100 years ago, [and it] needs to be replaced. ""So that's why this is really at the forefront of his agenda, is to try to make more informed decisions so the infrastructure will last."" Some states are also doing their part to weatherproof communities as well. California's largest electricity provider, Pacific Gas and Electric, plans to spend tens of billions, putting 16,000 kilometres of powerlines underground to prevent future bushfires. Parts of the state, which typically swelter through hot summers, have also set up cool rooms to house homeless people unable to escape the heat. Even Seattle, which is home to a far milder climate, set them up this year. ""Heatwaves kill people, as everyone says, silently, but they kill more if you don't understand them,"" Dr Hare said. ""If you're prepared — there's warning systems, there's welfare services in place — then you can get more people through the extreme heatwaves."" Governments will also have to start retrofitting buildings or replacing infrastructure better able to handle extremes on both ends of the climate spectrum. ""That's making sure cities are greener. You can lower the peak temperature by a number of degrees by focusing on that,"" Dr Hare said. ""Adaptation resilience sort of issues are labour-intensive, right, you've got to retrofit housings and buildings, you are spending money that's ultimately spent on labour and then you also impose the economic capacity of a country when things get too hot. ""Hot places have lower productivity, when it gets hot, people slow down. ""You're also trying to build economic resilience, the same with floods. If you can limit the infrastructure damages, then you're also building economic resilience to climate extremes."" Most scientists will tell you mitigating the effects of climate change by reducing our impact on carbon emissions is the best path forward. That's because continually adapting the world to ever-changing weather conditions will be expensive and inefficient. But Dr Hare seriously doubts many governments have the will to do it. ""You're talking about making hard decisions and very few governments are equipped to do that,"" he said. ""I'm hard-pressed to think of any governments who have serious approaches to this. ""It's a tough thing for governments because you're up against everyone."" He gives the example of governments being forced to determine whether parts of the planet are no longer habitable, even if it means moving a village that has existed for 500 years. ""It means looking at all infrastructure and slowly future-proofing it, when it's due for replacement or before,"" he said. ""It also means basically deciding that some places are not places for people to live safely.""

431,AI goes feral in fight to protect native species from wild cats on Kangaroo Island,environment,"  Machine-learning camera software gives humans new edge in fight against feral cats on Kangaroo Island A camera network that has ""learnt"" to identify feral cats is helping protect native animals and farming businesses on Kangaroo Island. Kangaroo Island Landscape Board has installed 70 cameras on the island's Dudley Peninsula to map where feral cats are active. Passing animals trigger the cameras and, rather than wait for humans to retrieve the pictures and interpret them, software identifies the animal. Feral cat eradication program project leader Dr James Smith said this network gave real-time information about cat movements. ""One of the biggest issues for us is knowing where to focus our efforts and to do that, we need a lot of eyes on the ground,"" he said. ""The best way to do that traditionally has been to put out camera traps. Of course, the more camera traps you put out, the more time you have to spend changing the batteries, looking through the images and maintaining the cameras. ""So, we're moving now towards a 4G connected system, where the cameras take a photo of an animal that walks past the camera and that gets sent to a company called eVorta, which runs a machine-learning algorithm over the image and it can detect cats and echidnas and bandicoots and other species of interest to us. ""We estimate that every 25 of these cameras saves us about 40 days of staff time a year."" Feral cats not only hunt native wildlife but can also spread a disease called toxoplasmosis, which causes abortions and stillbirths in sheep and costs Australian agriculture $12 million a year. Machine learning involves computers teaching themselves to perform tasks by identifying patterns in data, such as pixels in an image. Hamish Shah is the founder and platform engineer for eVorta, the company that developed the technology the cameras on Kangaroo Island use to identify feral cats. Mr Shah said it was more efficient to create a system to train itself rather than try and program it all themselves. ""Before this, we wrote bits of code to look for shapes or something very specific but then we handed over the skill of learning what an animal is entirely to a computer and we gave it some basic premises, which are kind of how our eyes already work,"" he said. ""So, at one side of the neural network it would look for maybe patterns like individual dots that connect up, and then as you go deeper into the neural network it will start seeing fluff or fur. ""And then it goes a bit deeper into a neural network that says, 'OK, if you see the sort of pattern, it is probably a fur pattern' and then as you go deeper and deeper still, it's like, 'OK, this is the tail'. ""Eventually it will get to a point where it can classify [what it sees] as a cat."" Dr Smith said the Kangaroo Island Landscape Board wanted to eventually install 200 cameras on the Dudley Peninsula as part of its goal of eradicating feral cats in that area by the middle of 2023.

432,Newcrest Cadia mine's dust report fails to prove residents are not at risk,environment,"  Newcrest Cadia mine's dust report triggers community health investigation request Three years after its tailings dam wall collapsed in the NSW Central West, Newcrest's Cadia Valley Operations — the world's second largest gold mine — has released their report into tailings dust environmental health impacts. The report, titled Tailings dust environmental health assessment and monitoring study review, released this month, sought to assure employees and those living in the mine's neighbourhood that dust lift from the CVO tailings dams posed no risk to public health. It did this, despite acknowledging the presence of efflorescent salts and regular exceedances of particulate matter (PM)2.5, prompting the community to seek expert advice. ""The Cadia District Protection Group approached independent expert Dora Pearce on the epidemiological impacts of dust emanating from mine waste,"" mine neighbour Frances Retallack said. Dora Pearce is a recently retired environmental epidemiologist whose doctoral research investigated the link between soil arsenic concentration and cancer incidence in the Victorian goldfields. In her experience with mine waste, she said the presence of efflorescent salts was a serious cause for concern. Efflorescent salts occur on gold mine tailings dams when tailings dry out. Once any residual moisture evaporates from tailings, a crust of very fine particulate matter can appear on the surface of the tailings, known as efflorescent salts. Especially subject to wind erosion due to their superfine appearance, efflorescent salts are also likely to be highly concentrated. ""Even when the total metal concentration in tailings is relatively low, a study by Meza-Figueroa et al. in 2009 demonstrated that efflorescent salts accumulated some metals to alarming concentrations,"" Dr Pearce said. Since Cadia Valley Operations' northern tailings storage facility embankment slumped in 2018, tailings have been permitted to dry out, given they are no longer contained. The embankment slump has also coincided with white dust events in the Cadia and Errowanbang valleys, flanking the mine — something the report confirms was likely related. ""Approximately 10 to 20 wt% of deposited dust reporting to DDGs [dust deposit gauges] was in a soluble form, consistent with a theory that highly soluble efflorescent [surface] materials from the tailings would be the most likely to be mobilised as dust in windy conditions and travel the furthest,"" the report said. ""This suggests, at least to some extent, that deposited dust is influenced by tailings dust."" For Dr Pearce, the dust's white appearance and a resident requiring medical treatment after direct exposure, was cause for serious concern. ""People may be breathing in very fine efflorescent salt particles which are likely to contain elevated concentrations of potentially toxic elements."" The report notes the presence of ""highly soluble efflorescent [surface] materials"";  that is, particles that dissolve easily on contact with wet surfaces. For this reason, the report focused on any impact the dust lift might have had on water quality in the mine neighbourhood, such as dams and rainwater tanks. However, it does not address any respiratory implications of inhaling efflorescent salts. ""Lung linings are wet, corneas are wet. The solubility of these airborne particles increases the risk of pulmonary and eye irritation,"" Dr Pearce said. When asked if efflorescent salts were known to cause respiratory complications, the report's author, Paul Harrison, said they could. ""I guess; yes, that would be true,"" Mr Harrison said. ""But I guess the issue is, for respiratory impact, it doesn't have to be soluble."" Dr Pearce said: ""Dust emissions offsite from mining operations are known to have the potential to adversely impact the health and wellbeing of exposed communities."" ""But disease severity can also be affected by the solubility, chemical characteristics and size of inhaled particles."" Mr Harrison told the ABC that tailings samples taken for the report fell within health guidelines for chemical components. ""There's nothing particularly toxic about them,"" Mr Harrison said. ""The results are all very low for metal contaminants."" In the report, a company called Earth Systems provided Newcrest with a sampling protocol for the tailings, including taking five bulk samples from each tailings dam and a minimum of three efflorescence-rich samples from each tailings dam surface. It also prescribed two windblown dust samples be taken adjacent to each tailings dam. Overall, Earth Systems recommended a total of 16 tailings samples be taken and analysed. Only eight were taken by Newcrest staff. Of these eight, only two were surface samples. For Dr Pearce, these deviations from Earth System's prescribed sampling strategy were intensely problematic. ""How can representativeness of tailings dust, particularly in regards to efflorescence, be justified?"" Dr Pearce said. Inconsistencies between tabulated monitor names and mapped locations of monitors also appear in the report, raising concern over accuracy for both Dr Pearce and those living in the mine neighbourhood. ""Comprehensive and precise dust monitoring data is crucial if the environmental health impact of offsite dust emissions is to be correctly interpreted,"" Dr Pearce explains. Monitors – both deposited dust gauges and particulate matter monitors known as TEOMs, were referred to by locations that did not match either their actual geographic location or their listed identification tags. ""Fundamentally, Dr Pearce's point is that the data on which conclusions have been based is flawed from a scientific perspective,"" resident Mrs Retallack said. The risk to those living in the mine neighbourhood broadly revolves around exposure to three factors – particulate matter (PM)10, PM2.5 and respirable crystalline silica (RCS). Despite the report being written to ""address community concerns"", only one community site was monitored for PM2.5 – and only as an indirect consequence of monitoring for the known lung carcinogen RCS. As with the tailings, an independent consultant prescribed the sampling protocol for RCS — in this case a company called Todorokski Air Sciences. However, sampling was not carried out at the two community air monitoring sites recommended by Todoroski, but at other sites chosen by Newcrest. Exceedances of annual air quality criterion for PM2.5 were frequently observed from July to December 2020 and while the annual criterion for RCS wasn't exceeded during the period, it was elevated as a percentage of the PM10 fraction of tailings samples. For landholders living in the valleys flanking the mine, the monitor and sampling anomalies, as well as limited or selective in-situ community monitors was further evidence Newcrest was failing to take the environmental health impact of the dust events seriously. ""Ongoing refusal to measure PM2.5, coupled with obfuscation regarding efflorescence only rings more alarms,"" Mrs Retallack said. ""Our resolve is strengthened to keep pushing for proper dust monitoring, particularly PM2.5."" Following the release of the report, the Cadia and District Protection Group lodged a request for an environmental health impact assessment with NSW Health. For Errowanbang resident Gem Green, it was about getting a bigger picture. ""There are 280 landholders that are known to be receptors of dust by Newcrest,"" Mrs Green said. ""When you know of a few neighbours with upper respiratory challenges and a significant number of locals who have experienced cancer in the last three years, there are pertinent questions that warrant investigation from a community health point of view. ""This is about community advocacy."" The move is supported by Dr Pearce, who said the mine's report failed to prove there was no risk to the community's environmental health, given the limited data. ""The commencement of analysis of metals concentrations in PM10 in April 2020, and PM2.5 and RCS concentrations in July 2020, has delayed the availability of environmental health data required to protect the potentially exposed community and instigate mitigation measures,"" Dr Pearce said. Dr Pearce believes it should not be the responsibility of a community to ask for environmental studies. ""Requesting a community environmental health assessment is a huge task for a community,"" Dr Pearce said. ""Surely, social and environmental accountability must be prioritised by the mining company and regulatory government agencies."" Newcrest's Cadia Valley Operations provided the following statement to the ABC in response to an interview request: ""In 2019, Cadia commissioned a tailings dust environmental health assessment and monitoring study review [the Study] through Serinus Health Safety and Environment consultants. The Study required the collection of data over a nominated period, then an extensive assessment and review process, before the public release of the Study in July 2021. The Study has been developed by reputable, independent specialists who are considered experts in their field. It is a compilation of studies, with the final report peer reviewed, evaluated and consolidated into one final document [referenced as 'The Study']. While the Study is a highly technical report, it concludes that based on the data and information available from the Study, and the ambient dust levels measured by the Study, there is no current evidence to suggest that dust from the CVO tailings storage facilities or emissions from the mine ventilation system pose a health risk to the community. The Study has been released publicly, along with a fact sheet which provides a high level summary of the Study's findings. We have also presented the outcomes of the Study at two community meetings over the past six months, where Paul Harrison, the author of the primary Study, presents his findings. The Study also details a series of recommendations, which has been welcomed by Cadia. Based on these recommendations, we will continue our monitoring program, particularly focussing on ambient air quality sampling around the operation. We will continue to provide regular updates on dust management activities to the community. We continue to welcome the opportunity to discuss the Study and its findings with the community through our regular community consultation meetings, and at the request of our community members.""

433,Our bill for feral cats comes in at $18 billion — but that's not the worst figure,environment," Science Invasive species have cost Australia $390 billion in the past 60 years, study shows They trample fragile environments and devastate crops, and now we can put a figure on how much damage invasive species like feral cats and weedy plants are doing to Australia's bottom line. Invasive species have cost the Australian economy $390 billion in just the past 60 years, according to research published in the journal NeoBiota today. Feral cats are the most costly individual species, which is mostly down to population control, coming in at over $18 billion. But it's weedy plants that are the most expensive group on the list, according to author Corey Bradshaw from Flinders University. ""That's not a surprise because they affect the agriculture industry mostly, and so there's a big economic incentive to assess how many are out there and report those costs,"" Professor Bradshaw said. The total cost of an invasive species was determined by looking at things like crop or livestock damage; the combined cost of management including eradication; and even human salaries. But although staggering, Professor Bradshaw said the $390 billion figure is probably an underestimation. ""This is just the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. ""Because it's really difficult to put monetary costs on things like ecological function, or even bushfire risk."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. With ryegrass, parthenium and ragwort highest on the list, invasive plants have cost the economy over $200 billion since the 1960s. In Tasmania, the pasture weed ragwort accounts for over 50 per cent of the state's invasive species costs. And in South Australia and Victoria, common heliotrope is the costliest of all invasive species. ""All of those costs are borne by the farmers, which then pass on to consumers, and in taxpayer money through government investment,"" Professor Bradshaw said. But despite this research being the most up to date and expansive assessment of the total cost of invasive species, Professor Bradshaw acknowledges there are some glaring omissions. ""We couldn't find a single economic assessment for root rot — that widespread and very economically damaging species to both agricultural and ecosystems,"" he said. ""People often focus on the ecological damage, but they don't provide the economic costs of managing it or trying to eradicate it."" By the time an invasive species is recognised as problematic, it's usually been there for a while. Want even more science, health, environment and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. ""Unless you detect it really early and do something about it, it's often too late,"" Professor Bradshaw said. ""The key is [to] invest hard in detection and early eradication, and you can save yourself billions — literally."" Putting a value on the less tangible costs of invasive species is also critical, according to Andreas Glanznig, chief executive officer of the Centre for Invasive Species Solutions, who was not involved in the research. ""The other side that's not as strongly represented in this study, is putting monetary value to environmental and social costs,"" Mr Glanznig said. ""I think this is a very important paper in both its scope and sophistication, that can be improved in the future as more data becomes available. ""What this study really emphasises is that the invasive species are a huge drag on efforts by farmers and industries to lift agricultural productivity.""

434,How Aboriginal culture can teach us how to live with less and tread more lightly,environment,"  How Aboriginal culture can teach us how to live with less and tread more lightly If you're looking to live more sustainably, ancient Aboriginal culture could give you some ideas for treading more lightly on the planet. Jamie Thomas comes from a timber industry town in Victoria's Far East Gippsland but he isn't anti-logging or anti-mining. ""If I was anti-logging or anti-mining I wouldn't buy anything that was timber and I wouldn't have a laptop or a phone because all of those resources come from the forest or the ground,"" Mr Thomas said. But he does get upset by what he sees as people destroying the planet, taking too much from nature and not being aware of the biodiversity loss of their actions. ""Men are very disconnected from the narrative of wellbeing, of connection, of sustainability, but when you put it into context about their children and future generations, a little light bulb goes off in their head,"" he said. He asks them: ""If I had a time machine and I went forward a thousand years and brought one of your descendants back, what do you think they would say to you?"" ""Don't you want fresh air, clean water and good soil for them to grow their food?"" Mr Thomas is executive director of Wayapa Wuurrk, an earth connection practice based on ancient Indigenous wisdom that focuses on taking care of the Earth for the wellbeing of all. Mr Thomas, a senior cultural knowledge holder for his Peek Whuurrung People of the Maara Nation and GunaiKurnai Communities, co-created the practice with his partner Sara Jones to honour Australia's First Nations as being among the oldest continuing cultures. ""It's an earth connection practice based on earth mindfulness, meditation, physical movements but also the practicality of how we can take care of Mother Earth,"" he said. Mr Thomas and Ms Jones have been sharing Wayapa Wuurrk — which means ""connect to the Earth"" in the language of the Maara and GunaiKurnai Peoples — for five years and now have 150 practitioners around Australia, half of whom are Indigenous. ""Wayapa is about honouring every individual's ancestry, and the individual's culture and honouring and understanding that First Nations people lived well for over 100,000 years because they were connected to their environment,"" he said. ""They understood it. ""At the end of the day, all human beings have ancestors going back tens of thousands of years that did the same thing, it's just that we've lost that connection with Country because we haven't bothered looking after it."" Examples from Aboriginal culture of sustainable living include the use of and spiritual attachment to plants and animals, the conservation and use of natural resources in line with traditional wisdom, and recognition of the spiritual and economic significance of various environments. Mr Thomas says that by actively participating in Aboriginal culture, people can facilitate a sense of belonging and purpose, connecting them to Country. ""We have practitioners who are Hindi, Catholic, Scientologists, creation theorists, atheists, witches, but they all understand that it doesn't matter what their religion or spirituality or connection to it is, they all agree that it is the oneness of everything we are connected to."" But how do we take ancient Indigenous knowledge and put it into a modern concept? What can we do? The answer, according to Mr Thomas, is to be mindful of over-consuming. He says Aboriginal wellbeing practices don't judge people on their journey but encourage them to look around their environment to see what they can change. ""This isn't airy-fairy, this is about humanity's ongoing life on this planet,"" he said. ""It's about connecting people to the responsibility of why they are doing what they do."" Simple things that are easy to change but will have a big impact on the future of our planet include shopping with sustainability at the forefront of your mind. ""Change to organic car-washing liquid or bio-degradable window cleaner because that's going to affect our environment, and don't you want future generations to be able to eat fish from the sea?"" Mr Thomas said. He says asking yourself a few questions before you purchase could help in your decision-making process. ""By healing Country, and healing ourselves, what we are really doing is healing future generations who will follow on from us,"" he said. Dharawal woman Jasmine Corr, a visual artist and teacher, completed a Wayapa Wuurrk practitioner diploma in 2019. ""It's the first Aboriginal Australian modality to be accredited in the world, which is really significant,"" Ms Corr said. Anthony McKnight, senior lecturer at the University of Wollongong's School of Education, said the accreditation referred to the health field. ""There are heaps of Aboriginal courses, so I'd say it's an Aboriginal approach to healing, accredited within the Western system,"" Dr McKnight said. ""But … Aboriginal approaches to healing don't need to be accredited in the Western system to work."" Ms Corr says empowering Aboriginal people to become practitioners and operate their own businesses facilitates a space to bring together Aboriginal and non-Indigenous people. ""We aren't exclusive to one or the other, it's something that we can share together,"" she said. ""Sharing knowledge is really important because we are on Aboriginal land and Country, so we need to adhere appropriately. ""Much like yoga and pilates, which came from other countries, we have a wellbeing modality from Australia. ""We should be practising that because this is our country, our home, and we are part of this country."" Ms Corr said the longest relationship anyone would have in their lives was with Mother Earth. ""We come from her and we'll go back to her, so we really need to focus on that philosophy of connecting,"" she said. ""An Earth connection — it's the best free WiFi we have."" Mr Thomas says individuals can make a difference and encourages people to think about how their decisions affect the environment. ""Don't blame the government, we voted them in. Stop blaming corporations because we are buying their products,"" he said. Mr Thomas says that, as a collective, people have the power to make change, and Dr McKnight agrees with him. ""Our culture is all about connection, not separation, and at some stage everyone was connected to Country and history,"" Dr McKnight said. ""Every country in the world, at some stage of their history, people were strongly connected to Country and the only way you can truly heal, is through Country. ""If you look at the violence in our society, we are representing what humans are doing to Country. ""If we reduce the violence to Country, then the violence in the human world will reduce as well, because it's that connected. ""If everyone started doing a little thing each day to take care of water, to take care of our air, it's going to make a massive difference.""

435,A geologist brought home some ancient rock 20 years ago. She may have stumbled on the world's oldest animal fossil,environment," Science Geologist may have found 890-million-year-old sea sponges in ancient reefs of Canada's Mackenzie Mountains Two decades ago, geologist Elizabeth Turner set out to explore the ancient reefs locked away in the Mackenzie Mountains in north-west Canada. Her heart was set on understanding how photosynthetic microbes had built huge reefs millions of years ago. Instead, the then-PhD student walked away with a pile of rocks, a handful of which had some pretty unusual features. But it turns out that Dr Turner may have stumbled across the earliest known animal fossils, according to a paper published today in Nature. The tiny structures embedded in the 890-million-year-old rocks look remarkably similar to the skeletons of sea sponges, suggesting that these simple creatures were thriving in the oceans earlier than previously thought. Dr Turner said the structures were too complex to have been created by algae or bacteria. “The process of elimination says that it can't be these other things,"" said Dr Turner, who is now based at Laurentian University in Ontario. ""The fact that other workers have found this structure in [younger] fossil sponges kind of put the nail in the coffin."" But some scientists are sceptical about whether the fossils are sponges or may have even been created by a biological process. Sponges are simple animals that were around long before the dinosaurs, making them useful for studying how life on Earth evolved from single-celled organisms to the animals we know today, including humans. So far, the oldest fossilised traces of sponges in ancient rocks date to around 540 million years old, placing them at the beginning of the Cambrian — a period when evolution kicked into high gear and produced an extraordinary diversity of animals. But the genes of modern sponges suggest they could have emerged up to 400 million years earlier than their fossils suggest. This suggests they could have been around before Dickinsonia, a flat, oval-shaped creature that has left behind 558-million-year-old fossils, which currently top the list as the earliest known animal remains in the geological record. Finding fossilised sponges that date back this far is no easy task, as their soft bodies don't preserve as well in rocks as animals with hard skeletons, making them difficult to distinguish from other types of fossils. It also doesn't help that ancient sponges are much simpler than their modern counterparts, said Jochen Brocks, a geobiologist who specialises in ancient ecosystems at the Australian National University. ""If you go further and further back in time, much of the complexity disappears and it becomes harder and harder to recognise what you're looking at,"" said Professor Brocks, who was not involved in the study. ""The more simple it is, the more likely it is that something non-biological made it by pure accident."" But if the fossils Dr Turner found are indeed ancient sponges, it means they were thriving in oceans 90 million years before oxygen was abundant on Earth, suggesting animal life may have begun evolving before this event. Dr Turner said the ancient reefs where these sponges lived could have been ""oxygen factories"", thanks to the cyanobacteria that they lived alongside. ""There may well have been oases of higher oxygen,"" Dr Turner said. ""[Sponges] may have hunkered down there for a few 100 million years."" The findings also suggest some animal life made it through a massive ice age that took place between 720 and 635 million years ago. ""In all probability, these glaciations did not wipe out life and it didn't have to start out all over again afterwards,"" Dr Turner said. Dr Turner unknowingly discovered the tiny 890-million-year-old fossils when she was looking at the hundreds of rock samples she had taken from her field site in the mountains. While she was more interested in looking for traces of reef-building microbes in the rocks, a handful of samples stood out. “I found this other microscopic structure that was totally out of place; like, it was much more complicated than anything that could be made by microbes,"" Dr Turner said. Dr Turner knew she was onto something, but decided to put the unusual rock slices aside for a deeper look some other time. Twenty years later, Dr Turner finally got a chance to slip the samples under the microscope. The slices contained an intricate pattern of tube-shaped structures that branch out in three dimensions. ""That's a pretty complicated structure,"" Dr Turner said. The branching pattern of the fossils also looked remarkably similar to the skeletons of horny sponges that live today, and those seen in younger sponge fossils. Professor Brocks says while more work needs to be done to confirm the fossils are sponges, their age matches with estimates of when they may have first appeared. ""It makes sense. That's sort of the timing where we think that could have happened,"" Professor Brocks said. But Professor Brocks isn't totally convinced that the sponge-like structures are a smoking gun. In fact, ""they may have nothing to do with biology at all,"" he said, adding that carbonate minerals can also form in branching structures.

Jim Gehling, a palaeontologist at the South Australian Museum, added that the fossils don't show classic physical features of sponges, such as an opening for filtering seawater or expelling waste. This makes it difficult to tell whether the mesh-like fossils are truly sponges, or colonies of marine algae that take on a similar appearance, he said. ""For a fossil to be a sponge it needs to preserve evidence of structural complexity,"" said Dr Gehling, who was not involved in the study. ""Unfortunately, it is very difficult to separate early fossil sponges from early bacterial colonies."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

436,Scientists have checked Earth's vital signs since the pandemic — and it's bad news,environment," Science Chances are in the past 18 months you've heard someone exclaim that air travel is at an all-time low, and how good that must be for the climate. But scientists have confirmed that despite many industries and human activities slowing during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Earth's ""vital signs"" have actually worsened over the past two years. And with catastrophic floods in Europe and India, unprecedented heatwaves in British Columbia and dozens of wildfires raging across the US west, it's frighteningly obvious that the climate emergency is not going anywhere. The research, published on Wednesday in the scientific journal BioScience, is not peer reviewed, but is a continuation of the 2019 climate emergency declaration, which was endorsed by over 11,000 scientists. That number now sits at over 14,000 scientists from 158 countries. The scientists involved chose 31 indicators that correspond to the effects of human activities on the climate, environment, and society, in an attempt to broaden discussions of climate change beyond global surface temperatures. These indicators, which they call Earth's ""vital signs"", include things like human population, meat production, tree cover loss, carbon dioxide emissions, national declarations of climate emergency, and sea-level change. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many of these ""vital signs"", but also provided insights into how a major shift in human activity can impact climate change, according to report author Thomas Newsome from the University of Sydney. ""Even with that decline in air transport and the general slowdown in human movement, it generally didn't have an overall impact on greenhouse gas emissions,"" Dr Newsome said. ""Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions have reached all-time highs over the last two years, so they continued to rise in step with surface temperatures."" Temporary declines in air transport, world GDP, energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, have all started to return to pre-pandemic levels, Dr Newsome said. ""It suggests that much more fundamental changes to the way we produce energy are needed than a slight shift in one particular sector,"" he said. The pandemic has also had little impact on the rate of forest-cover loss in the Amazon, which increased to a 12-year high in 2020. And the number of ruminant livestock worldwide has not been slowed down by the pandemic either — it now reaches over 4 billion. That means the total mass of ruminant livestock on the planet is now more than that of all humans and wild mammals combined, which contributes significantly to the production of methane and is also a driver of deforestation. A shift in both fossil fuels divestment and subsidies over the past two years does signal some movement in the right direction, Dr Newsome said. Around $8.8 trillion (US$6.5 trillion) was divested from fossil fuels between 2018 and 2020, with most of that being from faith-based groups, philanthropic foundations, education, government, and pension funds. And fossil fuel consumption subsidies — relating to prices consumers pay for energy — fell to a record low of $245 billion (US$181 billion) in 2020, which was 42 per cent lower than 2019 levels. ""It demonstrates that there are economic signals here that we're heading in the right direction,"" Dr Newsome said. ""Divesting in fossil fuels suggests that it's coming to an end, the world is moving towards renewables."" But despite an overall global decrease, two recent reports suggest fossil fuel subsidies are still holding back progress on emissions reductions. One report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development found that the reform of fossil fuel consumption subsidies in 32 countries could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5.5 billion tonnes by 2030. A separate report from BloombergNEF found that the level of support for all types of fossil fuel subsidies within G20 countries is incompatible with the Paris Agreement goals. And while we're responsible for a smaller slice of the subsidy pie, Australia had the largest percentage increase in fossil fuel subsidies from 2015-2019 of 48 per cent, according to the report. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Dr Newsome thinks Australia is becoming increasingly isolated from the rest of the world when it comes to emissions. ""Australia is an outlier in many respects, with both setting a clear target to reach net zero emissions and in terms of actually putting in place effective strategies to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""But equally, while the rest of the world is moving, we're not seeing the shifts yet in the data that suggests that anything to date has been effective in actually tackling the issue of climate change."" The report's researchers said the phasing out and eventual ban of fossil fuels is just one of the solutions required to find a way out of the climate emergency. An effective carbon price and environment reserves to restore natural carbon sinks are the other two key solutions proposed. While the ""vital signs"" are striking, the message is unsurprising, said lecturer in climate science and science communication at the University of Melbourne Linden Ashcroft, who was not involved in the research. ""It is a really effective way of showing people what's been going on, and echoes research that's going on in all different fields of science,"" Dr Ashcroft said. ""While we have dramatically changed the way we've lived in the last 18 months, it's going to require much more long-term, dramatic change to stop or even slow the worst impacts of climate change."" Dr Ashcroft said the sheer volume of the ""vital signs"" considered in the report meant some detail and nuance was lost. ""I'm going to be paying much more attention to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that comes out next month, because that's been through years and years of revisions and peer review,"" she said. The next IPCC report, due to be released on August 9, will be the most comprehensive assessment on the state of global heating since 2013. Dr Ashcroft said the paper would give an overview of a huge range of scientific fields and how they relate to climate change. ""I do think there is a place for this very impassioned scientific argument, but I also think there is a place for the IPCC-style report which brings together all of the climate research that's done all around the world to get an absolute, comprehensive picture of what's going on,"" Dr Ashcroft said.

437,Hot and humid weather in the Top End to return early due to Indian Ocean Dipole,environment,"  BOM NT predicts early onset of wet season build-up as July temperature records fall People in the Top End are being warned to brace for an early return to sweatbox conditions, with predictions an early onset of the wet season will bring the cooler dry season temperatures to a premature end. Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) modelling shows rain and high humidity levels are expected to envelop some parts of Northern Australia earlier than usual. Forecasters say the pre-wet season conditions known locally as the build-up – where soaring humidity propels many areas into sauna-like conditions – could begin as early as September. The driver behind the conditions is a phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole, which was recently declared negative for the first time in five years. That means central and southern parts of the country will become wetter throughout the colder months of the year. BOM senior forecaster Billy Lynch said it could also lead to early wet season downpours in the Top End. ""The rain that we would normally expect to experience during that September, October, November period could come earlier this season,"" he said. ""The prospects of seeing some rain in the Top End from September onwards is more likely."" Some parts of the Northern Territory have also sweltered through a scorching July, with record-breaking temperatures. On July 25, the remote community of Wadeye reached 35.6 degrees Celsius – its hottest July day in more than 20 years. In Victoria River Downs, a cattle station about 700 kilometres south of Darwin, a 37.7C day became the hottest maximum July temperature in 56 years. Mr Lynch said July temperature records in Central Australia could also tumble in the coming days. ""We're expecting to see that heat move southwards into central and southern NT, so we could even see some records across the south."" Alice Springs is forecast to have its hottest July day, at 32C, on Friday. Cooler temperatures will bring relief to southern and central parts of the NT from Sunday. The Top End will have to wait a bit longer, with a cool change not expected until the middle of next week.

438,The unlikely activists fighting climate change one legal action at a time,environment,"  Human rights issue or 'green lawfare'? Citizens take to the courts to fight climate change They don't fit the activist stereotype — some are farmers, some are from the suburbs, some are retired, and some are still going to school. Melbourne University's Jacqueline Peel calls them ""next generation"" litigants, ordinary citizens tired of political promises and eager to hold governments and companies to account. Many see climate change as a human rights issue and they're being assisted in their legal ambitions by a coterie of academics, lawyers and even judges. But there are also critics, who warn of ""green lawfare"" judicial activism and a threat to the democratic ideal of the separation of powers: that governments, not the courts, should determine national policy. Environmental law expert, Jacqueline McGlade, says the judicial landscape around climate change is changing rapidly. ""In the last two or three years we've doubled the number of cases that have been brought forward."" And those cases are being heard in court rooms across the globe from the United States to Pakistan to Australia, focused not just on current environmental threats, but on the risks to future generations, she says. ""Everybody knows that climate is going to impact everyone .... [it will] impact our fundamental human rights to life, to water, to food and so on, and that's how it is connected."" As an example, Professor McGlade nominates a case brought before Brazil's highest court in September 2020. Farmer, miners and land grabbers have used a weakening of Brazil's environmental protections to lay waste to swathes of the Amazon, and it could leave the Government open to being sued under its own climate change laws. ""The government was failing to properly administer the Amazon Fund, the mechanism that was set up to combat deforestation. ""The Supreme Court accepted that lawsuit last year and directed the government to actually provide information on why it wasn't managing the fund properly."" Then in March, the Federal Court of Australia ordered that Environment Minister, Sussan Ley, had a duty of care to protect young people from ""emissions of carbon dioxide into Earth's environment"". The case was brought against the minister by eight students and a nun and involved plans to expand a Northern NSW coal mine. The most internationally significant judicial decision of recent times occurred in a District Court in the Netherlands in May. It involved the giant multinational gas and oil producer Shell on the one side, and more than 17,000 co-plaintiffs on the other. Future Tense explores new ideas and new technologies. ""It was about Shell's accountability for the emissions it releases into the atmosphere and making sure that it was making appropriate reductions in those emissions over time,"" says Professor Peel, who believes the decision could set a global precedent. ""We've seen these kinds of actions against governments to hold them accountable for their emissions reduction targets [but] this was the first case in the world where you are seeing this kind of action being brought against a company."" The case has pricked the attention of industry across the world, she says. ""It's often said in relation to litigation that you probably only need one successful case to change the atmosphere in a boardroom. ""It puts companies on notice that they could be sued on similar grounds and could be held liable for the damages associated with the climate harms caused by their emissions."" Australian lawyer David Morris, from the non-profit legal service the Environmental Defenders Office, is also seeing the rapid growth in climate change-related lawsuits, but he says many litigants struggle to understand and navigate judicial processes. He works directly with individuals and communities to help them frame and prosecute their cases. He describes it as a ""redistribution of power"". ""It really goes to the integrity of our system, the idea that a small community group can stand up against the might of a major mining company or a government department and then win in court. ""It really ensures the integrity of our processes too. It ensures that when ministers are making important decisions which might have consequences over many decades, indeed well into the future, that they follow proper process."" Mr Morris says connection with country is increasingly being used as a litigation tool. ""Local community groups are often motivated by a deep love of place and a desire not to see that place destroyed. ""We see it increasingly in the work we do with traditional owners, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia, the deep connections that those people have to country and the impacts that they see from particular projects but also that they see from the growing impacts of climate change."" Yet official antipathy toward climate-related litigation is also on the rise. Ms Ley has appealed the recent Federal Court ruling made against her, arguing that she doesn't have a duty of care to protect Australian children from climate harm. A fast rise in legal challenges related to climate change reflects a belief that governments and business are not acting quickly enough. She and others in the Morrison government have repeatedly accused environmental organisations of waging ""lawfare"" against fossil fuel companies. ""We've often seen quite adverse reactions from politicians to a lot of the climate litigation,"" says Professor Peel, ""partly because it does reflect badly on the progress that politicians are making or not making in dealing with the challenge."" She says some in the judiciary are also cautious about hearing climate-related cases. ""There is a long-running debate in the legal sphere about what the role of judges should be, whether they should have a strong role in developing the law and taking it forward to address new circumstances and challenges. Or whether those functions should be best left with policymakers and parliaments."" But she says the framing of many ""next generation"" cases can be persuasive. ""You're seeing judges more willing often to go into that space because they think of it as an issue of justice where the law has a particular role to play. David Estrin from the International Bar Association rejects any notion of ""judicial activism"". While governments have a primary role in determining a nation's environmental laws, he argues, courts play an essential role in holding them to account when their actions fail to remain within the limits of the law. ""This mandate to the courts to offer legal protection, even against the government, is an essential component of a democratic state under the rule of law,"" he says, quoting a 2019 ruling by the Netherlands Supreme Court. Professor Peel argues a further increase in litigation is inevitable as long as there remains a perception that governments and companies aren't moving fast enough on climate change or aren't adhering to their own commitments. And David Morris predicts the next decade will see a significant shift in thinking. ""You will start to see an evolution of the jurisprudence in these spaces, so an evolution of the judges' thinking,"" he says, ""or of the court's findings in respect of some of these cases, which to date have been novel."" ""And what you'll see is a growing body of knowledge, a growing body of reasoning that starts to place very real pressure on companies and governments who fail to act swiftly.""

439,"Critically endangered birds find 'paradise', but for how long?",environment,"  Vulnerable hooded plovers find 'paradise' in coastal Victoria, but for how long? A south-west Victorian coastal city is being hailed as ""paradise"" for a vulnerable breed of beach-loving shorebirds. The hooded plover is considered vulnerable to extinction in mainland Australia and critically endangered in New South Wales. The fledgling shorebird lays its eggs in precarious positions during the warmer months, with beachside nests often found trampled by wayward dogs or other beach users. A strong push, however, from communities near south-west Victoria's Warrnambool, three hours west of Melbourne, has helped carve out a somewhat secure existence for a growing population of birds. Birdlife Australia, the nation's peak birdwatching society, conducts a national hooded plover report every two years. Volunteers scour beaches in Victoria, NSW, and South Australia across a number of weekends in November when the birds are at their most territorial, counting each animal by hand before feeding the information back into a central report. A total of 1,584 hooded plovers — 1,526 adults and 58 juveniles — were counted in the latest report, making up approximately 53 per cent of the estimated world population of 3,000 eastern hooded plovers. According to the latest figures, the beaches between Warrnambool and Yumbuck, near Portland, are proving something of a stronghold for the vulnerable bird. ""There are around 2.3 birds per kilometre there, which is way more than the usual 0.8-1 bird per kilometre,"" said Birdlife Australia's Grainne Maguire. ""The numbers are looking quite good, but we're just going to watch the next few years because we know the last few years have had quite poor breedings."" Ms Maguire praised the activism of the local community in fencing-off known breeding spots, allowing those chicks that hatch to mature in a safe environment. But rather than a blessing, the stay-home orders issued throughout the coroanvirus pandemic are being seen as something of a potential curse to hooded plovers. Hooded plovers, like most Australians, are beach lovers by nature. They are also highly selective of their ocean habitat, which is required to support their survival and reproductive needs. The birds nest from August to March, overlapping with the peak beach activity in Australia's eastern states. ""COVID's thrown another game-changer in that we're getting so many more local tourists now heading to Australia's coastline and that's putting a lot more pressure than we've seen before on our beaches,"" Ms Maguire said. ""If we want to have that coexistence [with the birds] and know how to share, you need to know which bit of beaches are theirs and which is ours."" Ms Maguire said the presence and improvement of the ""hoodie"" population is not only a good sign for bird lovers. ""They're real flagships because they tell us that our beaches and our coastline is quite healthy,"" she said. ""When you've got them present, and they're breeding well, it's an indicator that you've still got a healthy ecosystem.""

440,"analysis: Australia avoids global embarrassment, but the dangers for the reef are real",environment,"  Australia avoids Great Barrier Reef global embarrassment, but the dangers of climate change remain for the reef When the scientific advisors to UNESCO recommended the Great Barrier Reef be added to UNESCO's in-danger list, Environment Minister Sussan Ley claimed the process stunk. She argued it was a result of dirty politics, not science. So it's a matter of some irony that her victory this week — avoiding an in-danger list for at least another couple of years — comes after some skilled politicking. If there are claims that politics have swayed outcomes, then let's strip away the politics and look at the facts — the things that actually matter to the reef. The Great Barrier Reef will not be added to UNESCO's ""in danger"" list this year, after environment minister Sussan Ley's whirlwind diplomatic effort won enough support. In 2015, the Great Barrier Reef narrowly escaped being listed as ""in danger"". And regardless of that decision, and whether it fits UNESCO's criteria this time around, the facts show the reef clearly in danger. Mass bleaching events on the reef were a new — but still relatively rare — phenomenon back in 2015. The first one was in 1998 and then there was another in 2002. The combined impact of those two bleaching events, outbreaks of crown of thorns starfish and severe cyclones mean the reef had lost half of its hard coral cover since 1985. That rate of loss was unprecedented in the previous 400 years, according to the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Layered on top of that, the reef was being assaulted by fossil fuel giants developing major infrastructure along its coast. Three massive LNG plants had just been built in the World Heritage Area on Curtis Island off Gladstone, the construction of which involved dredging. And Adani was proposing to expand the Abbot point coal terminal, and dump dredge spoil in the World Heritage Area. Regardless, Australia was spared the embarrassment of an in-danger listing at the time, with stern words from UNESCO about acting on climate change, and the need for the reef's declines to halt and ""reverse"". But fast forward six years and Adani's dumping proceeded, mass bleaching events hit three times in five years, and Australia's policies on climate change have not grown in ambition. The 2016 and 2017 bleaching events wiped out half the shallow-water corals and the next year, coral reproduction dropped by nearly 90 per cent. ""Dead corals don't make babies,"" Professor Terry Hughes from James Cook University said at the time. Despite the 2020 bleaching event, the reef has been in a period of recovery since 2019, and the most fast-growing (but also most fragile) corals have boomed, and coral cover in many parts of the reef has today returned to levels not seen since the 1980s. The Great Barrier Reef is experiencing a rare window of recovery due to a break in weather and bleaching events according to the latest observations from marine scientists. But the repeated insults have changed the reef, and left it more vulnerable. Those fast-growing corals make up a much greater percentage of the overall cover, and are much more vulnerable to storms, bleaching and predation. ""Because of these vulnerabilities and likelihood of more climate-related severe weather events, future disturbances may result in rapid decline on these reefs,"" said Dr Mike Emslie from the Australian Institute of Marine Science when their long-term monitoring results were released this month. Through all this, the official outlook for the reef remains ""very poor"". And according to the federal government's Great Barrier Reef Authority: ""The window of opportunity to improve the Reef's long-term future is now."" Despite all that, Australia again avoided the embarrassment of a listing this year. But without Australia taking international leadership on climate change, it's hard to see how it will be avoided in the years to come. UNESCO has said that Australia's plan for the reef needed to include actions to address climate change, which are in line with the Paris Agreement, which involves trying to stop climate change at 1.5C of warming. That makes sense, because even at 1.5C of warming, up to 90 per cent of the world's corals could be lost. And for Australia's targets to be consistent with the agreement, Australia will need to nearly triple its ambition for 2030. All that certainly sounds like ""danger"" for the reef.

441,Great Barrier Reef avoids UNESCO 'in danger' tag after Australia says it makes 'no sense',environment,"  Great Barrier Reef avoids 'in danger' tag after Australian government lobbying convinces UNESCO Australia's Great Barrier Reef will not be added to UNESCO's ""in danger"" list this year, after Environment Minister Sussan Ley's whirlwind diplomatic effort won enough support to override the UN body's scientific advisers. The final motion, passed by the World Heritage Committee on Friday night, asked Australia to deliver an updated report on the state of the reef in February 2022, which would be considered at a meeting later that year. It also called for a reactive monitoring mission to visit Australia to study the reef's current condition. The timetable was faster than what was proposed by some countries — following lobbying by Australia — which would have seen the reef not considered for inclusion again until 2023. Ms Ley welcomed the decision and said it was never about Australia ""hiding from the challenges facing the reef or the pressures of climate change"". ""It has been about ensuring a fair and transparent process for the reef and the people who work tirelessly to protect it,"" she said. “Our concern was always that UNESCO had sought an immediate 'in danger' listing without appropriate consultation, without a site visit and without all the latest information, and it is clear that this process has concerned not only Australia but other nations as well."" The IUCN, which advises UNESCO on scientific matters, urged the committee to act urgently, quoting an Australian government report from 2019, which stated: ""The window of opportunity to improve the Reef's long-term future is now."" Speaking to the IUCN committee, Environment Minister Ms Ley said the draft decision to immediately inscribe the reef on the in danger list ""made no sense"". Her comments echoed those of a dozen other countries that moved an amendment to the draft decision, which delayed further consideration of including the reef on the list until 2023. Nineteen of the 21 committee members spoke in favour of that amendment. Norway proposed a further amendment, pulling the timetable forward one year, which was unanimously agreed to. Conservation groups, which hoped having the reef included on the list would spur action to save it, were disappointed by the result. ""[This] is a missed opportunity to shine a light on the Australian government's neglect of a natural wonder that remains at great risk due to the impacts of climate change,"" Greepeace said after the decision. But Imogen Zethoven, an adviser to the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the result was not what the government was hoping for either. ""They wanted to delay any reporting to the end of next year and then delay the committee considering the reef again until 2023. They did not get that,"" she said. The Great Barrier Reef's classification worsens to ""critical"", with climate change named the biggest threat to the planet's natural world heritage by a new report. WWF-Australia described the decision as putting Australia on ""probation"". ""Business as usual on climate will not prevent an in danger listing in a year's time,"" said Richard Leck, head of oceans at WWF-Australia. Labor spokeswoman on the environment Terri Butler said the decision was ""kicking the can down the road"". ""An 'in danger' listing would be a significant further blow to Queensland's tourism industry, with operators and local economies already reeling from the pandemic,"" she said. But Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the state government welcomed the UNESCO decision. ""Today's decision sets a clear timeline now for the federal government to show that it's acting to protect the Great Barrier Reef,"" he said. ""Just like we did in 2015, we need to work together to address the very clear science of the impacts of climate change and water quality. ""There are 60,000 jobs that rely on the reef, and it's imperative we act now to protect those jobs, especially as we recover from COVID-19."" Last month, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and the World Heritage Centre recommended that the reef be added to UNESCO's ""in danger"" list, mostly because of the effect of climate change. It noted that a plan for the reef's recovery needed to ""provide clear commitments to address threats from climate change"" that needed to be in line with the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement commits countries to try to stop warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius. Even with 1.5C of warming, coral reefs are expected to decline by up to 90 per cent. Australia's current commitment to reduce greenhouse gasses is in line with 3C of warming, according to Climate Tracker. And unlike most of Australia's major trading partners, the country has not committed to net zero emissions by the middle of the century. But several countries that spoke at the UNESCO meeting praised Australia's efforts to combat climate change. The representative of Ethiopia said: ""We appreciate the efforts of the Australian government with regard to its policies to promote green energy and to mitigate the effects of climate change."" And the representative of Hungary said: ""Australia is already playing a constructive role in the actions to address climate change at the global level."" After UNESCO scientific advisers recommended the reef be added to its ""in danger"" list, Ms Ley argued the decision was political rather than scientific. She then flew to several countries and returned to Australia having secured 12 backers to delay the decision for three years. It came on top of allegations that China — which was chairing the committee — had interfered with the independent scientific advice to the committee which recommended the reef be listed in danger. Several countries spoke out against those claims, defending the role of China in the committee. Russia said: ""We regret that it has provoked some politicised debate and even attacks against the chairmanship of this committee, something that we consider as totally unjustified."" Ethiopia said: ""Pressure was put on the chair based on fallacies, including in the media. And we absolutely reject that."" Ms Ley thanked China for its role in the committee. It is the second time the Great Barrier Reef has been spared inclusion on the ""in danger"" list. In 2015, lobbying by then-environment minister Greg Hunt escaped a push to have the reef added to the list. But UNESCO called on Australia to demonstrate it was addressing the key threats, including climate change and water quality. After that, the reef was hit with an unprecedented three mass bleaching events in five years, driven by climate change and water quality targets that were not met, although significant progress was made towards them.

442,"Hold on to your beanies, another big burst of winter is on the way",environment,"  Hold on to your beanies, another big burst of winter is on the way South-eastern Australia has had a freezing couple of days and it is not over yet with more wintry weather on the way this weekend. It has been bitterly cold across the south-east, after a strong cold front ploughed across the continent on Tuesday bringing a band of rain, strong winds, and much colder temperatures in its wake. Then clear conditions overnight brought widespread sub-zero temperatures Thursday morning. But attention quickly turned to South Australia, where a low and trough that had already brought heavy rain to Western Australia earlier in the week brought another wet and cold burst, and temperatures struggled to make it into the double digits. Adelaide airport only got up to 9.4 degrees Celcius, Renmark shivered through a max of 8.2C and across the border, Broken Hill only reached 7.8C and Mildura 9.7C. The rain is expected to peter out across southern Queensland and New South Wales today, but if you were hoping for a break after all that, this is not the winter for you. Today the focus goes back towards the west as the first of two cold front lines up to sweep across the continent. According to Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Jonathan How, the front is set to move through south-west WA today bringing more showers, before racing across the Great Australian Bight to reach South Australia and Adelaide by dawn Saturday. The front is then expected to blast through Victoria and New South Wales on Saturday and into Sunday, before being followed up by a second. ""It's just going to be a continual conveyor belt of really strong and bitterly cold winds,"" Mr How said. So expect a weekend of damaging winds, showers, local hail, thunderstorms, snow, and even blizzard conditions for alpine areas. The snow is expected to get down to 500-600 metres overnight Saturday in Victoria, with flurries possible in the hills around Melbourne. In Tasmania, snow is expected to get all the way down to 400-500 metres. A dusting down to 500-600 metres could be on the cards in the ACT, with flurries possible in the capital where it is only expected to get up to 8 degrees Celsius on Sunday. Damaging surf is expected to combine with high tides to bring coastal impacts, especially for Victoria and Tasmania on Saturday into Sunday. In good news though, for those who weathered the destructive winds in Victoria last month, these winds are expected to be the more common north-westerlies and last a much shorter duration. ""This time we're talking about winds around that 100 kilometre an hour mark, but that's still enough to bring down trees and power lines and cause power outages, unfortunately,"" said senior forecaster Dean Narramore. State duty officer of the Victorian SES, Aaron White, wants Victorians to stay safe and out of floodwaters. ""With the recent weather events we have had come across the state of Victoria we've got some trees that are already compromised and are more likely to fall with this wind event across the weekend,"" he said. ""We want people to be well clear of any dangers and ensure they are remaining clear of those at all times."" If anyone needs assistance from the SES, the nationwide number to call 132 500. As usual, please keep up with the warnings at ABC Emergency. While parts of the south-east shivered through temperatures well below average, temperatures have been over 10 degrees above average in parts of the Northern Territory. The heat is expected to push into northern Queensland today. The unseasonable heat is expected to dry things out and bring increased fire danger for the north and particularly the Top End this week. Keen weather watchers would have noticed there was a deep low impacting Victoria and South Australia on the weather models earlier in the week. Luckily, according to Mr Narramore, it now looks like the system will stay well south of the continent. These intense low pressure systems with pressures down to 950 millibars and winds well over 100kph usually circle around the Southern Ocean within the westerly wind belt. Most of the time they stay south with just the fronts and troughs they generate reaching up onto the mainland, as is expected to happen this weekend. Mr Narramore said it was highly unusual but not impossible for these lows to make their way up onto the mainland. ""Of course it has some big impacts if it does happen. But luckily, in this case, that deep low is going to be much further south and not impacting us too much."" So rug up and keep your wits about you folks. This winter is far from over yet.

Shoahaven Mayor Amanda Findley confirmed the council was approached by the NSW Port Authority to discuss the suitability of Jervis Bay as a destination. Cr Findley said NSW Port Authority needed make its intentions clear. ""The Port Authority have been to see Shoalhaven City Council,"" she said. ""We need to see them engage the community so the rumour mill can stop and we can get the facts. ""They need to be upfront now, not just leave it to the last minute to tell us what their plans are."" A Port Authority spokeswoman said a number of regional ports were being considered as potential cruise ship destinations. ""While the Australian government's ban on cruise ships in Australia has been extended again until 17 September 2021, we are starting to talk to council about what things might look like when [cruising] returns,"" she said. ""It’s very early days, but the Port Authority is interested to better understand the maritime capability of regional areas and any unique values that need to be considered in order to determine what, if any, opportunities there are for cruise visitation across our regional ports."" A leaked excerpt from the draft NSW Marine Park Network Management Plan shows the cruise industry has identified Jervis Bay Marine Park as an expansion opportunity. The draft plan indicates sustainable anchorages are being investigated, along with ""best practice cruise ship visitation"" in Jervis Bay. A spoksperson for the Department of Primary Industries (DPI) said the department had not been approached by the industry or an individual cruise company to discuss bringing ships into Jervis Bay. South Coast MP Shelley Hancock also denied that the DPI had been approached, but made her opposition to any such plan clear in a tweet. ""Regardless, I will never support cruise ships in Jervis Bay Marine Park,"" she said. Despite the denials and claims of plans being in the early stages, at least one cruise company is already selling tickets for a holiday that includes Jervis Bay. Ponant Cruises' ""Treasures of the South Australian coast and Tasmania"" itinerary for December 2022 has a one night stop in Jervis Bay and is already sold out. A spokesperson for the online travel agency Clean Cruising, which was selling tickets for the cruise, said Jervis Bay was a new destination for cruise ships. He also said this particular itinerary was for a cruise on the Le Laperouse ship, which had a capacity of 184 passengers and 118 crew. Independent MLC Justin Field said he had serious concerns for the environment if cruise ships were allowed in the Jervis Bay Marine Park. He also said he doubted whether there would be a significant economic benefit to the community. ""We don't want to have anything in a marine park that impacts on water quality or aquaculture,"" Mr Field said. ""Cruise ships are famous for trying to keep all the money on the ship in terms of accomodation entertainment and food. ""The community tends to get all the negative impacts and none of the benefits."" The NSW Port Authority spokeswoman said while cruising opportunities could bring economic opportunities to communities, the environmental value of cruise ship destinations were being considered.

444,The winners and losers of the NSW government's gas industry plan,environment,"  The winners and losers of the NSW government's gas industry plan Large swathes of north-western New South Wales will be off limits for gas exploration under a new state government plan, but a leading environment group says it is still a 'betrayal' of rural communities. The long-awaited Future of Gas Statement outlines a blueprint for the state's gas industry — including a plan to cut the area of land designated for gas exploration by more than three quarters. Twelve expired petroleum exploration licences, or PELS, cover 55,000 square kilometres of land from Moree in the north, through Narrabri and down to Coolah in the south. ""We have heard the concerns and questions from our regional communities around PELs and I can confirm today we are reducing the area of land available for gas exploration by 77 per cent,"" Deputy Premier and Minister for Resources John Barilaro said. ""The active PELs that remain will be to support the long-term future of the Narrabri Gas Project."" Land around the Liverpool Plains will be considered for gas development, prompting environmental group Lock the Gate's spokesperson, Georgina Woods, to describe the plan as a ""betrayal of rural New South Wales"". ""The deputy premier's decision to expand coal seam gas is at odds with New South Wales' commitment to carbon neutrality and makes the Liverpool Plains and Namoi Valley a sacrifice zone for the double whammy of Santos's coal seam gas damage and the legacy of climate change,"" she said. ""Communities in Coonamble, Gilgandra, Moree and the Upper Hunter are spared from the spectre of coal seam gas, and the decision not to proceed with gas exploitation in the Far West is very welcome."" Peter Wills, a Breeza farmer and a longtime campaigner against mining on the Liverpool Plains, said the inclusion of the area for mining development was disappointing. ""It's pretty horrendous actually, to be honest. Vast swathes of the of the Liverpool Plains are still under petroleum exploration licence,"" he said. ""Nothing has been saved as far as I'm concerned. ""The government's just not listened to landholders. We've been talking and concerned about this for over a decade … they've just listened to Santos."" Upper Hunter MP Dave Layzell said the plan gave the community certainty. ""The remaining active PELs, they will be a fixed term, so now that will actually be active for a period of time and we won't end up in this situation again where we've got so called zombie PELs just sitting there,"" he said. ""Admittedly, it probably doesn't go as far as some people wanted it to go, but it's a good step in the right direction."" Gas exploration has also been ruled out in the Far West of the state, near Wilcannia and Broken Hill. Santos chief executive officer and managing director Kevin Gallagher says the government's gas plan will do nothing to alleviate the high prices faced by NSW customers, who have been ""paying some of the highest prices for gas ever seen in the state"". Mr Gallagher said NSW businesses and manufacturers faced a significant competitive disadvantage because their gas had to be imported from other states. According to Business NSW, a baker in Sydney pays $26,400 more for gas every year than the same business in Brisbane, while a galvanising plant pays $66,000 more for gas every year. ""The only way to address gas shortfalls and price spikes at times of high demand is by developing local gas resources close to market instead of relying on imports,"" Mr Gallagher said. But he said the government's statement meant NSW customers would still have limited access to new gas supply sources, leaving them reliant on gas imports from other states or overseas. He said Santos had amended its PEL renewal applications to relinquish or surrender about 70 per cent of its total exploration acreage, which was ""far in excess of our statutory obligations"". The company was disappointed that the government had sought to ""extinguish further areas with no regard to the investment that has already been made"". Mr Gallagher also said the plan would mean NSW regional communities would miss out on the jobs and business opportunities that had turned Queensland gas communities into thriving regional centres. ""And NSW farmers will miss out on the opportunity for landholder payments for gas infrastructure that Queensland farmers have welcomed to drought-proof their properties and diversify their income,"" he said. Mr Gallagher said the company was still awaiting the outcome of an appeal against the Narrabri Gas Project, which was approved almost a year ago. Santos has promised that 100 per cent of Narrabri gas will go to the domestic market. ""The Narrabri community is looking forward to the jobs, business opportunities and regional development that the project would bring, and NSW gas customers are looking forward to having more reliable and more affordable gas from Narrabri,"" Mr Gallagher said.

445,Is it cruel to boil crabs alive? Here's what the science says about sea creatures and pain,environment," Science Do crabs, octopuses and fish feel pain? Should they have greater rights to humane treatment? In the verses of Nirvana's haunting track Something in the Way, Kurt Cobain offers the unremarkable cliche ""it's OK to eat fish, cos they don't have any feelings"". It was probably meant as a metaphor, for what we'll never know, but is it actually true? And if not, how has the belief become so widespread? In the lottery of life, non-mammalian sea creatures in general get a pretty bum deal. For whatever reason, the empathy we extend to dogs and cats — most mammals, really — doesn't seem to penetrate below the ocean surface. But could that be, legally at least, about to change? The United Kingdom parliament is currently debating a bill that would establish an ""animal sentience"" committee, which would increase welfare protections for fish and invertebrates. ""I have been shocked by some of the treatment of animals such as lobsters, crabs, and squid in the way they have been stored and very often killed,""  Baroness Fookes (Conservative) told the House while debating the bill. ""I believe very strongly that there is already sufficient evidence to indicate that non-vertebrates should be included in the bill."" In Australia, animal welfare laws vary from state to state, and whether an organism is covered generally depends on whether it is classified as an animal. In South Australia and Western Australia, fish and crustaceans are excluded from animal welfare legislation. Queensland and Tasmania also exclude crustaceans from the definition of an animal. Exemptions are also made in some states and territories for commercial and recreational fishing. So do Baroness Fookes and her colleagues have a point — and should we be following suit here in Australia? Here's what the science says about fish, crustaceans, cephalopods and their experience of pain and other feelings. First, it's worth pointing out that this debate isn't settled. The conflict has largely centred around whether a fish's distressed reaction to something like a hook in its mouth is a pain response or something involuntary that we might compare to a reflex. A commonly used example to demonstrate the difference between these two reactions is the case of burning your hand on a hot stove. The immediate response is to pull your hand away. This is a reflex that happens thanks to the transmission of signals between the burnt limb and your spine, which takes place before you experience pain. Pain occurs separately, after you have pulled the hand away, once the signals are processed in our brain's neocortex via a complex signal pathway. In the absence of that second process, we wouldn't experience pain, despite having withdrawn our hand from the threat. Fish don't possess a neocortex, nor do they possess any other apparatus that may allow similar processes to take place, according to Brian Key, a professor of biomedical science at the University of Queensland. He said experiments have been done where numerous parts of a fish brain were removed, and they still respond to stimuli in the same ""reflexive"" way — much like you pulling your hand away from the hot stove. ""It's what's called autonomous response. We can take a bit out of [the brain] and another bit out and another bit out of the animal and you poke it and it behaves [the same]."" He said it's difficult for people to believe that fish don't feel pain, because we associate those reactions with our own experience. ""Everyone has a set of core values but mostly it runs on 'if you poke it and it reacts, therefore it must feel,'"" Professor Key said. ""It's nothing to do with intelligence. It's about whether they have the hardware to feel and I’m saying, no they don’t."" On the other side of the coin, there are those who argue that pain is necessary for survival and that, by extension, survival is proof of pain. A negative or painful experience, according to the argument, is needed to permanently alter an animal's future behaviour towards the source of a threat. Without that behaviour-altering experience, an animal would continue to put themselves in harm's way, and inevitably suffer life-threatening injury. Numerous studies have shown fish will rapidly change their behaviour following exposure to what we would regard as a painful experience. And anecdotally, anglers have reported needing to alter their fishing methods — using finer line and well-disguised hooks — in heavily fished areas. There is physiological evidence to support this view as well. Nociceptors are sensory neurones found in human skin that help transmit long-ranging electrical signals to the brain. Their discovery, initially in rainbow trout, is part of the evidence that has effectively ""put to bed"" the argument against fish feeling pain, according to fish behavioural ecologist Culum Brown of Macquarie University. ""We've known since 2002 that fish have nociceptors, which are the nerves responsible for detecting painful stimuli in humans,"" Professor Brown said. Giving fish analgesics that work on humans has also been shown to alter their ""pain"" and fear response. ""Anxiety is pretty well established amongst a whole bunch of animals, including fishes,"" Professor Brown said. ""We know from looking at the various drugs we use on humans to prevent anxiety – all those drugs work on fish."" Although research into the experience of pain in invertebrates is less comprehensive than fish, some evidence suggests they experience feelings beyond a reflex-like involuntary response to stimuli. Again, though, the debate is not settled. Invertebrates have vastly different nervous systems to vertebrates, Professor Brown said. However, nociceptors have been identified in cephalopods — creatures such as cuttlefish, nautilus, octopus, and squid. ""Things like cuttlefish and octopus, their nervous systems evolved completely independently of vertebrates. They're basically snails,"" he said. ""Amazingly, though, some of our [pain-killing] drugs still work on cephalopods."" A 2018 study also found that octopuses given the party drug ecstasy were increasingly sociable, measured through the amount of touch and interaction between one another. Although nociceptors haven't been found in crustaceans — crabs, prawns, crayfish and the like — there are other clues that point to long-term behavioural changes associated with negative experiences. Crustaceans avoid objects that administered an electric shock in lab scenarios, and shocked crayfish were found to have higher brain-serotonin concentrations and blood glucose, which researchers put down to a stress response. An anti-anxiety drug was also found to reduce ""fearfulness"" in lobsters in a 2014 study. ""When we're talking about sentience we're literally talking about the capacity to feel,"" Professor Brown said. ""It seems to be an emergent property from complex nervous systems – if you have lots of sensory input from touch and smell and those sorts of things, and they're all being processed centrally, sentience is a feedback."" But Professor Key said similar experiments have been conducted in invertebrates as fish, where parts of the brain and nervous system were removed without changing the ""autonomous response"" to stimuli. ""Molluscs — same result,"" he said. ""Part of the family of molluscs are octopuses. They don’t have that hardware. But people would say they're intelligent creatures. ""These animals are complex structures but they just aren’t as complex as humans."" So where does that leave us on the question of sentience and whether animal cruelty laws should apply to fish and crustaceans? Professors Brown and Key conduct the scientific research that may help ethicists with these questions, but do not profess to be ethicists themselves. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Professor Brown thinks it's likely that laws regarding the humane treatment of animals will expand as the science progresses. ""The real question at the moment is how far back in evolution does this go — what animals might be sentient and what might the minimum requirements be? ""My guess is after crustaceans, it might be ants and wasps and bees."" But Professor Key said there was not enough scientific evidence on the matter of whether or not pain is a universal trait, and that we needed to be discerning about enshrining the rights of animals into law. ""[It] is not [always] justified and would lead eventually to bestowing any animal with a nervous system as being sentient."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

446,Bushfire brings unexpected gift as students rejuvenate creek bed,environment,"  Bushfire brings an unexpected gift as creek bed is rejuvenated 16 years on When bushfires raged across South Australia's Eyre Peninsula in 2005, North Shields farmer John Cook watched his property burn as he barricaded himself in the bathroom with his wife and one of his daughters. Their stone home withstood the fire but the paddocks were scorched. They lost 500 sheep, fences, the shearing shed and farming equipment. The road to recovery seemed overwhelming, but from the blackened earth came an unexpected gift. A mat of green has emerged along the edge of the trickling Meadow Creek which runs across his property. The creek bed has rejuvenated and now students from St Joseph's School Port Lincoln are helping plant more trees using the seeds from the fully grown bushfire seedlings. It is helping the ecology but the students are also getting their hands dirty and connecting with nature. Teacher Lisa Fox said about 200 middle school students were involved in the From Little Things Big Things Grow project, funded by the Eyre Peninsula Landscape Board. They collected seeds on the property in November, dried them out, propagated them at the school and planted the seedlings near the creek bed. ""It does feel like a bit of a magic trick when you take what looks like a seed the size of a grain of pepper and here we are six months later and they're growing into healthy trees,"" she said. ""It will be really exciting to monitor that over the years to come. ""It's really awesome to see kids realise they can make a difference. ""All too often, when you look into the environment education area it can tend to be a little bit overwhelming when you look at the challenges that are posed and kids are really aware of that. ""It's really nice to opt to take a really optimistic angle and focus in on what can be done."" Mr Cook said he planted trees in 1985 and 1994 along the creek bed to help soak up water and avoid a salinity issue. Those trees had burnt in the Black Tuesday Wangary bushfire but the recovery had been heartwarming. ""It's amazing within that first year you could see little shoots coming and then you could see the ground was a mat of seedlings,"" Mr Cook said. ""The rushes were starting to grow and … in amongst it you would have sworn you were looking at a lawn of trees —  it was unbelievable."" Some of his initial plantings, including a Western Australian species called a flat-topped yate (Eucalyptus occidentalis), paperbarks (Melaleucas), local water mallees (Eucalyptus porosa) and local blue gums (Eucalyptus petiolaris), were up to 7.5 metres tall when the fire decimated them. Mr Cook said farming was a game of balancing the ecosystem with clearing land to crop and make a living. He said the creek vegetation project would provide shelter for his stock as well as beautify the farm. ""In the winter time, and into late spring, it's really quite a spectacular peaceful scene with the water flowing and now that we've got plenty of trees there it's really quite a treasure to have,"" Mr Cook said. Eyre Peninsula Landscape Board officer Rachael Kannussaar said the Grassroots Grant Program, which funded the school's project, offered seed funding for community projects each year and had seen ""great ideas"" come to life.

449,Wildlife 'win' as government moves to take Currumbin land from developers,environment,"  Wildlife 'win' as Queensland government moves to acquire land for Currumbin eco-park from developers Almost 150 hectares of southern Gold Coast land is to be transformed into one of the largest eco-parks in the country through compulsory acquisition from the defiant owners. The state government has today announced it will begin the process to acquire 148 hectares for the Currumbin Eco-Parkland — locally known as Martha's Farm or Martha's Vineyard. The government is working to strike a deal with the commercial owners, who have a council-approved plan for a 348-residential lot, a marine precinct and artificial lake. Leaders of a local advocacy group say they are optimistic about the change but will be happy when the deal is officially finalised, putting an end to almost four decades of development threats. Minister for State Development Steven Miles said, after failed negotiations with the owners, the state would set out to compulsorily acquire the land. ""Unfortunately, an agreement has not been reached, and we have had to take further action,"" he said. The ABC is seeking comment from the owners. [hinterland] Mr Miles said the site had been subjected to ""several development approvals since the 1980s"". ""It's a highly constrained site with steep topography and flooding issues, making it difficult to develop,"" he said. ""But [it] has some unique features that makes it worth preserving and enhancing."" The state government currently has $15 million put aside for the land. If the owners refuse to come to an agreement, the government will only need to pay market value to secure the property. President of community advocacy group Friends of Currumbin Peter Kershaw has been fighting development plans since the 1980s. Mr Kershaw said the site had changed hands several times and had been considered for a retirement villa, residential estate and golf course. He said he was cautiously optimistic about the acquisition. ""It's never too late,"" he said. ""It is a positive score on the board."" Mr Kershaw said he has submitted several suggestions to the government for the land, including a cultural centre dedicated to the local Yugambeh traditional owners, low-impact eco-tourism cabins, a tree-planting area and a place for recreational ovals on the floodplains. ""There's also a lot of activity that takes place along the border track,"" he said. ""There's bushwalkers, birdwatchers, orienteers, trail runners and occasionally the local bikes. ""There's an opportunity… to let the community know a little bit about the hidden gems that are in there."" Mr Kershaw said the land's proximity to services and natural beauty attracted developers in the first place. ""It's one of the few areas set aside for development without heading to the north of the Gold Coast and wandering into the cane fields and further areas up north,"" he said. ""In terms of development opportunities on the southern end of the Gold Coast this is a rare parcel."" Under the government's ownership, the area will be open to the community as eco-parkland, and serve as a protected home for native flora and wildlife, including koalas. Minister for the Environment Meghan Scanlon said the decision would deter the ambitions of new developers and protect natural and delicate rainforest. [scanlon] ""This decision will protect koalas and other local wildlife and stop development from encroaching on the local blackbutt forest"" she said. ""Martha's Vineyard is already popular with hikers and nature-based activities, and we want to not just protect that access but improve it. ""Just like the land next door at the Merala Nature Refuge is being restored, we'll see our rangers protect and preserve this valuable pocked of nature."" Last week, locals Alan and Meryl Wilson agreed to lock up their nearby 30 hectares of land in the Currumbin Valley for the same reason.

450,'With a lot of power comes a lot of responsibility': SA rocket launch plan approved,environment,"  Australian Space Agency approves plan to launch test rockets from Whalers Way near Port Lincoln A plan to launch rockets from South Australia's Eyre Peninsula has been given approval by the Federal Government. The Australian Space Agency signed off on the proposal by Southern Launch for a sub-orbital rocket testing facility at Whalers Way, near Port Lincoln. It is one of the final hurdles Southern Launch had to clear before launching three test rockets later in the year. ""This is a major step forward in a very, very long program of work to realise this capability for Australia,"" Southern Launch CEO Lloyd Damp said. The approval means Mr Damp's company now holds the only two launch facility licences issued by the Australian Space Agency. A similar licence was granted for Southern Launch's Koonibba Test Range, also on the Eyre Peninsula, in March. ""With a lot of power comes a lot of responsibility, and we are totally committed to ensuring that any rocket launches that are undertaken from either the Koonibba test range or from the newly-licensed Whalers Way Orbital Launch Complex are done in a safe manner,"" Mr Damp said. The Whalers Way plan has been controversial with local residents, who fear the pristine coastal environment will be blighted by a surge in truck and vehicle traffic, ear-splitting noise and pollution. Ecologists have also expressed concern the activity could lead to long-term behaviour changes in native species, including birds. Southern Launch has previously responded to those concerns by saying its proposal was developed in close consultation with environmental authorities. Southern Launch has until the end of the year to fire up to three test rockets from the Whalers Way launchpad. ""At this point in time we don't yet have an update [on launch dates], but we recognise that we need to undertake up to three launches by the end of this calendar year,"" Mr Damp said. ""So our hope is that it's not too far away, but [we are] working very closely with the Space Agency on any dates they can support."" Data collected during the test launches will be used to determine whether Whalers Way would work as a site for ongoing, larger suborbital and orbital launches. The head of the Australian Space Agency, Enrico Palermo, said the approval should give the sector confidence. ""This approval provides the emerging launch sector with the confidence of the Australian Space Agency's intention to grow Australia's launch capability and infrastructure,"" Mr Palermo said in a statement. The infrastructure was approved by South Australia's State Commission Assessment Panel in June. """"We started some of the preliminary works a couple of weeks ago,"" Mr Damp said. ""The construction is expected to go through in stages. The concrete is down for Pad One and over the coming weeks we'll be installing other components as possible."" He said tourists were still able to access the dramatic views, spectacular beaches and serenity that Whalers Way was known for. ""At this point in time there is free access for everyone down to Whalers Way. ""Please go to the visitors centre, get a key or work through one of the existing tour operators and please continue to enjoy the beauty of the site.""

452,McCain Foods pledges to be powered by 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030,environment," ABC Rural McCain Foods pledges to be powered by 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030 McCain Foods has released its sustainability strategy that centres on a global commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by 50 per cent and move out of coal to renewable electricity by 2030. Agriculture Director for Australia and New Zealand, Rod McLaren, said he was excited the company was going green. ""The spotlight has been put squarely on the challenges being posed by climate change and our fragile global food systems,"" he said. The company has 49 production plants globally, with sites across Europe, in Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, North and South America, China, India and South Africa. But Mr McLaren said Australia's Ballarat plant was setting the agenda with a behind-the-meter solar farm in operation, which will be the largest in Australia once the building is complete. ""We're also building a biodigester. One of our targets is to be utilising 100 per cent of potato by-products by 2025,"" he said. Biodigestion is the process of creating an energy-rich gas, by placing organic materials, such as potato peels, into an airtight container to breakdown. ""Australia and New Zealand are going to lead the way with that. We're 100 per cent potato utilisation already. ""We divert most of our by-product to cattle feed but we will use some of that better by running it through a biodigester to create energy."" Lindsay Soutar, a renewable energy campaigner with Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said it was important food manufacturers committed to eliminating coal and utilising renewable energy. ""It's critical for tackling climate change, and we know that [McCain] is starting to make progress towards achieving that goal here in Australia which,  is really pleasing to see,"" she said. ""There is a pack of leaders of big global agribusiness companies that are now well underway in transitioning onto renewable energy. ""These businesses are driving the transition to 100 per cent renewable electricity. Other big companies including Mars and Kellogg's have signed big deals to get a lot more of their power from wind and solar projects."" Ms Soutar said McCain Foods was on the same track as Mars, which is now entirely powered by renewables and also have a manufacturing plant in Ballarat. ""It's a big corporate race that we're seeing underway to shift entirely to renewable energy. ""What McCain has done with the big solar development in Ballarat shows that renewables are affordable and better for business."" Ms Soutar said, despite these efforts, there was more that big agribusinesses should do, and consumers expected more. ""The next big step for them will be looking into how they can get off the gas,"" she said. ""That's the next frontier that's going to be critically important for these companies to be playing a leadership role in. ""Polling shows that 80 per cent of Australians want to see big businesses use more renewable electricity, and nearly 70 per cent want big businesses to commit to 100 per cent renewable energy."" ""There is huge consumer demand now for corporates to be doing the right thing in this space."" Another environmental goal in McCain Foods sustainability report is to implement regenerative agricultural practices across 100 per cent of suppliers' farms by 2030. This includes practices such as protecting soils, enhancing crop and ecosystem diversity, reducing chemicals, and optimising water use. ""Here in Australia and New Zealand, the farming practices are world-leading,"" Mr McLaren said. ""I'm pretty proud to say that most of our growers, if not all of them, are doing at least 90 per cent of that, which is really good.""

453,Polystyrene packaging is being phased out. Here's how you can help alternatives gain traction,environment,"  Polystyrene packaging is being phased out. Here's how you can help alternatives gain traction Australian businesses are hurrying to meet a deadline to phase out many types of single-use plastics. The federal government wants to phase out plastics that end up in landfill, including expanded polystyrene, plastic bags, plastic cutlery and takeaway containers by the middle of next year. So, how will that happen? First, here are some of the facts. Australians consume about 3.4 million tonnes of plastics a year, according to figures from the Environment Department. About 320,000 tonnes of that is recycled, and the rest ends up in landfill, where it can take hundreds of years to break down. Some states and territories have already moved to ban plastic bags, straws and takeaway containers. Australia imports about 52,000 tonnes of polystyrene resin every year, to make into things like insulation, as well as single-use packaging for white goods and packing beads for posting boxes. About a quarter of it is recycled, through business programs or at council depots, and the rest ends up in landfill. The good thing about expanded polystyrene is it's light, sturdy, and can keep things at the right temperature, so it's good for transporting food and medicine. But it is plastic, so it takes a long time to break down in landfill, and the deadline to phase it out is approaching. Some businesses are already moving away from polystyrene. Officeworks used to wrap all its furniture in polystyrene. Now it uses thick cardboard and tissue paper. The company's head of sustainable development, Ryan Swenson, says the company made the move to cardboard last year. He says cardboard is strong enough to protect the product, along with some reinforced corners. It is light enough to carry easily, and the cost works out the same. Mr Swenson says the company is ""working collaboratively with our suppliers and thinking creatively to design the solutions that reduce environmental impact but also help our customers take more sustainable action"". The company also sells bamboo and paper cutlery instead of plastic, but phasing out bubble wrap will take a bit longer. ""There's more work to do,"" Mr Swenson said. Cardboard is great, but it can't keep products hot or cold like polystyrene can. In a manufacturing plant in Sydney, Joanne Howarth is overseeing what she hopes will be the end of polystyrene. Ms Howarth is the chief executive of Planet Protector Packaging, a company that makes Woolpack — a lining made from waste wool. She says it can do everything that polystyrene can, without taking hundreds of years to break down in landfill. ""Since 1954, polystyrene has dominated this space, it's been the go-to in terms of best performance,"" she said. ""And it's not until now that there's been a viable alternative in terms of temperature. That's the big challenge."" Ms Howarth says wool packaging is now being used for shipping goods like seafood and medicine. She says the product is also good for the environment because it's made from waste wool that normally ends up in the bin. ""This is the material that's on the underbelly of the sheep and until now there was not a commercial use for it … ordinarily it's deemed a waste stream and it goes to landfill,"" she said. The chief executive of the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, Brooke Donnelly, says many businesses are already phasing out polystyrene ahead of the deadline in 2022. She is confident it will be met. ""It is about rethinking how we engage with products and how we design them to work effectively,"" she said. ""These are some of the great examples, and there are a lot of them, of where businesses are actually rethinking how you engage with the product and how consumers will deal with it once they've finished with that packaging as well."" While the government is making legislative changes, businesses say the real pressure to move away from plastics comes from customers. Ms Donnelly says companies will listen to consumers. ""Consumers have the most powerful voice of all and they have the ability to vote at the register, make a decision,"" she said. Ever bought a new TV or fridge only to have the polystyrene fill up your rubbish bin? Most local councils won't accept it in kerbside recycling. But you can take it to your local recycling centre, where it can be made into other products. Check here for drop-off sites near you. Or, you can turn polystyrene boxes into a handy worm farm, cut down on food waste and make soil for your plants. Of course, you could also just buy less stuff that comes wrapped in polystyrene, by putting off new purchases like TVs or fridges.

456,Protected land area grows to preserve habitat for native species,environment,"  Locals agree to lock up their land to protect wildlife, including koalas, endangered Richmond birdwing butterfly Land equivalent to 8,500 football fields is to become protected habitat for native wildlife in Queensland. The state government announced Queensland's protected area has expanded by more than 4,600 hectares. Environment Minister Meaghan Scanlon said it included former grazing land added to the Pinnacles National Park near Townsville and formerly unallocated state land has been added to the Wongaloo Conservation Park. ""So we can make sure the protection of important species continues in the long term,"" Ms Scanlon said. She said this was in addition to the $60 million protected area strategy funding, which was announced last year. ""Some of this land is a land transfer, some is private protected area,"" she said. The state also announced half a million dollars in grants to go to landowners who are offering private land to become nature refuges. ""We're continuing to work with private landholders to conserve even more land in places like the Sunshine Coast, Logan and the Gold Coast,"" Ms Scanlon said. ""We've got three new private protected areas."" Alan and Meryl Wilson own 30 hectares of land in the Currumbin Valley on the Gold Coast. Mr Wilson said reaching out to the state to protect the area made sense. ""We're not experts at all on reforestation but my wife, in particular, saw the potential of this land and said we can't let this land be anything else but a restoration area,"" Mr Wilson said. Species found on the land include koalas, the Richmond birdwing butterfly and the greater glider. Andrew Picone, from the Queensland Conservation Council, welcomed the announcement, saying the increase in protected areas and management funding was crucial. He said it was a step in the right direction but more needed to be done. ""We need to go from 8.2 per cent to 17 per cent in 10-15 years, to get the conservation estate on par with what we need to be doing to protect nature, to adequately manage these key areas and to protect biodiversity"" he said.

""Heal Country"" is this year's theme for NAIDOC Week Larrakia rangers are monitoring the endangered far eastern curlew, a migratory bird There is concern about the pace of Darwin's development For senior ranger Gabrial Millar, 22, working to protect and care for her clan's traditional country is ""more than just a job"". ""It's central to my identity,"" she said. ""Being a new mother, it's important to me to keep Larrakia country healthy and thriving because I can hand that down to my son and the next generation."" NAIDOC Week is an annual celebration of the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This year's NAIDOC theme, Heal Country, calls for greater protections for Indigenous lands, waters, sacred sites and cultural heritage from exploitation, desecration and destruction. ""My family was here long before I was, doing what I am doing now, and my family will be long after I am,"" Ms Millar said. ""I come to work every day and I don't dread working. ""I look forward to it, because every day I am doing something important, whether it's something small or big."" The mostly brown-feathered and long-billed curlew has become an endangered species through destruction of its habitat, hunting and coastal development. In 2006 there were only an estimated 38,000 far eastern curlews around the world. Monitoring the curlews, which fly from as far as Siberia to feed on the shores of Darwin Harbour, is only one of the jobs carried out by rangers on Larrakia land and sea country, which comprises the Greater Darwin region, west to the Cox Peninsula and east to the Adelaide River. Other work includes monitoring sea life such as crocodiles, dolphins, fish, mud crabs and sea shells. Monitoring whales, diving with dolphins and preserving ancient Aboriginal sites — protecting Botany Bay with the Gamay Rangers. The rangers also do weed control, grounds maintenance, fencing, boardwalks, water sampling and wildlife trapping. ""I am able to come here every day to learn, and acquire tools that I can pass down to my family,"" Ms Millar said. Steven Dawson, a 27-year-old Larrakia man who has been working as a ranger for more than six years, said the best part of the job was being able to work outdoors and look after his country. But he is worried about the impact of local development. ""Darwin seems to be growing so fast, and hopefully, there will still be some bushland for future generations to go and explore,"" he said. ""I would like to see everyone respecting the land and looking after it. I mean, it's not just for me, but for my kids, my family and everyone, including animals."" Larrakia Rangers are a long-running, urban-based Aboriginal ranger group with 24 staff split into two teams. Their aim is to work in partnership with land owners to keep the lands and seas safe for all to live on. There are around 2,000 people in the Larrakia clan, who refer to themselves as ""saltwater people"". ""We're learning and doing things on ground that is healing country and helps us to heal country in the future,"" Ms Millar said.

459,EU fines four German car makers $1.3 billion over emission collusion,environment,"  EU fines German car makers BMW, VW, Audi and Porsche $1.3 billion over emission collusion The European Union (EU) has handed down $1.3 billion in fines to four major German car manufacturers, saying they colluded to limit the development and rollout of car emission control systems. Daimler, BMW, VW, Audi and Porsche avoided competing on technology to restrict pollution from gasoline and diesel passenger cars, the European Commission said. Daimler was not fined after it revealed the cartel to the European Commission. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said even though the companies had the technology to cut harmful emissions beyond legal limits, they avoided competing and denied consumers the chance to buy less polluting cars. ""Factories compete with one another also when it comes to reducing carbon emissions from the cars,"" Ms Vestager said. ""Manufacturers deliberately avoided to compete on cleaning better than what was required by EU emission standards. And they did so despite the relevant technology being available."" It made their practice illegal, Ms Vestager said. ""So today's decision is about how legitimate technical cooperation went wrong. And we do not tolerate it when companies collude."" Volkswagen said it was considering whether to take legal action against the fine, saying the penalty over technical talks about emissions technology with other carmakers set a questionable precedent. ""The commission is entering new judicial territory, because it is treating technical cooperation for the first time as an antitrust violation,"" the German carmaker said after being fined 502 million euros ($799 million). ""Furthermore, it is imposing fines, although the content of the talks was never implemented and no customers suffered any harm as a result,"" Volkswagen added in a statement. BMW agreed to the settlement proposed by the European Commission, paying a 373 million euro fine, saying it had been cleared of suspicion of using illegal ""defeat devices"" to cheat emissions tests. ""This underlines that there has never been any allegation of unlawful manipulation of emission control systems by the BMW Group,"" the company said in a statement. The case was not directly linked to the ""dieselgate"" scandal of the past decade, when Volkswagen admitted about 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide were fitted with deceptive software. The software reduced nitrogen oxide emissions when the cars were placed on a test machine but allowed higher emissions and improved engine performance during normal driving. The scandal cost Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen 30 billion euros ($47 billion) in fines and civil settlements and led to the recall of millions of vehicles. It was the first time the European Commission imposed collusion fines on holding back the use of technical developments, not a more traditional practice like price fixing.

460,Ratepayers could foot quarry clean up bill,environment,"  Fears Shoalhaven ratepayers could foot Tomerong quarry clean up bill Concerns have been raised in New South Wales parliament about who is responsible for remediation costs at the site of the Tomerong quarry on the South Coast if the current owners, In-Ja-Ghoondji Lands Incorporated, are unable to pay. Quarry operations ceased in 2017 after operators, who were leasing the site, were fined $114,000 by Shoalhaven Council for a number of consent condition breaches. This was the first and only fine ever issued by Shoalhaven Council to operators despite numerous reports of wrong doing. Independent MLC Justin Field said the lack of compliance action raised serious questions about who was responsible for the clean up. ""Compliance failures by council have exposed ratepayers and council to large rehabilitation costs,"" Mr Field said. ""I think council need to explain more why such small fines were issued when so many breaches were documented,"" he said. Councillor and Tomerong resident John Levett has been asking that question since 2017. He said so far, council staff had not been able to answer. ""It was done within the ranks of staff, so they did the investigation and discussed what orders would be made,"" Mr Levett said. ""We take things to council like the purchase of a swing set, but this was never referred to council for endorsement."" ""Was it transparent? I argue that it was not and it should have been discussed with councillors first,"" he said. Mr Field and Mr Levett both said the $114,000 fine was inadequate and a fine in the millions would have been more appropriate. The director of Shoalhaven City Development Phil Costello said there were a number of reasons the council arrived at that figure. ""All levels of government must act as 'model litigants' in the conduct of any compliance action and this was a major consideration,"" Mr Costello said. ""There are levels of evidence required to prove an offence has occurred and community observations, do not reach this standard,"" he said. Mr Costello also indicated that because no former action had been taken, the court would have taken that into consideration if there was a legal challenge. However, in a letter to the Tomerong Community Forum in 2018, former General Manager Russ Pigg apologised to the community for failing to meet community expectations when it came to compliance. He also advised them to approach the ICAC if they wanted to investigate the matter further. ""In respect to the past years and your concerns with council’s actions, or lack of (from your perspective), I do apologise that council has failed to meet your expectations. In my view, historically, there have been numerous factors influencing the capacity of the organisation to respond effectively such as: It is also of note that the issues/complaints raised by yourselves and other community members over the years were not only highlighted to various staff but were also well known to councillors and council itself. So given this broad awareness and knowledge, in my opinion, there has been a “collective responsibility” at all levels of the organisation, rather than staff alone, which should take responsibility for the circumstances and situation that developed and was by default “accepted”. Whilst council has, at its June meeting, resolved in part that – “ Council acknowledges that the perception in the Tomerong community, for quite some time was that communication and feedback from Council to the community was far too infrequent and that Council unreservedly apologises for the circumstances that led to this perception.” – I write to you separately to convey my apologies, and also on behalf of my staff, past and present, for our part in not achieving the expectations of the community. Mr Pigg said at the time that he was confident the decision-making process would in future be more transparent and logical. The In-Ja-Ghoondji Land group bought the quarry site in 1998 and had plans to turn the site into a cultural centre and amphitheatre. There were also plans for a 50 Mega Watt solar farm. Plans were drawn up by international design and engineering company WSP,  however no moves to begin work on the site had been made. The ABC has tried, unsuccessfully, to contact the current owners of the site. It was also unclear whether they had the funds to pay up to $18 million to remediate the site. Mr Costello said draft remediation plans had been submitted to council in the past, however they were returned to In-Ja-Ghoondji because there were shortfalls. He said council is currently in discussions with the owners about the future of the site. ABC Illawarra will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

461,'It's very sad': Mystery surrounds dead koala found on beach,environment,"  Mystery surrounds dead koala found on Queensland beach A quiet stroll along a picturesque beach in Queensland has ended with the distressing discovery of a dead koala. A resident of the Hay Point area, south of Mackay, found the koala partially buried in sand after it was washed up on the beach earlier this week. It appeared to have injuries consistent with having been attacked, but what caused the wounds and where the animal came from remain a mystery. Warning: This story contains images that may be distressing. Ian Gottke from Padaminka Nature Refuge said it was very unusual to see koalas — alive or dead — on the beach in the region. ""Normally they're up in the trees and if it's on the ground, there's something wrong with it,"" he said. ""I've never seen anything like it before … we come across koalas hit by cars and trains and the odd dog attack out west around Dysart and Middlemount, but never on the beach."" The wildlife carer said the koala's wounds indicated it might have been attacked by a dog. ""They are consistent with a dog grabbing it from the back and side,"" Mr Gottke said. ""We don't think it had been there long because there was still blood on the sand. ""It's very sad, it takes you aback and you think, 'How the hell could this happen?'."" Mr Gottke said it was impossible to find out more about the animal, because its body had been moved by the time a carer was able to make it to the area. He said he, like many in the community, became aware that the koala had been found on the beach after a post on social media. ""We do like to be able to examine the animal to provide information back to the university about its weight, body score, disease and measurements,"" he said. ""It helps determine if the animals in the area are from one colony or a separate group, and determine genetic ties to different areas. ""It also helps with tracking diseases."" There are a number of koala populations throughout the Mackay-Isaac-Whitsunday region. ""There are known populations around Hay Point and we've seen and recorded them around Louisa Creek,"" Mr Gottke said. ""There's also populations out around the Nebo area."" While the beach was not a common habitat for koalas, Mr Gottke urged dog owners to keep their pets on a lead. ""The trick is to keep your eye out ,and if you do come across an animal [that's been injured or killed], call 1300ANIMAL and they will contact the closest koala rescue group.""

462,Forget 'FOMO' — in Wollongong kitchens it's all about the FOGO,environment,"  Wollongong FOGO green bin use slashing hundreds of tonnes of landfill waste It may be a small bin that sits on the kitchen benchtop, but the FOGO (food organics and garden organics) caddy you are emptying into your green-lidded garbage bin is making a significant difference to the amount of waste going to landfill. Since Wollongong City Council started accepting food organics in household green bins, the equivalent weight of about 66 African elephants of waste — give or take — is being turned into compost each month. ""Four months prior to the rollout of FOGO, we were averaging up to 3,540 tonnes of red bin waste per month entering our waste facility at Whytes Gully,"" a council spokesperson said. ""During the first four months of FOGO, the amount of waste to landfill dropped on average to 3,120 tonnes per month."" A significant portion of household waste is now suitable for the green bin, which is now emptied weekly instead of fortnightly. ""We have recorded a substantial increase in the amount of material collected from green-lidded household bins and we believe this can be attributed to the introduction of FOGO and the enhanced organics collection service,"" the spokesperson said. For the first time, green bin waste exceeded landfill waste from December 2020 to February 2021. While the wet summer and good growing conditions for plants and lawns increased the amount of garden waste during this time, it was a positive sign for council. ""While it's still too early to understand changing trends with residents' behaviour, since the rollout of FOGO in November 2020, we've seen that FOGO has had a significant and positive impact on the amount of waste sent to landfill,"" the spokesperson said. Council also acknowledged not all Wollongong residents had access to a FOGO bin, particularly the thousands living in the growing number of high density apartment blocks in the city. A $261,000 NSW government grant announced in April will be spent on a trial to offer a FOGO service to apartment blocks, with a goal to eventually having the service available to everyone in the city. ""Minimising waste is everyone's responsibility and finding ways to make FOGO a practical option for those living in units within our community is extremely important,"" Wollongong City Lord Mayor Gordon Bradbery said. ""A large and diverse portion of our community lives in units, so adapting FOGO to meet their needs is vital to the long-term success of the program for Wollongong City Council. ""This will provide invaluable information for other councils also looking into FOGO services for their communities.""

463,Pictures show fish kill hot spot’s incredible transformation,environment,"  Floodwaters see long-absent native species return to the Menindee Lakes System in outback New South Wales With water comes wildlife and after five long, dry years the Menindee Lakes system is filling with both. The political battle over the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has often been fought here, with locals expressing fury at mass fish kills and ""excess"" upstream irrigation. But floodwaters — enough to fill Sydney Harbour twice — reached the largest natural depression in the wetlands system in April. Since then, Lake Menindee has transformed from a vast, dry expanse of cracked dirt into a freshwater oasis in the middle of the Outback. Water levels throughout the system have been rising, and animals of all kinds are taking advantage of the new landscape. Dozens of species, from tiny, red-capped plovers to pelicans, swans, emus and kangaroos, are benefiting. Some native bird species whose numbers have steadily diminished are beginning to breed once again. Meanwhile, the water has caused yabbies, in a deep sleep for years underground, to re-awaken and climb to the surface. Geoff Looney has been taking photographs of wildlife at Menindee for the past 30 years. He says the floodwaters have caused an amazing change in the area. ""I was out taking photos a couple of weeks before Lake Menindee started filling and there was nothing about. Not a thing,"" he says. ""You’d travel 20 kilometres and not see a bird. ""From struggling to catch a photo of a bird to them being pretty well everywhere you go it’s an amazing change."" He says that in recent weeks, he's spotted a stunning variety of birds in choice birdwatching locations where, only weeks ago, there were few. ""The ground birds come back in big numbers, robins and the wrens and the song larks and things like that,"" he says. ""I [have] seen ... ducks, pelicans, cormorants, egrets, blue bills, everything. ""They’d have come back mainly for the water that’s here."" But he says bird populations in the area have been shrinking for years, and it could take then just as long to recover. Vivian Henderson runs a busy work life on the New South Wales North Coast. She always takes the opportunity to do some bird watching when she travels. ""[Menindee] is a lovely spot, particularly when there’s so much water around, you find lots of water birds,"" she says. ""I think I’ve found a pink gaped honey eater, which I’ve never seen before, which was quite exciting for me. ""I love the pelicans. They’re a fascinating bird. ""They’ve got a wing span about as wide as a car."" Yabbies must keep their gills wet to survive. They're found in rivers, lakes and wetlands throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. But if the water dries up — as it did from Lake Menindee several years ago — the common freshwater crustacean uses an extraordinary method to stay alive. It burrows deep into the mud and dirt, initially following the water table down as it sinks lower, and lower. Then, it creates a small chamber for itself under the ground, falls into a state of suspended animation and stops breathing — for years at a time. Only water causes the yabby to re-awaken and climb to the surface, to feed and breed. ""It’s amazing how they go underground in the mud for all those years,"" says Barkandji Elder and River Ranger Co-ordinator Cheryl Blore. The Barkandji River Rangers monitor water quality across the lakes system. ""It's just amazing seeing all the animals and the bird-life coming back,"" she says. ""All the different colourful parrots flying around ... and emus and kangaroos are everywhere now. ""We have quite a few tourists coming through and asking where could you go and see the birds [for] bird watching."" Hundreds of thousands of native fish were found dead and floating on the surface of the water and most of the Menindee Lakes System was dry in 2019. Fish that survived the crisis were often found swimming in green pools of mostly stagnant water, along otherwise parched creek and lake beds. Fast forward to early this year, when record rains flooded parts of Queensland and New South Wales. The floods caused a major spawning event among golden perch, and sent millions of tiny, juvenile golden perch, hundreds of kilometres downstream in more than 1000 gigalitres of water. All that water, carrying all those fish, is now in the Menindee Lakes System. The large, shallow lakes act as a natural nursery for the golden perch, before the next major flood event sends them further downstream. Menindee resident Graeme McCrabb says several cohorts of young native fish have arrived in the lakes in recent months. ""We've got golden perch at about 30 centimetres long, we've got some at about 100 [millimetres] long and then we've obviously got the last [group],"" he says. ""There'll be some really small fry there, at five or ten millimetres. ""They grow from larvae to fingerlings, and then you hope for another flood event that will transport them right through the Basin.""

464,"The River Torrens has battled pollution, rubbish and algae — could it again host the platypus?",environment,"  Platypus comeback planned for River Torrens if pollution and predator levels permit Adelaide's River Torrens could be set to host a return of the platypus, more than a century after the species disappeared from the habitat amid rising pollution levels. Researchers are preparing to carry out a feasibility study to check on whether the river environment and water quality have improved enough to be suitable for the animals, and will report back in six months. The river has persistently battled pollution in recent decades, with frequent algal blooms, rubbish build-up and the infamous accidental draining of the Torrens Lake in 2009 when a weir malfunction exposed the bed. In 2006, an environmental researcher from the University of Sydney described the high level of metal contamination in the river as ""astonishing"" and potentially dangerous. But Chris Daniels — presiding member of the Department for Environment's Green Adelaide — said the ecosystem had improved sufficiently to consider a comeback for the platypus. ""It's an animal we used to have in the Torrens up until about the late 1880s when mistreatment of the river just destroyed the habitat and the animals disappeared,"" Professor Daniels said. ""There's been a huge amount of work done on improving the Torrens and naturalising it and creating a wonderful river over the last 30 years. ""Isn't it time we think about bringing back one of the world's most amazing, most iconic animals to a place it used to live?"" Platypuses have been considered extinct on South Australia's mainland since the mid-1970s, but are still found on Kangaroo Island, with sightings in the Riverland during the 1990s and in 2018, and anecdotal reports of them in the Adelaide foothills in 2017. Professor Daniels said the feasibility study would consider three factors — whether there was enough space, whether there was enough food, and the prevalence of predators. He said there was no obvious reason a population could not thrive. ""The first step is to a really detailed plan about whether it is possible to do it … and what are the potential hurdles to establishing a viable population of these animals along the river,"" he said. ""The platypus exists in urban rivers in Hobart, in Melbourne, in Sydney and in Brisbane and in some of the smaller cities along the east coast, so they actually do OK with us [humans] along as there is plenty of food. ""If they can survive in the Yarra, considering the quality of the Torrens at the moment, I think it's really a reasonable expectation that we can make this work. ""Then animals [would] need to be sourced from elsewhere — breeding locations around Australia — so we would be working with governments in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland."" The SA government said the project was part of Adelaide's push to become a so-called National Park City — a term first used in 2019, when it was bestowed on London. University of Adelaide mammologist Dr Jasmin Packer said that, since their disappearance from the Torrens, the animals had proved elusive from the SA mainland, despite occasional rumoured sightings. ""There have been regular reports of platypus in the Onkaparinga and Sturt Rivers, but we're still looking forward to the day when someone shares photos or footage of these sightings,"" Dr Packer said. ""This potential reintroduction is a vital and exciting next step in continuing the improvement of the River Torrens.""

465,Hundreds of dead turtles wash ashore in Sri Lanka weeks after cargo ship sinks off coast,environment,"  Hundreds of dead turtles wash ashore in Sri Lanka weeks after cargo ship sinks off coast Hundreds of turtles have washed ashore after a ship caught fire and sank off the west coast of Sri Lanka in June in the country's worst-ever marine disaster, a court in Colombo heard this week. A fire erupted on the Singapore-registered MV X-Press Pearl on May 20, carrying 1,486 containers, including 25 tonnes of nitric acid along with other chemicals and cosmetics. It sank on June 2 even as salvage crew tried to tow the vessel away from the coast. The Russian captain of the ship, Tyutkalo Vitaly,  appeared in court on Thursday but has yet to be charged in a case environmental experts say is Sri Lanka's worst man-made environmental disaster. The toxins released from the ship had killed at least 176 turtles, 20 dolphins and four whales, deputy solicitor-general Madawa Tennakoon said at an initial court hearing in the capital on Wednesday. A video by a local television station seen by Reuters showed carcasses of dead sea turtles and countless plastic pellets scattered over the shore with several volunteers working to clear them. ""There were more than 190 items of cargo (on the ship) and most of it was plastic-based,"" Environment Minister Mahinda Amaraweera told reporters. ""During the south-western monsoon season, sea creatures never die in this way. Most of these carcasses are found on the west coast directly affected by the shipwreck."" The government has named 15 people — including the captain — as co-accused in cases over the damage caused. Mr Vitaly made no comment when leaving the court on Thursday after the procedural hearing and could not be reached for further comment. He has been barred from leaving the country. Authorities said last week they had lifted a ban on fishing in parts of the affected coast, though experts said risks to marine life from the disaster remained.

466,Stockton Beach's erosion crisis finally has a solution,environment,"  Unprecedented move to combat disappearing sand on NSW beach After years of trying to find a solution for a worsening erosion crisis at Stockton Beach, north of Newcastle, the New South Wales Government has located three offshore sand sources to replenish the coastline. If the plan is approved, it will be the first time permission is granted to mine sand offshore and use it to rebuild a NSW beach. The areas include the Inner Shelf Plain Sand Sheet and Old Barrier Sands to the east of Stockton Beach, as well as Hunter River Sands near the Port of Newcastle. Deputy Premier John Barilaro said 91 surface samples and 44 core samples were retrieved from the seafloor to be assessed by scientists, who considered factors like sand size and colour. ""This is the first time high-quality mapping data has been used in NSW to look for suitable sand for the purpose of beach endorsements,"" Mr Barilaro said. ""If proven successful for Stockton, the technology could be used in other locations."" The data will now go to Newcastle Council so it can assess the options and submit a development application for a mining license. The Deputy Premier also committed to helping the council fund the project, which Newcastle Labor MP Tim Crakanthorp expected would be millions of dollars. ""It's simply too big a spend for council to be coming up with and the local ratepayers, so music to my ears,"" he said. Mr Crakanthorp said it was an unprecedented move in NSW. ""It's very exciting because we absolutely need a solution for Stockton Beach and you know this really is the only one long term moving forward,"" he said. ""They do it in QLD, so it's been done elsewhere in Australia, but never before in NSW."" Deputy Lord Mayor of Newcastle Declan Clausen said the unique nature of applying for a mining license highlighted the urgency of the issue. ""We still need to have conversations to understand exactly what's required next,"" he said. ""The Deputy Premier has made it very clear to us that we have the support of the NSW Government and his department, including financial resources to ensure we can get that done in the most expedient way possible."" Barbara Witcher is part of the Stockton Taskforce and has been fighting for a solution to Stockton's disappearing sand for years. She said an important step had finally been reached in a tiring, long process and the government must now fast track the remaining steps to avoid more damage. ""We look forward to advancing this whole situation with the Deputy Premier,"" she said. ""The Stockton break waters have caused our problem and our sand is part of that sand that they have verified out in the Bight.

467,"'World-leading' powers for EPA, but farmers fear unfair decisions",environment," ABC Rural Victorian EPA beefed up with powers to prosecute environmental offenders Victoria's Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has been granted more power to hold polluters to account. The Environment Protection Act 2017 increases maximum penalties for serious offences. EPA chief executive Lee Miezis said penalties for bodies corporate were now much higher. The courts can fine severe polluters between $1.6 million and $3.2 million and individuals who commit aggravated offences can receive a jail term of up to five years. ""It's really world-leading legislation and it gives the EPA a lot more powers, but it also introduces almost a duties-based or a preventative framework, a bit similar to OH&S legislation,"" Mr Miezis said. ""Under the new act, a new general environmental duty is introduced which applies to every Victorian, and what it really means is we've got to take all reasonable, practical, steps to understand and manage the risks from the activities we do."" The proactive approach of mitigating potential for harm to human health or the environment has been welcomed by environmental consultant Dale Smith, the managing director of Scaada Group Services. ""I think the guidelines are really sound, in the way that people have real clarity on what is required of them,"" he said. ""People will now have to assist in [cleaning up pollution and dumped waste] — you need to manage your own problem. ""I think that's a fantastic thing. ""You see some of the legacies that the EPA have been left with over the last few years — there are hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of clean-ups that have taken place."" Mr Smith said the new legislation and tough punishment would stop people intentionally breaking environmental law. ""These perpetrators have simply been able to flaunt the laws knowing they haven't got any risk of being challenged at the high end of court. ""It stops people thinking they can get away with no repercussions."" Pork producer and commodity market analyst Matt Dalgleish said he wanted a separate category for agricultural waste — especially manure, which was classified as industrial waste. ""With the new regulations, it's a perfect opportunity to reassess the treatment and animal waste product and maybe determine that it shouldn't be lumped in with [industrial waste],"" he said. ""It seems like quite a bit of an overreach in terms of the amount of power the EPA now has. ""Effectively anyone in that's in the supply chain that [mismanages] handling manure can be looking at jail or a significant fine. ""Certainly if they are doing the wrong thing they need to be brought to account, but by and large the practices farmers use these days are very environmentally sound and sustainable."" Mr Dalgleish said he was concerned the new laws might unfairly punish farmers who used manure as a form of fertiliser. ""We are talking about a fairly organic product that's been used since the beginning of agriculture,"" he said. ""It's been around for hundreds and hundreds of years in terms of the safe use of this. ""It's actually a practice that's beneficial to the soil — if you look at the organic farms that rely on it, it can obviously be used in a capacity where it actually improves the environmental outcome, putting microbes back into the soil."" Mr Dalgleish said he understood the EPA needed to have the power to investigate manure if pollution occurred, but that the classification should not be equivalent with hazardous chemicals. ""I can understand the EPA's point in the sense that the use of manure in the wrong amounts and certainly near waterways … needs to be treated with care,"" he said. ""But farmers are the best stewards of the land and, as a farmer, if we don't treat the land properly and do the right thing by the land then it comes back and bites us in the longer term."" Mr Miezis said manure was deemed as industrial waste in the previous 1970 Environment Protection Act. He said the EPA was not unfairly targeting farmers. ""We know that in the farming community there is lots of good practice, there is lots of research and quality assurance,"" Mr Miezis said. ""We want to capture that and we want to see that promoted right across the industry, lift the performance and ultimately protect our important environment.""

468,Scores of pigeons found dead in Broken Hill's CBD may have been poisoned,environment,"  Dead pigeons at Broken Hill may have been poisoned Investigations are underway to find out why more than 80 birds were found dead near the centre of Broken Hill. The cause is a mystery, but some locals believe the birds may have been deliberately targeted. Helen Semmers from the Rescue and Rehabilitation of Australian Native Animals (RRANA) said the birds were found bleeding from their mouths and nostrils. ""It's usually indicative of some sort of poison,"" Ms Semmens said. She said the alarm was raised when people reported ""pigeons falling off of power lines at the intersection of Kaolin and Blende street."" When volunteers arrived to try to save the birds, they were confronted with a ""horrific"" scene. ""Not only were there a number of dead birds lying on the road, a number of them had been run over by vehicles,"" Ms Semmens said. ""And then there were a number that were being attacked by crows."" Of the 84 birds killed, the majority were found in the surrounding streets. Twenty-two were found on the Broken Hill High School grounds, while a number were also discovered at the TAFE building and at the site of the new police station. The concern for organisations like RRANA is that if the birds were poisoned, they could pose a significant risk for native species if they were not collected immediately. ""What is eating them is native birds such as crows and hawks that come along, and some falcons,"" Ms Semmens said. ""If the bodies are left overnight, or for a week, it could be somebody's pet cat or somebody's pet dog, and they could ingest the poison that these birds have ingested. Tests are being undertaken on one of the birds at the Broken Hill Local Land Services veterinary practice.

469,Building a bandicoot haven in your yard,environment,"  Giving bandicoots a chance in backyard havens On mainland Australia, eastern barred bandicoots — nocturnal animals with stripes across their rump — no longer exist in the wild. But they persist in Tasmania, where their number ""fluctuates"" and urban residents are being asked to turn their gardens into bandicoot havens to boost their population. Kate Thorn from the Natural Resource Management North (NRM North) said Tasmania was a ""stronghold"" for the marsupials, and we ""need to look after them here"". ""It's really about ensuring the population here can do the best it can, with the possibility even of reintroducing from here to the mainland in the future,"" the biodiversity manager said. She said the eastern barred bandicoot ""really can thrive"" in suburban areas and small towns. An urban garden can be turned into a bandicoot-friendly environment through five steps, according to NRM North. Firstly, they need a nesting site, which can be achieved by planting grasses and sedges in clumps: tussock grass, sagg and flax lily make for good species. Native Tasmanian animals are learning to live in urban areas and are frequenting Hobart's residential suburbs — researchers believe a drought 18 years ago could explain why. Next, the area needs to have food suitable for the critters. Lawns, leaf litter, branches and logs attract insects and worms that bandicoots feed on. ""They love to find little insects around your lawn, but they need somewhere to hide,"" Ms Thorn said. To keep them safe, plant prickly shrubs that provide protection from dogs and cats. ""The focus of the gardens is to provide some cover for them, where they can get away from cats and dogs, and have their nesting habitat where they actually nest within that grass as well,"" Ms Thorn said. They need to be hidden from other prying eyes too, such as hawks and owls — larger shrubs and trees, including manuka, lemon bottlebrush and silver banksia, can provide that protection. And finally, they need to be able to get into the garden: so, when fencing the yard, make sure the bandicoots can still get in and out. ""Even small things like changing the way you mow because bandicoots can be hiding in long grass and you need to give them a chance to get away,"" Ms Thorn said. Rosanna Coombes, chief executive of NRM North, said by creating a bandicoot haven, people also create an ark for other species. ""When you actually enhance habitat, you're also providing a habitat for other species as well, so there is a flow-on impact into other areas,"" she said. Peter Voller from West Tamar Landcare said he can personally vouch for the program. ""We ourselves on our own farm have planted about 3,000 plants for bandicoot habitat in the last two years,"" he said. ""The last couple of years has seen a real recovery in the species because there's just that access to shelter."" He said the West Tamar Landcare group had up to eight members who focussed on giving ""the little creatures a bit more security"". ""People in the lower West Tamar have indicated they've seen bandicoots back after 20 years, and that's a really good indication that we've started to see recovery,"" he said. Eastern barred bandicoots can reproduce quickly, if given a chance, but the young are prone to drying from predation or disease. ""Let them do what they do. They breed like rabbits if they get a chance,"" Mr Voller said. ""Leave them alone, give them some habitat and you're pretty well right.""

470,"Plastic waste export ban to be enforced, but could it see recycling sent to landfill?",environment,"  Recycling industry 'not ready' for ban on exporting plastic waste An export ban on sending mixed plastics overseas for recycling comes into effect on July 1, but it could see recyclable items sent to landfill. The waste and recycling sector said it was not ready for the change, with some states more than a year away from having the capacity to recycle all of their plastic waste. ""We're slowly progressing towards that,"" Rose Read, the chief executive of the National Waste and Recycling Industry Council, said. ""But are we ready for the 1st of July? No."" Federal, state and local governments agreed to ban exports of a range of recyclable items last year, after China and Indonesia blocked imports of waste from Australia and other nations. Glass has been banned from export since January 1 this year. From July 1, mixed plastics — where different types of plastics are bundled together — can no longer be exported. Plastic waste sorted into single resin or polymer types can be exported for another 12 months, if exporters are granted a licence by the federal environment department. But next year that too will be banned, with only plastic that has been sorted and processed into another material eligible for export. ""It is a big transformation, but importantly, it is gradual,"" Federal Environment Minister Sussan Lee told the ABC. Ms Read says the sector wants to re-use all of the plastic waste, but might not have the capacity to process it all. While Western Australia and the ACT have upgraded or built new plastic recycling facilities, some states and territories will take 12 to 18 months to increase their capacity. That does not leave many options for what to do with the mounting recyclable waste in the meantime. ""There is a limitation how long materials can be stockpiled because of safety reasons,"" Ms Read said. ""The alternative is to put it into landfill, (it) is the final option."" ""To put plastics into landfill is a significant cost and we don't want to do that. Plus there is the loss of those potential materials."" The Environment Minister disputed the sector's claim it is not ready for the change, stating a recent survey of the industry showed there was spare capacity for 160,000 tonnes of plastic recycling each year in Australia. That would easily allow for the processing of 75,000 tonnes of plastic waste exported last financial year. ""We've got to get this show on the road,"" Ms Ley said. ""We don't want to see this plastic to go into landfill, there's no need for it to go into landfill. ""Consumers have every right to expect that what they put in the recycling bin actually gets recycled."" Labor's shadow assistant minister for the environment, Josh Wilson, said it was the federal government's responsibility to ensure plastic put in recycling bins is recycled. ""Ultimately, the government will either need to change the date of the export ban or provide exemptions,"" he said. ""(Otherwise) it will go to landfill or it will be dangerously stockpiled, which creates a fire risk."" ""None of those outcomes ought to occur, but the government hasn't taken responsibility for the very real risk that that is where we will be after the 1st of July."" So far, no export licences have been granted to allow recycling companies to send single-use plastic waste abroad. The National Waste and Recycling Industry Council said this could compound the problems facings the sector over the next 12 months. ""The federal government needs to approve, as a matter of urgency, the current applications to export sorted plastics,"" Ms Read told the ABC. ""That's an important way to keep the revenue coming in… to cope with the losses incurred by not being able to export mixed plastics."" Ms Ley gave assurances those issues would be resolved. ""There has obviously been a bit of a rush (in applications) in the last few days. My department will work through the congestion in the system.""

471,"Thought to be extinct for more than a century, Gould's mouse is back",environment," Science Gould's mouse was declared extinct, but DNA shows it still lives on an island in Shark Bay, Western Australia Before European settlers set foot on Australian shores, Gould's mouse scurried about the continent. But land clearing and the introduction of predators decimated native rodent populations, and the little mouse was declared extinct more than a century ago – until now. A team of researchers, led by Emily Roycroft of the Australian National University, looked at genomes of Australia's extinct and living rodents. Their analysis shows a small population of Gould's mouse (Pseudomys gouldii) lives on an island off the coast of Western Australia. But this little animal with shaggy fur and large black eyes is known by another name. Gould's mouse is actually the same species as the Shark Bay mouse (Pseudomys fieldi), they report today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""I was quite surprised,"" Dr Roycroft said. ""Extinction doesn't usually offer second chances."" Australia is home to some of the world's most unique wildlife, with 86 per cent of its mammals not found anywhere else. But it has also lost more mammals over the past 200 years than any other country, with 34 land species being declared extinct since Europeans set foot on the continent in 1788. Native rodents make up nearly half of these extinctions. Their rapid decline was likely due to a mix of human impacts. Along with land clearing and introducing predators such as cats and foxes, early settlers were also keen bounty hunters. ""Basically, the government paid people to bring in dead animals,"" she said. And while Gould's mouse was once widespread, it was one of the hardest hit species during European colonisation and hasn't been seen on the mainland since 1895. But what hasn't been clear is whether Australia's rodents were already struggling before the first settlers arrived. Dr Roycroft and her colleagues wanted to look at this group's genetic diversity before its numbers took a nosedive nearly 200 years ago. Conservationists often use a population's genetic diversity as a measure of resilience against stressors such as disease and environmental change. Having a large mix genes gives a species a better chance of adapting to its changing environment. To assess the genetic diversity of Australia's rodents prior to European settlement, the researchers extracted DNA from eight extinct rodent species and 42 of their living relatives from museum specimens. The specimens had been collected between 120 and 184 years ago. In the Museums Victoria Ancient DNA Laboratory, the researchers sequenced the specimens' genomes to look at how they're related and how their genetic makeup had changed over time. They found that the rodents' genomes were diverse before European settlement, indicating that their once-thriving populations were more likely wiped out by human impacts than genetic weakness, such as inbreeding. The rodents' healthy genomes suggested they declined rapidly, unlike other extinct mammals such as the Tasmanian tiger. The team also found that larger species were more likely to become extinct. This is because larger rodents tend to be more attractive to predators and produce fewer young than their smaller relatives. But there was one extinct species that stood out. When the researchers analysed the genome of the Gould's mouse specimen, they found that it matched up with a species currently living on the islands off Shark Bay in Western Australia. This means the mouse never completely died out to begin with. This came as a surprise, as Gould's mouse specimens were originally collected in New South Wales and Victoria — over 4,000 kilometres away from Shark Bay. ""That's a really big distance, so I was surprised that those things were essentially the same species,"" Dr Roycroft said. ""But this has revealed that it was in fact a once very widespread single species that had collapsed down into this single off-shore population."" But how did these mice get there in the first place? Dr Roycroft said they likely made their way over when the islands were still connected to the mainland thousands of years ago. ""Slowly as the sea level rose, a little pocket of the population may have got trapped there,"" she said. Euan Ritchie, a wildlife ecologist at Deakin University, said that it's ""fantastic news"" that Gould's mouse is alive on an island in Shark Bay. But because the species is listed as endangered, it's important to make it a conservation priority, said Dr Ritchie, who was not involved in the study. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. ""Given this species occurs in such an isolated and single location, establishing captive breeding colonies and additional wild populations should be a priority,"" he said. Dr Ritchie also said the study highlighted the need for more investment in surveying, cataloguing and describing Australia's wildlife. ""We risk being unaware of the true diversity of Australia's species, and hence unable to care for and conserve it properly,"" he said. ""We essentially risk losing what we don't even know exists."" The next step for Dr Roycroft and her team is to analyse the genomes of other native animals to look at how they were also impacted by European settlers. ""I hope this study can be an inspiration to looking at other species and seeing what we can learn about Australia's biodiversity that we've lost,""  Dr Roycroft said.

474,No 'silver bullet' to help desperate farmers through mouse plague,environment,"  Bromadiolone poison rejected for use as bait to fight mouse plague,  no 'silver bullet' to help farmers While many rural residents are relieved the use of a poison described as ""napalm for mice"" has been rejected, communities remain desperate for a stronger tool to fight the mouse plague. In May, the NSW Government lodged an urgent application with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) to authorise the use of anti-coagulant poison bromadiolone in broadacre farming to try to eradicate mice. This week the application was knocked back by the independent authority, citing concerns for safety and the environment, particularly for what bromadiolone's high rate of secondary deaths would mean for other animals. Narromine farmer Stu Crawford said despite the severity of the mouse plague, he wouldn’t have used the poison if it had been approved. ""I don't think any farmer wants to see indirect consequences from a poison, I think there were too many risks from the product to follow through with it,"" he said. ""We wouldn't have used it if it was approved, we've been happy with the performance of zinc phosphide."" The Narromine mixed farmer says locals are prepared for the worst in spring. ""The sleeping giant is what mice will do in the spring [when breeding escalates]. That will very much depend on what happens to the populations in winter,"" he said. ""We're all very aware it could become a big problem."" ""There’s no easy fix for the plague, hopefully Mother Nature steps in soon."" Coonabarabran resident Susanne Sovic isn't as relieved by Bromadiolone's rejection. ""While people clap and cheer about this poison being rejected, another farmer walks away from the land,"" she said. ""More people are bitten while they sleep, more grain and crops destroyed. More dead stinking mice caught in buckets and buckets of water to drown. ""More kids have to suffer because their school books and uniforms are eaten by mice, not to mention their poor parents struggling with mice through their houses, eating wiring in their cars, chewing electrical wires in their homes. The list goes on and on. ""Yes, there would be secondary poisoning effects on wildlife but people in their homes out here are already spreading poison,"" she said. ""Come and take a drive at night [in a mouse plague-impacted area] and drive till the road is carpeted with mice. People wouldn't be so happy about this decision if they were suffering from the plague."" There are real concerns about the mouse plague worsening in spring when conditions warm up and breeding escalates. ""Breeding generally stops through the winter every year so we would be expecting mouse numbers to plateau over the next couple of months,"" CSIRO mouse expert Steve Henry said. ""We're still sure there are lots of mice in the system. ""This month in Parkes we trapped over 3,000 mice in a two-week period. We need to be really vigilant about how many mice make it through the winter time for when breeding starts again in spring."" Unfortunately the cold, wet conditions during winter are not expected to end the mouse plague, with mice hiding in burrows to escape the harsh conditions. Residents must be vigilant with mouse baiting and it's hoped approval to double the potency of the poison currently being used will have a big impact. ""The double dose zinc phosphide should be quite successful, we haven't tested it in the field yet but we should have some of those results soon,"" Mr Henry said. Dubbo environmentalist Mel Gray said while the plague was a devastating problem, she believed bromadiolone was a terrible option. ""A lot of native animals have been feasting on mice, including threatened species of Murray cod which people found surprising,"" the Healthy Rivers Dubbo convenor said. ""They're voracious predators. ""Goannas, raptors, owls, wedgetail eagles and fish are all gorging themselves on these mice,"" she said. ""Bromadiolone is a particularly insidious type of secondary poison. We can't just expect to be able to treat one part of the ecosystem – an out-of-control mouse plague — and not have serious knock on impacts with other species and the human food chain as well."" Ms Gray said there was no safe, quick fix to the mouse problem. ""The mouse plague is a horrible thing. There's no silver bullet,"" she said. ""I understand the government really wanted to come out … with a strong way to deal with this mouse plague, but there's nothing like that. ""I think this mouse plague has to be dealt with over time with a series of different solutions [such as] land management solutions [and] continuing with the poisons we're using now that aren't so dangerous for the environment. ""It’s a relief that APVMA saw fit to step in and common sense prevailed.""

475,Ecologist comes out of retirement to revisit outback pastures ,environment,"  Retired ecologist returns to repeat study of outback Queensland pastures five decades on It started out as an amazing career opportunity but, for Brian Roberts, moving to Charleville in Queensland's south-west in 1972 turned out to be life-changing. The Australian Wool Network awarded the South African ecologist a 12-month fellowship that year and Dr Roberts moved his wife and three kids to Charleville. ""It was a big adventure for my family,"" Dr Roberts said. In fact, they loved it so much, they eventually made the move permanent. ""It was an adventure that led to a big life change,"" he said. ""We were coming from apartheid South Africa and we were starting to feel like strangers in our own land. ""[After the 12 months] we spent the next two years trying to come back permanently. ""We [eventually] came back and became Australian citizens at the beginning of 1975 and we've been here ever since."" Dr Roberts says his friends call their journey ""Roberts' Odyssey"". For 12 months, Robert and his team travelled to 36 different sites spread throughout western Queensland, between Longreach and the New South Wales border. They were tasked with examining the condition of grazing land in western Queensland, and establishing a list of vegetation and soil types at the sites to determine how it may have changed over the years. ""We had the clear-cut briefing of trying to establish how the vegetation has changed since settlement,"" he said. After 12 months of travelling around the west, occasionally hitching a ride with the Royal Flying Doctor Service flights to different towns, Dr Roberts published the report ""Ecological studies in pasture conditions in semi-arid Queensland"". It was during this 12-month stint that he and his family fell in love with Charleville, its community and south-western Queensland. Almost 50 years after the initial study, Dr Roberts and some of his team are returning to western Queensland to revisit those 36 sites. Now 88, Dr Roberts says he'd always planned on coming back for the 50-year anniversary, but had to plan the trip a little earlier, on the 49th anniversary, due to his declining health. ""It's a big moment for me,"" he said. ""But I've left it rather late. I'm probably on my last legs. I was going to do it next year, which is the actual 50-year anniversary. ""We're a year head, but I am going backwards, physically, so this maybe the last big one."" Revisiting the area that he once called home, with most of the original team, is a wonderful walk down memory lane for Dr Roberts. ""I'm privileged to have a number of my old team members who were there in '72,"" he said. ""It's a bit of gathering of the clans."" Tracking down the 36 sites could prove to be the hardest task, with many now on properties that have since changed hands. ""We'd be lucky if we get to about 10 or 12 of them in much the same shape as they were before,"" he said. ""But that will do us, beggars can't be choosers, ""We'll do the best we can.""

476,Small towns fury over proposed Martins Creek quarry expansion,environment,"  Hunter communities united in fight against planned gravel quarry expansion Hunter communities have united to fight gravel company Daracon's plans to expand the extraction from its Martins Creek quarry to more than 1 million tonnes a year. Quarry operator Daracon wants to triple its annual output, increasing the number of freight vehicles and trains moving through the region. Residents of Martins Creek, Paterson, Vacy, Gresford, Bolwarra and Maitland assembled at Tocal College to express concerns about the potential impact on heritage, road condition, noise and air pollution, property values and the environment. The Department of Planning, Environmental Protection Agency and Roads and Maritime Service were invited to the meeting, but did not attend. The Martins Creek Quarry Action Group (MCQAG), which ran the community meeting at Tocal College, does not want the quarry to close down. ""Our committee understands that the quarry has operated in our community for over 100 years,"" MCQAG secretary James Ashton said. ""[The quarry] has co-existed quite reasonably until recent times in and around the community. ""However, now, Daracon are seeking to expand the facility from what was a 300,000 tonne per annum railway ballast production to the current application currently on exhibition, which is seeking to increase the scale to 1.1 million tonnes per annum."" The group's president Chris Atkinson said the proposal went too far. ""If you're extracting 1.1 million tonnes, you have two options: to make the blasts bigger, or to do more of them."" Other residents expressed concerns about dust levels and air pollution for asthma sufferers in particular. Residents' placards showed their fear of ""trucking hell"" with ""5 x Blasts, 5 x Dust and 10 x Trucks"". The ABC contacted Daracon for an interview but the company declined. A project summary sent to the ABC by a Daracon representative noted that the application has been revised due to identified concerns, and the new proposal included amendments to reduce the impact on road transportation volumes and refined operational hours. ""Key concerns from the local communities related to traffic and transport [including the volume and frequency of truck movements and road safety], noise, blasting and vibration impacts, and impacts to rural amenity and lifestyles,"" Daracon's summary stated. The company said it will await the verdict of the State Significant Planning Department, which will take into account its application and community submissions. Want more local news?

477,Culturally significant lake opens naturally after five years,environment,"  Culturally significant lake opening event creates natural tourist attraction The Lake Tyers Beach sandbar in East Gippsland has naturally opened to the ocean for the first time since 2016, enthralling curious onlookers. Environmental historian Jack Whadcoat — who has lived in the area for the majority of his 88 years — has seen it before. ""The entrance through the sand takes a lot of water out from the lake. The level goes down to sea level and then the system recycles again,"" Mr Whadcoat said. When it is sealed, Lake Tyers can reach peaks of up to 2.4 metres, accumulating a build-up of insects, rodents, mulch, fish, algae and other micro-organisms. A natural breach occurs when heavy rains cause water from the surrounding creeks to overflow the lake over the sandbar, eroding a pathway to the ocean. According to Gunai elder and author Wayne Thorpe, Bung Yarnda — the Gunai name for Lake Tyers — roughly translates to ""camping area near plenty of freshwater"". ""The significance of the sandbar break is that the fresh water gets a chance to meet up with the saltwater, so they can have a conversation and exchange gifts,"" Mr Thorpe said. That collision of fresh and salt water during a breach event means an abundance of fish, marine organisms and plant food amass at the entrance, a phenomenon which historically attracts birds, seals and diverse species of fish to the area. For traditional custodians of the land, the bounty of seafood was a time of feasting, where neighbouring clan groups were invited to share food and settle differences. ""Our ancestors, over generations, have gathered here. This is a meeting place. At times, when the bar opens, that brings a lot of fish, so there's a lot of food to share,"" Mr Thorpe said. Historically, the lake opened about once every 12 months, either naturally or by human intervention. There were opposing community viewpoints on whether the lake should open naturally or be prised open when water levels were high. The argument to artificially open the lake largely stemmed from property owners in low-lying areas upstream, trying to avoid flooding to their homes as the lake's level rose. However, traditional owners and environmentalists in the area believed the lake needed to open naturally, so that the flood water pressure from surrounding creeks would flush out and refresh the entire ecosystem, bringing new marine life into the lake. With fires, floods and climate change, the eco-system of the lake has been changing. ""Over the [past] few years, [our] climate has been changing … and the rainfall is irregular. This time, it has got to a high level, almost as high as I've seen it in my lifetime"", Mr Whadcoat said.

478,"New national parks created in Victoria, but not everyone's happy about it ",environment,"  Victorian government creates three new national parks, but not everyone's happy The Victorian government has created three new national parks in the state's central west in an attempt to protect and preserve some of the region's most precious parkland areas. The new national parks will be created either side of Ballarat, and north-east of Bendigo, adding 65,106 hectares to Australia's national park register. The largest will bring together the Lerderderg State Park and the Wombat State Forest to create a new park covering more than 44,000 hectares between Daylesford and Bacchus Marsh. A 15,000-hectare Pyrenees National Park will be created north west of Avoca, and a 5,282-hectare Mount Buangor National Park will double the size of the existing state park north of Buangor. Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said the parks were created to preserve the areas, ensuring their tourist viability for years to come. ""We're listening to the communities that use and care for these areas and balancing the needs of public land users, industry and the environment,"" Ms D'Ambrosio said. However, a local bush users group has slammed the decision, labelling it a ""devastating decision"" for regional Victoria. The Victorian government's decision comes more than two years after the Victorian Environment Assessment Council (VEAC) finalised its report into the environmental sustainability of the region. The report, which was initiated by Ms D'Ambrosio in 2017, recommended the government protect 58,115 hectares of land. Ms D'Ambrosio had the findings on her desk since at least June 2019 when the report was made public. After months of delays — which the government blamed on the Black Summer bushfires, then the coronavirus pandemic — the plan has been acted upon and the government's response to VEAC's report finalised. It will be a bitter pill to swallow for some, who have railed against the move since VEAC began its investigation into the Central West district. The state government said it had engaged extensively with local communities and stakeholders, including traditional owners. But Bush Users Group United co-founder Bill Shulz said he was absolutely furious with the government's decision. ""There is absolute massive number of people who were against this altogether,"" Mr Schulz said. Activities like recreational shooting, domestic firewood collecting, and prospecting, which were previously permitted in state forests, will be banned in the new national parks. Mr Shulz took aim at the environment minister, accusing her of not listening to the community groups that use the forests regularly. ""She does not realise that this is going to be devastating for regional Victorians who suffered enough as it is through bushfires and COVID-19,"" he said. ""As soon as you bring in a national park, anything that's in the national park is protected — including cats, dogs, pigs, and anything else. ""What do you think is killing your wildlife? It's cats and dogs, killing them by the billions."" Parks Victoria is the body charged with controlling feral animal numbers in Victoria's national parks and reserves, and has numerous programs in place to control introduced pests within protected areas. The Environment Minister said turning the areas into national parks would protect the surroundings, rather than endanger them. ""Our parks, reserves, and forests help safeguard our unique flora and fauna, and provide Victorians with space to enjoy the great outdoors and connect with nature,"" Ms D'Ambrosio said. The peak body for national parks in Victoria described the announcement as a ""landmark moment"", with significant progress made for nature protection in the state. Victorian National Parks Association executive director, Matt Ruchel, said the decision should be seen as a win for the protection of such pristine areas. ""This is the first significant addition to our parks estate in over a decade,"" Mr Ruchel said. However, the association remains guarded about the state government's promises, questioning why a staged approach would be taken to parks, allowing for extensive logging at the future site of the Mount Buangor National Park. ""The decision has come with strings attached,"" Mr Ruchel said. ""The plan to log much of these areas and then turn them into national parks in 2030 doesn't make any sense. There is still decades of wood supply outside of the proposed park areas.""

479,Koalas at centre of $40m Byron Bay planning dispute,environment,"  Land and Environment Court considering $40 million Byron Bay subdivision on potential koala habitat A $40 million development in Byron Bay is likely to hinge on whether or not the Land and Environment Court considers the site to be core koala habitat. Plans for the 162-lot subdivision were rejected by the Northern Regional Planning Panel in February 2019 and the proponent for the development, Site R & D, has appealed the decision through the Land and Environment Court. The appeal falls to the Byron Shire Council to defend. The West Byron proposal includes 127 residential lots, 25 super lots, two business lots and two industrial lots on land opposite the Byron Arts and Industry Estate. It is a separate development to the adjacent Harvest Estate, which was approved in December. The second half of a six-day hearing wrapped up today, with Commissioner Michael Chilcott reserving his judgement on the matter and asking both parties to submit more information. Lawyer for the applicant, Clifford Ireland, argued in closing submissions that the evidence did not support the definition of the land being core koala habitat. He said the relevant state environmental planning policy defined core koala habitat as having a resident population with sufficient numbers for breeding. ""The definition specifically uses the term resident,"" he said. ""It must be a sufficient number of koalas capable of breeding on that land (and) the evidence simply does not go that far."" Mr Ireland said the resident population must be evidenced by attributes like breeding females. ""There was one female detected in all the historical records,"" he said. ""Neither ecologist was able to say in their expert evidence that there were breeding females on this land. ""The definition also requires sighting of a population (but) all we have as far back as 2010 is a sighting of a (small) number of koalas."" In reply, the lawyer acting for the Byron Shire Council, Adam Seton, said any perceived lack of evidence about a residential koala population was more likely the result of the applicant doing nothing to look for them on the site. ""There is not one targeted survey for koalas on this site,"" he said. ""You will not find evidence of things you do not look for. ""When it comes to asking that question about whether the land is core koala habitat, one may say you cannot be satisfied one way or another because you simply don't have sufficient evidence to come to a conclusion."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC North Coast's weekly email newsletter. Mr Seton cited evidence of at least five koalas spotted on the land since 2010 — including a female — as well as koala scat surveys. He said the most comprehensive was a survey by the University of the Sunshine Coast in 2017, which identified 13 sites where fresh scat was recorded and two sites where koalas had been present in the previous 24 hours. The court also heard arguments about the development's impact on vulnerable frog species and the removal and ""insufficient replacement"" of thousands of preferred koala food trees. Land zoning and previous development approvals were also discussed, with Mr Ireland arguing there had already been an approval for a subdivision in the same (West Byron) urban release area, which was approved through the Land and Environment Court under the same commissioner. He said the land was specifically zoned for urban release and had a large number of planning, environmental and social benefits, such as the regeneration of ""degraded"" and ""unmanaged"" farmland as well as addressing the need for additional housing in the area. However, Mr Seton said zoning was not the ""end of the story"" for development approvals. ""The fact that you have zoning does not necessarily entitle you to go ahead and impact on biodiversity values,"" he said. In closing, Commissioner Chilcott said he would also need to consider the issues raised about the legal interpretation of wording in the state environmental planning policy. Mr Ireland made the point earlier in proceedings that the policy was framed in a way that guided decision making by councils, with no reference to decisions made by planning panels — raising legal and jurisdictional questions about the role of the Land and Environment Court. Mr Seton disagreed, and both parties have been asked to make written submissions on the issue.

480,UN calls on Tasmania to pause wilderness development,environment,"  UNESCO calls on Tasmania to pause development in Wilderness World Heritage Areas The Tasmanian Government is again under pressure over its management of the state's World Heritage Areas. A United Nations committee has asked the government to halt tourism development in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA) until a cultural assessment is completed. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) World Heritage Committee said  ""all proposed tourism developments within the property, regardless of their nature and spatial extent, should be subject to adequate impact assessments prior to being permitted"". The Liberals called for expressions of interest in tourism developments within the TWWHA when they came to power in 2014. In 2019, Mr Gutwein — then as minister for environment, parks and heritage — said the government's plan was for Tasmania to be ""the eco-tourism capital of the world"". Since then, the government's handling of a requested Tourism Master Plan for the area has drawn criticism from UNESCO on several occasions. Despite one being first requested in 2015, it was only publicly released earlier this month. In a draft decision released ahead of a meeting next month, UNESCO said it wanted more scrutiny of the plan. Tasmania's Premier Peter Gutwein would not be drawn on the advice to pause developments, saying he would ""wait to see that advice before I comment on the position they've taken"". ""I would hope that would be sooner rather than later,"" he said. A spokesperson for Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley said concerns expressed about the Tourism Master Plan were ""not warranted"". ""It does not make any sense to halt all development at the property, especially if development is required for maintenance of existing infrastructure or visitor access, amenity and safety,"" the spokesperson said. UNESCO also asked the state government to offer up details of its tourism development plans in advance. Wilderness Society campaign manager Tom Allen said the advice built on previous concerns expressed by UNESCO and the World Heritage Committee about development in the World Heritage Area. ""We are going in the wrong direction,"" Mr Allen said. One controversial proposal is for a standing camp and fly fishing tours at Lake Malbena in the Walls of Jerusalem National Park., with objectors opposed to the proposed use of helicopters to get people to the location. Mr Allen said it was not known whether the Tasmanian Government had informed UNESCO about the Lake Malbena proposal or others it wants to see in the TWWHA. He said the committee also noted the ""area is suffering because Australia's government is failing to take the climate and extinction crisis seriously"". ""The World Heritage Area has been significantly affected by bushfires which is equivalent to coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef,"" he said. ""In a few years time, if the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, the world's highest-rated World Heritage wilderness, continues being mistreated, privatised and developed, it could join the Great Barrier Reef on the in-danger list. ""Thankfully, It's not too late for the Tasmanian Government to change course and save it"", Mr Allen said. The UNESCO committee noted ""with serious concern"" that the 2018-2019 fires had resulted in the loss of swathes of sensitive vegetation in wilderness areas. ""The response by the [government], particularly the commitment to developing a comprehensive fire management plan for the property, are welcomed and should be further sustained,"" it said. ""The progress towards a more inclusive approach to the protection and management of the property is also welcomed. ""The advances of the Detailed Plan for a Comprehensive Cultural Assessment are additional positive steps, but it is of great importance to conclude this process before any further development takes place.""

481,Jet ski tour turns into a mission to rescue a turtle in trouble,environment,"  Jet ski riders free entangled turtle near Airlie Beach in the Whitsundays A scenic jet ski tour in the picturesque Whitsundays has turned into a mission to rescue a turtle in trouble. The group was touring the waters around Airlie Beach on Monday when their guide spotted a turtle in trouble. It was initially thought the large green turtle was suffering from float — a condition that prevents turtles from diving below the surface — but it was soon apparent the situation was much more serious. ""It was entangled in quite a large crab pot, with two large metal rings about a metre in diameter and remnants of the net,"" rescuer Ian Wilson said. ""I tried to sneak up on it and swim out to it but it was a bit timid and didn't want a bar of us."" Mr Wilson, who runs Whitsunday Jetski Tours, said he recruited a passer-by to man his jet ski while he attempted the rescue. ""I had no hope of getting it from the water on my own, I couldn't get it above my shoulders in the water."" He said the rescue took about 40 minutes and several attempts. After trying to swim out to the distressed animal, he decided to go upwind, turn the engine off and jump onto the turtle's back. ""Once I got hold of it around the shell it flapped around a bit, but when I lay back with it in my life jacket it just sort of gave up. ""As soon as it was on the ski, it was like, I'm done, it's rest time."" Mr Wilson said he believed the turtle had thankfully only been entangled for a short period of time. ""There was only a little rub mark on its flipper and didn't have any growth on the shell,"" he said. ""The line was tight but it hadn't broken the skin."" In the course of his work, Mr Wilson regularly sees turtles swimming in the ocean and has seen some struggling due to float or other conditions. But none to this extent. He said most people around the Whitsundays were pretty good at disposing of fishing gear, but the rescue was a timely reminder. ""Make sure you discard the gear properly, cut up the line and nets and dispose of them properly in bins."" Injury and fatalities to marine life by entanglement is listed as a key threat under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act. The federal government has adopted a plan to address the issue of marine debris and its impact on wildlife. It's something that Mr Wilson sees each day at work and he said he used it as an opportunity to educate people. ""People were asking why is this happening and why the turtle was like it was,"" he said. ""I explain about bloat and the problems plastic and fishing gear give marine life. ""Our tours are about fun, but it's a great chance to educate people … many don't understand the plight they face."" Ian Wilson said it was a great feeling to have been able to help the turtle and then see it go back into the wild. ""I spoke to the turtle rescue centre and they assessed it at a boat ramp,"" he said. ""Once we put it in the water he was a bit dazed, swam into a pontoon and freaked out a little bit but then once he found the ocean he was on his way. ""You see the trouble they get into and it's all man-made, so it's good to be able to help out.""

482,'Not a city person': These regional Aussies are digging in as climate change advances,environment," Science Climate change challenges residents of Kiah, Cobargo and other NSW towns who want to rebuild after Black Summer The forests of the NSW south coast are shooting green new leaves, but the future of many communities here is uncertain. Can the locals dig in? The isolated hamlet of Kiah, near the New South Wales-Victorian border, is perched on the edge of vast tracts of eucalyptus. Bushfire destroyed most of its 73 houses during Black Summer. Eighteen months on, only a handful of dwellings are being rebuilt. Many people are still living in sheds and caravans. In February 2020, as the fires still burned, the Prime Minister promised his government would do ""whatever is necessary to ensure communities rebuild."" But with climate change making many types of disaster more frequent and severe, the question of whether people should rebuild at all hangs in the air. ""Any place surrounded by forest is going to become extremely dangerous to live in,"" says Professor David Bowman from the University of Tasmania. This could mean some people have to leave their land, according to Richard Thornton, head of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre (CRC). ""It's really difficult to say to somebody, you can't live here anymore although you own the land,"" he says. ""What do you do with people that refuse to leave? Is there a process to forcibly do that?"" Barbara Norman, director of Urban and Regional Futures at the University of Canberra, agrees. ""It's a very emotional issue,"" she says. ""And so it should be."" Standing outside his shed on the first morning of winter, Harry Tress is surrounded by objects that have miraculously survived the fires, or been oddly transformed. There's a brick coated with metal; a window pane curled like a shell; a shiny teaspoon found in the rubble. The retired forester and commercial fisherman lost his Kiah home of 30 years on the night of January 4, 2020, when a fire that ""couldn't be stopped by a million firies"" swept up from the south. ""My whole life savings gone into this house and the fire come through and f***ing wrecked the lot."" He raised his family in that house, of which nothing remains. ""It’s really knocked me around, I know that."" Harry plans to rebuild. The fresh concrete pad of his new home is nestled among the trees. It's classified as the highest possible bushfire risk. ""I like the area, I like me spot here. I've got nowhere else to go,"" Harry says. Today, his former neighbour Dale Boyce is visiting. The retired fish filleter and keen deer hunter lost his home of 20 years that same night of January 4. In conversation, the pair like to exchange vivid impressions of the fire and the scenes of destruction afterwards. One saw a paddock that was ""red and blue"" with asphyxiated parrots; the other came upon the gruesome, pooled remains of a commercial chicken hatchery. On the one-year anniversary of the fire, Harry and Dale fired their shotguns at a ""Good Riddance 2020"" pinata. Not much was left of the papier mache when they had run out of shells. The shells are still scattered about, but Dale has moved an hour away to a greener patch. He says when he initially moved back to Kiah after the fires, the silence of the charred forest was so creepy that he couldn't make himself leave the shed for days. ""It's got nothing going for it,"" he says of Kiah. Harry disagrees, but says the place will never be the same. The surrounding forest of scraggly burnt gums isn't going to recover, the former forester says. And most of the traffic on the Princes Highway just rushes through nowadays — the neighbours are gone. ""They couldn't go through it again,"" he says. Driving south from Sydney to Kiah, the Princes Highway follows the NSW coast. The winding route passes through a string of places that were devastated by fire during Black Summer. At Lake Conjola, more than 130 homes were destroyed. Sixty houses burned at Malua Bay. And Cobargo lost 70 homes. Australians in rural areas are generally more exposed to the impacts of climate change than those elsewhere. Yet the Australia Talks National Survey 2021 revealed that Australians in rural areas are the least likely to say that climate change is a problem for them personally or Australia generally. Many of Kiah's residents, for example, say the drought that led to the Black Summer was due to a ""natural cycle"". They say the climate will ""go back to normal"". The science says otherwise. There may be ups and downs, but warming will continue — and the barrage of extreme weather will worsen. Meanwhile, climate change is already shaping many people's lives, from the cost of insurance through to the expense of bushfire building standards. Most of the houses destroyed in New South Wales during the 2019-20 fire season are not in the process of being rebuilt. From a statewide sample of 1300 destroyed houses across nine shires and councils, less than a quarter have been the subject of development applications. That rate will go up, but past experience suggests it won't go much higher. Ancestral family properties burnt out by the Black Summer may never see houses again. Many people say they can't afford to rebuild, and fear that only the wealthy will be able to live in these beautiful, isolated locations. Those who have the money — and can stomach the risk — are rebuilding in very high-risk areas. ""If you've got money you've got options,"" says Peter Gartlan, co-ordinator of bushfire recovery for Financial Counselling Australia. ""There'll be a lot of people that won't rebuild,"" Mr Gartlan says. ""Or they'll rebuild something a lot smaller than what it was. ""Or they'll walk away."" Geoff Manias is one of those who are walking away. Four hours north of Kiah in Lake Conjola, where 130 homes were lost in one night, the serenity of the water views is punctured by the nail guns of several construction teams. The fence cladding advertises special deals for landowners wishing to rebuild from bushfire. Property prices on the South Coast have boomed during the COVID pandemic as people in capital cities seek a sea or tree change. Geoff says he's sold his block, which housed his home of 20 years, to ""Sydney money"". As with many others, Geoff's decision to leave came down to the rebuild cost. And the size of this figure was decided by a piece of paperwork known as a BAL rating. Most of the houses destroyed in the Black Summer were built before BAL ratings, which were made mandatory for bushfire-prone areas in 2009. As a a result, most of those rebuilding are encountering the ratings for the first time. After the fires, Geoff's property was rated at BAL FZ, which stands for Bushfire Attack Level Flame Zone. It's the most expensive rating. Building to BAL FZ costs an extra $280,000 on average due to the cost of fire-resistant materials and design elements. On top of this, the quarter-acre block will require a 10-metre cleared strip around the house, which will leave only the width of a shipping container in which to build. The attitude of the new owners, Geoff says, is ""whatever we have to do, we'll do it with money."" Stories like this are familiar to Catherine Gorrie, who runs a private company that assesses bushfire risk and assigns BAL ratings for people building in bushfire zones. ""We work out something is going to be in the flame zone [BAL FZ] and we have people crying,"" she says. ""People buy [bush blocks] ignorant to the cost of building and then have to sell them."" ""We see that all the time."" On New Year's Eve 2019, a fire described as a ""500,000 hectare inferno"" struck the tiny coastal locality of Malua Bay south of Lake Conjola. Nick Hopkins' home burned to the ground. Fire-fighters estimated that some rooms burned at 1400 degrees. Nick then sold the block and moved with his wife to a suburban plot on the coast. ""It will only be a matter of time before the next wildfire emergency comes through because of climate change,"" the tree-change retiree says. ""We don't want to risk having to go through that a second time."" Tammie Goodliffe, a local small business owner and mother of four children, has bought the property. She believes it's possible to build to a standard that would make the house safe from another Black Summer, but hasn't yet had the property assessed for a BAL rating. Even BAL FZ homes are designed to withstand only 30 minutes of exposure to fire. But Tammie is happy to take the risk. Her dream is a common one: for her children to have a ""home among the gum trees"". ""What puts you at risk is having that beautiful scenery,"" she says. ""This is going to be our forever place. We hope."" Barbara Norman from the University of Canberra says we need to move away from the current approach of putting all the risk on the buyer. Leaving the stressful decision to rebuild entirely up to the individual — and lumping them with the liability — also creates its own mental health problems. ""We're just placing vulnerable people on vulnerable lands,"" Professor Norman says. One approach, she suggests, may be consolidating rural settlements so they're more easily defensible. Another may be resettlement: paying people to move elsewhere. ""It takes a lot of resources to be able to look after those isolated settlements,"" she says. ""When the fire comes, that's putting our first responders at risk."" Those who lost houses but stayed in the area are constantly reminded of the destruction. The scent of wood smoke from prescribed burning; the ""matchstick trees"" on the ridgelines. These are a reminder of what could happen again. South of Malua Bay, in the area around Cobargo, dozens of people are living in caravans with little prospect of rebuilding, but no wish to leave. Carlin Stanford, Anglicare's bushfire recovery coordinator in Cobargo, says she knows 300 people who lost their homes. Only 18 have been rebuilt. She says many people have experienced mental health problems and these issues will get worse the longer they go without their own home. Here, too, it all comes down to BAL ratings. Even a less-extreme BAL rating of 29-40 can add up to $80,000 to the cost of building. ""And so lots are really staring down the barrel of not being able to rebuild in any way,"" Ms Stanford says. ""And they're facing having to move off the land, which they've been on for, in some cases, generations."" Down a dirt track off the highway, the unofficial mayor of Kiah, Errol McGovern, has gathered the clan beneath the twin stone chimneys of the former family home. There's five children and 11 grandkids. The house, built by his great-grandfather more than a century ago, burned to the ground on January 4, 2020. Errol and his wife, Joyanne, are living in a shed. ""I'm building regardless of what council say,"" he says. ""I didn't strike the match that burned the house down."" Two of his children are buried on the property and he hopes that one day he will join them there, he says, fighting back tears. ""I'll never leave. This is paradise."" But of the 11 properties further up the river, only two are still occupied, says Joyanne. The McGoverns, one of the first European families to settle in the area, may soon be one of very few that remain. ""Community-wise, we find that difficult,"" Joyanne says. COVID hasn't only created a property boom, but also made it easy for people to forget the Black Summer, says Kel Henry, RFS captain in the nearby village of Wonboyn. ""The fires became yesterday's news fairly quickly,"" he says. The lessons of that summer, including where people should rebuild, have not been learned, he says. ""The places where Kiah folk are rebuilding need to be really carefully considered,"" he says. ""There'll be certain places that are not able to be rebuilt. ""But I'd hate to be the one making those calls and decisions for those poor buggers that are in that situation."" Amy Whipp may be one of those ""poor buggers"", but she says nothing and nobody will make her leave her land. Her isolated property in dense forest an hour west of Kiah is accessible by one narrow dirt road. ""There's definitely a lot of fuel left over from the last one, so the fear is there,"" she says. Amy has neither council approval to rebuild nor the money to pay for a house with the necessary BAL rating. There was a house on the property when she bought it, but it turns out it hadn't been approved. She lost everything in the fires and was not insured. Eighteen months later, Amy and her family are still living in a shed and using an outdoor shower in a climate that can freeze buckets of water overnight. If she stays, she may lose her home and its contents to fire again. If she wants to leave but the land does not have approval to build, she may struggle to find a buyer. And with each decade of climate change, the bushfire risk will go up. ""I'd be here even if I had to live in a tent,"" she says. ""I'm not a city person.""

483,Atmospheric river set to fuel a wet week ,environment,"  Atmospheric river set to deliver a deluge from coast to coast A cold front and tropical moisture are teaming up to drag rain from coast to coast, across the desert, this week. According to senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology Sarah Scully, thunderstorms are forecast to develop on Thursday through south-west Queensland, central New South Wales and even central parts of Victoria. These storms could be severe, with wind gusts likely to be the biggest factor. Then there is the rain. Rain is already falling across the desert and it is about to feed all the way down into the south-east and across into Queensland. During winter, cold fronts skirting across the south of the continent are a near weekly occurrence, but rain from the desert to the Dandenongs is not part of the usual script. The difference this time around is what is known as an ""atmospheric river"". University of Melbourne PhD student Kimberly Reid studies atmospheric rivers. She explains that they are like rivers of water in the sky that transport water, above our heads, at quantities roughly equivalent to the amount of water that flows down the Amazon. ""So they are huge and when they hit mountains or interact with cold fronts, as we are about to observe, they rain out this water and can typically cause heavy rainfall, floods, snow and strong winds."" Keen watchers of Australia's weather might be familiar with the term north-west cloud band. Such a phenomenon is associated but not quite the same thing. A north-west cloud band is when there is a band of cloud that stretches across Australia from the north-west and typically ties in with a cold front, as is going on at the moment. North-west cloud bands can exist without being associated with an atmospheric river but they don't typically bring as much rain. But when an atmospheric river joins in, it brings extra moisture to the party. As is happening at the moment. An atmospheric river is feeding in tropical moisture from the north-west just as a cold front is pushing across the south of the country from west to east. ""You've got this warm, moist air in the north-west and then this cold, dry air coming up from the south. ""So, what happens when they interact is the cold air forces the warm air to go up and cool."" As the water vapour goes up and cools it condenses into a liquid, generating a huge band of cloud and increasing the chance of rain. According to Ms Reid, atmospheric rivers are not particularly uncommon because there is usually one in our region around once a week. And yes, there was one associated with all that recent flooding in Victoria according to Ms Reid. The rain has already started to fall across the Pilbara and central desert. It is a part of the world where rain gauges are few and far between but they have already recorded 31mm at the Bureau's weather station at Giles (from Uluru, keep going west until you cross the West Australian border, then keep going some more). Not bad for the desert and a promising sign for those hoping for rain further south. ""This is a really good news story for many … agricultural areas of South Australia ... as they've been missing out on a lot of the rainfall that eastern Australia has been drenched with over the last few months,"" Ms Scully said. But perhaps the biggest relief associated with the system this week is who will miss out. After a thoroughly sodden few weeks, flood-affected regions in Gippsland are not forecast to receive significant rainfall with this rain band, according to Ms Scully. However, there is a cut-off low spinning up in the wake of the atmospheric river and its path is uncertain at the moment, but the BOM is keeping an close eye on it. ""It looks like the areas to be watched will be south-east South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. ""Particularly the western and northern windward slopes of Victoria and New South Wales."" This system is also forecast to bring dangerous surf conditions along the southern coast, which is set to coincide with the highest astronomical tides, upping the risk of coastal erosion and could even result in the inundation of low-lying areas. Ms Scully warns those along Spencer's Gulf and the Gulf of Saint Vincent, including Port Adelaide, to remain alert. As usual, please keep up to date with the warnings via ABC Emergency and consider packing a dry set of socks if venturing out in the wet this week.

485,"Just like last year, dead birds are littering Nhill Lake ",environment," ABC Rural For a second straight year, corella bodies are littering Nhill Lake and its surrounds Dozens of dead birds have been found on and around Nhill Lake for a second year running, with state bodies investigating potential reasons. It follows dozens of bird bodies being found at the lake around May, 2020. “I collected about 26 birds from about the bank of the lake, and there are a number in the water as well [that] we can’t get to at the moment,” Mr Bone said. “[The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning] then had some inspectors come up and have a look, they have also had Agriculture Victoria collect some birds for testing but, at this stage, we haven’t heard anything back on any causes. “They did inspections last year but couldn’t find anything in the autopsies that was blatantly the cause, and I suspect there will be a similar finding this time.” Mr Bone said DELWP had informed him there were no risks to public health at the lake. “I actually think it might not be anything in the lake,” he said. “The birds are migratory during the day and roost at the lake at night, so I suspect they pick something up during the day, come back to the lake to roost and then fall victim to whatever it is.” A DELWP spokesperson says investigations into the most recent dead bird find are in their early stages, but made no further comment.

487,Wet winter and spring tipped for much of Australia thanks to climate phenomenon brewing off WA,environment,"  Indian Ocean Dipole developing off WA likely to spell wet winter and spring for much of Australia A heavy band of cloud has been producing an unusual and out-of-season downpour over parts of Western Australia's north this week. But weather forecasters say a climatic phenomenon developing off the state's north-west coast could bring more wet weather in months to come. And it's not just WA's north. Much of Australia, particularly the south-eastern states, is being tipped for a wet winter and spring, thanks to a climate driver known as the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The IOD affects rainfall and temperature patterns across the country, particularly during winter and spring (or the dry season if you're in tropical parts of Australia). There are three phases of the IOD — positive, negative and neutral. On average, each phase lasts three to five years. While it's currently in neutral, the IOD is looking more and more likely to kick into negative gear by late winter and into spring. If it does, it will bring with it a wetter-than-average season for much of Australia, particularly south-eastern states. The IOD refers to the sustained difference between sea surface temperatures on the tropical western and eastern side of the Indian Ocean. When the IOD is in a negative phase, the waters near Africa's east coast are cooler than usual, while the waters the the north-west of Australia are warmer. Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) senior climatologist Lynette Bettio said the warmer sea surface temperatures meant more chance of rain. ""The negative IOD provides more available moisture for weather systems to tap into, so the impacts of the negative IOD are dependent on the weather systems,"" she said. ""For example, a north-west cloud band would deliver more rainfall in an area as broad as from north-west WA through inland parts to South Australia and Victoria."" It can also influence temperatures, often bringing cooler-than-average maximum temperatures over south-eastern Australia while maximum and minimum temperatures in Australia's far north are typically warmer than average. The last time the IOD was in a negative phase was in 2016. A negative IOD event is not declared until the index remains below the threshold for at least eight weeks. But Dr Bettio said it could still influence Australian rainfall as the event develops. So far, the IOD index has been below the negative threshold for five weeks running. Dr Bettio said that could be a contributor to the out-of-season wet weather in WA's Pilbara this week. Up to 30 millimetres of rain was recorded in several Pilbara towns on Monday, with further rain forecast to reach the popular tourist destination of Broome on Tuesday. Wet weather is typical for the south of WA this time of year, but the Pilbara and Kimberley are in their dry season, usually marked by six months of clear, blue skies. Despite developing off WA's coastline, a negative IOD phase is most likely to bring a rainfall boost to south-eastern Australia. Average rainfall figures from past negative IOD phases show Victoria and New South Wales are given the biggest boost in rainfall (indicated in blue shading on the above map). Large areas of Queensland, South Australia, Hobart, the eastern half of the Northern Territory plus the Pilbara, Gascoyne and Goldfields regions of WA also have above-average rainfall (indicated in green). No part of Australia experiences below-average rainfall. As parts of WA's south clean up the trail of destruction caused by intense downpours over the weekend, it may be hard to believe, but the new phase of the IOD is unlikely to have any impact for the state's most populated region, the South West. In fact, many of the major climate drivers, such as La Nina and El Nino, yield little influence over the region. ""In the cool season rainfall predominantly comes from the passage of cold fronts, and it is rare that they are far enough north to channel the moisture across the southwest,"" Dr Bettio said But after one of the wettest autumns in decades, particularly for parts of WA's Central Wheatbelt and Great Southern, it is unlikely the region will be desperate for the extra rain this year.

488,This entire remote Fijian village needs to pack up and move. Again,environment," Science Between a rock and a hard place: A Fijian village stares down climate change After two catastrophic cyclones in three years, the village of Drue faces a life-changing decision. Sixty-three-year-old stroke survivor Miriama (Miri) Katawalu is confined to a wheelchair. When a powerful tropical cyclone struck her village in 2018, she says she felt abandoned. ""One day before Cyclone Keni struck, I was alone at home. No-one came to check on my wellbeing. When the winds started to intensify, I didn't know what I was going to do. I was helpless. ""My sister-in-law came to my rescue as the winds and the waves tore my house to shreds. I've been living with her family ever since."" Miri's village on the remote Fijian island of Kadavu suffered the full brunt of Cyclone Keni. The storm surge generated 8-metre waves that crashed more than 100 metres into Drue, as well as gusts of up to 215 kilometres per hour. Ten of the community's 27 homes were severely damaged. Two years later in April 2020, and before the residents could fully rebuild, Drue was hit by a second, more powerful storm. Tropical Cyclone Harold destroyed 20 homes, flattened crops, the village primary school and its teachers' quarters. Adding to Fiji's woes, the recovery effort was severely impeded by the COVID outbreak. Cyclones, storm surges and flooding are commonplace for communities across Fiji. But the added influence of climate change means these disasters are becoming more intense, according to Naomi Jackson, a technical officer in oceanography with Pacific Community (SPC). ""We know that low-lying atolls and coastal communities are experiencing sea-level rise through climate change, and potentially extreme cyclones that will exacerbate the risk of coastal flooding and increase the likelihood of extreme waves,"" Ms Jackson says. It's not just scientists sounding the alarm. Drue village chief Ratu Paula Nakulanikoro says he's witnessed the changing climate. ""Since the 1970s, we can see the difference in the strength of the cyclones we used to have then, and to the cyclones we are facing now. ""When Tropical Cyclone Keni happened [in 2018] I was at home. ""I crawled to a safe pathway under the house that I had prepared earlier and took shelter with the chickens and the dogs. ""I remember there were three waves that swept through the village — we all fled for our lives."" Ratu Paula says when Tropical Cyclone Harold struck last year, he took his family to another house further from the ocean to take shelter. ""During the height of the cyclone, I kept looking at my watch — an hour had passed — we were praying for the cyclone to die out. ""The strong winds felt like someone was using a pinch bar to remove the nails off the roofs. ""After the winds had stopped, we made our way outside. ""I went to check on my house to find half of the house gone, including everything inside except the kitchen sink. ""While we were still inspecting what was left of our homes, the children ran to the beach to collect fish that were brought in by the big waves. ""We suddenly felt a wind, much stronger than the first. ""This destructive wind lasted for almost two hours. It felt like a bomb was set off in the village."" The Drue people pride themselves on their rich history, and their village is significant to the Indigenous people of Fiji. It's immortalised in a famous Fijian song Liwavi au na Tokalau (the easterlies blow on me), which has become somewhat of an anthem for the people of Kadavu. In pre-colonial times, the area was a centre of tribal warfare and Drue was established as a fortress for the self-proclaimed King of Fiji, perched on a cliff overlooking the sea. In the late 1800s when missionaries brought Christianity to Fiji, the villagers were encouraged to move down from their hill fortress to the beach to gain easier access to maritime trade. The village has remained at that low-lying site since. But now Ratu Paula, Miri and the rest of the community are faced with a choice: to stay put and face the rising sea, or once again upend their village and move to higher ground. A 2016 report by the Pacific Community (SPC) identified Drue as one of several villages on the island of Kadavu requiring relocation, due to its increased vulnerability to disaster. Ratu Paula says he is starting to accept that moving may be necessary. ""The village of Drue has been one of the many places tourists stop by to spend their vacation and experience the true hospitality of the Drue people. ""[But] due to the consecutive number of cyclones that have hit Drue, we are now coming [around] to the idea of relocating to higher ground. ""We consider this decision to be much safer than getting hit by the cyclones and tsunamis that keep destroying our homes and farms."" But it's not so simple. Relocation has been a topic of great concern during village meetings. For many in these remote communities, access to the financial resources to relocate is difficult, and it's especially so for the people of Drue who have already had to rebuild twice in the past three years. The community relies on subsistence farming with some access to markets where they sell fresh produce and locally caught fish. This provides a limited income, but not enough for most to be able to afford to relocate their houses. But despite the difficulties, 76-year-old Epi Cula has been encouraging the villagers to relocate and build away from the shoreline. ""We know very well the dangers of cyclones and how to prepare for them; however, we didn't prepare well,"" says Epi, an active member of the Drue community. ""Cyclones and sea-level rise are coming. We need to be ready and to build our homes further inland; we need to move. ""We have already identified a place beside the old village site — if anyone wants to build, go build there. Our lives are in our own hands."" In the meantime, the 2016 SPC report recommended villages focus on moving their evacuation centres and churches to higher ground, and planting vegetation along the shoreline as a temporary buffer against big storm surges. The main access to Drue village is via a path along the beach. The pathway was built by a local hotel owner who had seen how hard it was for children to get to school, and for the villagers to get to town over the steep cliffs that bookend the village. But large waves during cyclones Keni and Harold dislodged rocks from the cliff face, sending them onto the path below. This makes the journey to the coconut plantations or to the nearby resort, where some of the women of Drue work, difficult. In good weather, the primary school children from a nearby village catch a long-boat to school in Drue. But when the weather is bad or when the boat is busy, they have to use the increasingly dangerous pathway. When that happens, Drue village school head teacher David Turabe accompanies the students on the rocky track, called Muaikeru. On foot it takes an hour and when the tide is high, the children must swim around the cliff. The only other access around this point is by boat, which is expensive, Mr Turabe says. ""We have five students that live in Naikorokoro village and one student that lives in Muaidule, [who] use this track frequently. ""This trail of rugged volcanic rocks is very slippery and steep; the children have to climb these rocks to get to the other side. ""Rising sea level has brought a lot of things that we did not see before — the waves breaking onto the side of the cliff are causing the rocks to break and fall and that's a danger to the people [who] are using that point as a crossing. ""[But] we don't have access to roads, we have to cross."" Despite the hardships they face, the Drue people are full of determination and resilience, and still carry their trademark Fijian smiles. The Drue Women's Club meets weekly to discuss issues that affect their families and the village. The 26 women in the club say the two issues of greatest worry are the continuous disasters that strike the village, and food security after disasters. One key lesson they have learnt is how to be resilient during the cyclone season. The women have been weaving mats, producing coconut virgin oil, and planting vegetables around their homes, as access to the village farms has been destroyed by the cyclones. This initiative has been successful in assisting the village, providing a second income for their families and putting food on the table, Drue Women's Club secretary Kaselia Marama says. ""Our farms have been destroyed, including our yaqona (kava), our main source of income. [So] we are trying new initiatives to help our families."" Yagona plants take up to five years to mature. The frequency of disasters is now making this crop unsustainable. ""We have just been concentrating on 'voivoi' or pandanus leaves to weave mats, as this was the only tree that was spared by the cyclone. ""The sea also provides us with fish that we sell at the Vunisea market, together with the vegetables that I plant around my house."" The club has embarked on a project to build an evacuation centre for the village. This project will also involve the Drue women living in Suva, Kaselia says. ""Women play an important role in supporting our households, families and communities. The Drue Women's Club is determined to work with our village committee to rebuild our village. ""We have a five-year plan, and we will work with the relevant people, government, and NGOs to fulfil all that we have planned together. ""This is our village and our future, we have no other place to go. We are strong and resilient. Slow but sure, Drue will rise again.""

489,Rare Chilean cacti returned home after Italian police raid smuggling operation,environment,"  Poached Chilean cacti discovered in Italy returned to their rightful home Armed with a search warrant, Italy's police wildlife unit entered the house of a suspected cactus trafficker, finding over 1,000 rare cacti poached from Chile's Atacama Desert in a locked room. This February 2020 discovery became one of the largest known cactus busts and the catalyst for an international effort among cacti experts, police, conservationists and governments to return the plants to their native countries. What Lieutenant Colonel Simone Cecchini and his team found in Senigallia, a town on central Italy's Adriatic coast, were hundreds of Copiapoa cinerea and Eriosyce cacti that had been uprooted from the desert. They also found the suspected trafficker's passport, computer and other documents that helped them reconstruct his operation. The suspect, an Italian in his 40s, had made seven trips to Chile, from where he sent boxes of cacti to Romania and Greece. They then were brought to Italy and sold to clients, mostly in Asia. ""I never imagined there could be a market like this. I never thought a cacti could be sent by post to Japan for 1,200 euros ($1,898),"" Mr Cecchini said. He reached out to Andrea Cattabriga, president of the Association for Biodiversity and Conservation, and asked him to examine the specimens to confirm they had plundered from the Chilean desert, which is considered the driest non-polar desert in the world. The region, west of the Andes Mountains, has been used by scientists as a site to simulate Mars expeditions. In a small town on the outskirts of Bologna, Mr Cattabriga has several greenhouses where he legally grows a wide variety of rare cacti from certified seeds. He then tries to recreate their natural habitat and uses cotton swabs for pollination. This has given him the ability to distinguish between those grown in greenhouses and others pulled out of the desert. Mr Cattabriga immediately contacted the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which keeps a red list of endangered species around the globe. According to the IUCN, about one-third of 1,478 cacti species are classified as threatened. Yet while there's international concern about the risk of extinction for rhinos, tigers or pandas, few people are aware or concerned about the possibility of a cactus species becoming extinct. ""I think part of it is because plants are everywhere. So we take them for granted,"" said Barbara Goettsch, co-chair of the IUCN's cactus and succulent plants group. ""In the specific case of cacti, these are more threatened with extinctions than birds or mammals."" Cacti have become increasingly popular both as collectors' items and as decorative house plants. In recent years, demand has been growing in China, Japan and Thailand. Mr Cattabriga and Mr Cecchini decided the size of the seizure required an historic action: plants had to be returned to Chile. ""When a stolen work of art is recovered, it is returned,"" said Mr Cattabriga. ""It had to be the same for these cacti."" But sending them back was easier said than done. Shortly after the seizure, Italy went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The confiscated cacti were moved to a greenhouse at the Botanical Garden at the University of Milan. Then they launched a year-long effort to cut through red tape and find the funds for the transfer. In Chile, Pablo Guerrero of the Botanical Department at the University of Concepcion began organising with the Chile's National Forestry Corporation (CONAF) to receive the plants. Finally, over a year after the cacti were discovered, the recovery plan fell into place. Mr Cattabriga joined officers from Mr Cecchini's wildlife team wrapping up 844 plants to be sent back to Chile. Of those confiscated from the suspected trafficker, 107 had died. On April 18, 2021, the plants arrived at the airport in Santiago and were taken to a special quarantine centre on the outskirts of the Chilean capital. They will remain there until August. Their future is still uncertain. Politicians are pushing for them to be returned to the Atacama Desert. But Guerrero is concerned that the plants may not survive that direct planting. He is pushing for a special botanical garden in the Coquimbo region where their natural habitat can be reproduced. Meanwhile, the suspected trafficker and an accomplice have been charged and will face trial in Ancona, Italy. He declined to speak to The Associated Press. Mr Cecchini also said people who collaborated with the suspect have been put into a Europol database and will be monitored. ""Most people in Chile do not think we have species poaching. They think poaching is about rhinoceros or elephants very far away. They are not aware that it is right here with our cacti,"" said Mr Guerrero.

490,Dinosaur footprints 'fascinating' evidence of how prehistoric animals lived side by side,environment,"  Dinosaur footprints reveal behaviour of prehistoric animals living near Winton 95 million years ago Newly published research on a 54-metre-long site of dinosaur footprints in outback Queensland has revealed the extent of the region's biodiversity 95 million years ago. The fossilised footprints, discovered in Snake Creek on Karoola Station north-west of Winton in 2000, encapsulates a week in the life of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals from the Winton region. ""The site preserves evidence of almost every major group of vertebrate animals that we find in the Winton area,"" paleontologist Stephen Poropat said. The tracksite, which is up to 10 metres wide, and weighs at least 300 tonnes, preserves footprints of three different types of dinosaurs — sauropods, theropods and ornithopods — as well as crocodyliforms, turtles and lungfish. Dr Poropat, who is a research associate at the Australian Age of Dinosaurs museum and led the research on the Snake Creek tracksite, said the results of his analysis were surprising. ""Next to these big sauropod tracks there were tiny little tracks as well, and they had three toes,"" he said. ""The immediate assumption was they were made by small-bodied dinosaurs, probably either meat-eating theropods or little plant-eating ornithopods. ""That turned out to be wrong."" Some of the tracks in fact belonged to crocodyliforms, relatives of modern-day crocodiles, and turtles. The tracksite was painstakingly excavated and relocated to Winton's Australian Age of Dinosaurs museum over three years, and opened to the public last month. The museum's executive chairman, David Elliott, said it was exciting to have confirmation of the story behind the tracksite. ""Now we've got a whole raft of information that we can tell people who visit the museum,"" he said. ""It's really exciting. ""There's a lot more things on that trackway than we originally thought. ""We knew we had some dinosaur tracks and we thought that was the extent of it, but there's quite a lot more, and that tells us so much more about the biodiversity of the Winton area back 95 million years ago."" Dr Poropat said the research ""solidified"" and ""galvanised"" scientific understanding of prehistoric life in central-west Queensland. Until now, the Australian Age of Dinosaurs had found sauropod bones, but no tracks. In contrast, it had discovered footprints of the smaller ornithopods and theropods, but not as many bones. ""This site puts paid to that — it's got them all,"" Dr Poropat said. Both he and Mr Elliott said it was surprising to find evidence of all the animals living in the one place at the one time. ""It's one thing to find bones, but it's another thing to find the tracks of all these different animals where they've been watering or living in the water or whatever it is, in a billabong,"" Mr Elliott said. ""I think it's fascinating. ""We knew that those animals were around, but to … see them interacting and on that trackway, I think that gives science more information, it backs up what they're saying. ""Like they say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and I think a dinosaur trackway is the proof of the pudding for a lot of paleontology, when most of what we find is body fossils.""

491,Destructive coconut rhinoceros beetle a 'stone's throw’ away,environment,"  Destructive coconut rhinoceros beetle a 'stone's throw' from Australia as it spreads through Pacific Australia's sugar, pineapple, mango, and coconut oil industries are facing a major threat from a destructive pest beetle sitting on the nation's doorstep. The coconut rhinoceros beetle has bulldozed its way across the Pacific in just a few years and is now in Papua New Guinea, University of Queensland researcher Dr Kayvan Etebari warned. ""If it gets into Australia, coconut oil palms and many other palms found in the forest and in home gardens will be at risk,"" Dr Etebari said. It has been a year since another invasive pest, the fall armyworm, was first detected at Bamaga at the tip of far north Queensland and has since devoured crops across most states and territories. Dr Etebari said the fall armyworm came down the island chain from PNG. ""Last week it got into Tasmania,"" he said. The coconut rhinoceros beetle, a native of South-East Asia, has been in Samoa, Fiji, and Tonga for a century, but was successfully controlled by a virus for the past 50 years. However, that biological control is now failing. Central Queensland horticulturalist Neil Fisher has been watching with growing concern the beetle's rapid march from the South Pacific across to Guam and Hawaii to Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and Solomon Islands. ""The move through Papua New Guinea has been quite swift and we've seen large-scale coconut plantations and oil palm plantations being destroyed,"" he said. ""Our border security is the Torres Strait and it's only a matter of kilometres, just a stone's throw from Papua New Guinea into north Queensland."" Councillor Fisher, who is also the deputy mayor of the Rockhampton Regional Council, said it was a concern shared with council colleagues in Cairns. ""There are miles of coconut-lined beaches to the north of Cairns and to lose those would see erosion coming back. You could lose two or three kilometres of actual shoreline,"" Cr Fisher said. The beetle causes damage by boring into the plant's stem and feeding on the sap, damaging the developing leaves. The plant will then be defoliated and will die during a heavy infestation. The beetle lays eggs in decaying matter and then moves on. ""We knew it was a risk, but it wasn't until it got into large horticulture and agriculture areas in Hawaii that suddenly the red flags went up,"" Cr Fisher said. He said Hawaii had similar horticulture and plant culture to Australia. On top of the obvious economic threat to the country's $2 billion sugar industry and $53 million pineapple industry, Cr Fisher said the beetle could pose a threat to other plants. ""If it's in pineapples, what about bromeliads? It's an up-and-coming collector choice for gardeners. And if it can get into sugar cane, what is the risk to other canes and bamboos?"" he said. Cr Fisher said it was important to work with universities to find a new biological control to keep the insect at bay. Dr Etebari and his team at UQ are studying why the virus is no longer controlling the beetle and their findings would be critical to managing the pest if it got a foothold in Australia. ""The question is how do we stop it? And what's gone wrong with the control that's been effective for the past five decades?"" Dr Etebari said. The researchers discovered that there have been several new waves of beetle invasions, not one as previously thought, as well as different types of beetles. They also found there were variations to the beetle virus which was originally sourced from Malaysia. ""It's similar to how other scientists spot different strains of COVID-19. We are detecting variations in the beetle virus in the Pacific,"" Dr Etebari said. ""In our case the problem is more complicated because there are different types of beetles and different strains of the beetle virus."" Their next step was finding out how the virus variations behaved in the different beetles and how that could be used to control them. Dr Etebari said it was important for Australia to help its Pacific neighbours to tackle the pest, not just for economic reasons, but also humanitarian. ""It's a serious threat to livelihoods across the Pacific islands as the coconut tree provides essential resources like food, copra, building material, and the coastal protection for more than five million vulnerable people,"" he said. A Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment spokesperson said it was working with biosecurity counterparts in PNG and Solomon Islands to track and monitor the spread of the new beetle strain. The department was also actively monitoring the spread of the beetle strains through PNG, particularly in the Western Province and PNG Treaty Village areas bordering Australia's northern Torres Strait Islands. The spokesperson said the department was also supporting regional initiatives that were dealing with the coconut rhinoceros beetle.

492,Peruvian mum awarded 'Green Nobel' for work to create Amazon national park,environment,"  Peruvian mum awarded 'Green Nobel' for work to create new national park in Amazon rainforest As a teenage mother and activist, Liz Chicaje would travel by boat and foot across Peru's Amazon rainforest with her young daughter campaigning to protect the ancestral lands of the Bora indigenous people from illegal logging and mining. To preserve the forest that the Bora and other indigenous people depend on for hunting and fishing in Peru's north-eastern region of Loreto, Ms Chicaje spearheaded the creation of a 809,370-hectare national park. Ms Chicaje's activism and leadership earned her a prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize — known as the ""Green Nobel"" — which honours grassroots activism, along with five other winners. ""We live off the forest. It's our wealth. If it wasn't for the forests, we wouldn't have the food and pure air that we breathe,"" Ms Chicaje, 38, said. A growing demand for timber, beef and soy is fuelling the destruction of the Amazon. As criminal networks operate with impunity, those trying to defend the rainforest face a life or death battle. ""We all have to continue to advance in the protection of the environment and reforest areas."" Ms Chicaje and other indigenous leaders worked with government officials, environmentalists and scientists, using satellite imagery to map areas that would be placed under protection. She convinced other indigenous communities to endorse the park, and in January 2018, Peru's government declared the creation of the Yaguas National Park. With deforestation rates rising in parts of Peru's Amazon, the national park is seen by environmentalists as vital in safeguarding ecosystems and carbon-storing peatlands and rainforest. Announced in San Francisco, California, during an online ceremony, the Goldman Environmental Prize provides each of the six winners with financial support to magnify their environmental activism and continue local campaigns. Among this year's other prize winners are Gloria Majiga-Kamoto, a Malawian anti-plastics campaigner; environmentalist Maida Bilal from Bosnia-Herzegovina; American Sharon Lavigne, a campaigner against toxic waste and pollution. They also include Thai Van Nguyen, a Vietnamese wildlife conservationist, and Japanese environmentalist Kimiko Hirata. Ms Hirata's work has focused on eliminating Japan's old and inefficient coal-fired power plants — a major contributor to carbon and other emissions that fuel global warming. After Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was severely damaged in a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the government closed many of the country's nuclear plants and ramped up coal power, said Ms Hirata, who is the founding member of the Kiko Network, a local climate change nonprofit. ""We needed to start from zero. People didn't really know anything about coal … they didn't see it as a problem,"" she said. ""There was no knowledge among the Japanese people where coal power exists, how many coal plants exist and the risks it has."" As part of a national anti-coal campaign Ms Hirata began in 2011, a website was created to track new proposed coal plants, along with a network of activists living in areas where new coal stations were being planned, she said. Working with scientists, academics, lawyers, journalists and local community leaders, Ms Hirata sought to raise awareness in public meetings and hearings about the negative impact of coal power on the environment and Japan's pollution levels. The campaigning paid off. By 2019, Japan's government had cancelled 13 planned coal plants across the country, averting the emission of about 42 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, the Goldman Prize committee said. ""When I see the map of Japan, and where [coal] projects were canceled, those are mostly the areas where we mobilized local movements,"" said Ms Hirata, adding that there are currently no plans to build any new coal plants in Japan. Ms Hirata is now putting pressure on Japan to phase out the use of coal power altogether and to commit to only renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar, by 2050. But achieving this goal will be more difficult in a country where coal is seen as an important part of the energy mix, and where healthcare and economic issues often take priority over climate action, Ms Hirata noted. Japan's energy policy aims to have renewable energy contribute 22 per cent to 24 per cent of total power by 2030. Currently, the country gets about 18 per cent of its electricity from renewable energy sources. ""We can't just shout, 'Do not build more coal plants!' We have to show a solution for the people who are involved in the coal business,"" Ms Hirata said.

493,Outback tour guide becomes a TikTok star,environment,"  TikTok outback guide attracts 750,000 virtual tourists to South Australia An outback tour guide who gave up everything to chase his dream job is bringing South Australia's outback to hundreds of thousands of virtual viewers. Sid Hewison — known on the video-sharing platform TikTok as Sid Ventures — has enthralled viewers across the world with snippets of Australia's most remote and ancient landscapes. His path to internet fame started a decade ago when he moved back to Australia with no job, no money or possessions after living in Indonesia. ""I was looking on the internet for anything and everything that would take my fancy,"" he said. ""I saw a little job popped up that said: 'Be a tour guide in Alice Springs', and two weeks later I was living in Alice Springs, and 10 years later it's still my number one passion."" The pandemic prompted Mr Hewison to get on TikTok and bring his day job to a global audience of more than 750,000. Users of TikTok share videos ranging from just a few seconds to a minute to an ever-increasing global audience comprised mostly of younger people. ""I joined about four months ago, now I've got about three-quarters of a million followers and about 60 per cent of those are from the United States,"" he said. ""Part of the inspiration behind it was basically to bring the tours to the people who I couldn't actually get to, or who couldn't get to me. And I wanted to still be able to bring what I felt I could actually provide to the world. ""If they are in lockdown watching, that's the plan."" Eight of Mr Hewison's past 10 years have been in South Australia. ""I've got to say Arkaroola is one of the most special and beautiful places that I've ever had the pleasure of working at and living in as well,"" he said. ""Anywhere in the northern Flinders [Ranges], there's so much beauty and ruggedness and ancient aspects to the landscape and the culture up there. I can just never get enough of it."" He has just embarked on a six-month motorcycle tour of Australia. ""After I gained the traction that I gained over the past few months, I realised that I wasn't going to lose too much if I threw myself into this online presence 100 per cent. ""As soon as I realised people were interested, I decided I was basically going to make my own tour riding around Australia and film and document that whole thing."" Popular TikTok users can earn a living off the platform in some parts of the world, but not yet in Australia. ""I've got a lot of people who are following me who are quite happy to throw in a couple of dollars until I can actually monetise the whole project myself,"" Mr Hewison said. ""That'll be through advertising or sponsorship or something like that."" But Mr Hewison said viewers would not be spotting prominently placed cans of soft drink or beer in his videos anytime soon. ""I'm very much against marketing and advertising in general … If I ever do promote a product, it'll be something that I stand by 100 per cent.""

494,Flinders Ranges virtual tourists to be 'teleported' into the deep past as part of World Heritage bid,environment,"  Flinders Ranges virtual reality tour in development to support World Heritage bid While the Flinders Ranges in South Australia's outback are hundreds of millions of years old, the region's rugged landscapes are getting a more contemporary treatment as part of a move to secure lasting global recognition. Researchers at the University of South Australia are currently developing a virtual interactive tour of the region to support a bid for World Heritage status. Several sites within the Flinders Ranges, including Nilpena Station, were placed on Australia's Tentative List for World Heritage in April. The SA government is currently preparing a full nomination to be submitted to UNESCO over the next two years, with a final decision expected in 2024. That process is now being complemented by the virtual reality project led by geologist Tom Raimondo, who is developing a 3D interactive tour of some of the region's most visually striking and geologically important locations. ""We want to teleport people back in time to witness these events that were the building blocks for what the Flinders are today,"" Associate Professor Raimondo said. Using 3D cameras attached to drones and four-wheel drives, a team of researchers and students has collected videos and images of sites including Ikara-Wilpena Pound, the Warraweena Conservation Park, and the Blinman Heritage Mine. The end result, they hope, will allow participants to put on VR headsets to undergo a ""journey through deep geological time"". While Associate Professor Raimondo said the VR tour was not formally a part of the World Heritage bid, he hopes that, when complete, it will be rolled out in schools and museums around Australia and the world. ""This project was really borne out of the desire to really engage people with the World Heritage nomination,"" Associate Professor Raimondo said. ""We thought what better way to do it than to create a virtual tour where people can learn about all the fantastic geology, all the fantastic palaeontology, all the stories that really give us an insight into a critical period of Earth's history."" He said while the virtual tour would offer a bird's-eye view of some of the region's most popular spots, participants would also be given the opportunity to witness renditions of prehistoric events — such as the creation of the Acraman crater by a giant asteroid strike 580 million years ago. ""For the Ediacaran theme — which is all about the earliest forms of life on Earth — what we will do is transport people to that original ocean bed that existed over 500 million years ago,"" he said. ""You will be able to effectively swim around with these critters that represent the first life forms to appear on planet Earth."" By making the Tentative List for World Heritage, the Flinders Ranges sites are a step closer to joining an illustrious club across the world, which includes places such as Machu Picchu, Yosemite National Park and the Galapagos Islands. The successful nomination follows years of effort by palaeontologists who have been excavating rare Ediacaran fossils believed to be 550 million years old.

496,Rock wallabies under threat from parasitic disease on Magnetic Island,environment,"  Rock wallabies under threat from parasitic disease on Magnetic Island A colony of rock wallabies on Magnetic Island has been ""virtually wiped out"", with fears a parasitic disease carried by cats could be responsible for the deaths. The Magnetic Island Nature Care Association is trying to save the island's remaining wallabies and is calling on the community to help them. ""We've got a cluster of about 23 or 24 deaths in one small area in Nelly Bay, so at the moment we're seeking community advice on any other dead animals people are seeing,"" said Gethin Morgan, the group's president. ""20 odd wallabies in this small section is basically a very healthy colony virtually wiped out."" At least three of the animals, which are classified as a vulnerable species, have been confirmed to have been infected with toxoplasmosis, which is caused by a parasite typically carried by cats. Mr Morgan said feral cats had been a problem on the island for some time and urgent trapping needed to be done to help protect the national treasures. ""We're looking for funding to employ a feral cat specialist to do a preliminary trapping of feral cats in the area where deaths are occurring, and work with national parks to set up a longer-term feral cat strategy for the island as a whole,"" he said. The group also raised their concerns with the Townsville City Council calling for them to approach the issue with some urgency in urban areas. A council spokesperson said they are aware of the recent deaths and residents needed to be diligent in meeting their responsibilities for keeping their pet cats enclosed within their residence. ""Residents are urged to call council to collect any wandering cats that they may come across so officers can attend and impound the animal,"" the spokesperson said. Humans can also contract toxoplasmosis and Mr Morgan said he was worried the disease could pose risks to the island's residents. Townsville Hospital and Health Service Public Health Unit doctor Steven Donohue said the likelihood of people contracting toxoplasmosis from rock wallabies was exceedingly low. ""The host animal of the parasite is cats,"" Dr Donohue said. ""The most common sources of human infection in Australia is from accidental ingestion through contact with contaminated cat faeces."" Dr Donohue said in rare cases the disease could be dangerous for humans, and some healthy people with good immune systems could develop flu-like symptoms, but most people would not show any signs of illness at all. ""In people with weakened immune systems the infection can be severe and require medical treatment,"" he said. While the risk of contracting toxoplasmosis remained relatively low, Dr Donohue said people could take precautions to protect themselves. ""Good hand hygiene and safe food handling practices, in addition to wearing gloves whilst gardening and closed-in shoes whilst bush walking, will minimise your chances of being exposed,"" he said.

497,'We need to watch this shelf': Scientists concerned about acceleration of huge Antarctic glacier,environment," Science Fears Antarctic glacier could melt faster as it speeds up and ice shelf 'rips apart' Antarctica's Pine Island Glacier has started moving faster again, according to new research. Scientists said the glacier increased its rate of flow toward the Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica by 12 per cent between 2017 and 2020, in a paper published today in Science Advances. This latest acceleration in flow speed and the mechanisms which caused it, mean the melting of the glacier could be ""much more rapid"" than previously expected, the researchers said. The Pine Island Glacier has contributed the most to sea-level rise from Antarctica over the past few decades, and holds enough water to raise global sea-levels by half a metre. ""What is worrying is that we weren't expecting this much shelf loss from this part of the ice sheet,"" said lead author Ian Joughin from the Polar Science Centre at the University of Washington. ""It's entirely possible that the rest of the shelf could break up in the next decade or two now that the process has started,"" Professor Joughin said. Between 1973 and 2009 there was a general trend of acceleration of the glacier, from 2.3 kilometres per year to 4 kilometres per year over that period. The acceleration was attributed to thinning of the ice shelf due to ocean warming, and a retreat of what is called the ""grounding line"" — the boundary where the glacier lifts from the land and begins to float over the water. But between 2009 and 2017, that process of thinning remained fairly stable and there was a pause in the acceleration of the glacier. The speedup which began in 2017 is not thought to have been caused by further thinning, but instead by the ice shelf — the leading edge of the glacier that sits out over the sea — ""ripping apart"", the researchers said. Several large ice-shelf calving events, where large slabs of ice break away from the shelf, have been captured in satellite monitoring images since 2017. These resulted in a 19 kilometre retreat, or a loss of one-fifth of the ice shelf during the 2017-20 period. That's compared to a 7.5 kilometre loss between 2015-17. The rate of the glacier's movement, which was measured at a point above and below the grounding line, is now estimated to be 4.6 kilometres per year. The floating section of the glacier helps to slow the advance of the ""grounded ice"" — the part of the glacier still over the land. That's because the floating section is pushing through an embayment. The friction of the ice against the walls of the embayment holds the entire glacier back. Sea-ice scientist Petra Heil from the Australian Antarctic Division, who wasn't involved in the study, said it was like removing an obstacle from cars in traffic. ""We have seen this in some other locations as well — if you lose the buttresses you make the traffic faster flowing,"" Dr Heil said. ""It also happened for example, with the Mertz Glazier, but there, there were a whole heap of other processes as well. ""But here they've shown [the process] really clearly. They have the satellite imagery — they were lucky it happened during those years where we had Sentinel."" The European Space Agency's Sentinel-1A satellite was launched in 2014 to scan the Earth's surface as a way of monitoring the environment. Sentinel's images of the Pine Island Glacier — taken every 6 to 12 days since 2015 — provided the imagery that allowed the researchers to measure the scale of the loss. There are myriad influences on the rate that glaciers flow and melt, and so it's difficult to ascertain whether this glacier will slow down again or continue at this new pace. The researchers' models predicted there was a chance the Pine Island Glacier would slow back down to around 4 kilometres per year over the next decade, but that the longer term trend was likely to be continued acceleration, according to co-author Pierre Dutrieux from Columbia University. ""It may be that this is just a momentary speedup, and that in this new configuration the ice will resume its lower-paced acceleration driven by ocean melt,"" Dr Dutrieux said.

Professor Joughin said even without further acceleration, the Pine Island Glacier is ""way out of balance"". ""At the present rate it is losing about 85 per cent more ice than it is gaining through snowfall."" ""We clearly need to watch this shelf because its breakup could happen way sooner than expected."" He said that unless global temperatures actually drop, which is a highly unlikely scenario, it's ""more than likely"" we'll lose the majority of the West Antarctic ice sheet. The crucial factor now, according to Professor Joughin, is the rate at which that happens. ""If we get say 3.5 metres of sea level rise over a century or two, that's a big deal. ""On the other hand, if it's over a millennium or two, that's much more manageable. ""So even if the loss is committed, we have the power to slow that rate by slowing the rate of warming.""

498,"A creature frozen for 24,000 years was considered dead. Then it began to multiply",environment," Science Tiny creatures survive after being frozen for 24,000 years in Siberian tundra Some 24,000 years ago, a tiny creature was frozen in time in the Siberian tundra. But being locked in permafrost in one of the coldest regions on the planet wasn't the end for the bdelloid rotifer — a microscopic animal that is found in freshwater environments. The creature was still able to reproduce after being frozen for thousands of years, a team of Russian scientists has reported today in the journal Current Biology. Offspring produced by their ancient parent were also able to survive being frozen and thawed in the lab, revealing the animal's amazing ability to tough it out in the most extreme conditions. ""[The ancient rotifer] did not show any signs of decline,"" said study co-author Stas Malavin, a biologist from the Soil Cryology Laboratory at the Institute of Physicochemical and Biological Problems in Soil Science in Pushchino, Russia. ""The longevity was a surprise."" The ability to survive in a state of suspended animation is known as cryptobiosis. While bdelloid rotifers have been known to bounce back after 6-10 years of freezing, the specimen reported in the new study breaks that record by a long shot. These tiny, but mighty, animals can also make it through starvation, drying, and low oxygen conditions. Other animals, plants, and microbes living in Arctic environments can also offer a window into the past, with some being frozen in time for tens of thousands of years. Researchers have revived roundworms that have been frozen in Siberian permafrost that dates back 30,000 years. Some plants and mosses can also regenerate after being covered in ice for thousands of years. ""Life on Earth has evolved in a very broad range of environments,"" said Rick Cavicchioli, who studies Antarctic microorganisms at the University of New South Wales. ""The natural environment one species calls home, another species may never survive in."" Mr Malavin and his colleagues collected permafrost core samples from the Alazeya River in north-eastern Siberia. Using radiocarbon dating, the researchers dated the permafrost to between 23,960 and 24,485 years old. After thawing the permafrost, the researchers uncovered several rotifers and other microorganisms. One of the ancient rotifers was able to reproduce itself in a petri dish through a process called parthenogenesis, a form of reproduction that doesn't require fertilisation through sex. Examination of the ancient rotifer's physical features revealed it belonged to the Adineta genus. Genetic analyses showed the ancient creature was a new species, most closely related to modern Adineta vagas rotifers collected in Belgium. This species has been used to study how organisms survive conditions in space, such as doses of x-ray radiation and heavy ions. Next, the researchers wanted to see whether the rotifers produced by their ancient parent could withstand the freezing and thawing process. The team selected 144 of these rotifers and froze them at -15 degrees Celsius for one week. The tiny creatures proved resilient once thawed, surviving the formation of cell-destroying ice crystals during the gradual freezing process. Just how bdelloid rotifers are able to survive such extreme conditions is still a mystery, Mr Malavin says. ""There are different mechanisms, but we still don't understand the whole orchestration."" A bunch of microscopic, virtually indestructible creatures known as tardigrades (or water bears, depending on who you ask) crash landed on the Moon. What are the chances of their survival? Other animals, such as Antarctic fish, have glycoproteins that produce an antifreeze effect. These proteins lower the freezing point of fish and allow ice crystals to be filtered through the spleen, said Kerrie Swadling, a marine ecologist at the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies. ""To date, there has been no antifreeze identified in bdelloid rotifers,"" said Professor Swadling, who was not involved in the study. ""The jury seems to be out with respect to the mechanism behind their ability to survive freezing."" While more research is needed to figure out how bdelloid rotifers can recover from being frozen in time, looking at their DNA could be a good starting point, said Professor Cavicchioli, who was not involved in the study. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. ""The ability of the Siberian bdelloid rotifer to survive thousands of years in the permafrost may relate to the mechanisms that keep DNA repair enzymes functional,"" he said. ""The ability to survive desiccation may provide 'cross-protection' for these small animals when they find themselves exposed to nature's deep freeze."" As bdelloid rotifers are multicellular organisms like humans, animals, and plants, it's worth pinning down the mechanisms that help them survive freezing. These insights could offer clues that could one day improve cryopreservation techniques — the process of freezing cells, tissues, and organs. ""We know for sure that this is possible,"" Mr Malavin said. ""This organism is quite a good model for studying this."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

499,"Deep in coal country, one community is grappling with what the future holds",environment,"  Deep in Queensland's coal country, one community is grappling with what the future holds As you drive south-west from Mackay towards the small inland community of Clermont, you pass through stunning burnt-orange sorghum crops and past rock formations bursting from the ground before entering deep into coal country. Convoys delivering giant machinery that takes up both lanes slow the trip down. The machinery is heading towards the open-cut mines that are the lifeblood of these communities. And seemingly never-ending trains rattle on the tracks that skirt the road, carrying the precious black cargo to the port and out to sea. Some stereotypes hold true; the roads are full of men and women in high-vis orange shirts driving white utes. For the past 35 years, Rhonda Bleakley and her husband have been keeping those utes going from the helm of a petrol station and fuel distributorship in Clermont. ""We only planned on coming out here for a couple of years when we first moved out here,"" she says. ""But it was such a lovely community, we decided we liked it and it was a great place to raise our kids."" Rhonda's livelihood depends on the fossil fuel industry, as do many of her customers'. She used to think it would take a long time for the industry to wind up, but now she sees the future speeding up to meet her. ""I'm sure there's no two ways about that. How long it takes, I think, is the big question that everyone is sort of trying to deal with now,"" she says. ""People that work in the fuel industry or in the coal industry are just normal workers — they're trying to earn a living — and that doesn't separate them from the rest of the community. ""That doesn't necessarily mean that you are not on board as far as trying to reduce emissions."" But not everyone out here sees it that way. The mining sector directly employs 27 per cent of people in Clermont. That number rises to 40 per cent in the wider Isaac Regional Council area. It is the largest coal mining council region in Queensland, with 24 operational mines producing more than half the state's coal exports. Despite global pressure on the future of coal, the council still supports the opening of new coal mines. ""Coal is extremely important for jobs in our region,"" Mayor Anne Baker says. ""There's three very large projects that have been assessed and approved that will take us into the next century."" That would mean another 100 years of coal. ""What I feel is this discussion needs to be a balanced discussion and we need to be a primary stakeholder in that discussion,"" she says. ""Because we bring a lot of value, we bring a lot of balance to the debate. ""And this should never be about closing any one industry down."" Others hold more extreme views. Like Greg Austen, a local councillor who runs a trucking business that supplies nearby mines, including the Adani Carmichael mine. ""I don't believe in it at all — the climate's changing all the time,"" he says. Greg is not afraid to say how much he loves coal. ""Coal provides us with an income and it employs 10 staff in our business and it keeps the wolf from the door."" As well as producing thermal coal for energy, a large portion of the coal produced here is metallurgical — used for steel production. Many here, including Greg, believe those exports will continue well into the future. ""Well, what's happening globally? All I can see is people want coal,"" he says. But there is a stark intergenerational divide out here. Coal miner Ashely Reed has decades of work ahead of him, but he is worried about what that will be. ""It's very polarising being a coal miner and talking about environmental stuff,"" he says. ""There's a big uproar to do better for the environment and I completely understand that, but then there's millions of people in jobs like my own. ""I guess there's a fear in our line of work that one day we're going to be out of work. ""That's a worrying thing for a lot of people."" It is something Rhonda Bleakley's youngest son is also grappling with. Tim Bleakley works in a nearby coal mine. ""It's weird being in the middle, like torn both ways,"" he says. ""My family's part of the fossil fuel industry and my friends all around me are part of the fossil fuel industry. I'm part of the fossil fuel industry,"" he says. ""But I've got another part of me that wants to make a change. ""If it was up to me, I wouldn't be working in the coal mine, but I need to support my family."" It is not a topic he likes to openly discuss. ""It's just, I don't want to get into a debate about it because it always ends quite nasty,"" he says. Clermont became a key battleground during the 2019 federal election, when a convoy of anti-Adani protestors led by former Greens leader Bob Brown came to town. They were greeted in Clermont by a pro-coal protest. The result was a massive swing to Nationals MP Michelle Landry. But Rhonda believes in the past two years there has been a shift in community attitudes. ""Those extremist views, I think are really — there's not as much of that anymore,"" she says. ""I really do think there is a realisation in the coal industry community that things are changing."" That is a reality for her son Tim. ""People are going to be out of work anyway. So why not try and have the back-up plan?"" he says. ""It's coming. The rest of the world is doing this slowly, you know, weaning off coal. ""Why can't we? Why can't we start that now?"" Local union representative Shane Brunker agrees. ""People on the ground understand that there are pressures coming,"" he says. ""But then we don't see any action from governments, as far as giving them an alternative where the future is heading."" Conversations about the impending change remain difficult for everyone, with the language heavily politicised. The term ""just transition"" was coined by the international trade union movement to ensure that moving towards a low-carbon economy did not come at the detriment of workers and their communities, but even that language has become divisive in coal country. ""My union, we don't like the word 'just transition'. We see it's actually a transformation of the economy,"" Shane says. ""We've actually put our case forward to the government that we believe there should be a statutory authority developed. ""And that authority then can liaise directly with local communities like Clermont or Moranbah or Emerald."" A transition authority — or whatever you want to call it — is an idea that is gaining traction both in Australia and globally. Amanda Cahill from Next Economy works with regional economies that are trying to deal with economic change. ""I think it's a shame that the language has become so politicised because regions are losing out,"" she says. She says in the past 18 months there has been a real shift in community attitudes, with people a lot more open to the discussion. ""The real issue for Queensland in particular is that our major trading partners have upped their climate ambition around net zero emissions,"" she says. ""They are moving away from carbon-intensive production techniques, so they're not going to need our coal anymore. ""We still have some time but we need to start now because this sort of change that we're talking about is transforming the entire economy. We need to start now."" She believes there needs to be leadership and a national transition authority. ""If you look around the world, I think there are over 50 countries now that have a national transition plan and have set up authorities or bodies to manage that,"" Amanda says. ""Really good examples that we talk about all the time, like Germany, they have national transition authorities in place that have brought together industry, different levels of government, environment groups, unions and workers to actually plan together what needs to happen."" Amanda also hopes the change in community attitudes will impact the politics. ""Because of the amount of acceptance now on the ground that things are changing, it would be hard for any politician to say, 'We don't need to think about that, because coal is here to stay,'"" she says. ""It would be brave to say that now. People know things are changing. They just want to know what the plan is."" The federal government denies there are any pressures on the future of coal. In a statement to the ABC it said: ""The Coalition government is committed to supporting coal industry workers, who have a long-term future in the region. ""Coal exports to some of our key Asian markets are expected to increase as the global economic recovery picks up."" Trying to bridge the political divide is Rhonda's eldest son and Tim's older brother, Dan. He is back in town for the first time in five years. Since leaving Clermont, Dan has become a fervent climate change activist. ""I really care about this community a lot and I care about the farmers and the coal miners and everyone in this community,"" he says. ""But at the same time, I know that we have to change our ways. ""This region has been quite dependent on fossil fuels for a long time, so once I started learning about the climate crisis, it became quite difficult to try to talk to people about it."" Now he is back trying to change hearts and minds — with fast cars, taking coal miners out for joy rides in a Tesla. ""I think that introducing people to EVs (electric vehicles) out here really gives people an idea of how amazing the future can be if we choose to grab it,"" Dan says. One of the coal miners who got behind the wheel was Ashley Reed. ""It took me by surprise how quick it actually was,"" Ashley says. ""It's got a lot more punch than what my diesel dinosaur does. ""I definitely think we need to invest in the infrastructure for the EVs because, the way I personally see it, is it's the only way that the future is going to go."" Driving fast cars around to make a point may be fun, but it still hides the deep fractures in this community about the future. ""I definitely think that the coal industry will continue on and we will need them for a while longer,"" Ashley says. ""But there does need to be a change in getting things ready for what the future is going to hold."" Dan believes if governments had invested in clean industries a decade ago, they would be booming now. ""In central Queensland, you have a huge amount of technical skills — engineering, you've got boilermakers, diesel fitters — you've got all these skills out here that could quite easily be utilised in other clean-tech industries."" But he says change is better late than never. ""I think that these regions could be developing clean-tech industries now,"" he says. For the younger generation of coal miners, change is inevitable. But what it looks like or how it happens remains uncertain. ""I don't think anyone goes out to harm the environment,"" Tim says. ""I truly believe that people, wherever they can, if it's easy enough, they're not going to go out of their way to burn fossil fuels.""
