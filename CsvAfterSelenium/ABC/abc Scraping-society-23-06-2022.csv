0,'International bestsellers' open up about life and racism during 'human library' sessions,society,"  Human 'books' fight racism in Bunbury one story at a time Racism is uncomfortable: It's uncomfortable to experience, uncomfortable to speak about and uncomfortable to call out but a group of residents in a popular coastal city near Perth has found an innovative way to discuss the subject. Inspired by the concept of ""human libraries"", Bunbury Multicultural Group vice chair Shamara Williams decided to set up a collection of ""international bestsellers"" as part of the area's multicultural and Fringe festivals. Over two days, strangers borrowed the ""human books"" for an hour of private conversation and spoke about everything from everyday life to individual experiences of racism. ""It's important to keep these conversations intimate to allow people to open up and actually share what's really in their heart: to be authentic, honest and raw even,"" Ms Williams said. The experiment, inspired by the Human Library movement which began in Denmark more than 20 years ago, has been set up in other places including Hobart and in Queensland. ""It's an amazing concept."" Ms Williams, a migrant from Sri Lanka, has been living in regional Western Australia for more than 30 years and jokes she's ""still not a local"". ""There's an expectation you're here for a certain number of years but that number is unknown [and] it's a lot harder on new migrants until they get to that point,"" she said. She believes the opportunity to bring people from seemingly different worlds to simply speak to each other in a safe space can reduce prejudice. ""Stories are so powerful and it has the ability to change perspectives,"" she said. ""I'd tell anyone to give it a go in your own little community."" When Shizleen Aishath first moved to Australia in 2013, she hadn't given much thought about the headscarf she wore until an incident at the shops. Ms Aishath moved to Bunbury to get settled before her husband and children joined her from the Maldives. ""I was at the shops with a friend [and] this little lady came up and spat on me and said, 'go back to where you came from',"" she said. ""The shock was so big that I did not even react ... did not even realise that I'd been spat on."" While the incident has made Ms Aishath more cautious when out in public, it has also given her more drive to stand up against discrimination. ""It made me really, really aware of our role in the community to both educate and actually speak up,"" she said. ""Because my worry was there'd be a lot of people who wouldn't."" For Ms Aishath, the library initiative provided a ""beautiful way"" for people to ask questions. ""There is a lot of miscommunication out in the community and this brings that to the table,"" she said. ""Us being such a multicultural community, we need to start doing stuff that is not just celebrating a day."" Through one-on-one conversations in the library, she was able to open up about her matriarchal upbringing and challenge assumptions about why she wore a scarf. ""[In the Maldives], it's very normal to wear a scarf and it's also very normal not to wear a scarf,"" she said. ""I was the first person in my whole family to start wearing a scarf. ""For us, it's a choice."" Ms Aishath said similar conversations had the potential to help many other minority groups including people living with disabilities and those who identify as LGBTIQA+. ""It also allows the community to have a chat about those positive experiences,"" she said. ""All these different diversity groups do bring something to the table that isn't normally discussed."" Bunbury Mayor Jaysen Miguel said while a lot of work had been done to celebrate and acknowledge diversity in the regional community, there was always room to do more. ""Support, both financially and in-kind, to events such as the Reconciliation Week bridge walk, NAIDOC Week, the South West Multicultural Festival and the new This is Me series, is crucial to not only continuing to educate our community, but acknowledge our diverse community and provide a safe, welcoming place to [be],"" he said. ""While unfortunately there may be some in the community who express outdated views, many of our residents welcome and support our culturally and linguistically diverse community."" The Mayor also encouraged people who witnessed racism and discrimination to speak out. ""When people who witness racism speak out against it, this makes the person being targeted feel supported, and can make the person being racist reconsider their behaviour,"" he said. ""Don't put yourself at risk. But if it is safe to do so, speak up and stand with the victim. Even a simple gesture can be powerful.""

1,"After 800 editions and 17 years, the future of Wilcannia's treasured local paper is in doubt",society,"  The Wilcannia News is an archive of the town's history — so what happens if it shuts down? Ever since it went to print 17 years ago, the Wilcannia News has been run by an enthusiastic and dedicated team of volunteers. The paper's content is gathered, collated and printed independently in Wilcannia. While the already sharp decline in readership of newspapers around the country was exacerbated by the pandemic, the vital role of the Wilcannia News only became more apparent last year as the town grappled with an outbreak that was spreading like wildfire. The team has consistently managed to produce a weekly 15-page newspaper that informs and engages readers across the region and beyond — digital copies are sent as far as Brighton in the UK. But the publication has struggled to attract and retain new volunteers and has been forced to slash its weekly edition to monthly. If the volunteers can't find more help soon, the paper will be forced cease printing. Wilcannia-born Nola Whyman has used the paper as a crucial way to stay in touch with her country and community while she lives and works elsewhere. ""It's really important for me to know what's going on there, what's happening with family on the ground, what programs are being offered,"" she said. ""It's great for my kids to see photos of their cousins, uncles and aunties and everyone gathering, and it's been so consistent."" As a child, Ms Whyman used to rush out the front of the house to meet the mailman and help deliver the newspaper to the neighbourhood. ""Seeing, over the years, the positives reported in Wilcannia paper is important, because all we ever see coming out a lot of the time is quite negative of our hometown,"" she said. ""To me now what's in the media sometimes isn't the full story and that doesn't give justice to our community."" Robert Clayton from Wilcannia River Radio said the paper had been a vital platform to encourage better community outcomes. ""There are a lot of good stories here in Wilcannia, but due to the lack of volunteers they're not being told,"" he said. ""People in the community wouldn't quite push themselves as much in doing good, in what they're doing. ""To see your photo in the newspaper you'd buy three copies just to give to family. ""It's just a really good feeling that we have that sort of newspaper where we can put local people's and students' achievements in."" Christine Elliot has long volunteered at Wilcannia News, but between managing the golf club and sourcing and writing much of the paper's content, the time to hang up her hat is looming. ""We've always been stretched for labour and four of us have been involved in the paper every week since December 2004,"" she said. ""So it's been a 17-year haul and we're not getting any younger."" With more than 800 printed editions, the paper focuses on the preservation of the town's deep colonial history and provides a physical archive of happenings in the town through its regular ""History Corner"". It also publishes eulogies in full. ""One thing that has been lacking in Indigenous communities is that background of their family,"" Ms Elliot said. ""Many years ago I was asked by a couple of elders how they can do their family tree and I thought, 'Well, I don't know.' ""But this is a way we can help people in the future do their family tree, because it will be there."" The paper also acts as a public noticeboard, publishing upcoming health service visits and school information for parents. ""I just rely on it for the hospital clinics — you can put it on the fridge,"" Ms Elliot said. ""In football season we publish the football draw and most of them get stuck on fridges, and the … recording on what's happening at the schools, which is just as important. ""I think it's like everything you probably don't realise until it's not there."" Wilcannia News president John Pineo said the paper proved a vital source of accurate information when the town became the epicentre of a COVID-19 outbreak last year. ""The Washington Post picked up on Wilcannia's outbreak at the time and a lot of media scrutiny wasn't totally accurate,"" he said. ""I think living here through the outbreak, we probably did capture really the true sense of how it was."" With a mission statement to inform, connect and unite, Mr Pineo said focusing on publishing positive news while not ignoring the negatives had played an instrumental role in keeping community unified. ""What we print each week is not to point out something negative and whinge … [but about helping to] find the solution to it,"" he said. ""We try and focus on the good things happening in the town. ""I hope in a hundred years from now people will look back on it and see what life in Wilcannia was like back then."" The uncertainty of the paper's future has attracted the interest of local economic developer, RED.I. Site manager and Wilcannia River Radio host Brendon Adams has earmarked the potential for a collaboration with the town's media sector to create more secure employment opportunities. ""Even for us, as part of the radio station, we read a lot of information from the paper to inform listeners of our deadly station,"" he said. ""If Wilcannia News does fall, we are looking at making our radio station a larger media hub where we not just have radio but video and print. ""Media is such an important part for remote communities and we think it needs to continue.""

2,"So you want to be a backyard beekeeper. You, and many others",society,"  Growth in amateur beekeeping contributing $173.5 million per year to the sector For this group of students, it has been a dream to keep bees. They're taking part in a beekeeping course run by one of Tasmania's most experienced commercial beekeepers. Some, like Ellie Langdon, are keen to take it up as a hobby, others are looking for a new business. ""There's a lot to it, more than I thought, but I've found it really interesting finding out the intricate details about their life and how they work,"" Ms Langdon said. ""I've nagged my husband for so long about beekeeping he did cave in and make me a hive and bought me a course. ""I'm glad I've done the course before leaping into my active hive."" Beekeeping has surged in popularity in the past five years. In that time, numbers of recreational beekeepers have tipped over 28,000 nationally, up from 23,000. Trevor Weatherhead, chair of the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council, attributes the upsurge in recreational beekeeping to media highlighting concerns about declining bee populations and the popularity of the hobbyist's Flow Hive. Mr Weatherhead said COVID lockdowns had also prompted a spike in beekeeping. ""Ironically, I think COVID has played a little bit of a role in this. I've seen a few stories out there where people have got into bees in their backyard because of COVID they couldn't go anywhere,"" Mr Weatherhead said. Military veteran Marc Webb struggled to leave his house in Adelaide, years after a serious incident in Afghanistan left him wounded and traumatised. He never thought bees would be what save him. The backyard industry has become a valuable sector in Australia. The AgriFutures Australia snapshot of the country's honey bee industry likens recreational beekeeping to recreational fishing: comparable in size to the commercial arm of the industry and just as important economically. The report authors estimate the economic value of recreational beekeeping at $173.5 million per year. In comparison, the commercial honey bee and pollination sector is worth $264 million. Agrifutures, the government's research and development arm, estimates that recreational beekeepers spend $72 million per year on bee equipment including hives, bee suits, smokers and beekeeping courses. Southern Tasmanian commercial beekeeper Peter Norris has been in the business for years. He has been running classes as well as selling bee equipment. He said the past couple of years had seen an increase in their popularity. ""People are becoming more aware of how important bees are,"" Mr Norris said. ""It increases the appreciation of how much is involved and the necessity of bees and hopefully it will help educate people about being more careful with sprays and things like that."" Mr Norris said he had run three courses so far this season, an indicator of the growing interest in the backyard hobby. A growing number of women are among Australia's surging beekeeping hobbyists. Anita Long and Jenni MacLeod run beekeeping education programs and a group called Sister Hives. ""Sister Hives started as an idea around Anita's kitchen table,"" Ms MacLeod said. ""We talked about how great it would be to run a program specifically for women."" A weekend pilot of the female-only program sold out in 48 hours. ""It demonstrated to us that there was a need for connection, community and skills-building; particularly among women who want to do beekeeping,"" Ms MacLeod said. Spring boarding off the success of the trial, the pair went on to secure funding from the Tasmanian government to run a 12-month program for aspiring women beekeepers. ""We were overwhelmed with inquiries,"" Ms MacLeod said. ""We were funded initially for 25 places but we received over 120 inquiries from across the state. ""We ended up receiving 60 applications and we then went back to our funding body to make sure that everybody could be included in the program, because the key point about this program is connection, the skills."" Across Australia there are a multitude of classes for amateur beekeepers, a multitude of groups they can join, and plenty of equipment they can buy to support their hobby. It is particularly important at a time when the industry is keen to protect our island nation's bee population from some of the devastating diseases that have wreaked havoc overseas. Industry bodies are encouraging hobby beekeepers to register with their state's Primary Industries Department, but it is not yet compulsory everywhere. Tasmania is the only state or territory that does not have mandatory hive registration, although there is hope to have it in place by April 2022. Mr Weatherhead said it was vitally important for backyard beekeepers to register their hives. ""It's important that you do register because it's a biosecurity matter,"" he said. ""If ever we did get an incursion of a pest that is not in Australia we need to know where those beehives are, then we can go out and check them."" But without penalties it could be considered soft regulation and the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council admits it is almost impossible to enforce. Taking a beekeeping course is the first step towards being able to recognise when a hive becomes unhealthy. ""We encourage beekeepers to join up with the local bee club so that way … they then realise what their responsibilities are,"" Mr Weatherhead said. ""You've got to know how to look after your beehive. They're not something you put there and leave and don't look at. You need to look at bees to make sure they're all right. ""You don't buy a new car and keep driving it and driving it without servicing it, [it's] the same sort of thing with bees. ""You need to check on them at least every two weeks to ensure they're getting enough food, they've got water supplies, the hive is not too crowded and there's no disease.""

3,'People would be outraged': Women evacuated in latest confronting domestic violence case,society,"  Remote community shocked by latest domestic violence allegations Two women have been evacuated from a remote Aboriginal community in northern Western Australia amid allegations of prolonged sexual and physical assaults. It is the latest in a string of disturbing domestic violence cases in remote Kimberley towns that have highlighted gaps in services and the complex cultural context making it almost impossible for women to escape. The two women had been living with a man in a house within a bush community since March. In mid-September they sought help from local police, alleging they had been subjected to repeated sexual and physical violence. People who spoke to the women in the hours after they came forward say they alleged the man held them against their will at the time, and took control of their bankcards and money. The women were flown several hundred kilometres to a larger Kimberley town for medical checks. One woman was taken to hospital and both have since given statements to police. WA Police have confirmed that a man has been charged with one count of common assault and one count of aggravated assault occasioning bodily harm. A woman who has been a social worker in the area for a number of years and knows the pair said it is a distressing case. Speaking to the ABC on condition of anonymity, she called the alleged victims ""two of the bravest women I've ever met"". ""Violence is normalised in the communities here, but this case has blown me out of the water."" She said it should be a wake up call about the severity of the violence occurring in remote communities. After a history of abuse, they are living proof that people can change. ""I feel like this would not be allowed to happen in the city — it would be leading the 6:00pm news and people would be outraged."" ""It's almost impossible for women to get out of these situations, because even if they can physically find a way to get a lift or a plane ticket to a different community, there's often pressure from families to return to their partner. ""We need help. But it's very hard to get staff out here, so the whole situation is really frustrating and really upsetting."" The police investigation is ongoing, with detectives planning to fly to the bush community in coming days to interview residents. The evacuation comes amid growing calls for violence-prevention programs tailored to protecting First Nations women; research shows they are 11 times more likes to die from assault. The Kimberley courts regularly hear horrific cases of abuse. Earlier this year, a man was jailed after he and his nephew raped a woman who they had lured from the local women's refuge. In her victim impact statement, the victim said her family had shunned her when they found out she had been sexually assaulted. In a separate case, Kimberley man Daniel Chungarai was jailed for subjecting his partner to a six-hour ordeal, in which he punched her while she was breastfeeding, shaved her head, stabbed her repeatedly, jumped on her, and tied her feet together with electrical cord. The couple's children witnessed the assaults and one — a 12-month-old baby — was showered with broken glass. Most northern towns have women's refuges run by local Aboriginal organisations, but thousands of people live in bush communities where support is limited for those wanting to escape a violent relationship. Community leaders say there is also a desperate need for programs to empower young women and challenge the normalisation of violence linked to jealousy and controlling relationships. Earlier this month, Women's Safety Minister Anne Ruston committed to developing a standalone strategy for Indigenous communities, to sit alongside the national plan currently being developed to end violence against women. The existing plan has been in place for twelve years, and the new documents will come into effect for a decade, starting in July next year. Indigenous rights activist June Oscar, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, met Minister for Aboriginal Australians Ken Wyatt last week in Broome to discuss the issue. ""I think we are making some change, but it is slow,"" Ms Oscar said after the meeting. ""We must grasp this opportunity to be frank and honest about the issues. ""But we need other ministers and all parliamentarians to listen; not just Indigenous affairs, because local women are bringing solutions to the table."" Minister Wyatt said he was committed to bringing about practical change. ""We are increasing the budget in this [domestic violence] area, but I do know there are gaps,"" he said. ""Isolation and distance to services is always problematic ... and in some circumstances people are aware of the [violence], but because they're in a small community they don't report it. ""This is a priority one for me, because the flow-on effect to children is having the visual images of a battered mother, or a battered aunty, or a battered sister. ""And that is unacceptable and it is cowardly."" Minister Ruston's office says the government is working with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Council, state and territory governments and Indigenous communities to develop the plans within the first half of 2022.

4,Rock painting hide-and-seek relieves the lockdown blues,society,"  Search NSW ROCKS on Facebook and you will find more than 100,000 members participating in a group aimed at lightening the load during lockdown. The rock painting hide-and-seek has quickly become a creative activity inspiring people to paint, go on walks, and find a rock purposely planted or buried in the landscape — no matter their age. When 7-year-old Arlo and his 4-year-old sister Luciana, affectionately known as Lulu, discovered a painted rock on their walk along the Blue Mile in Wollongong, the pair were immediately captivated. ""We saw the big one first, so it was very exciting because we hadn't seen one with such a beautiful design on it before,"" their father Chris Yates said. ""And then when we read the back, then it was even more exciting because we had a little treasure hunt on our hands."" ""The rocks were all on the steps down at the harbour,"" Arlo said. When put together, the six rocks formed a turtle. ""We haven't had it for very long,"" he said. ""We discovered a few things about it, like the big triangular piece has a dot in the middle and that dot glows in the dark."" According to Lulu, the large piece is ""a love heart, not a triangle"". ""We are keeping it for a few days and then we are going to hide it,"" Arlo said. Lulu wants to keep it forever. ""We are not going to give this turtle away,"" she said. ""I like how somebody went to all the effort to paint these rocks and then hide them at the beach for us to find,"" Arlo said. ""We were really grateful … and daddy even said that we were literally the most grateful people to find it."" Mr Yates said the find had ""definitely added a touch of colour to our walks"". Kabrina Piirlaid, from Agnes Banks in the Hawkesbury region, started painting rocks when lockdown began two months ago and has already distributed more than 30 around her community. ""You don't have to draw your own image. You can find one that inspires you and transfer it over onto a rock and paint it in your own style,"" she said. Despite the call for recipients to photograph their findings and publish it on the Facebook page, many do not. But this does not stop enthusiasts such as Ms Piirlaid from participating. ""Most of the time you don't see your rock turn up afterwards. Sometimes you do, but you just keep on liking everyone and encouraging people because it's fun,"" she said. ""I'm enjoying it and it's a good thing to do."" The last time she planted rocks, Ms Piirlaid hung around to see what happened next. ""We saw someone find one. I didn't know them. They took a photo of it and re-hid it, and it was just that process of watching to see how it all works,"" she said. ""I saw it a couple of days later on Facebook and the ripple effect of happiness that comes from it all is wonderful."" Retired illustrator David Stanley's contributions to the NSW ROCKS project are exceptional, winning hearts across the state. ""In the area I have been dropping rocks there are a number of people making a massive effort, sometimes 30 rocks at a time,"" Mr Stanley said. He produces two or three painted rocks a day which takes him roughly three hours to finish. He also makes daily posts to the group which receive thousands of engagements in likes and comments. ""My main thing has been wood carving Welsh lovespoons, but the interest in the rocks has sidelined me a bit,"" he said. ""I've painted myself into a corner."" Mr Stanley said the Facebook group was helping people in at least two ways. ""They are doing the walk, and I'm doing more walking than I've ever done before,"" he said. ""Ironically, at a safe distance, I've met more people in the local community than you would come across in normal life."" As a professional artist Mr Stanley enjoys creating his contributions, but he also admires those who are encouraging their children to participate. ""People are working with their kids doing it, and that's a good thing,"" he said. ""People are doing something for someone else and that's also a good thing too."" The creators of NSW ROCKS got the idea from the Rock Painting Club SW WA on Facebook, and thought it was a great way to keep children busy. Matt Stevenson, one of the original NSW ROCKS Facebook group members, joined in 2017. “Devices are a huge distraction these days and we want to get kids painting and back into parks,” Mr Stevenson said. ""We started with 20 people on the first day and it's grown from there to over 100,000 now."" Photos on the page of painted and found rocks have gained in popularity over the lockdown period. Although there are localised groups focussing on regions like #Gongrocks, Mr Stevenson believes NSW ROCKS is the place to be. ""We don't promote other groups apart from state groups. Localised groups are exclusive whereas we are inclusive. ""If you enjoy travelling you shouldn't have to join a local group to find rocks there, you can search for it through the NSW ROCKS page."" The group's 11 volunteer moderators respond to more than 300 requests a day to join the online community. ""There are people watching the page 24/7 because you can't guarantee that everything posted on there is going to be positive, so we snuff out negativity,"" Mr Stevenson said. Its members say NSW ROCKS is all about positivity, giving people something fun to do and something to look forward to, inspiring joy. ""You can't have one without the other. It's like a giant hide-and-seek game. You need both sides to be successful,"" Mr Stevenson said. ABC Illawarra will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

5,Man left 'raw and completely degraded' after a Canberra removalist allegedly racially abused him,society,"  Canberra man allegedly racially abused by removalist makes complaint to Human Rights Commission A Canberra man who was left ""completely degraded"" after allegedly being racially abused by a removalist is urging people to ""stand up and fight"" against racism. Mechanical engineer Aditya Kumar said he was racially abused while trying to hire a removalist in Canberra on Monday, and has lodged a formal complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) Under the ACT government's lockdown restrictions moving residence interstate is permitted, but Mr Kumar said a dispute over what was included in the cost was what led to the racial slurs. Mr Kumar said he was called a ""curry dog"" and an ""Indian dog"" during the dispute — abuse that left him ""raw and completely degraded"". It is the second recent incident of alleged racial vilification in Canberra, after another man was abused and had his phone smashed in Civic last month. Mr Kumar, who is planning to move interstate, said he posted a removal job to a local third-party website site a few weeks ago. The job was initially accepted by a local removalist, but a disagreement arose over what it entailed. ""The argument was about me not being upfront about how many boxes I needed to be moved,"" Mr Kumar said. ""Words were exchanged, and I did not hold back either, and I was ok with it until he started making racist remarks."" Screenshots show the two men exchanged barbs over text message — including Mr Kumar telling the man: ""kindly go f*** yourself, you piece of shit"" — before Mr Kumar said the removalist racially abused him. ""Tough words over phone right you Indian dog,"" one of the messages to Mr Kumar said. ""You are full of shit you knew you would tried [sic] adding extras not the first Indian dog I've come across. ""Curry dog."" Mr Kumar said he was shocked by the comments. ""I felt raw and completely degraded,"" Mr Kumar said. Mr Kumar eventually decided to send a formal complaint to the AHRC. The ABC has contacted the AHRC for comment, but the Commission states on its website that it does not comment on individual cases of alleged discrimination, or complaints that may have been made. Mr Kumar said it was the second time he had been ""bluntly"" racially abused in Canberra, and said he chose to speak out to engender change. ""A lot of people on the Canberra Noticeboard Group on Facebook suggested that I let it go, "" Mr Kumar said. ""But every time we let one of these incidents go, it gives people like this the courage to and go do it again, since there is nothing anyone ever does about it. ""I say stand up for yourself and fight it. Let them know that is not OK.""

6,Port Macquarie's astronomical society over the moon about observatory rebuild,society,"  'Most people drive past and think it's a toilet block': Major upgrade for Port Macquarie Astronomical Observatory Port Macquarie's Observatory is set to get a major redevelopment thanks to a multi-million-dollar grant from the Bushfire Local Economic Recovery Fund. The local astronomical association has been successful in its application for a $4.86 million grant to upgrade the 55-year-old facility in Rotary Park. Port Macquarie Astronomical Association president Robert Brangwin said it was a fantastic achievement. ""Not just for us, the members, but for the whole district — for the businesses around us,"" he said. He said the new centre would be able to hold about 80 people and the dome would be replaced with one twice the size. Mr Brangwin described the present observatory as ""quaint inside"". ""It's got a lot of heart and soul but it's very tiny, 12 people have to duck their head to get in the doorway and the roof inside there,"" he said. ""It can be very claustrophobic at times. ""Prior to COVID, on some open nights we had more than 60 people in that auditorium and sometimes we had kids sitting in the aisles."" Mr Brangwin said they intended to employ a professional astronomer and install a much bigger telescope. The next stage is to move onto the construction plans. ""The concept is that it will look iconic on the site because it's an iconic site in town and it will stand out so people we hope will drive past and say, 'What was that'? and they'll come back and have a look,"" chair of the planning committee Chris Ireland said. It's expected the upgrade will also attract more tourists to the coastal town, Mr Ireland said. He said it was hoped they could establish ""direct links to all the major telescopes in the world"" and project them on large screens. ""It will be futuristic inside — my idea is that it will look like the inside of a spaceship."" Port Macquarie MP Leslie Williams applauded the community-run organisation. ""They've had some big plans and big dreams in the past few years and today it's all going to become a reality. ""This is not only about providing a fantastic new centre in terms of astronomy for locals but attracting visitors to the area and it will be an attraction. Member for Cowper Pat Conaghan said the new observatory would bring tourism back to town. ""We've forgotten about the bushfires, how bad they were,  the schools were closed and the shops were closed. ""Most people drive past and think it [the observatory] is a toilet block. ""This is a huge tourism drawcard for the local area."" But the most exciting aspect of the upgrade was the education facilities that would be offered, Ms Williams said.

7,How social media 'robbed' mum of privacy with her dying son,society,"  How social media 'robbed' Gold Coast mum of opportunity to privately grieve her son's loss Sue* was 1,800 kilometres from home on New Years Day in 2020, when she received the fateful call from her eldest son. He told her that Dallas, her 21-year-old son, had been hit by a car. The freak accident had happened while crossing the road, leaving her youngest son with critical injuries, fighting for his life in hospital. Sue booked the next flight home, ""willing the plane to hurry up"" and she arrived seven hours after first taking the call. ""I was desperate to see both my sons. I was stunned and shocked upon entering the ICU to be confronted by a crowd of people – some I did not know,"" she said. ""I was not asked who we wanted there for us."" After speaking with a doctor and social worker, Sue said it was decided that information about Dallas's condition would be kept private – and importantly – off social media until they felt ready to share. ""We did not need to explain or justify our decision,"" Sue said. So, when the family began to receive ""invasive"" calls and text messages asking about Dallas' injuries, Sue grew concerned about what might be circulating online. ""I assumed my request would be honoured and respected. How wrong I was,"" Sue said. With only days to spend with Dallas, Sue said she wanted to remain calm for him. ""I wanted my son to be able to leave this world knowing we were okay to let him go, not wanting him to suffer,"" she said. Instead, the family began receiving condolence messages, long before Dallas had passed. ""I was shattered,"" she said. There were also large gatherings held – shared publicly online — and pictures of people ""getting drunk"" and ""grieving"" for Dallas, Sue said. ""I was confused. One gathering was to tell of my son's impending death after I specifically asked them not to tell. ""It was heartbreaking, considering we were sitting with my critically injured son that was still very much alive. ""I was robbed. Time with my precious son was taken away."" Sue said a Facebook group chat had been created to share updates about Dallas' condition — against explicit requests for privacy. The messages, she said, were ""fabricated"" and they told others the information had come directly from her, despite them having not spoken to anyone. ""They invited others to visit my son in hospital, without asking us. His dignity was totally exposed, his injuries were horrific,"" she said. ""It is like we never mattered."" As ill-informed social media tributes flowed for Dallas, the local newspaper misreported the date of his death and, worse, incorrectly stated his brother was his father, forcing Sue to call the journalist to correct the story. ""That newspaper gained their information from social media, no one contacted us to confirm those details,"" she said. Sue said she personally asked that no information about Dallas be shared on social media but — after her requests were ignored and disrespected — she was left feeling isolated and in disbelief, questioning herself as a parent. ""He [was still living] at home and we conversed every day,"" Sue said. ""It was like he was not mine, like he belonged to everyone else. ""Did anyone stop to think of us, what we were going through or how we would feel seeing these things?"" The ""horrid"" experience was ""life-changing"", to the extent that mundane tasks like shopping for groceries have become a challenge for Sue. ""I hate shopping. I just want to go home. [I'm] also fearful of who I may bump into, not knowing what they have been told,"" she said. ""I walk the dog at night, preferring the solace of darkness than to be seen out. ""I am in the process of moving away. I am torn, not wanting to leave this home with so many wonderful memories. ""There is not one day I have not cried since my son left us — mostly for him, for my daughter, and for my other son."" Sue felt the tragedy was exploited by some to ""keep up appearances on social media, to be the most popular, the most important and to get the most attention"". ""Peoples' addiction to social media seemed to override any sense of humanity and genuine compassion,"" she said. ""If it is another person's tragedy, it is not your place to get involved unless asked to do so. ""We received so many beautiful cards, flowers, food and messages – sadly these were overshadowed by all the hurtful things we endured."" Sue said Dallas would not have wanted the family to suffer as they did and remembers him as a ""loveable larrikin"". ""He could be funny, he could be crazy, he could be adventurous, he was loyal and he loved life,"" she said. Dr Jaimee Stuart is a lecturer in the School of Applied Psychology at Griffith University, researching young people's online and offline behaviour. Young people can be ""shielded"" from the consequences of their online behaviour because they feel distant to those they might be harming, Dr Stuart said. ""Things you say online may be very different from something you say offline because, if you say or do that to somebody in person, there would be direct consequences that you would have to face then and there."" Dr Stuart believes the remedy for this lies in broader education around media literacy, which must be modelled in the home and taught in schools. ""Without media literacy education, young people find it much more difficult to manage or self-regulate the way they behave online,"" Dr Stuart said. ""We shouldn't be using the internet as a vehicle to cause harm. ""We should be minimising harm and enabling our children to do the same thing so we are modelling behaviour at the same time. ""On the internet [you need to] think, 'If you were face-to- face with them, would you say that or not?' and, if you think not, maybe you should refrain."" * Sue requested anonymity for this story.

8,A majority of Australians say they're trying to lose weight. Jen's not one of them,society,"  The Australia Talks survey has revealed 60pc of us are trying to lose weight. Let's unpack why Jen Bray spent years of her life on diets, but these days she isn't trying to lose weight — and that puts her in the minority. The small business owner from Melbourne said her parents put her on Weight Watchers when she was just nine years old. ""So from nine years old I learned how to count calories, how to restrict and how to deny myself things that were enjoyable and food that's not even unhealthy — I denied myself cheese and bread,"" she said. ""They're not bad foods, but I learned before I was even a teenager to stop eating those things."" The results from the Australia Talks National Survey 2021 reveal 60 per cent of Australians are currently trying to lose weight. In fact, more people agree than disagree with this statement across all demographics — age, gender, income, region, education, ancestry and voting preference. Jen said she started to earn praise for her weight loss when she left school, but it came at a huge personal cost. ""The more weight I lost, the more attention I got, the better people saw me — society saw me — but the worse I felt,"" she said. ""I was living in constant fear of putting on weight and my whole life became about staying thin and it was at a huge cost where I couldn't go out for dinner anymore, I didn't even have enough energy to socialise."" Things hit rock bottom when one day, on the way to uni, she did not have enough energy to get off the tram. ""I couldn't get off, I couldn't stand up, I couldn't will my body to move,"" she said. Jen's mum picked her up and took her to the doctor — the event sparked a decade-long recovery. ""Even though I wanted to change, it was still so hard,"" she said. ""I'd kick the wall in the dietician's office and scream ... even just wanting to get better wasn't enough, it was many years of trying to change the way I felt about myself."" ""I've slowly gotten better and now I follow so many accounts on Instagram of beautiful fat people enjoying life, and the more fat people I'm exposed to, and see that they are living and loving and enjoying themselves fat, has slowly changed the way I think."" Now 40, Jen exercises five times a week and chooses healthy foods. ""But my weight crept back to what it was when I was 18 and I feel like when it comes down to it, maybe I'm supposed to be that way, maybe … there's no such thing as an ideal way,"" she said. ""I used to think I'd rather be dead than fat, and now I turn up at the gym, the fattest person in the class and I'm proud like, I want to show people what fat people can do."" Alex Haslam, a psychology professor at the University of Queensland, said it could come down to the stigma around size. ""The fact that everybody wants to lose weight tells you something about social norms, obviously around losing weight, but more generally the idea that being overweight is seen as undesirable,"" he said. ""If you are overweight and you're seen to be overweight then you potentially open yourself up to criticism from other people. ""So in a way, what people are saying here is, I don't want to be in a group that's stigmatised."" Associate Professor Tegan Cruwys, a clinical psychologist at the Australian National University, agreed. ""We do live in a culture which does highly value certain body shapes over others, and those body shapes aren't super easy for most people to obtain, especially in an environment where we've got this hyper-availability of delicious foods and a culture that makes it challenging for people to get enough activity in a day,"" she said. ""It is the case in our society that lots of people are carrying extra weight, not just more weight than is necessarily healthy, but also more weight than is socially valued and, as a result, a lot of people are unhappy about that. ""We do see a relationship between people who want to lose weight and and poor mental health."" Dr Cruwys says weight discrimination has become an acceptable form of discrimination in society and is often presented as constructive criticism. ""There's a really strong belief that by discriminating against people with obesity, we will somehow encourage them to lose weight, that it's like an effective behaviour change strategy,"" she said. ""But in fact, we see the exact opposite — the data tends to suggest that the more people are exposed to discrimination and stigma for their weight, the more weight they gain."" We asked 60,000 Australians about their lives. See where you fit on the issues that matter. Size discrimination is something Jen has experienced firsthand. ""Every time I go to the doctor it [my weight] is constantly pathologised without even any medical tools to find out if I actually am unhealthy,"" she said. ""I keep getting told that the way I am is wrong, but I'm healthy and I exercise … and I'm still wrong."" Jen said she recently consulted an endocrinologist about whether there were any other underlying reasons she carries more weight. ""She took a bazillion tests and it came back that I was perfectly healthy, I'm healthier than most people … no diabetes, no signs of elevated blood sugar, my heart rate, everything was great and she still said, 'have you considered weight loss surgery?' ""I just find it so frustrating."" Dr Cruwys says there is a perception our bodies can be easily changed by ""health kicks"" — but that's not the reality. ""It is extremely challenging and most people who attempt to lose weight — and most people who do lose weight — will regain it,"" Dr Cruwys said. She likened it to pushing a boulder up a hill. ""We've got all these factors working against us that are kind of pushing us as a society towards weight gain and towards unhealthy lifestyles. ""And when we as individuals try to push against that, we are really fighting a losing battle most of the time."" Dr Cruwys says what tends to be more effective for long-term change is adjusting the social context we find ourselves in, rather than individual behaviours. ""When we are spending more time at organisations that support healthy lifestyles, when we are living in environments that are really walkable … those are the sorts of things that support long-term change."" According to Australia Talks, people aged 40-49 are the most likely to say they are trying to lose weight. Ray Bondzulic is one of them. The 49-year-old Brisbane-based sales manager said the reason he wanted to lose weight was to live longer, stay fit and look good. ""I think moreso I'm trying to turn back the clock a little bit,"" he said. ""I've trained on and off for a lot of years, but I've been always trying to get the top results, and then I'd go back to my old lifestyle of just eating junk food every day and drinking every night."" Ray broke his back in a jet ski accident not long ago, which gave him a new perspective on his health. ""As I get older I think health is more important than weight, even though they're kind of related, but yeah, I feel like if I'm healthier I can deal with things a lot better,"" he said. The survey also revealed 65 per cent of Australians would characterise their physical health as good or better, and almost half of Australians said they exercised several times a week. Australians are also more likely to be part of a sporting club, gym or exercise class than a religious group, social club, or political organisation. So if large portions of the population say they're healthy and exercise regularly, why is there still such a strong desire to lose weight? Tim Douge, accredited exercise physiologist at Studio 99 in Brisbane, said the survey results highlighted the disconnect between weight and health. ""Weight loss is really complex, there are a lot of different variables that go into it,"" he said. ""Our weight is often a lot more symptomatic of how we're feeling personally and it can tie into self-confidence and body issues, so people often focus on exercise for weight loss, not for health reasons."" Dr Cruwys says the survey results suggest people are much more motivated to change their physical appearance than their health. ""My sense is that what's happening there is that most of those people who are saying they want to lose weight, they're not trying to do so for health reasons by and large, even though they might associate weight loss with health."" Two years ago the ABC asked tens of thousands of people to share their thoughts, feelings and experiences. The Australia Talks National Survey is back again — here's what we found out. When it comes to getting active and exercising, Tim said weight loss alone could be the wrong motivator. ""Exercise for weight loss is really quite hard to do — you have to exercise at a high volume every day to reach success."" While Tim said people who do regular physical activity have a better chance of weight loss, the reason people stick to exercise for weight loss long-term is for the other benefits — more energy, better mental health and better sleep. ""They then stick with their lifestyle change for other, more beneficial reasons [and] weight loss becomes a nice side effect,"" he said.

9,How to talk to your family at Easter (without summoning the Four Horsemen),society,"  How to get through difficult conversations at family lunch this Easter long weekend Millions of Australians will don masks and brave highways to catch up with family this long weekend, but family lunch can sometimes take a turn for the worse. Nearly all of us have ideological and political fault lines in our immediate and extended clan, often along a generational divide. The SIgnal is the ABC's daily news podcast. Subscribe wherever you get your podcasts. Whether it's climate change, religion, border closures, or just plain old party politics, most families have topics that are conversational land mines. So how do you get through family lunch without setting one off? Georgie and her brother Charlie first started making their views known to their dad Peter when they were in their late teens. ""Georgie probably more so than Charlie, but both have got very strong thoughts about what's right and wrong,"" said Peter. Peter and his wife are both retired and live in regional Victoria, and Georgie works for an NGO in Melbourne, specialising in education. ""Georgie certainly has some very different political persuasions and ideas to what I was brought up thinking."" The list of tricky conversations they've had since then is long, but one stands out. Both Georgie and Peter point to one big disagreement several years ago, and Georgie said it was a catalyst for change in their family. ""I have a fairly strong view around gender equity and I remember having a conversation with my dad around him joining an elite men's club,"" she said. ""First of all, he didn't tell me he was going to join, because he said to me: 'I knew you'd cause a fuss.' ""My brother basically spilled the beans when we were all together and I reacted in a fairly profound and devastated and frustrated way. ""I would have said to him: 'How could you possibly do something like this, I'm a woman and you are married to a woman and you'll probably have a granddaughter one day, and don't you care that you are contributing to what is gender inequity?"" ""That didn't land beautifully with my kind and generous dad, who absolutely strives to be a very good person and is a very good person."" Georgie made a special trip to see her dad and talk about it later, and she made her case about why she thought he shouldn't be a member. ""He said to me, 'Is this a deal breaker?' and I said, 'it's not a deal breaker, it's your life but it will always be something that I'll be challenged by.'"" It never came up again. ""From what I understand he's not a member of said club, but I don't actually know,"" said Georgie. Peter said he is still a member of the club. Recalling the disagreement, said it ""was not deemed to be politically correct, within the family, especially by Georgie."" ""The solution was, over all these years, 'you'll do something that I might not necessarily approve of, and I'll do the same' but I'm not going to lose a daughter over it."" Despite that specific clash remaining unresolved, it sparked a bigger shift in Georgie's family. She pitched an idea to them that from then on, rather than give gifts to each other at Christmas, they donate the money to charity — but not just any charity. In the lead up to Christmas, there's a big family discussion about where the pool of money should go and it has opened up a proxy discussion about their values, according to Georgie. ""What we value is the conversation that we can spark around areas of interest that we want to support."" She said she would recommend the same approach to other families Peter added that there's no doubt his children have shifted his own views over the years. ""Growing up in an all-boys school, going through the private school system there were things that were ingrained into us,"" he says. ""I have no hesitation in saying I was a homophobe and I am certainly not now. ""That has come about through considerable discussion and interaction with a number of the younger generation, [who] I admire immensely"". He said the same shift has happened on a range of other topics and he has no doubt his views will continue to evolve. Clinical Psychologist Dr Charlotte Keating gives Peter and Georgie's family full marks for their approach, but said it's easy for things to go a much uglier way. ""When the particular issues at hand are ones that feel very personal, where people's communication style can be more combative or reactive or judgemental."" ""When relationships break down, it's got a lot to do with poor communication leading to that loss of connection."" If the disagreement is to do with an immutable part of a person's identity, such as their sexuality, it can be incredibly painful. ""Often, deep down, there's that real sense of feeling unloved, or feeling rejected, when there's parts of ourselves that are not understood or misunderstood."" As for how to avoid family catch-ups taking an ugly turn, Dr Keating has some practical advice. ""I think it's really important to stick with your truth and to speak it from a place of heartfelt lovingness,"" she said. But that doesn't mean you're obliged to talk about topics likely to start world war three. ""We do have some level of choice about what we are prepared to actually talk about on the day."" She says if things do get heated, it's okay to hit pause and make time to discuss it later, in a different setting, perhaps without alcohol in the picture. ""That's a way of setting some boundaries about what you're comfortable with."" If a proverbial landmine has gone off, Dr Charlotte Keating also has advice on how to keep the argument from escalating. She refers to the well-known psychological framework, known as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, coined by an American husband and wife team of clinical psychologists, Julie and John Gottman. The Gottmans' research suggests the presence of these so-called four horsemen are very accurate predictors of whether or not a couple will ultimately separate. But Dr Keating said the theory is also a useful tool in managing family conflict. The Four Horsemen: Noticing these behaviours in yourself and in others can help cut problems off before they become a problem, said Dr Keating. ""You want to notice things getting emotional before it gets to that point,"" says Dr Keating. And finally, being aware of these behaviours can also help to plan for conversations ahead of time, so you can prevent the Horsemen from showing up. ""Even role playing with a partner or a friend,"" said Dr Keating. ""It takes the anxiety and the tension out of it for you because you've got a way of navigating it, you've done it before.""

10,Nerrissa says she's suffered years of racism at school in Victoria — and not just from other students,society,"  Greater Shepparton Secondary College student says racist incidents left her feeling 'subhuman' Senior student Nerrissa Leitch should be concentrating on her studies, but she says she is often exposed to racism at school that makes her feel ""subhuman"". ""Many of my friends come from different backgrounds, different nationalities, and they've been told to go back to their own country. Things like the n-word,"" said the 17-year-old Yorta Yorta and Gunaikurnai woman. Ms Leitch is in her final year at Greater Shepparton Secondary College (GSSC), which was found to be ""a picture of systemic racism"" in a scathing report obtained by the ABC. Commissioned by the Department of Education and Training after a series of race-related incidents, the independent report found the workplace was ""complicit"" in racism experienced by students. Ms Leitch said she had encountered racism over a number of years at the school. ""It's not only the students with racist opinions, it's also the teachers and the staff,"" Ms Leitch said. ""I really think the staff also need cultural awareness training, and to be more culturally inclusive."" The same recommendation was made in the report, written by cross-cultural consultant Georgia Birch, which was presented to the school in November but has not been publicly released. The ABC has attempted to contact GSSC for comment. Among the report's 47 recommendations is for the school's all-white leadership and all-white teaching teams to take part in ""ongoing cultural intelligence training"". The report found ""a high number of racist incidents"" experienced by students had involved teachers. It also said some teachers were reluctant to report racist behaviour for fear of being isolated or bullied by colleagues. There are approximately 575 students from multicultural backgrounds enrolled at Greater Shepparton Secondary College, and more than half are Aboriginal. Other students come from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Congo, Malaysia, Philippines, Samoa and Tonga. When I was a teen, I wanted to be the cool black girl, the safe black girl. But that came with baggage I wasn't ready for. Despite its diverse cultural mix, the report found the school's leaders had one-dimensional view of multiculturalism and Aboriginal culture in the school, and had suggested that ""tokenistic interventions, such as having Aboriginal artefacts in the foyer"" were enough. Meredith Peace, the President of the Victorian branch of the Australian Education Union, said neither the union nor the school's staff had been given a copy of the report. ""Media reports in relation to the Department of Education's report suggest there are significant issues that would concern our members and the school community,"" she said in a statement. ""GSSC staff must have the opportunity to understand the contents of the report and be engaged properly in the work required to address the issues raised. ""Racism should never be tolerated and we expect the Department to provide the additional resources necessary to assist the school community to tackle the issues."" A spokesman for the department said that racism was never acceptable, and that a cultural steering advisory committee had been established to examine the report and its recommendations. ""It will be the cultural advisory steering committee that provides advice to the school about the best way forward from this point,"" said David Howes, the deputy secretary of schools and regional services. ""The challenges that the school faces are the challenges that the broader community faces and what is happening outside the school does impact what does happen inside the school."" Suzanna Sheed, the independent member of state parliament for Shepparton, said aspects of the report were ""obviously very concerning,"" and that resourcing in the area was an ongoing issue. ""We have high levels of disadvantage in Shepparton and we have to fight for resources,"" she said. ""And we've been doing that for so long with so many groups in our community, all addressing issues, putting out fires, treating things as a crisis when they arise. ""I think this is a real opportunity for us all to work together, look at all the programs and organisations we have in our town and see how we can go forward."" The report comes at a time of immense change, as four high schools are merged into the college to address poor educational outcomes. New facilities are being built to create a ""super school"" at a cost of $121 million. Once the capital works program is completed, Greater Shepparton Secondary College will become Victoria's largest government school, with an anticipated enrolment of 2,700 students. Ms Leitch said she would love to see the school introduce more programs to allow Indigenous children to connect with their Elders, and wellbeing areas so that students have a safe place to go. ""A language program would be something that's so special, and just more programs for Indigenous kids, and not just Indigenous kids, for all cultures,"" she said. The changes may come too late for Ms Leitch, as she prepares to graduate this year. But she says change is needed so that other children don't have to experience the same racism she and her friends endure each day. ""I don't want the future generations to experience what we've experienced,"" she said. ""It's just not good enough. I think everyone deserves to belong, and everyone deserves to have a safe space.""

11,"Safety audit finds 'immediate, severe risk' to residents at a Gold Coast aged care centre",society,"  Safety audit finds 'immediate and severe risk' to Southport Lodge aged care centre residents A Gold Coast nursing home has failed every quality standard in a surprise audit by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (ACQSC). A report published by the ACQSC shows the Southport Lodge was non-compliant in all eight of its measured quality standards during an audit conducted December 15-18, 2020. The ACQSC identified that there was an ""immediate and severe risk"" to the safety, health or wellbeing of Southport Lodge residents. It has imposed a six-month sanction on the Southport Lodge, barring it from receiving Commonwealth subsidies for any new care recipients for six months. ACQSC's report said the facility did not have a sufficiently skilled workforce to ""provide safe and timely quality care"". ""The service does not adequately demonstrate that deterioration or change of a consumer's mental health, cognitive or physical function, capacity or condition is recognised and responded to appropriately, specifically in relation to consumers who experience a fall overnight or develop an acute respiratory illness,"" the report says. ""There are no registered staff available overnight to assess consumers who may experience a deterioration during this time."" A lack of understanding of strategies required to minimise a potential COVID-19 outbreak was also noted, as well as no documented palliative care or end of life procedures. The facility also faced losing its approved aged care provider status unless it appointed an adviser to help it comply with ACQSC standards, and provided relevant training within six months for officers, employees and agents. The ACQSC said Southport Lodge, which is owned by Planlow Pty Ltd, had already taken action, appointing an adviser on December 31, and it would continue to be monitored. The Southport Lodge has been contacted for comment. Fadden Federal MP Stuart Robert said the health, safety and wellbeing of senior Australians was of utmost importance to the Australian Government. ""If the provider fails to take timely remedial action, there are other actions that the commission may take to ensure the safety of care recipients,"" he said. ""The Serious Incident Response Scheme legislation includes additional regulatory tools providing the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner with functions and powers to respond to serious incidents and provide compliance notices and directions to take action, and will also include imposing civil penalties, infringement notices, enforceable undertakings, and injunctions."" It follows the abrupt closure of the Earle Haven nursing home in Nerang in 2019, which left 68 elderly residents homeless. Earle Haven also formed part of the Royal Commission into Aged Care, which heard half of the residents were being physically restrained in the weeks before it closed. Aged and Disability Advocacy Australia CEO Geoff Rowe said he was surprised by the breaches. ""What really concerns me is this is happening at a time when there is a spotlight on aged care,"" he said. ""Over the past 18 months they have had a Royal Commission that has been looking at the quality of care in aged care and you would think that is a time when providers would be on their absolute best behaviour."" He said unannounced audits by the ACQSC to nursing homes, like the Southport Lodge, were turning up concerning results. ""Rather than in time gone by where aged care facilities were told, 'You're going to have an audit on this date, you can expect the quality auditors to come in', we saw quite bizarre things happening — and this is not about Southport Lodge — but certainly other facilities on the Gold Coast where special crockery and cutlery was brought in for the audit, there were special meals, clients who were seen as difficult were taken out for the day,"" he said. ""There was a real facade around the whole audit process. ""Now with the unannounced visits, they're just turning up and getting a phone call to say, 'We're out the front, we're coming in' and we're seeing it, warts and all."" Beth Mohle from the Queensland Nurses and Midwives Union said the issues raised reflected ""a fundamental failing"" of the aged care system. ""There's not even a requirement for there to be one registered nurse on duty 24 hours a day in our aged care facilities,"" she said.

12,'I don't need alcohol to be myself': Why more people are going booze-free,society,"  Sober lifestyle grows in popularity, with more Australians giving up alcohol Ten years ago, teenager Ezrah Waith was in a bustling nightclub on the Gold Coast's glitter strip, with lights flashing and music pumping, when he had an epiphany. ""I just remember standing in the middle of Sin City and realising I didn't need alcohol to be myself,"" Ezrah said. It was almost sacrilege in the schoolies' capital of Australia, where drinking alcohol is a veritable right of passage for many. ""They call it 'liquid courage' for a reason — because it gives people the confidence to do things, but I felt I was always comfortable with myself."" Now 30, Ezrah and his wife Tyrene are proud to remain booze-free and it seems their sober lifestyle may be catching on. According to an Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) triennial survey, the number of people who had ditched the drink rose from 1.5 million to 1.9 million between 2016 and 2019. Weight gain and hangovers were cited among the reasons. The AIHW report found the proportion of ex-drinkers had fluctuated since 2001, but 2019 recorded the highest proportion of ex-drinkers over that period. The coronavirus pandemic may have disrupted people's drinking habits in 2020, however, the AIHW said no clear patterns had emerged yet of the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on alcohol and other drug consumption. Christmas parties and work social gatherings can often be an irritating experience for the sober-minded, but the advent of no and low-alcohol drinks has allowed people like Ezrah and Tyrene Waith to fly under the radar. ""It's not so much that the questions annoy me, but it gets repetitive after a while if you are constantly explaining why you are not drinking,"" Ezrah said. ""I like non-alcoholic beer and gin and tonics; I've found ones that are quite enjoyable. They taste very similar [to an alcoholic drink]. ""It's more socially acceptable to drink non-alcoholics. When you are not drinking, people think you are not having fun. ""People will hardly ever notice you're drinking non-alcoholics."" Faye Lawrence is the founder of Untoxicated, a non-drinking network of 8,000 Australians who socialise over morning teas and activities like mini golf and camping. They are part of a growing movement called ""sober curious"". Ms Lawrence said whether people drank alcohol or not did not have to be ""black or white"". ""It's about having that sense of curiosity and picking for the individual what works for them and how they want to show up in the world. ""It's that mindful drinking, where one day you might have an alcohol-free vodka or wine, and other days you might want to go out with mates and have a big night."" Ms Lawrence said ""cool, fun and attractive"" alcohol-free alternatives helped non-drinkers overcome the fear of missing out. ""We're social animals, we also want to fit in and if you turn up and have an alcohol-free cocktail, no-one is going to notice that you're not drinking, so a big deal doesn't have to be made about it,"" she said. With the rise of the sober curious, Burleigh-based distiller Catie Fry is tapping into a market that traditionally only catered for beer and wine drinkers. Ms Fry is the first distiller in Australia to produce a zero-alcohol and mid-strength range of white spirits. ""I wanted to make something that was complex, bold and rounded, but do it in a lower-alcohol form and be able to have a couple of drinks and be okay,"" Ms Fry said. ""You'd call them a botanical vodka, but they're crafted very much like a gin."" The distiller's inspiration came after being treated ""like a house plant"" during her two pregnancies, when the only drink options were water or juice. ""It's distilled in exactly the same way; I work with 21 different botanicals all up in my range of three infusions and I craft my botanicals with a wheat-based spirit,"" Ms Fry said. The mother, wife and entrepreneur said she was also determined to change the culture of the male-dominated distilling industry. ""I didn't have much of a chance to be in the distillery uninterrupted, which I get. You can't have kids running around in the distillery, someone's got to look after them,"" she said. ""But I got excluded a little bit, so I bought a copper still and experimented when the kids went to sleep."" Her three varieties are marketed to a female audience, but the mother of two said she was surprised by the overwhelming interest they had from men. ""People said if I was too feminine or female-focused, then you'll lose half your market and alienate men,"" she said. ""But I don't think anyone's ever said that to Jack Daniel, Jim Beam, Johnny Walker or XXXX, which are marketed to men and consumed by women. ""Little wins like this for women show young girls that they can be a distiller too, or have their own distilling company, or mechanic shop, or anything really."" Ms Fry hoped her company would help bring about a shift in the drinking landscape. ""Things are changing and there are so many amazing craft distilleries that are getting with the times and becoming more inclusive so look around, be proud and you'll find others who want to come along with you,"" she said.

13,"In 2021, the NT will introduce surrogacy laws — but that's 'too late' for some",society,"  The NT Government will introduce surrogacy laws in 2021 — but it's 'too late' for some Tara and Luke Kaspar have been trying to have a baby for the past decade. They've spent nearly $100,000, raided their superannuation accounts and been through 28 rounds of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) — falling pregnant twice and miscarrying both times. Luke, who comes from a big family, says as tough as it's been financially, it's been tougher still on their mental health. ""It was tough mentally and on the hip pocket, but more mentally,"" he says. After years in limbo, Tara and Luke are just months away from becoming parents using Tara's sister as a surrogate and egg donor. But the couple lives in the Northern Territory — the only jurisdiction in Australia with no surrogacy laws — so their journey is far from over. When their twins are born in June, Tara and Luke will find themselves in a stressful legal purgatory, because surrogacy in the NT is neither legal or illegal. Doctors still don't know why Tara hasn't been able to carry a baby to term. After her second miscarriage, Tara and Luke asked their doctor about legal surrogacy options. They say they were stunned to discover the Northern Territory had none. Darwin council alderman and mother-of-two Rebecca Want de Rowe says she was similarly shocked when making her own enquires about surrogacy five years ago. Rebecca, whose husband Kent is the Director of NT Parliament, had a miscarriage in 2016 when she was 11 weeks pregnant with the couple's third child. ""Through my grief, and sharing my story with a lot of people, it really became obvious how many women out there are struggling with infertility [and] miscarriages,"" she says. ""People who I thought were choosing to not have a family, were actually not having families because they were not able to."" Rebecca wanted to be a surrogate herself, but without the legal framework to support her, she wasn't able to push ahead with her plans without leaving the Northern Territory. So, in 2018, she launched a petition calling on the NT Government to introduce altruistic surrogacy legislation, laws which can't be used for financial gain. The NT Government has now committed to introducing surrogacy legislation, but with the bill yet to be introduced or debated in NT Parliament, their ascension to law could be months off. For Rebecca, that means having to travel interstate to become a surrogate for friends in Sydney — if coronavirus travel restrictions allow — which will also mean taking time away from her job and two young children. And for Tara and Luke, whose children are due in June, it will also be too late. Tara's sister Renee Andrews says she didn't hesitate to offer to be a surrogate for her sister and Luke. ""Of course I was going to do it, that's my younger sister,"" Renee says. ""They're very loving people and these kids are going to be very blessed."" Renee, who has three young daughters herself, will deliver Tara and Luke's twins at the end of June. But because Renee is giving birth to the babies, and there's no surrogacy legislation in the Territory, it will be Renee's name on their birth certificates — not Tara's. Tara will need to adopt the babies or push for a parenting order after they are born and until then, she won't be able to get maternity leave, which means they will continue to chew into their savings. ""It's like we haven't endured enough pain to have to endure more,"" Tara says. ""It feels like it's never going to end, we'll have to keep jumping hurdles."" Sarah Jefford is the only lawyer in Australia who exclusively practices in surrogacy and donor conception law in Australia. She's also an IVF mum, egg donor and former surrogate and describes helping another couple start their family as ""one of the very best things"" she's ever done. ""When surrogacy hits the headlines, it's often negative,"" Ms Jefford says. ""I never once regretted it, and I've never spoken to a surrogate that has regretted it."" Across Australia, between 60 and 80 babies are born via surrogacy every year, and Ms Jefford wants Australian families to be able to discuss infertility without the fear of stigma. She says she knows dozens of Northern Territory families who have moved interstate to access surrogacy or used an overseas surrogate because they didn't want to relocate. ""I probably get one or two enquires a month from people in the Northern Territory who think, 'I need to pack up and go,'"" Ms Jefford says. ""All the other jurisdictions have had surrogacy legislation from as early as 2004. ""Most surrogacy legislation is from about 2008 to 2010, so it's been a while, it would have been nice if the Northern Territory had caught up a little sooner."" For families who choose to stay in the Northern Territory, such as Tara and Luke, the way forward isn't clear cut. And Ms Jefford says any new laws introduced in the NT must put the rights of the child first, before the interests of the surrogate or the intending parents. ""Any laws around children really need to focus on the child's best interests at heart,"" Sarah says. This means giving children access to information about who their biological parents are and if they're conceived with the help of a donor. Tara and Luke hope that sharing their story will help other Northern Territory families struggling with infertility, and to let them know they are not alone and there is hope. Despite the legal challenges ahead, Tara and Luke are simply grateful to have two healthy babies on the way. ""It's amazing, thinking we'd never have kids, to now having two,"" Tara says. They're catching up on all the sleep they can before the twins come home in June.

14,Regional Victoria and Melburnians embrace as COVID-19's 'ring of steel' falls,society,"  Melbourne woman Sarah Vincent was on the road with her family well before the crack of dawn today as Victoria's ""ring of steel"" was lifted. Over four months, Ms Vincent and millions of friends and family members were kept apart by the separation of greater Melbourne and the rest of the state, enforced at the height of the state's coronavirus crisis to limit travel. On Sunday at 11:59pm it was finally relaxed, and Melburnians and regional Victorians came together on Monday for the first time since July. Melbourne has come into line with regional Victoria's coronavirus restrictions. Here's what that means for cinemas, sport and travel. ""We know so many people have missed those they love the most, those they need to see and have been desperately keen to see for such a long period of time,"" Premier Daniel Andrews said. Ms Vincent had not seen her mother, Wodonga resident Jennie Johnson, in six months — aside from the odd message or video call. The escape to the north-east Victoria also meant her two-year-old son Blake would have more space to play and spend precious time with his grandparents. ""It felt so good to see my mum and have a cuddle. I've been waiting a long time for it,"" Ms Vincent said. ""It's been very difficult, especially with a little one and not being able to have everyone around. ""I had a lot of mental health issues being in lockdown all the time, I couldn't go anywhere."" Jennie Johnson said she was on the verge of tears when she saw her daughter pull into the driveway with her young family after counting down the hours. ""We've been hanging out for this, it's been very difficult not being able to see them all,"" Ms Johnson said. ""It's been difficult not watching the little one grow up — missing his birthday, missing everyone's birthdays. It's given me a new appreciation for family."" The family said they planned to go on picnics, visit the shops, and spend some quality time together. ""Blake seeing his grandparents is a massive thing, and him being able to be a kid and run around having fun, getting muddy, and not being locked down,"" Ms Vincent said. ""It's so different out here. It's like I can breathe again."" Melbourne woman Zoe told ABC Radio she was headed for Anglesea this morning for a surf at long last. She told Virginia Trioli's Mornings program it ""felt like life was coming back"". ""It looks like it's going to be heaven,"" she said. ""We gave a big 'whoop' when we hit the 25-kilometre mark and the ring of steel, and said 'goodbye Porpoise Spit'."" Kate from Ballarat said she was looking forward to seeing her son this weekend, having been separated for five months. She said the most frustrating thing had been tough restrictions in areas of the state where there had been few cases. ""We've been waiting for Melbourne to open up, we've had very low numbers. Some areas in the western region have had none,"" she said. ""You've got little businesses that are struggling because we're waiting for the whole state to be on par, and that's the hardest part."" The timing of the Government's decision could not have been better for Gordon Bahn from Leongatha in South Gippsland. Mr Bahn and his wife Gillian today celebrated their 52nd wedding anniversary with their daughter Diane and granddaughter Zoe who travelled from their home in Melbourne's south-east. He said it was ""lovely"" to see his family for the first since June. ""One of the things that Diane wanted to come down for was to wish us a happy anniversary,"" Mr Bahn said. ""And Zoe loves to do her cooking, so she cooked us a little cake for our anniversary, that was very enjoyable, and just an enjoyable time to have them here together."" But he said he did not have plans to travel to Melbourne to see his other grandchildren while there was still a risk of catching coronavirus. Mental health service Beyond Blue received thousands of calls from Victorians seeking support over the past four months. Among the main queries received were concerns about isolation, general uncertainty, job losses, and not being in touch with family and friends. Beyond Blue's lead clinical adviser, Grant Blashki, said with the state open again, there was a great feeling of enthusiasm and relief as people could reunite. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Victorian news. ""There's obviously a lot of joy and relief, but I'm also seeing mixed emotions,"" Dr Blashki said. ""There's a bit of apprehension — particularly older members of the community who have lost confidence and are nervous, and also those who may be dealing with anxiety getting back out there. ""I think a lot of regional people not having access to tourist dollars has been a really big hit and they're excited to see people visit again."" Dr Blashki said it could be tough for some people affected by the lockdown and separation moving forward. ""I'm suggesting people take it slow, particularly those who have had anxiety or stress.""

15,"Puppy prices soar during lockdown, with breeders and shelters struggling to match demand",society,"  Barb Traeger knows just how hard it has become to get a dog. When she retired in June, she decided it was the perfect time to get a puppy. She had owned dogs previously, she had space at her Langwarrin home in Melbourne's outer south-east and she knew she would have the time to spend with a pet. Ms Traeger initially looked for a Jack Russell puppy online but the cheapest puppy she could find was selling for $5,000. ""They were just way out of our price, they were very expensive,"" she said. It took many applications, but Ms Traeger was able to adopt a dog instead. She has been enjoying training her dog Allie during Melbourne's extended lockdowns, saying it has given her something positive to focus on. For teacher Kate Ellis, it was a case of just in time, when she purchased her puppy. She organised to buy a dog before COVID-19 for her 40th birthday, but by the time she was able to pick up her Airedale puppy, Melbourne was in its first lockdown. ""It was incredible timing, I was living on my own at the time and I got this incredibly vivacious, very hilarious dog,"" she said. She said her puppy brought a lot of fun to her life during a difficult time. Data from Melbourne councils show just how strong demand for dogs has been. In Maribyrnong City Council in Melbourne's west, more than 1,000 more dogs have been registered this year, compared to the same time period last year. Hume City Council in Melbourne's north has seen nearly 700 more dogs registered since lockdown started this year compared to the same time period last year, while the City of Stonnington in the city's south has seen a rise of nearly 200 extra dogs being registered. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The RSPCA's Tegan McPherson said the organisation had seen a significant increase in applications for pets this year. ""We have seen in excess of 26,000 online applications to adopt a pet since the start of the pandemic,"" she said. She said the RSPCA has had hundreds of applications for some dogs. ""It has been really difficult for the staff as well, because obviously people are disappointed or become a bit frustrated (if they miss out on a dog) and unfortunately it is just the nature of the demand we are seeing at the moment,"" she said. Border Collie breeder Jacqui from Gippsland said demand for her puppies had gone through the roof since lockdowns started, with a lot of enquiries coming from Melbourne. But she said some people were not thinking through how big a decision it was to get a dog. ""You don't just get a puppy because you are bored, you get a puppy because you have been looking for a while, you are focusing on it and you want a puppy long-term,"" she said. Jacqui is worried the state will see more dogs in shelters after lockdowns end. She has not raised her puppy prices because of the pandemic, and said she was shocked to see some border collie puppies being sold for about double the usual price. The Australian Association of Pet Dog Breeders president Tracee Rushton said there had been an incredible jump in demand particularly for small, apartment-friendly dogs, and oodles — dogs that are crossed with a poodle. Ms Rushton said registered breeders had to match market rates, to avoid creating a secondary puppy market. ""The problem is if we don't price our puppies in accordance with the current market rate, what we have found is that we get people purchasing puppies for a cheap price, then turning around and immediately reselling those puppies for a greater amount,"" she said. ""That is not what we want to see as breeders, we want to see our puppies go to a forever home."" She said families struggling to find or afford a dog could consider adopting a breeding dog, with many retired by the age of about four, or contacting breeders to see if they are willing to negotiate on the price. While Julie Nelson from the Master Dog Breeders and Associates said supply had become a problem during the pandemic because many Victorians usually bought dogs from interstate, but that had become difficult with border closures.

16,"'Parliamentarian, soldier, rail enthusiast, family man': Tim Fischer memorial plaque unveiled at Albury Train Station",society,"  Tim Fischer memorial plaque unveiled at Albury Train Station Members of Tim Fischer's family have attended a memorial plaque unveiling at the Albury Train Station to honour the former deputy prime minister. The plaque was unveiled on the first anniversary of Mr Fischer's state funeral that was held in Albury on August 29, 2019. Although Mr Fischer's wife, Judy Brewer, was unable to attend the event due to the coronavirus pandemic and the NSW-Victoria border closure, Ms Brewer witnessed the event via FaceTime. The Fischer family was represented by Mr Fischer's brother, Tony Fischer, and his sister, Vicki Baudry, who unveiled the plaque. As well as being a parliamentarian, diplomat, author, rail enthusiast, farmer and soldier Tim Fischer was also a broadcaster and chose to host his ABC Great Train Show podcast series out of the Wodonga studios in 2008 and 2009. The plaque was gifted by the ABC and honoured Mr Fischer's contribution to the local community and beyond and acknowledged his love of the Albury Train Station. Ms Brewer said she was pleased a memorial plaque for her husband was now at the station. She said the station was one of his favourite places and he often used it for travel, meetings, interviews and book launches. ""It  was our 'meeting place' in Albury both before we were married and after. He could always entertain himself there if I was running late!,"" she said. Before his state funeral was held at the Albury Entertainment Centre last year, Mr Fischer's funeral train stopped at the station and a military service was held on the platform to honour the Vietnam veteran. In the Great Train Show podcast series, Mr Fischer often spoke of his love for the station and its important place in Australian history. The Albury Railway Station is heritage-listed and officially opened in 1882. It was designed by the engineer-in-charge for the New South Wales Railways, John Whitton, and includes a platform that is 455 metres long — one of the longest in the southern hemisphere. The station played a significant role in the Second World War, the different gauge system between states on the New South Wales and Victorian border meant hundreds of soldiers swapped trains in Albury during the war. Mr Fischer often spoke of the individuals who stood on its platform due to the change in rail gauge. Notable travellers included authors Mark Twain and Agatha Christie, opera singer Dame Nellie Melba, cricketer Don Bradman, and military leaders General Sir John Monash and General Douglas MacArthur. The Duke of York, who later became King George VI, would have once stood on the platform, as would Saint Mary MacKillop and various politicians including Australia's first prime minister Sir Edmund Barton and the first woman elected to the Australian House of Representatives, Dame Enid Lyons.

17,Adelaide Showground 'eerie' with inactivity after first cancellation in 75 years,society,"  Adelaide Showground 'eerie' with inactivity after first cancellation in 75 years A veritable ghost town has replaced what should have been the city's busiest location at this time of year, according to Royal Adelaide Show (RAS) stakeholders, but all is not lost thanks to online interest in some of its most popular offerings. Originally scheduled for a September 4 start, the Adelaide Show's stages, carnival rides, marquees, stables and exhibition displays would have been getting assembled behind the Showground fences for an annual event that brings about $317 million to the SA economy. ""We'd be in the final stages of set-up here, about seven days from where the livestock start rolling in, so we'd be right in the thick of it,"" Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of SA chief executive John Rothwell said. Instead, the show was cancelled in April due to COVID-19 restrictions, the biggest in a string of event cancellations at the 26-hectare multi-purpose venue in Adelaide's inner-south. Other than skeleton staff, maintenance workers and perhaps a few tourists in its new caravan park, the showground has been at its quietest since the last disruption during WWII. Mr Rothwell said the ""dark days"" in the pandemic's first few months created an ""eerie"" atmosphere at the venue. Just 10 per cent of its full-time staff were still coming to work, while others were made redundant or put on reduced hours with the support of the Federal Government's JobKeeper package. ""We have lost 95 per cent of our income, which is extraordinary, and it happened in the third week of March when all our events and exhibitions just disappeared overnight,"" he said. The show is by far the biggest loss, however, accounting for up to 60 per cent of the society's revenue in regular years. The digital world has offered some respite, with the show's two high-profile ram sales, the Elite Sale and the Merino and Poll Merino sale, to be held online. The Royal Adelaide Beer and Cider Awards will also still be held, along with its Wine Show, despite the public elements of those competitions having been cancelled. ""We have a few exhibitions and events still booked for the last quarter of this year, so our focus now is on those we can accommodate, as well as those in February and March next year,"" Mr Rothwell said. Other stakeholders feeling the loss include Showbag Shop director Emily Williams, whose company usually produces about 1.1 million showbags for capital city and rural shows, including about 250,000 for the Adelaide event alone. She said 90 per cent of their income came from shows right across the country, most of which had been cancelled. Despite her company also relying on the JobKeeper package to retain staff on reduced hours, Ms Williams said they turned out to be busier than expected thanks to a boost in showbag sales online. ""I think there are a lot of families who couldn't go to their show but wanted to retain their tradition of buying showbags,"" she said. ""When they hear they can still buy them, they do. ""It can also be people buying gifts, showbags for the kids to keep them entertained, birthday presents and kid's parties."" Mr Rothwell said the first time the Adelaide Show was cancelled was during the Victorian Gold Rush of 1852 when men rushed interstate, erroneously ""assuming that the women who were left behind could not run the show"". It was also cancelled during the WWI and WWII years, as well as during the Spanish Flu pandemic, which was spread by soldiers returning from WW1. He said the society had gone into debt in order to stay afloat, but had benefited from the City of Unley waiving its council rates for 12 months, and a Federal grant of more than $2 million. It had also used the time to finish a versatile caravan park ahead of schedule in the south-east corner of the showgrounds, where old stables were demolished. Among those missing their chance to present their best efforts at the Adelaide Show this year are photographers, artists, cooks, horticulturists, pet owners, livestock workers, dairy farmers, tropical fish enthusiasts and flower lovers, to name a few, plus countless companies from the exhibition halls. Embroiderers' Guild of SA member Susannah Whitney, who won Best Handicraft Exhibit in Show during 2019, said members would otherwise be very busy preparing for the show. ""I think everyone is still working on things, but we just haven't been able to get together and see them,"" she said. ""Normally we have our stitching group meetings every week, where we all meet and stitch together and look at what each other is doing, but we had to close down in March and are only just starting to reopen.""

18,National shearer shortage looms as New Zealanders battle the border,society," ABC Rural Australia's shearing contractors and wool producers fear a national shearer shortage with COVID-19 border closures and travel restrictions, making it difficult for New Zealand shearers to enter the country. Key points: Every August an influx of 500 shearers from New Zealand arrive in Australia primed for spring shearing — but not this year. They handle at least seven million sheep over three months and head home to New Zealand for their own season in December. Shearing Contractors Association of Australia (SCAA) secretary Jason Letchford said the looming workforce shortage was a major concern for the industry. ""We are really in a desperate situation to get the sheep shorn this year in spring,"" Ms Letchford said. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic He said if sheep were not shorn in time, the season would be extended, which would cause financial losses for producers and also pose a risk to animal welfare. ""If you don't have good animal husbandry practises you lose your asset,"" he said. The SCAA is working with the Department of Agriculture, Home Affairs and state governments to find an agreement on New Zealand shearers coming to Australia. Mr Letchford believed a fast and proper solution was needed. ""I realise that the governments are walking this very narrow band between safety and keeping the virus at stake, but there are jobs and commercial issues at stake,"" he said. ""It can't just be a blanket approach where we turn of the tap in one area and it has unintended consequences across other industries. ""But we have a critical shortage of shearers in Australia and we the New Zealand workers who are COVID-19 free,"" he said. ""At this point in time with the $3,000 entry for quarantining and actually getting through an Australian port is making it look unlikely any will be able to come across."" Mr Letchford said with the drought breaking in many parts of Australia the national sheep flock was only set to surge from the current 65 million head as farmers look to rebuild and retain more stock and more shearers would be needed. Craig Gilbert, who runs Woolaway Contract Shearing in Naracoorte, South Australia, feared he might not be unable to secure a full workforce if the agreements for NZ shearers entering Australia did not change. His business brings half of its staff into the area as seasonal workers from interstate and overseas, but he might have to work with a skeleton workforce and ask growers for more flexible shearing arrangements. ""We simply don't have the numbers of shearers here in Australia to cover all that to get it done in the time frames that growers require,"" Mr Gilbert said. ""If the sheep need to get shorn and they don't get shorn that will have a significant impact on the area, on growers and on their price and on the wellbeing of the animals."" ""It's not just like you can say we are going to shear your sheep in December instead of October. Of course the season changes, and it gets a bit hotter, the animals can suffer from grass seeds, they can suffer from flies, and that's distressing for the animal."" He found it ""somewhat frustrating"" to see New Zealand shearers denied entry to Australia and believed the Department of Agriculture needed to step up and understand the significance of shearer coming from New Zealand, which now was a COVID-19 free country. Mr Letchford recognised many Australian's were out of work due COVID-19 and were looking for work. Shearing was still a skilled trade that had to be learnt over time. ""We do welcome people to the industry but the reality is you won't be able to pick it up overnight, so we are not going to be able to retrain a Virgin flight person to be a be a shearer suddenly,"" Mr Letchford said. ""People come into the industry and start as a shed hand and we would love that, and there is plenty of training available for that."" However, he is not aware of any people from COVID-19 impacted industries trying to enter the shearing and wool handling industry. ""New Zealand has the labour force that we need as we just don't have enough skilled workers here in Australia to do it."" ""It's very frustrating that we can't easily access those workers in New Zealand."" But it's not only Australia's shearing sheds that are short-staffed. New Zealand's industry also fears a workforce shortage for its peak season starting from November to March, when usually shearers from Australia and the UK flock to the nation. New Zealand Shearing Contractors Association president Mark Barrowcliffe said a delay of their season was on the cards and despite talks with their Department of Immigration there were additional challenges to bring overseas shearers into the country. ""We have to comply with quarantining rules for the staff, that's putting a cost on either the person coming over or the employer, so there is a few issues to deal with there,"" Mr Barrowcliffe said. ""We want to do it faithfully for the employee and whatever country they are coming to or are leaving from."" While the industry remained hopeful about their discussions with the Department of Immigration, Mr Barrowcliffe said they were also upskilling local stuff to partly pre-empt the looming shortage. However, with the situation of New Zealand shearers heading to Australia, he believed there was a 'bigger reluctance' from workers due to the increasing coronavirus cases in Australia. ""We are a very family-orientated industry, so once you move away from your family at the moment, you can't just pop back quickly if something happens, and the family coming first is definitely keeping a few people at home,"" he said. ""They are just not prepared to risk their own communities or risk not being able to attend and event if something happened."" The Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment said in a statement provided to the ABC that WoolProducers Australia (WPA) and the National Farmers' Federation (NFF) hade identified the need for more than 480 seasonal New Zealand shearers and shedhands for July-November. ""The department recognises that the wool industry traditionally uses a mobile pool of workers, including a group that moves from New Zealand to Australia for a substantial proportion of its workers and that extended delays to shearing can pose serious problems with regard to animal welfare, on top of the commercial impact for wool producers,"" the statement said. WPA and the NFF are seeking support for New Zealand shearers and shedhands to enter Australia using exemptions from the Australian Border Force Commissioner. In the statement, the Department of Agriculture said, at this point in time with Australia's borders closed, the only means to get workers in is for travellers to seek an exemption from the Australian Border Force Commissioner based on those workers providing critical skills. ""Ultimately it is the decision of the Australian Border Force Commissioner as to whether or not to approve a border exemption."" The movement of workers between different states is governed by state health directions, the statement said. ""It is important that potential workers and employers understand those requirements before they seek to travel."" ""Feedback from industry to the department is that recent border closures are, in general, being managed well and not causing significant difficulties.""

19,"The African-Australian community is suffering a crisis of confidence, and one community leader is working to solve it",society,"  Ballarat's African community is punching above its weight — it just doesn't realise it The African-Australian community in Victoria's Ballarat punches above its weight, but the community itself struggles to realise its own potential. The president of the Ballarat African Association (BAA), Michael Akindeju, knows how much African-Australians contribute to the local community. But Dr Akindeju says the community itself is suffering from a shortage of self-esteem and he wants to change that. ""We are punching above our weight, nominally,"" he said. ""But that is not what the community is reflecting."" The BAA started 15 years ago and now has more than 1,200 members hailing from 14 different African countries. ""Most of our people here locally in Ballarat are professionals,"" Dr Akindeju said. ""We have a large portion of our population that work in daycare, in the primary healthcare sector … medical doctors, we have professional engineers, only a few really are unemployed."" Dr Akindeju said stereotypes, casual racism and discrimination have taken a toll on the community's confidence. As an example, he spoke of a community member who had run a successful business in Africa, hand-making shoes, but since arriving in Ballarat in 2013 has not felt he could set up and run the same business. When asked why, Dr Akindeju said the man worried his product would not be seen as being up to Australian standards and there was not a path to foster his enterprising ambitions. The stereotype of the African migrant as a low-paid, poorly-educated worker — and not as the entrepreneurial, self-assured businessman — has created a self-fulfilling prophecy which Dr Akindeju has intended to break. ""It's had a great impact on self-identity and self-esteem,"" he said. ""The reflections that the community would give back to us will still be the stereotype … they have battered the self-worth and self-image of our people."" This problem is something the community is solving themselves by running a series of workshops to help community members to develop a sense of purpose. In doing so Dr Akindeju hopes it will ""rebrand the African identity"" in the community. The workshops will pair career and financial advice with the more existential tasks of developing a long-term ambition to strive towards. Dr Akindeju expects these workshops to succeed because, crucially, they are being planned and run by the community itself. ""To date, programmes have been designed and have been run by agencies and governments in Ballarat, for Africans, and have not acknowledged adequately the nuances of our culture,"" he said. ""And so mostly, what you find is that they are just ticking the boxes — but that is not sufficient. ""It doesn't lead to sustainable developments."" A key part of the BAA workshops is promoting the stories of exceptional community members, like 23-year-old Lamourette Folly. Ms Folly was born in a refugee camp in Benin, a small country in Africa's Gulf of Guinea, after her family travelled there from neighbouring Togo. She spent the first 11 years of her life there. ""When we came to Australia there was another culture that we had to try and circulate our life around,"" Ms Folly said. ""And the Australian culture was immensely different to our culture."" But this has not tempered her ambition. Ms Folly is currently studying a master's degree in international tourism and hotel management, but also wants to be a journalist, having studied that field as well. ""I haven't let identity stop my path in life,"" she said. Ms Folly wants to empower other young people in her community, including her younger brothers. ""One thing African kids have in common is competition,"" she said. ""You know, I keep telling them [my brothers], 'If you do a diploma, I'll do my bachelor's; if you do your bachelor's, I'm going to do my master's; if you go and do your master's, I will do my PhD'. ""So we keep trying to better each other. ""Because I see, if I do better, the younger kids in our community are going to look at me and say, 'Oh, Lamourette is doing that — why can't I do it?'""

20,73 millionaires did not pay a cent in tax — but it wasn't all through negative gearing,society," Updated 
    
      July 20, 2020 10:02:29 Seventy-three millionaires paid no tax in 2017-18, while Australia's richest people live in Sydney's Double Bay, on average earning more than 16 times the nation's poorest, who live in central-west Queensland.  The latest taxation statistics for 2017-18 are based on the tax returns of 14.3 million Australians. Seven of the nation's average highest earning postcodes are in NSW, while six of the lowest earning postcodes are in Queensland.  There were 73 Australians who earned more than $1 million in the 2017-18 financial year that did not pay a cent of income tax, up from 69 the year before. Negative gearing remains a popular tax break. More than 1.3 million of the nation's 2.2 million landlords declared a net loss on their investment properties. Almost 1.8 million of those landlords had a mortgage on their property and were claiming interest deductions — that is about 80 per cent of property investors. Postcode 2028, Double Bay, had the highest average taxable income, at $242,428. The second average highest earners, with an average taxable income of $198,828, live in postcode 2027, taking in Sydney harbourside suburbs Darling Point, Edgecliff, HMAS Rushcutters and Point Piper.  The third average highest, earning $196,816, reside in Melbourne's postcode 3142, taking in Hawksburn and Toorak. DOVER HEIGHTS, HMAS WATSON, ROSE BAY NORTH, VAUCLUSE, WATSONS BAY The nation's poorest income earners reside in mostly small towns in Queensland. Postcode 4732, which takes in Muttaburra and Tablederry in central-west Queensland, has the lowest average taxable income in the country at $14,681.  This was followed by postcode 4426, including Jackson, Jackson North and Jackson South, with an average income of $19,396. And third lowest was NSW's 2308 — the Newcastle University, Callaghan area — with an average income of $21,054. ERRINUNDRA, MANORINA, CLUB TERRACE, COMBIENBAR, BEMM RIVER, CABBAGE TREE CREEK, BELLBIRD CREEK $27,617 The 2017-18 statistics also cover average taxable income by occupation and state. Medical practitioners again dominated the highest earning occupations, much like the year before. Surgeons on average made $402,582 in taxable income.  Anaesthetists filled the second spot with an average income of $382,674, and internal medicine specialists came in third with an average income of $301,129. Financial dealers took fourth place with an average income of $272,895, while psychiatrists took fifth place with an average income of $225,206. The lowest-earning professions were dominated by hospitality, with farm work and baggage handlers also featuring. Fast-food cooks are the lowest earners (average income $18,608), followed by hospitality employees ($19,102), hospitality apprentices or trainees ($19,431), farmers ($20,089), farm, forestry or garden workers, apprentices or trainees ($20,686), and baggage handlers ($22,244).  There were 14,907 Australians who declared a total income of more than $1 million in 2017-18. Combined, they reported $37.4 billion of income — an average of just over $2.5 million each — and collectively paid $15.9 billion in tax, a total tax rate around 42.5 per cent.  However, out of that millionaire group, the data also show 73 paid no net tax in 2017-18. For 54 of those millionaire earners, that was because they had enough deductions to lower their taxable income below the tax-free threshold of $18,200. For whatever reason, one other million-dollar earner fell below the threshold but still paid $721 in tax that year. A further 19 people who earned more than $1 million that year declared taxable incomes above the tax-free threshold but still managed to avoid paying tax, presumably due to various offsets and rebates. The statistics suggest this is a generous group, at least in terms of donations and gifts that are tax deductible, which totalled just over $1.4 billion and made up almost three-quarters of the gap between total and taxable incomes. Negative gearing property does not seem to be a strategy favoured by this ultra-high earning group, with net rental losses of just $121.3 million claimed between them, and a modest rental profit of almost $20 million reported overall. The Australia Institute's senior research fellow David Richardson said it wasn't just millionaires getting away with tax minimisation. The data also shows that more than 2,000 people earning between $100,000 and $1 million per year succeeded in paying no income tax. ""Australia's tax system is shot full of expensive and inequitable loopholes,"" Mr Richardson said. ""A key principle of a fair tax system is that people with similar incomes should pay similar amounts of tax, but in Australia that principle seems to have been completely abandoned. ""There are people on the minimum wage paying more tax than people with million-dollar incomes.""  The average landlord reported just over $21,000 in rental income, with around $13,300 in interest payments, more than $3,400 in capital works and more than $10,100 in ""other deductions"". The median, or typical, landlord received less rental income but also had a much smaller loan and other expense claim.  Of the 1.3 million landlords reporting net losses, the average was $9,156 and the median was $5,670. Part of the difference between the median and average reflects the fact that the median landlord only holds one investment property, while the average is skewed higher by those who own two or more. Nowhere is the difference between the median, representing the typical person, and the average, skewed by the wealth, more apparent than in share investing. Of the just over 2.8 million people who declared they had received franked dividends, the median payment was just $557, while the average was more than 15 times higher at $8,743. Likewise for the tax credits associated with receiving franked dividends, which were typically worth $240, while the average was $3,634. This distinction between the median and average sharpened further when it comes to capital gains, or the profits from selling investment assets. Of the slightly more than three-quarters of a million taxpayers who reported a net capital gain in 2017-18, the median was just $2,290. The average was $30,794, meaning relatively few people made some very large gains.  Want to find out how much your neighbours earn? Search for your postcode in the ATO database below. Median income is what the middle, or typical, person in your area earns.  The average is generally skewed higher by those whose who earn a lot more than what the typical person does. All of these are ""taxable"" incomes, meaning after any deductions for things like work-related expenses, managing tax affairs or offsetting losses, such as those from negative gearing property. If your postcode is missing, it is probably because the ATO has only included postcodes in this table where at least 200 people filed tax returns, which also explains why none of the lowest income areas in the table above do not appear in this table, because they all had fewer than 200 taxpayers filing returns.

21,What should life look like after this? Our top writers share their hopes for post-COVID Australia,society,"  While we're not exactly sure when and how this pandemic will end, things are slowly beginning to return to a semblance of normalcy in Australia. But do we want normal? What can we learn from this time of great instability and slowdown; from long stretches spent away from our loved ones and our workplaces? And what about the future of those people and sectors — including the arts — so adversely impacted by the lockdown? Do you love books? So do we! Join our Facebook group to talk books — with each other, with specialists from across the ABC and with your favourite authors. As social distancing restrictions shift and we reorientate ourselves once again, ABC RN's The Book Show asked five prominent Australian novelists — adept at imagining different worlds and ways of being — about the kind of country they'd like to see on the other side of this pandemic. ""We've been given an opportunity to change our ways. It's a warning of sorts,"" says Noongar novelist Kim Scott, reflecting on both the summer's bushfires and the current pandemic. Scott sees this as a chance for ""reweaving our moral fibre"" and restructuring our society around social justice and equality in education, health and housing. The two-time winner of the Miles Franklin Award (for That Deadman Dance in 2011 and Benang in 1999) says that there were moments during the pandemic when he thought we were moving in that direction. ""[But] my sense of that opportunity has been derailed by the callous destruction of a significant site in the Pilbara,"" says Scott. During National Reconciliation Week, mining giant Rio Tinto detonated explosives which destroyed two 46,000-year-old rock shelters. ""Something in the intimacy and connection and the common concerns of humanity [that we'd developed during the pandemic] was just destroyed in that explosion,"" says Scott. His optimism was also shaken by the death of George Floyd, which sparked a wave of renewed Black Lives Matter protests in the United States. Protests in Australia followed, focussing on Indigenous deaths in police custody. ""Racism, and the refusal to acknowledge it, is a problem here in Australia and the cause of a big divide,"" the writer says. Tune in for author interviews and news from across the book world. Scott's 2017 novel Taboo told the story of a community reckoning with an historical massacre of Noongar people. But for Scott, a post-pandemic Australia needs to go beyond acknowledgement. ""We need to think about rebuilding in the interests of social justice, starting at the foundations,"" he says. He says that that foundation should be the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which would ensure that First Nations voices are heard and centred in the rebuild. Alice Pung is a journalist, essayist and writer who has often explored racism in her writing — including in her young adult novel Laurinda and her award-winning memoirs Her Father's Daughter and Unpolished Gem. Pung says that Asian Australians have often been viewed as ""the model minority"" — which has meant that their problems haven't always been recognised — but that the pandemic has both fuelled and drawn attention to racism against Asian Australians. ""So I guess it's been a very eye-opening time for everyone,"" she says. ""Yet having grown up in a quite rough suburb, and having lived experiences of sometimes quite physical racism, I can assure you that there's an underlying tide [of racism in Australia] that the wrong kind of political stoking could ignite."" Pung's family have been a major support to her during the pandemic. ""I hope [out of this] we recognise the importance of extended families, especially the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren,"" she says. Through the pandemic, Pung has been educating her children from home, giving her a new appreciation for the work of teachers. ""I hope that post-pandemic we will understand, appreciate and imagine all the things that teachers do during a day to occupy our children,"" she says. Anna Funder is a Miles Franklin award-winning novelist (All That I Am, 2012) as well as the author of internationally acclaimed nonfiction novel Stasiland. Like Pung, Funder says she was struck by how much we've relied on teachers through the pandemic, as well as health workers — workforces that are largely female, underpaid and insecure. ""What I really hope coming out of this is that they are paid [better] for that work,"" she says. ""[And that] the incredible skill and the incredible emotional intelligence it takes to do [that work] is valued … [instead of being] undervalued because of the feminisation of those workforces."" Funder — like many writers — is used to working remotely, but she's had two of her children learning from home during the pandemic too. She's observed that conversations around home-schooling have been led by mothers. ""The women were trying to work at the same time as they juggled the work of running a household — which primarily falls to them — as well as additionally … the work of homeschooling,"" Funder says. She's hoping the pandemic has made women's work more visible, which might result in more equitable domestic workloads. ""[I] hope for some more permanent gender recognition of what goes on in feminised workplaces, outside the home and within the home,"" Funder says. Stella Prize-winner Heather Rose's latest novel, Bruny, is about a family fight that also happens to be a political fight, over a bridge between Tasmania and Bruny Island. ""I've been thinking a great deal about what the world might look like beyond 2020. And how we might shape a future that works better for all of us,"" says Rose. ""I think COVID-19 has given us a really interesting shift in values. We've been able to see what makes our communities work and what doesn't."" Rose is concerned by job losses due to the coronavirus shutdown, as well as future job losses brought on by increasing automation. ""It's time to bring in a universal basic income that protects our most vulnerable,"" she says. The future of the environment is also on Rose's mind. ""I am really saddened by the fact that we have allowed our natural resources to be dug up and shipped out,"" she says. ""That has made a lot of mining companies and a lot of magnates very rich … [but] it's done nothing for the long-term wellbeing of Australia, as we face the challenges of life with dwindling resources."" Moving forward, Rose would like to see a ""sovereign wealth tax"" on the extraction of minerals and resources, the proceeds of which would be used to fund health, education and renewable energy. ""I would also like to see us give very serious consideration to agricultural security and biosecurity into the future,"" she says. ""If we really do want to move forward, we've got to lead more mindful lives, and we need our solitude. We need our sabbaths,"" says writer and human rights advocate Arnold Zable. Zable's beloved 2001 novel Cafe Scheherazade was set in a St Kilda cafe that became a local institution, and Zable says that during the pandemic he's been spending more time in his neighbourhood. ""We've gone perhaps from the global to the local,"" he says. The author has been taking long walks and conversing more regularly with his neighbours. ""It's triggered memories of past times when … people have been more open to each other."" But Zable acknowledges that these simple pleasures are not universal, pointing to the situation of refugees in Australian immigration detention. ""We have to become more conscious of the need to be advocates for a society in which we truly do care for each other, and a society that really tackles structural inequalities,"" he says. Zable recently released an essay collection titled The Watermill, which includes four stories — from across the globe — that explore trauma, memory and resilience. ""Thinking about the post-COVID-19 future, I think it's important to focus on what we've gone through, and not to forget it.""

22,Birpai woman leading campaign to remove statue of Edmund Barton from burial site,society,"  Campaign grows against statue of first Australian PM Edmund Barton at Aboriginal burial site in NSW Thousands of people have signed a petition demanding the removal of a statue of Australia's first prime minister, Sir Edmund Barton, from a traditional burial site in NSW. Port Macquarie's Historical Society President agrees the statue is in an inappropriate place Port Macquarie woman Arlene Mehan, of the Mid North Coast's Birpai people, is leading the campaign to force Port Macquarie-Hastings Council to move the statue from Town Green park on the banks of the Hastings River. The seven-day-old petition has more than 2,100 signatures and comes amid global action by the Black Lives Matter movement to tear down statues of white historical figures. Ms Mehan said the Barton statue had always been an issue with her family. ""You wouldn't put a statue of Hitler in a Jewish space, so it's been a bit of a thorn,"" she said. ""It's a burial site and you're putting a figure of white Australia on an Aboriginal burial site — it's just not appropriate."" The statue of Australia's first prime minister is close to a small monument on the burial site. ""Everyone knows that statue but not everybody knows the monument to the burial site, which is located only 10 metres from that statue,"" Ms Mehan said. Remains at the burial site are more than 1,800 years old, she said. ""As a Birpai woman, I'm looking for something to dismantle in the local community that represents racism and the statue does,"" she said. ""Consider what this statue means for us as a community and what message we are giving to, not only members of the community, but visitors as well. ""It brings up a lot of trauma for people, how we glorify these figures."" Ms Mehan said she would present the petition to the council and was open to talks on the statue's future. ""The onus is on the council, who had put it there without community consultation in the first place in 2001, the onus is on the council to remove it,"" she said. Port Macquarie Historical Society President Clive Smith said he there was ""absolutely no reason"" it could not be moved. ""In some ways, as being Australia's first prime minister and a connection with the area, maybe it is appropriate to have a statue of him somewhere in the vicinity but probably not at that location,"" he said. An ABC-wide initiative to reflect, listen and build on the shared national identity of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Sir Edmund, a member of the Protectionist Party, was a local state MP before federation in 1901 when he became the nation's first PM. He played a key role in drafting the national constitution and his government passed the Immigration Restriction Act, forerunner to the White Australia policy. He later became a founding member of the High Court. ""I can see why it would not be considered appropriate by probably a good percentage of the population when he was one of the authors of the constitution, which basically wrote the Aborigines out,"" Mr Smith said. ""I don't have any particular opinion on statues except that I often think there are too many statues to dead white men whose achievements get reviewed from time to time and are perhaps not as great as they were once thought to be."" The Port Macquarie-Hastings Council said it was not appropriate to comment on a petition it had not received.

23,Family of five receive new bushfire recovery 'pod' home just in time for winter,society,"  Family hit by bushfires on Mid-North coast score first six-person pod to house them while they rebuild The first of around 200 six-person pods providing semi-permanent homes for bushfire-ravaged families has been delivered to a family of five on the New South Wales Mid-Morth coast. The Disaster Recovery Minister, Deputy Premier John Barilaro, was on the Willis family's property at Yarranbella, west of Macksville, to hand over the keys. Carpenter Patrick Willis said the 12-metre dwelling would be a welcome change from camping out. ""It's been a bit cosy in the camper trailer, a bit cool at night, so the pod's going to be very helpful,"" he said. ""It's been a bit of fun really, the camping part of it — but it's wearing thin now."" The shack they had bought, just before their property was devastated by fire, was to be home until they built a house. ""I don't mind the camping but it's hard work for Karly with the kids,"" Mr Willis said. ""You know what kids are like — it gets pretty muddy out here and coming into winter it's been some chilly nights of late, so it will be a bit nicer to be out of the camper and into something with hard walls."" At the height of the bushfires, Mr Willis' parents also lost their home to fire on the South Coast. ""On New Year's Day, got the phone call that my family home where I grew up — where my brother, his kids, my parents live, had also burnt,"" Mr Willis said. ""It took the wind out of our sails. I'd had enough"" The arrival of the pod coincided with the day of their second wedding anniversary. ""I would like to say I went to a lot of trouble to organise this to land on today, but it's just a bit of good luck,"" Mr Willis said. ""But she deserves some good luck. ""I can turn our skeleton of the house back into a job site and get things out of the way so I can work in there a bit more comfortably and easier."" Mr Willis said he was most looking forward to not having to fill a cast iron bath everyday. ""Just not having to light a fire and wait for two hours to get some hot water is pretty cool,"" he said. ""Washing machine's a big one, we have a lot of dirty clothes out here with little kids.""

24,"Using ropework, recycled pots and intuition to build a suburban garden empire",society,"  Succulents, traditional ropework and sustainable materials create garden haven for retired couple There is love in the air at the sparkling suburban garden belonging to Anna Sofocleous and her partner, Nick Skourmallas. The retired Wollongong couple, who exhibit and sell a range of succulent plants in pots in their back garden, have found comfort in their self-isolation, even when customers have been stroppy about self-distancing. The busy hobbyists produce an array of gifts, mostly using recycled and salvaged sustainable materials like old teapots, discarded jewellery and clippings from Mr Skourmallas's aunt's garden. Ms Sofocleous sits on the back porch of an afternoon, patiently creating macramé potholders, an airy change from the aged care facility where she spends mornings with her mum. ""When I retired, I became interested in the idea of doing more hand crafts whilst I was taking care of my elderly mum, and I found macramé,"" she said. ""I sit every day, talking to my mum, doing my macramé ... listening to her stories, and it became a hobby and I'm enjoying it."" Ms Sofocleous took up macramé, a form of traditional ropework using knots, four years ago. What she couldn't remember from the 1970s, she learnt by watching YouTube videos. Want more local news? Sign up to the ABC Illawarra weekly email newsletter ""I started to remember, and then I started putting it together myself. There are only basic instructions on YouTube and then you just have to figure it out yourself,"" she said. When she first started, it took close to six hours to make one macramé potholder, but now she is whipping them out by the hour. ""It was really difficult, and I was going to give up,"" she said. Sometimes Ms Sofocleous includes beads in her designs, which, like all her other materials, she picks up for very little cost. ""I cut up salvaged necklaces,"" she said. She recommends cotton rope but warns that nothing lasts forever, especially recyclable, sustainable materials. ""macramé doesn't last forever. It gets very dusty. Because it's a natural fabric the weather will, within five years, rot it. It will fall to bits."" Mr Skourmallas is responsible for the succulents that go into pots, as well as a vast assortment of other plants in his 30-year-old garden. ""When I bought this house there were only three rocks around the letterbox. That was the garden and I've put in all this garden myself,"" he said. His friends, neighbours and Greek aunties have helped him out a lot. ""When I go and re-pot their pots, they say, 'take whatever you like, Nick,' so sometimes I come home with six or seven bags ... full. ""I go walking every day and old people call me over. Sometimes I have to call Anna with the car, I've got that much,"" he said. ""There is so much you can propagate on your own. You can make your own, and it's never ending."" He is an old-fashioned gardener, relying on sunshine, clean water and intuition. ""Stick your clipping in the dirt, not too deep, and keep it moist and out of the sun for the first few weeks,"" he said. He knows within two weeks whether a plant is likely to survive or not. ""It will let you know. It will either change colour, the stem may rot, it will fall down, or you'll see the new shoots coming. By four weeks it's ready to sell,"" he said. As customers queue two by two to peruse and purchase the plants, Ms Sofocleous delights in her achievements. ""If you go searching, you'll find a lot of recyclable stuff. People can do this. There's so much out there, and you can actually do it yourself.""

25,Quaden Bayles's family nominates six charities to redirect Disneyland money after declining chance of a trip to US,society,"  Quaden Bayles's family nominates six charities to redirect Disneyland money The family of Quaden Bayles has nominated six charities that public donations intended for his trip to Disneyland in the US will now be given to. The nine-year-old Brisbane boy captured the hearts of the world after a six-minute video clip of him crying and threatening self-harm from a school bullying episode was posted on Facebook last week by his mother, Yarraka. US comedian Brad Williams, who set up a GoFundMe page on February 21, raised more than $700,000 with the intention of sending Quaden to the theme park in Anaheim, California. Like Quaden, Mr Williams has achondroplasia, the same genetic disorder that results in dwarfism But the family wants to target ""the real issue"" and believes the money will be better spent in support of those affected by bullying. ""We want the money to go to community organisations that really need it,"" Yarraka Bayles told NITV. ""As much as we want to go to Disneyland, I think our community would far off benefit from that."" The six charities named were Dwarfism Awareness Australia, Gallang Place, Dolly's Dream and the Balunu Foundation in Australia, and Born This Way Foundation and STOMP Out Bullying in the US. They will receive $100,000 each, with the remaining funds going to Quaden to cover ""direct medical help, education, accommodation costs, food to feed the family"", plus other charities that he may later choose. Under GoFundMe's terms, all donated funds are ""solely for the purpose you have stated on and in connection with your campaign"". Mr Williams said that anyone who had given money with the intention of sending Quaden to Disneyland will have until March 12 to get a full refund if they wish. ""I have been in close communication with Quaden's family and fully respect their needs and the needs of Australian First Nations people who are experiencing bullying and discrimination at extremely high rates,"" Mr Williams wrote in a statement issued by the family. His aunt Mundanara Bayles told NITV News that Quaden was initially excited at the prospect of visiting Disneyland. ""What kid wouldn't want to go to Disneyland, especially if you have lived Quaden's life,"" she said. ""But my sister said 'you know what, let's get back to the real issue'. We want the money to go to community organisations that really need it."" Three days after his bullying episode emerged online, Quaden was invited to lead out the NRL's Indigenous All Stars onto the field for their game against the Maori All Stars at Robina Stadium on the Gold Coast last Saturday night.

26,Documenting the plight of China's 7 million 'left-behind' children,society,"  Documenting the plight of China's 7 million 'left-behind' children 相关中文文章 The birth of Perth-based photographer Tami Xiang in the 1980s bankrupted her family in China. As the fourth born in the family, Tami's arrival under the one-child policy led to a fine that not only ran their finances dry but also left a huge debt her father, the family's breadwinner, had to work for years to pay off. ""I rarely saw my father when I was little but I was lucky to have my mother around all the time,"" Tami said. Her father was a bricklayer who was away most of the time building bridges and houses, while Tami and her siblings were left at home in their mother's hands. Many children in rural China share a similar experience to Tami. The sheer number of children growing up with either one parent or under the guardianship of their grandparents is so big in China the group has been dubbed ""the left-behind"". According to Government estimates, as of 2018 China had nearly 7 million children ""left behind"" in rural areas while both parents worked in big cities to support the family. The rural-urban wealth divide and the rigid household registration policy, which limits the free migration of the population in China, have given rise to the phenomenon. Over the past decade, Tami has photographed more than 300 ""left-behind"" children and their families in rural China for her work Peasantography, a visual documentary of the ""left-behind"" generation. Jie Fei, 22, was one of the children featured in Xiang's project. He told the ABC he now rarely contacts his parents. ""We haven't spoken much for many years. We started to quarrel whenever we tried to talk to each other, so we just gave up on talking if [there was] nothing important,"" he said. ""I know many people are in a similar position with me, with parents working away and being brought up by grandparents. ""But what I can't let go of is parents of others at least come back home every Spring Festival. My parents haven't come back for 10 years. They care too much about money."" Mr Jie's mother, Wu Fen, is now close to retiring from her job at a steel mill in Zhuhai, Guangdong province. ""I don't have a long break during Spring Festival in our factory. The production doesn't stop. I'm too busy and tired,"" said Ms Wu, explaining why she doesn't go home during the break. ""I took care of my child until he was 12 before I went to Zhuhai. It felt difficult to part with him. He had to attend school in our hometown and we were quite poor at that time. ""He also doesn't like it here [in Guangdong]. We asked him to come over for Spring Festival, he said he's busy."" The Spring Festival, which falls on January 25 this year, is the most widely celebrated festival in China and considered an important occasion for families to get together. Many parents of the ""left-behind"" go home to join their family. It is estimated that over 3 billion people are expected to travel between January 10 and February 28. Wei Jiayu, director of New Citizen Project, an NGO which aims to improve the living environment for migrant children who move with their parents to the big cities, said one key reason children were ""left behind"" was because they were unable to get enrolled in public schools in the cities. Private schools were usually also not an option because families did not have enough money to pay the tuition fees. ""Being 'left behind' will lead to a lack of companionship which is going to hinder children's psychological development,"" Mr Wei said. ""After they grow up, they will have a stronger need for intimate relationships. Also, their insecurity will make them have little trust in others."" Tami Xiang came to Australia in 2011 as an interpreter working for a mining company in Perth and started her study of photography soon after. She used to think being ""left behind"" was nothing special until she was struck by the contrast once she started working as a family portrait photographer in Perth and saw what typical Australian families were like. Tami said she believed children growing up ""left behind"" suffered a series of problems such as ""educational, mental health, safety and social"" issues and she intended to raise greater awareness of their plight with her work. ""They were brought up by grandparents who [themselves] received little education and had to quickly fit into the fast-developing modern society once they grew up,"" Tami said.

27,'They don't pay real money out': Geoffrey would lose $160 in 10 minutes from his phone,society,"  Calls for 'social casinos' to be regulated as Australians lose thousands in growing industry It took only a few weeks before Geoffrey Pelham became hooked playing games on the Big Fish Casino app where he would spend $800 in a matter of minutes. Every day, the 58-year-old would spend at least an hour playing virtual slot machine games on his mobile phone. ""They give you free chips when you first sign up to suck you in,"" the Perth-based fly-in-fly-out miner told the ABC. Once the chips ran out, he had to start paying. ""I used to pay $160 for 80 million chips and then lose it all in 10 minutes,"" he said. All up he said he spent thousands on the game and won nothing in return. ""They don't pay real money out. All you do is win virtual chips,"" he said. Games like Big Fish Casino are not traditional gambling — they're part of an unregulated grey area known as ""social casinos"". The app-based products simulate casino games such as blackjack, roulette and slot machines but players can never cash out their virtual chips for money. While social casinos are relatively new, it has become a multibillion-dollar industry. Australian are the world's biggest gambling losers per capita, losing more than $1,200 every year. According to the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, Australian spent a total of $25 billion on gambling in 2017-2018. Dr Christopher Hunt from the University of Sydney's Gambling Treatment Clinic said social casino games appeared to be increasing rapidly in Australia, while participation in traditional forms of gambling was declining rapidly. ""Some of these games are being played by people in their spare time, like on the bus or on their way to work,"" he said. ""A lot of companies that have previously focused on traditional forms of gambling are moving into more internet-based and social media types of gambling."" In 2017, Australian gaming giant Aristocrat bought the Seattle-based Big Fish Games digital arm for $1.3 billion. Online casino games are illegal in Australia but social casinos fall into a grey area. They are classified as entertainment so are not subject to any gambling regulations. Independent Federal MP Andrew Wilkie wants that changed, and said he would push the Federal Government to act this year. ""This is gambling and anyone who tries to tell you it's not is wrong,"" Mr Wilkie said. ""In my opinion, these should be regulated in Australia in exactly the same way as mainstream online casino games and that's to ban them."" Aristocrat refused to comment, instead referring the ABC to the International Social Games Association (ISGA). ISGA chief executive Luc Delaney argued social casino games were ""purely for entertainment"". Mr Delaney said despite heavy scrutiny in recent times, no new regulation of social casino-themed games had been adopted — either under gambling or consumer protection laws. ""That's because casino-themed social games offer no opportunity to win money, or anything of value. ""Video games, including social games, fall under a range of consumer protection regulations as do all forms of digital entertainment, which we believe is appropriate."" Geoff still plays the slot machine games using free chips Big Fish Casino occasionally gives him. But he says he never pays to play any more. ""I'm glad I saw the light a couple of years ago.""

28,How one beloved video store defies the streaming era to keep thriving after 40 years,society,"  Video store survives streaming era with big library, personal picks, and new technology — to a point Defying the trend of video shops closing their doors, one store in Thirroul, the longest-serving business in town, has survived for almost 40 years. The owners share their secrets of success. At 78, John Wallace is looking forward to retirement and his wife, Marion, says she isn't far behind him. As a young couple 37 years ago, the Wallaces stepped into an exciting new entertainment industry opening doors into a glamourous world with Hollywood appeal. In the early 80s the film hire business was a thrilling place to be. Now their amassed film collection holds treasures available both on VHS and DVD. Mr Wallace says he's enjoyed the ride immensely. ""The customers are pretty good here. When we first started, we knew everybody in Thirroul but it's a different kettle of fish now,"" he said. People say ""You're like family to us"" and you know everybody has watched us grow old too."" Mr Wallace worked at the blast furnaces in Wollongong's steelworks for 27 years but in 1982, when he found himself redeployed and unhappy, a video hire shop opened in Wollongong changing his life. ""We used to go there and hire VHS and Beta movies. It used to be packed. Being a local Thirroul fellow I looked around and found our first shop,"" he said. ""It was fantastic. From the word go, we had people hanging out the doors. When one person left another one could come in because it was very small. ""We were there four years, but we just ran out of room."" To stock shelves they signed up with Leading Edge, a buyer's group, and 30 years later they are the only Leading Edge shop left between Thirroul and the Victorian border. ""I heard there's one in Newtown, and a few places outback where they haven't got the internet,"" Mr Wallace said. As the years passed the couple were rewarded by the industry with invitations to national and international conferences. The party environment presented opportunities to mix boozy days and nights with Hollywood stars. ""We'd go to conferences in Los Angeles. It was fabulous. They provided lots of booze and actors we could talk to. It was great,"" Ms Wallace said. When DVDs became popular, the business was ready with a good selection. But after 20 years they still have more than 1,000 VHS tapes in stock, which are selling and still hiring out with surprising regularity. Ms Wallace still watches VHS films at home. ""I've got 40 at home that I've been watching to see what condition they are in, and they are in great condition! They used to preview about six movies before the movie,"" she said. When the business started selling VHS titles, horror films were the first to go. ""We couldn't get enough horror, we had no trouble selling horror. I imagine when we sell the DVDs, the horror collection will go first,"" Mr Wallace said. While streaming services spelt the death knell for video shops, it was not the only threat to the movie hire industry. ""Even the local library has cut our throat, they've got free video hire,"" Mr Wallace said. But the couple attribute their ongoing success to their vast film collection. With shelves of classic foreign movies, Australian movies, and British comedies, there are thousands of titles to choose from. ""We have hung onto everything from the past. We class ourselves as a library. A lot of shops sell films if they aren't moving and put something else in, but we kept all our stock,"" Mr Wallace said. Ms Wallace is happy helping people choose their films. ""They trust me. I can go from classics to foreign films to fabulous films from the past few years. I'm not big on comedies,"" she said. Lucky then that Mr Wallace is. ""I'm big on British comedies, Monty Python-type stuff,"" he said. Son Ben Wallace also works at the shop, and both parents rely upon his film expertise and business management acumen. Ms Wallace proudly shares her critique of films with him so that he can pass on her recommendations in her absence. ""He will say to a customer 'My mum loved this, you'll love it too',"" she said. Her favourite movie of the year? Green Book, and it's Mr Wallace's favourite too. ""I recommend it all the time, everybody loves it,"" Mr Wallace said. New releases, which used to be the biggest seller, have declined in sales and surprisingly TV series are the big hirers for binge watching. ""Once they start they'll try a couple of seasons and get hooked, then that's it, they go through the lot,"" Mr Wallace said. Ms Wallace says hiring movies from a bricks-and-mortar store still has charm. ""We've got customers who come in with their children because they want them to experience this,"" she said. ""They don't have Netflix, so they just like to come in here and choose their movies as a family."" But as for those heady days of standing-room only in the shop, they are probably over. ""It used to be a meeting place, here on a Saturday night but I don't think those days will come back,"" Ms Wallace sighed.

29,analysis: Why many in China support Beijing's policies in Xinjiang and Hong Kong,society,"  Why many in China support Beijing's policies in Xinjiang and Hong Kong 阅读中文版本 At a reunion dinner with my best friends from university last month, we got into a heated discussion on Beijing's mass repression in Xinjiang and the protests in Hong Kong. My friend Adrian, who was born and raised in Xinjiang, said he didn't feel any sympathy for the Uyghurs detained in camps there. It shocked us that he said it just like he was talking about something ordinary. The China Cables leak of highly classified documents reveals the scale of Beijing's repressive control over Xinjiang, where more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups are detained. ""None of you ever lived in Xinjiang, and most of the Western reporters who write about Xinjiang have never been there in person,"" he said. Of course, you can imagine how badly my other friends criticised his view. He eventually left earlier than us. He wondered why everyone thought they knew the place better than him. As a Chinese-born journalist who has covered Beijing's repression of Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang for more than a year, I come across many different views on Beijing's use of re-education camps every day. However, that dinner was the first time I had been confronted by such divisive views in my personal life. Many in China support human rights and democracy, however support for Beijing's often contradictory actions remains vast — so why is that the case? Recent violence in Xinjiang, and the resulting sense of insecurity, is at the core of why many people across China support Beijing's policies there. Adrian said Han Chinese, the ethnic group that make up the vast majority of mainland China's population, used to have a very close relationship with ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. But he said everything changed after riots in the regional capital Urumqi in 2009, where nearly 200 people — most of them Han Chinese — were killed after a mob of more than 1,000 Uyghurs took to the streets. The riots that led to some of China's worst ethnic violence and set the wheels in motion for today's internment camps in Xinjiang began in the most unlikely of places. The riots started as a protest against the killing of two Uyghur migrant workers at a toy factory in China's south-east but escalated after police allegedly used excessive force to disperse demonstrators (however, Beijing disputes this). ""Han people were living in fear and insecurity, we were very dissatisfied with the local government's inaction, and even protested several times,"" Adrian said. ""Later, a large number of armed police were transferred from other provinces to Xinjiang … Their [presence], and now the camps, really made Xinjiang the safest place to live on earth."" Associate Professor Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang's history and politics at the Australian National University, said there was undoubtedly a sense of fear and insecurity in Urumqi after the riots. However, he said this affected both Han and Uyghur people. ""Authorities began house-to-house sweeps of Uyghur neighbourhoods, arresting and in some cases disappearing those believed to have taken any part in the violence,"" Dr Clarke said. He said Han Chinese mobs, which assembled in the days after the riots and also clashed with police, were not treated in the same way by authorities. Over an uncountable number of official statements and state media news reports, Beijing has described both Uyghurs and the demonstrators in Hong Kong as ""separatists"", who are seeking to ""undermine China's sovereignty"". This has created a huge stir in mainland China, where people take the subject of the country's sovereignty very seriously. Chinese human rights lawyer Qiushi Chen attended a couple of the protests in Hong Kong this August, in a bid to separate fact from fiction in regards to the mainland news coverage of the unrest. Hong Kong was handed back to China with no framework for what would happen after the year 2047, leaving the city to carve an identity out of two ideologically opposed empires. He live-streamed the protests to his more than 1 million followers on Weibo and Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, to raise awareness of the pro-democracy movement inside China's Great Firewall. ""Most people were demonstrating in a peaceful manner, and most of them understood how biased media reports in China shaped people's perceptions of the movement,"" Mr Chen told the ABC. Soon his accounts were permanently banned, and he was called back to the mainland by authorities. He was later disqualified from practicing as a lawyer. Mr Chen said he was very concerned about the influence of social media, and the ability of pro-Beijing accounts, which he says have increased in number, to direct public opinion in China. ""It increases the chance that people consuming that media content will struggle to accept others who have different identities,"" he said. Adrian said he believed some Uyghurs had ""bad thought and ideology"", and that they ""needed to be educated"" — he thought the re-education camps helped unify people from different ethnic backgrounds in Xinjiang. But Dr Clarke from the Australian National University does not agree. ""This appears to repeat almost word-for-word [Chinese Communist Party] rhetoric,"" Dr Clarke said. ""The problem, of course, is that the idea of ethnic unity is understood almost entirely as a one-way street … Non-Han ethnic groups must increasingly conform to [the Party's] mandated vision of ethnic unity."" Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai fled mainland China as a child, reaching the island territory as a stowaway on a fishing boat. At the age of 12, he went to work in a garment factory for around $4.5 a month —  by the age of 27, he had purchased his own factory, and by his mid-30s, he had created the international fashion label Giordano. He later founded the pro-democracy Next Magazine in 1990. After the magazine published criticisms of the Chinese Communist Party, officials threatened to close Giordano stores on the mainland. Mr Lai subsequently sold out his shares in the fashion company and founded a second publication, Apple Daily, in 1995. ""Many mainland Chinese people cannot understand the feeling of having freedom, because they had never really lived in a free society,"" Mr Lai told the ABC. Since the protests kicked off in Hong Kong this year, Mr Lai has been at the forefront of the movement. ""They don't understand what Hong Kong people are fighting for. They are confused: 'If I could live my life in China like this, why can't you,'"" he said. ""Our spiritual assets are our rule of law, human rights, free market, private assets, and the lifestyle without fear, which is fundamentally different from the mainland Chinese,"" Mr Lai said. But like the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, Hongkongers have seen the things that are central to their identity — democracy and freedom — encroached on by Beijing over time. China is perpetrating a ""cultural genocide"" against Uyghurs in Xinjiang, but in Australia, they are dancing in defiance in a bid to save their culture. For example, there was a huge public backlash in 2012 when Hong Kong's government attempted to introduce pro-Communist ""Moral and National Education"" classes in schools. But not everyone sees it that way — just like how some Hongkongers feel that China doesn't understand their values, some in the pro-Beijing camp feel China is also misunderstood. Deng Fei, principal of the Heung To Secondary School and the director of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau, told the ABC the protest movement was a sign of the lack of positive stories about China in Hong Kong. The lack of positive stories is a complaint I've come across on my own WeChat account. Last month, when I shared an article I wrote on the Hong Kong protests on WeChat — which told a different story to the reports in China's state-owned media — the platform advised me that six of my friends had unfollowed me. I decided to call one of them: they said they were tired of seeing biased reports from Western media outlets, offering facts contrary to the official Beijing line.

30,'I taught him how to hold the ball': Students school Prince Edward on art of Aussie Rules,society,"  Earl of Wessex Prince Edward meets students on royal visit to the NT Despite the Earl of Wessex's decades of royal training, nothing could prepare him for a crash course in Aussie Rules football in the sizzling Top End sun. As part of a visit to Sanderson Middle School in Darwin's northern suburbs, Prince Edward, the youngest of Queen Elizabeth's children, met with young Territorians undertaking the Duke of Edinburgh Award Program. While other students showed off their footy skills, Mahlea-Jo Anderson gave the Earl a few handballing tips. ""I just taught him how to hold the ball, how to pass it to a teammate,"" she said. ""He went pretty good, but on the first go the ball just went to the floor."" She said His Royal Highness would do well to work on implementing a more orthodox handballing grip. ""A bit of accuracy,"" she added, would also not go astray. ""He was really nice, and good to talk to,"" Mahlea-Jo said. Duke of Edinburgh Award participants Chloe Ferguson and Allen Calma, who are both year 9 students, were chosen to accompany Prince Edward on his tour of the school. ""I was expecting him to be really classy and surrounded by security guards, because he's really high and really important,"" Chloe said. ""But he was really nice, he was easy to talk to. He had guards around him but not as tight as I thought it would be."" Allen said he took pride in exhibiting to the Earl the school's programs and culture. ""He's a funny person, very excited and he's ready to meet a lot of people,"" Allen said. Prince Edward's visit commemorates 60 years since the Duke of Edinburgh Award program was started under the under the auspices of his father, Prince Philip. The school tour was the final public engagement of a low-key visit that saw the Earl visit Sydney, Wollongong and the Northern Territory. A handful of locals gathered outside Government House to watch as Prince Edward was officially received and welcomed by members of Larrakia Nation, who greeted him with a smoking ceremony and traditional dance. One of those locals, self-confessed royalist Marie Louise Pearson, even swapped jokes with the Earl across the fence. ""I said: 'Look up Your Royal Highness!' And he did, and I've got a gorgeous photo of him smiling at me,"" Ms Pearson said. The prince's Northern Territory trip began in Alice Springs where he visited Yirara College, an Indigenous boarding school just outside the town, to meet students and volunteers taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award. He was greeted by a smoking ceremony, before Yirara students gave him a guided tour, which students said His Royal Highness enjoyed. ""To be honest, I was expecting him to be a bit quiet and shy. But he wasn't, he was really good to have a chat with,"" Yirara student Mishai Wollogorang said. Mr Wollogorang said it was a privilege to show Prince Edward around. ""It's something I'm really proud of, something my family can be proud of,"" he said. Mr Wollogorang is working to complete his gold award in the Duke of Edinburgh program, and says it's been a challenging but rewarding experience. ""I like challenges. It gets me out of my comfort zone,"" he said. ""It's like camping … and paperwork. The worst thing about a gold award is paperwork."" Fellow student Danielle Campbell is also taking part in the program, completing a silver award. ""I get to go out and do community service and stuff like that … it's challenging, but in a good way,"" she said.

31,'Something in our system is not right': NT loses its top-tier AFL team,society,"  NT Thunder demise blamed on declining crowd numbers, draft picks The possibility of a first grade Northern Territory AFL side looks further from reality than ever, as past players and officials mourn the loss of the NT Thunder. Tanking crowd numbers, a lack of draft picks and a haemorrhaging of hundreds of thousands in sponsorship funds have assisted in the demise of the Northern Territory's top-tier AFL team. Statistics show the extent of the damage. ""In 2010 we had 27 players on the [AFL] list, today there are 13. The figures don't lie,"" said AFL NT CEO Stuart Totham. ""Something in our system is not right … we can't stand back and let the program go backwards,"" Totham said. The numbers, being used by the AFL NT to justify the disbandment of the NEAFL men's and VFLW women's sides, show that NT Thunder sponsorship had plummeted from $626,000 in 2015 to $302,000 by 2019. They show crowd attendance fell from 18,709 in 2015 to just 4,018 by this year. Retired NT Thunder captain Cameron Ilett said the players had reacted with ""shock and disappointment"" to the news. ""It's also been a time to reflect on some of the really positive things that the club has been able to do as well,"" Ilett said. ""But overall it's been quite sad."" Mr Ilett conceded that crowd numbers and draft picks had fallen off in recent years. ""I'd hate to be judged just solely on that, because the football club means a lot more than that,"" he said. The NT has for decades been known as a prodigious breeding ground for AFL talent, from the Rioli and Long dynasties to Liam Jurrah, Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti, Dom Barry and Nathan Djerrkura. But this was no longer happening, said Mr Totham. ""The Thunder and the NEAFL was putting resources in the wrong place, and not allowing enough kids to get into programs and the opportunity to play at the highest level,"" he said. The AFL NT said it would now sharpen its focus on grassroots and remote Territory footy clubs, and on building better relationships with first grade AFL teams. One club name that has been floated as a potential future partner was the embattled Gold Coast Suns, although Mr Totham would not directly confirm. ""If there's an opportunity for us to get more players on the list, that's a good result,"" he said. The Northern Territory Government puts $300,000 into AFL partnerships in the NT per annum, and Sports Minister Lauren Moss said she had learned from NT Thunder's dissolution through news reports. ""I'm incredibly disappointed to learn this through the media,"" Ms Moss said. ""But we have a very good relationship with AFL NT, and I have no doubt we'll have good conversations about this."" The NT Government last year committed $100,000 to a scoping study to assess the future viability of an AFL team based in the Northern Territory. The results were slated for a midyear release, but have so far not been made public. Mr Totham said the chances for a Territory team was still a possibility. ""If in the fullness of time there's opportunities to have our team back again, we'll be looking really closely at it,"" he said.

32,Animals by the thousands as 'country meets the city' for the Royal Adelaide Show,society,"  Animals by the thousands as 'country meets the city' for the Royal Adelaide Show When city children step through the southern gate at the Royal Adelaide Show one of the first things they might ask is, ""what's that smell?"" Parents loaded with backpacks — already flustered by excited children on the train ride there — will likely explain that its manure and herd them quickly past the looming fairy floss stand before it's noticed. But spare a thought for where that manure comes from. The facts are so impressive it might even delay a child's rush to sideshow alley so they can see its origins for themselves. Leading the pack in terms of animal numbers at the Royal Adelaide Show this year will be a massive 2,445 entries for horses-in-action, including equestrian, harness racing and show jumping, and a further 1,302 horses in the led stock category. Join us as we go behind the scenes of the ghost train at the Royal Adelaide Show and talk to those who make a living by scaring the daylights out of people. Following the horses, there are 2,136 dogs listed among competitive entries, as well as 166 dogs competing for obedience and agility, 22 in the weight pull, and many more under the grooming category. Some 2,159 domestic fowls (poultry), such as chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese, will lay about 3,000 eggs that will be donated to the Salvation Army. There will also be 826 cats, 532 pigeons, 346 rabbits, 189 caged birds, 144 guinea pigs (cavies), 59 aquarium fish and 26 reptiles, such as snakes and lizards. With 1,591 sheep, 742 dairy and 537 beef cattle, 162 led steers, 171 pigs, 395 goats and 171 miniature goats also present, it is no wonder the smell of manure inside the southern entrance packs such a wallop. Last year's State Rural Ambassador winner and president of the Kapunda & Light Agricultural Society Christopher Hutchinson said it was the biggest showing of animals in the state by far. ""It's country meets the city,"" he said. ""I think a lot of people visit all its show rides and the showbag pavilion, but end up giving a hard pass to looking at anything agricultural. ""Some go for a quick lap and go, 'oh, that's nice', but a lot of people seem to forget that's what the show's about."" He said coordinating such a large number of animals, however, was not an easy task, and success was reliant on having a ""dedicated crew"". ""At the Kapunda Show, for example, I have a really good show committee, from my partner who's secretary, from my horse convenor, hacking convenor and entertainment coordinator. ""If you don't have really good, dedicated people in those roles, it falls apart pretty quick."" Since winning the ambassadors award in 2018, which recognises potential leadership and aims to highlight the importance of youth in the agricultural show movement, Mr Hutchinson has been travelling to large and small shows across the country as well as in the UK. He said the UK shows differed from major Australian shows because they offered comparatively few sideshow attractions but still drew massive crowds. ""One of them had no show rides and the other one had half a dozen really small rides for kids, and everything else was 100 per cent based around agriculture, which is fantastic,"" Mr Hutchinson said. As well as getting involved and helping with the animals and wherever else he can at the Adelaide Show, Mr Hutchinson said he was looking forward to seeing the next group of ambassadors. At 27 years old, Mr Hutchinson is one of the youngest agricultural society presidents in the country and pointed out he was a mechanic by trade and did not come from the land. ""If you want to get involved in the Royal Adelaide Show on the agriculture side, or in a country show around the place, it's really easy to do,"" he said. ""You don't have to have a farming background to get involved and that's something I've been really trying to point out to everyone over the past 12 months. ""It's not a hard process and you can be a total novice."" The 244th Royal Adelaide Show, which is visited by half a million people annually, runs from August 30 to September 8. Its organisers said it contributed about $200 million to the economy each year and was the state's largest event.

33,Retiring councillor critical of Gold Coast administration,society,"  Gold Coast councillor Dawn Crichlow bows out after nearly 30 years in local government One of the longest serving — and most colourful — councillors in Australia is retiring after nearly 30 years in local government. Dawn Crichlow has announced she will not contest the Gold Coast City Council elections that are due in March next year. Councillor Crichlow, who was awarded an Order of Australia medal for her service to the community in 2006, said she wanted to do more as a volunteer for various groups. The septuagenarian has served under five mayors including Lex Bell and Ray Stevens who became state MPs, and Olympic great Ron Clarke. She said her favourite was Lex Bell — who remained a good friend. Councillor Crichlow described this year, with Tom Tate at the helm, as her toughest year in local government. ""We've got too big and there is too much control at the top,"" Councillor Crichlow said. ""I am against so much that is going on at the moment. ""I am afraid that I am one of the small people who don't have the vote any more."" The councillor and the Mayor have clashed in recent years over issues including plans for a casino in her division of Southport. Councillor Crichlow described the amalgamation of the Gold Coast and Albert Shire Council into a super city in 1995 as a mistake. ""Albert Shire had no sewerage, no septic, no nothing,"" she said. ""For about 10 years we had to pour money into Albert Shire. ""That's what took the gloss a bit away from Surfers Paradise. ""We only finished doing sealed roads 10 years ago, so it was very tough. ""It was the wrong decision."" The Southport resident entered local government calling for accountability on rates expenditure and she was leaving a similar message for her successor. ""I don't want it where they are afraid to go to their local councillor and they are told to come online, show your grievances online, tell us what you want online. I want local government to stay local government"", she said. The former businesswoman has worked in areas as diverse as taxidermy, racehorse training, appaloosa and quarter horse breeding, floristry, hairdressing, and fashion. She distils vodka and flavoured oils but gives her beloved dog, Princess Pookie, credit for that work. ""She makes the vodka with 24 carat gold, she makes the virgin olive oil with 24 carat gold,"" Councillor Crichlow said. ""She is now doing a Southport honey and she also does beer — Princess Pookie's pale ale."" Councillor Crichlow said she wanted to work as a volunteer with various community groups in Southport but said her beloved companion, Princess Pookie, would be taking it easy. ""She has just had an MRI and a CT scan. It showed nothing but the vet seems to think she has a bit of dementia, so we will both retire,"" she said. But Councillor Crichlow wanted to maintain contact with her constituents. ""Just say hello to me in the street, that's all. I talk to everybody in the street,"" she said.

34,"Emojis are everywhere, but they can be a painful reminder of exclusion for some",society,"  Australian South Sea Islander community seeks recognition in the world of emojis They are the images that litter online discussions and text messages. But for one group of Australians emojis are also a reminder that they are not part of the conversation. Emojis, or word pictures, are more and more a part of every day written language and can be used to show emotions, appreciation or representation of a particular group. But members of the Australian South Sea Islander (ASSI) community say they're not able to properly express themselves or their pride in culture in the digital space. They have called on Unicode, the body responsible for the emoji 'alphabet', to add an ASSI flag to the more than 250 already available. ""We've historically been a community that's been ashamed, due to the background of how we came to Australia,"" community representative Louise Pfeffer said.. ""We've been described as the forgotten people, hidden in plain sight and that now extends to the digital space."" Malcolm Burt, a researcher and PhD candidate at CQUniversity and media expert, said wanting an emoji that represented the Islander flag was not a frivolous request. ""Emojis are a universal language, an instantly understandable type of shorthand,"" Mr Burt said. ""They also mirror social conditions and inequity. ""So not having a representation in the emoji alphabet mirrors an inequity in their identity. ""I can't think of a more valid request."" He said the request by the group was a perfect example of just how important emojis are in today's society. ""People want to be part of the conversation, and I can see a direct connection between not having an emoji and being left out."" Mr Burt said the decision of the Oxford Dictionary to select an emoji as the World of the Year in 2015 was further evidence of the importance of the characters. ""The Mayans had symbols and then the Egyptians had hieroglyphics,"" he said. ""This is just a digital version of how people have been been using images as a form of shorthand."" Australian South Sea Islanders were brought to Australia in the 19th century to work on sugar farms, in a practice known as blackbirding. ""Our ancestors were tricked, lured and kidnapped and there's a real history of trauma the community needs to heal from,"" Ms Pfeffer, whose grandfather came to Australia in search of a better life, said. ""We want to be able to show pride in who we are — we're still here, we're survivors. Ms Pfeffer said it was painful for people in the community that many Australians still did not know anything about Australian South Sea Islanders or who they are. ""Now more than ever we need a way to express ourselves and who we are — both visually and verbally,"" she said. ""At the moment we have no way to show that pride."" The Australian flag is not enough, according to Mr Burt and Ms Pfeffer. ""Yes we are Australian and we have the Australian flag, but that doesn't really encompass our unique history,"" Ms Pfeffer said. ""Unless you have experienced what it's like not to have a voice, you don't understand what it's like not to be able to express your voice."" Mr Burt agreed. ""You can be Australian and have a rainbow flag as well as part of your identity. It doesn't make you any less Australian,"" he said. ""It's simply reinforcing your identity within Australia. ""This is a valid desire for recognition."" Although emojis for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags exist on Twitter, Unicode is a different platform. Unicode's website states that there is no mechanism to support such a request. Historical flags, such as South Vietnam, also don't have their own emojis and neither does Australia's Aboriginal flag have its own symbol. Unicode's site said adding subdivision flags could appear to play favourites, unless similar subdivisions also got flags.

35,Wollongong Public school celebrates diversity and 'seeing the person within',society,"  'You are more than welcome in our country' – welcoming words for a young Muslim family Embracing diversity is easy when your friends come from all over the world. It's even better when your school celebrates different cultures too. As Australia embraces diversity, children from across the globe are studying together in our public schools. With the right attitude, colour, race and economic factors disappear when children are taught to see the person within. That's how Bader Alshoumr, and his family from Ha'il in Saudi Arabia, feel about Wollongong, where they have been for 18 months. ""After the shooting in New Zealand a lot of people came to our mosque to show support. They brought flowers and they told us, 'You are more than welcome in our country', so this is a good support for us,"" Mr Alshoumr said. ""I have been to many countries and I think that Australia is one of the safest places for us."" Mayasa, his eight-year-old daughter, agrees. ""I like this place because there are lots of people from different countries, and some people are from the same country I am from. That means that I can speak to them [in Arabic] and be friends with them,"" she said. Mr Alshoumr has travelled extensively across the globe. ""Wollongong is one of the best cities, most beautiful cities, that I have ever been to,"" he said. His wife, Ibtisam, Sam for short, is also mother to three-year-old Khaled. Together they live in Wollongong while Mr Alshoumr completes a PhD at the university. Mayasa attends the local primary school, Wollongong Public, while Khaled attends pre-school just one day a week. Incidentally, both the University of Wollongong and Mayasa's school environment are not that different, as both institutions cater for the cultural diversity that comes from multicultural communities. Mayasa, who speaks fluent English and Arabic, attends Arabic school on the weekends. The main difference being that Arabic schools are same sex so Mayasa's weekend class is girls only. ""I learn how to write and read in Arabic … and write the numbers because some numbers are tricky to write,"" Mayasa said. ""Most of my friends are Arabic but some are from a different culture. I know that one of my friends is from England, and one of them is from China and one from Iraq,"" she said. Mayasa was happy to have lots of friends from different cultures. ""If I know they are an Arabic person then I can talk to them in Arabic, but if they are English I just talk to them. If they are from a different country and they do know English I'll talk to them in English,"" she said. Assistant principal at Wollongong Public, Samantha Neaves, said inclusivity was important for the children. ""They learn together, are in consultation with one another, and we are most definitely encouraging the children to be collaboratively working together,"" she said. ""Probably the highest cultural group within our school is the Arabic culture; we have about 76 students who are from Arabic backgrounds. ""We also have high populations of Chinese, Macedonian and Serbian-speaking children across the school."" The school celebrates Harmony Day by encouraging pupils to bring a plate to share and wear traditional clothes. School principal, Harold Cosier, said Wollongong Public was diverse in many different ways, not just culturally. ""We have an incredible diversity, not just of cultures but of people from all walks of life,"" he said. ""We have high socio-economic families, we have refugee families, and all of the kids here see through that. They see past that. ""They don't even bother thinking about colour, language. They look to see the person within. It's something that we are very proud of and it's something that we celebrate all the time. ""It's not just for Harmony Day; it's what our playground looks like every day."" The Alshoumr family are heading back to Saudi Arabia once Mr Alshoumr's studies are complete. It's the main reason the children are literate in Arabic and English. ""These days, in order to get a job in Saudi Arabia, you need to improve yourself in academia as it is now one of the main requirements,"" Mr Alshoumr said.

36,'Safer on the streets than at home': A town's answer to youth crime,society,"  Youth crime in decline thanks to program that keeps kids off the streets at night The day's heat has persisted into a humid Saturday night in Moree as a group of about 30 kids waits outside the Police Citizens Youth Club (PCYC) beneath the glow of a solitary orange light. The crowd has gathered even though the doors of the hall will stay shut for another half an hour. When the hall opens at 9:00pm, kids pile in to play cricket, soccer and basketball, and hip hop music echoes from a large speaker. A joint effort between local police, Indigenous youth services and PCYC volunteers in the northern NSW town, the new program aims to keep young people off the streets and out of trouble. Sixteen-year-old Katherine, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, is among those at the hall tonight. She has arrived on one of the buses run by local Indigenous youth service Miyay Birray to ferry kids to and from the program. Katherine says the program is a nice change of pace. ""It's nice to see the kids happy and enjoying themselves together for once,"" she says. ""Usually they're not all together like this, they're all beefing and fighting. ""Most of these kids that are here right now, they would be out doing something that you wouldn't like to hear about."" As she catches up with friends out the front of the hall, Katherine says relations with police still have a long way to go. ""To be honest, right now most of these kids don't like the police,"" she says. ""But from this program so far they're showing their compliance with the officers and they're communicating pretty well with them."" On the other side of town, Inspector Martin Burke leaves the local police station in plain clothes and steps into an unmarked van to begin his patrol. Pulling away from the station as police radios chirp back and forth, Inspector Burke says the sight of kids on the street is an everyday occurrence in the town of 10,000 residents. ""The sad reality is that there are some kids that are actually safer out on the streets than they are at home,"" Inspector Burke says. Now in his fourth year as the officer-in-charge, Inspector Burke says it is not uncommon on nights like tonight to see large groups of children and adolescents roaming the streets and committing crimes. ""There's graffiti, there are rock-throwing incidents, there's malicious damage to property, there are break-ins to cars, break-ins to businesses and homes. ""All we can liken it to is just boredom."" Inspector Burke says some of the town's residents are scared to walk the streets at night. In the 12 months to September 2018, Moree had the highest rates of robbery with a non-firearm weapon, malicious damage to property, and motor vehicle theft per 100,000 people of any local government area in NSW, according to the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. Cruising the side streets of Moree, Inspector Burke spots groups of kids walking to the PCYC hall, where he soon arrives himself, and welcomes kids as they arrive at the front door. Inspector Burke says the program has already seen promising growth, and that its success out of the gate highlights the lack of safe spaces in the town. ""It's a good opportunity [for the kids] to socialise with their friends in a safe environment where they're not going to be in a position to cause trouble,"" he says. ""That's been really, really pleasing — to see everybody get on board."" Inspector Burke says the program hosted 200 kids in its first month, and was an easy sell for the kids of Moree. ""There's no-one there that's rounding the kids up to come in. They're there of their own volition."" Inspector Burke knows many of the kids' families and says a more ""nuanced"" approach to engaging Moree's youth is essential to moving forward. ""Some of the social dysfunction that some houses have here, you can't police your way out of it,"" he says. Towering above the crowd of kids is Lloyd Munro, a youth caseworker with the support service Ngaoara. The Moree local has known many of the kids since they were born, and says he gets respect and attention from them, which police officers might not. ""I see most of these kids growing up. I know most of their parents, their older brothers and their older sisters, they see me in the community all the time,"" he says. As he plays a friendly game of basketball with a boy, Mr Munro says the community can already see the benefits of the program. ""It's only been running for about four weeks, but it's been a massive turnout,"" he says. ""Ever since we've been running the Saturday night program, the crime rate has dropped."" Although youth crime has anecdotally declined, the program is not incident free. When tensions boil over and two young boys start fighting, Mr Munro forces himself between them to break it up. After the altercation, Mr Munro says mediating disputes between young people in a controlled environment is a major benefit of the program. ""[We] get them to shake hands, cuddle and that's it. That'll be the end of it,"" he says. ""For our kids, we need more male role models in the town to step up and start taking ownership of their community."" Collaboration between youth services and police allows community leaders like Mr Munro and Inspector Burke to communicate closely about the needs of individual children regularly. Community consultation with police has ensured participating kids can't be arrested or charged for any of their actions at the program. Participants are also welcome to return each week regardless of previous incidents. ""All services in town have got to work together. It's just bridging that gap with the community and the young fellas with the police,"" Mr Munro says. ""At the end of the day it's about the kids."" Nearing midnight, all water at the hall has run dry. A slab of more than 100 water bottles has been reduced to a pile of plastic. Police and volunteers say attendance has been higher than expected, and they plan to install a water fountain at the hall soon. Stepping into one of the community buses to return home for the night, Katherine says the sooner Moree's kids can see police as their peers, the better. ""They just need to work with them a bit more so the kids get to know them, not only inside of work but outside of work as well,"" she says. ""The community is so thankful for this program, and so am I.""

37,"'Look at this place, it's disgusting': Troubled public housing block due to get a facelift",society,"  NT public housing block due to get a facelift, but some residents are still waiting for new homes The $45 million redevelopment of a crime and drug hotspot in the centre of Darwin's northern suburbs has left a cloud of uncertainty over those being kicked out of the public housing blocks pegged for demolition. Pensioner Peter Dinehardt agreed with the Government's decision to knock down his Nightcliff block but said he still did not know where or when he would be moving. ""All they're saying is 'I don't know',"" Mr Dinehardt said. ""Every time I ask them they say we don't really know."" The NT Labor Government announced the plan to redevelop John Stokes Square in April last year, which includes the construction of a new 24-hour police station, tower-style public housing units to replace the 75 existing homes and the creation of additional green spaces. Some people had already moved out in preparation for the transition, Mr Dinehardt said. ""I've got my name down to live close to town, but I haven't heard anything."" Mr Dinehardt has lived at the John Stokes Square public housing block for five years, during which time he has seen some of the crime, alcohol and drug problems that have given the area a bad reputation. ""They need to close this place. It's old, look at the place, it's disgusting,"" he said. ""A lot of people don't want to leave, because they are so used to being here. ""Personally, I would like to leave."" Attorney-General Natasha Fyles said the plan would create 240 jobs and improve the amenity and safety of the area. She said work had already begun on the police station design, and she expected demolition to start in May, with the tender for the demolition works to go out this week. Currently there is no concrete timeline for the expected completion of the project or a definitive decision on what the housing will look like, although the local area plan allows development up to six storeys. ""It's anticipated that the police station will be two storeys, and the housing four storeys, but we will work with the department around meeting their needs and also make sure that communities view is heard,"" Ms Fyles said. ""Every resident must move out of the property to allow for that redevelopment. ""We are trying to take into account their individual needs in relocating them into other public housing properties."" One of Mr Dinehardt's fellow residents said they also did not yet know when or where they would be going. ""I got a note to call Housing [Department], but I haven't heard anything else,"" he said. ""Hopefully we'll hear something soon."" Another said she had just found out she would be moving to housing in Palmerston. ""I don't have a car, but there's a bus stop there, so it should be OK, and I went and saw the unit and it's OK,"" she said. ""It does seem like a waste of accommodation to knock all this down."" A spokesperson for Housing Minister Gerry McCarthy confirmed 33 tenants were still waiting for new accommodation but said they were on track to be transferred prior to works commencing. Mr Dinehardt said he hoped he would be moved to a better place soon. ""They have to [find a new home for us], they can't just throw us out on the street,"" he said. ""They have to put us somewhere, but I don't want to live in Palmerston or anything like that because of a lack of transport, it's too far away.""

38,Driving cultural change in rugby league's next generation,society,"  Young Darwin players driving cultural change in rugby league's next generation For a young man, Shane Draper has been through his share of rough patches — but all the while rugby league was there to help pull him through. As the NRL deals with the repercussions of several serious off-season scandals, young men like Mr Draper in Darwin want to be at the forefront of driving cultural change in the next generation. He is one of a handful of players in a new development academy, helping players to tackle issues affecting young men and wider society. ""Looking where I'm at now, I'm feeling good about myself,"" Mr Draper says. ""Being a part of this academy with these fellas,"" he says looking over his shoulder at his teammates training behind him. ""It's good."" It's aimed at teaching the young men ways to prevent falling into the traps which seems to have snared many rugby league players past: booze, violence, and making bad decisions. But to help these boys see the right path, they need positive mentors. They need to be able to look past the scandals of their role models in the premiership league: and the Nightcliff Dragons have a way they hope to make this work. It's a cool Darwin evening, as the final drops of rain fall on a group of Nightcliff Dragons players being put through their paces as they train for the upcoming Northern Territory rugby league season. But more than just rugby drills, the sessions are a chance to teach the players about important social issues. ""We've been doing a lot of fitness work, we've been doing a lot of life skills,"" club president Kevin Page said. ""We've brought in mentors to give talks."" One of those is anti-violence campaigner Charlie King, who sits watching Nightcliff train from the sidelines. Mr King, the founder of the No More campaign against family violence, has some confronting words for the young players. ""If I talk to you for five minutes, by the time I'm finished, five more victims of family violence in Australia,"" Mr King said. ""That's the reality of it."" In a rousing speech to the boys, he laid bare the effects of domestic violence across the nation. ""In Australia, there's half a million acts of family violence every year,"" he told them. ""There is one thing we can do to make life better for us, and that's to take on individual responsibility to fix it ourselves. ""And that's exactly what you guys are doing."" Mr King's comments came at a fitting moment. It's been an off-season to forget for the NRL, with the code marred by a number of bruising off-field scandals, including serious allegations of family violence. St George Illawarra Dragons forward Jack de Belin has been charged over an alleged sexual assault, and Manly Sea Eagles' Dylan Walker is facing court over the alleged assault of his fiancee. Both were stood down under the new guidelines for players in court, introduced by the Australian Rugby League Commission earlier this week, which means players facing a serious offence will be banned from playing, but can continue to train with their clubs. Mr King also welcome those changes and said they were long overdue. ""Too many players who fall foul of what the NRL or their clubs stand for have managed to hide away behind the fact the matters didn't get dealt with in the court,"" he said. Mr Page thinks the group has responded well to the sessions, and learned a lot already, especially from the visits from mentors like Mr King. ""They really have reacted well, they've really sat down and taken it in,"" he said. Michael Freeman is in his last year of under-18s, and said the sessions were a great way to engage with the issues facing young men and the rest of society. ""I wouldn't want to do this anywhere else, and doing it with something I love like rugby it's definitely easier for the knowledge to go in,"" he said. Sabastian Page said it helped to build a strong bonds between the academy members, while learning important lessons. ""We've had people come in and talk about domestic violence,"" he said. ""A lot about mental health with men … because a lot of people don't really talk about their feelings."" It's the first time the Dragons have run the academy, after the club couldn't field a team for the under-16s and under-18s competitions. ""What we've endeavoured to do this year is to get out early, get a lot of these kids together and bring them in … to get them together as a group,"" Page said. While he hoped more would eventually join the academy, Page said it has been worthwhile for the current members regardless. ""The kids that have been involved have really put in, and we're very pleased with what they're doing,"" he said. The academy will run until the end of the month, ahead of official training for the upcoming rugby league season.

39,'Your love will live on': Darwin rallies for family of nine-year-old boy killed in playground,society,"  Darwin rallies for family of Seth Tran Anderson who was killed in playground accident There's been an outpouring of support for a Darwin family after the death of a nine-year-old boy playing on park equipment in the northern suburbs. Seth Tran Anderson has been remembered by his older sister as a ""beautiful and smart boy"" with an unforgettable smile. Posting on Facebook, Gabriella Anderson wrote, ""Indeed you were a handful, but that's the price of having younger siblings, but you've always been by my side ever since you were born my little brother, I've told you many times before and I'll tell you again, I love you."" ""My special angel, rest in peace. For your love will live on through many hearts."" The boy's death at a council-owned park in Kailis Street, Wanguri, in Darwin's northern suburbs is still being investigated by Northern Territory Police. They've described it as non-suspicious and possibly the result of ""misadventure"". A crowdfunding campaign set up to help Seth's family pay for the costs of his funeral has raised over $13,000 in just one day. Dozens of people have posted messages of support on the campaign's webpage. ""My son goes to school with Seth and we are saddened by this tragedy. No mother should have to say goodbye to her son so young,"" one person wrote. ""Words seem inadequate to express the sadness I feel,"" said Faranak Layeghi. ""I'm so sorry for your loss. It's not much but I hope it helps you get a beautiful send off for Seth. My heart aches with you all,"" wrote Lucia Seats. His sister Gabriella shared the fundraiser on her own social media saying she wants to make her brother's send off successful, and that she is so thankful for anyone who kindly supported it. ""I want to make him have the very last moment of the whole family together,"" she wrote. Deputy Chief Minister Nicole Manison, who is the MLA for Wanguri, also posted her ""deepest condolences"" and contributed $500 to the campaign.

40,Living Dolly's Dream: How a Territory teen tragedy captured the nation's attention,society,"  Living Dolly's Dream: How a Territory teen tragedy captured the nation's attention From a cattle station near the Territory town of Katherine to the national stage, Kate and Tick Everett have turned their heartbreak into a transformative campaign to raise awareness about the harm caused by bullying. This time last year, Kate and Tick Everett were in a state of shock after the tragic death of their daughter Dolly, who took her own life at the beginning of January in 2018. She was just 14. Today, Dolly's parents have been recognised as the nation's 2019 Local Heroes at the Australian of the Year Awards in Canberra, for turning their grief into tireless advocacy work to raise awareness of the serious harms caused by bullying and cyberbullying like the kind their daughter had endured. Chairwoman of the National Australia Day Council Danielle Roche said the award winners were among Australia's ""finest citizens"". ""Kate and Tick Everett endured heartbreak and put their own grief aside to drive cultural change, prevent bullying and ensure that other children and parents never have to suffer as their family has,"" she said. ""By founding Dolly's Dream to confront bullying, they have displayed incredible courage and commitment."" More than 250 communities have held fundraisers to support Dolly's Dream's anti-bullying work, and Kate and Tick have met with politicians across the country, including Prime Minister Scott Morrison, while also caring for their daughter Megan and running their cattle station. The Dolly's Dream campaign, which aims to raise awareness of the seriousness of bullying and has a special focus on remote and regional Australia, has united communities and even inspired new legislation in NSW. ""Dolly's law"" has strengthened the penalties for anyone found guilty of online abuse or cyber bullying, with a new maximum imprisonment of five years in NSW. The Everetts were not the only Territorians to be acknowledged at this years awards. He's the proud black Yolngu boy with the killer flow, and now Danzal Baker, aka Baker Boy, can also add Young Australian of the Year to his growing list of accolades. Raised in the remote communities of Milingimbi and Maningrida, the 22-year-old Territory rapper, dancer and musician was recognised for being a ""dedicated advocate for Indigenous Australian culture"". Baker Boy, who is known in Arnhem Land as the 'Fresh New Prince' and raps in his language Yolngu Matha, had songs featured in the Triple J Hottest 100 in the past two years and this year performed around the country as part of a sold-out national tour. He was the first Indigenous rap artist to receive mainstream success rapping in language and has been seen as an important role model for young people living in remote communities with aspirations of making it in the music industry. This year, Baker Boy was handpicked as the support act for English rapper Dizzee Rascal to be his Australian support act and also cleaned up at the 2018 National Indigenous Music Awards, receiving recognition as Best New Talent of the Year and Best Film Clip of the Year, for his track Marryuna. Ms Roche congratulated Baker Boy for his contribution to the Indigenous and broader Australian communities. ""Danzal Baker is an inspirational young Australian, an outstanding musical talent and dedicated advocate for Indigenous Australian culture,"" she said. ""Through his music, he inspires young Indigenous Australians to embrace their heritage while sharing his own cultural stories with a wider audience here in Australia, and around the world.""

41,#MeToo founder says the portrayal of her movement has become 'unrecognisable',society,"  #MeToo founder Tarana Burke says the way her movement is framed at times is 'unrecognisable' Activist Tarana Burke started the ""MeToo"" movement on social media over a decade ago, but has now described what it has become as ""unrecognisable"". Ms Burke started the campaign in 2006 as a way to help young girls that are survivors of sexual violence to share their experiences. Then came the Harvey Weinstein scandal. As more and more high-profile women shared their experiences of sexual abuse and harassment, the Me Too movement went viral. Speaking at TEDWomen (an annual conference) in Palm Springs, Ms Burke said the movement had been misrepresented as a witch hunt out to destroy due process and start a gender war. ""Suddenly, a movement to centre survivors of sexual violence is being talked about as a vindictive plot against men,"" Ms Burke said. She said at times, the portrayal of the movement in the media was unrecognisable to her. ""This is a movement about the one in four girls and the one in six boys who are sexually abused every year, and who carry those wounds into adulthood,"" Ms Burke said. Despite the global attention that Me Too has gained, Ms Burke said it was understandable that people were coming together. ""This accumulation of feelings that so many of us are feeling together across the globe is collective trauma,"" she said. The activist also told the audience she wanted to see the campaign remain a ""movement"" and not just a ""moment"" in history. ""My vision for the Me Too movement is part of a collective vision to see a world free of sexual violence,"" she said. ""I believe we can build that world. Full stop. ""We start by dismantling the building blocks of sexual violence: power and privilege. This starts by shifting our culture away from a focus on individual bad actors or depraved, isolated behaviour. ""Instead, we must recognize that any person sitting in a position of power comes with privilege, rendering those without power vulnerable — whether it's a boss and employee, coach and athlete, landlord and tenant or another similar dynamic."" Ms Burke finished her speech with a reminder that the work of the Me Too movement was to teach survivors that it is OK to share their experiences and to raise public awareness.

42,opinion: Are men's movements a new form of terrorism?,society,"  Are men's movements a new form of terrorism? Among the greatest dangers of the current populist moment, manifested in the rise of strong male politicians with little respect for the rule of law, is the emergence of far-right political movements emphasising a militant masculinity dedicated to the restoration of a perceived loss of men's rights and place in society. At its most extreme, this men's movement is motivating new forms of far-right violence that steer dangerously close to the politically motivated violence we call terrorism. This past week, Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes announced he had resigned from the far-right group after the FBI reportedly categorized it as ""an extremist group with ties to white nationalism"". Such dissociation might aid McInnes in his aim to tour Australia, as membership of an extremist group would be a clear reason to deny him a visa. Ideological masculinity seeks to promote a return to a perceived period of male supremacy, now ""lost"" to women's rights and self-effacing men. The ""new economy"", defined by precarious labour and individualised conceptions of the workforce, has left many men effectively stranded. Male manual workers with little education are most likely to lose their jobs through de-industrialisation, while the female-dominated service occupations are growing. At the same time, women have entered the professions en masse and, with a suite of hard-won protections related to childbirth and child care, are able to reach and hold high level jobs that used to be the birthright of men. As Guy Standing has noted in The Precariat, anger, anomie, anxiety and alienation have replaced traditional working-class notions of masculinity bound up in self-reliance, strength and the ability to provide for one's family. The breakdown of traditional work also removed traditional support mechanisms — economic, solidaristic, familial and communal — creating a vacuum that has been filled by identity politics and the politics of victimisation. Social media is an accelerant, bringing together disparate, often isolated, figures to feed off one another in forums such as Gab, 4Chan and Reddit, the birthplace of movements such as neo-masculinity and the incels. These groups not only celebrate the forms of bodily masculine disposition traditionally embodied in working-class men, they provide a reason for their marginalisation grounded in ""ideological masculinity"". Over the past year we have seen a steady stream of far-right provocateurs seeking to bring this movement to Australia. Milo Yiannopolous Troll Academy tour in December 2017 brought to our shores a man who labelled feminism ""mean, vindictive, sociopathic and man-hating"". He was identified as the suspected driver in the Toronto van attack. Here's what we know about him. This December The Deplorables tour, featuring Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes and English Defence League (EDL) founder Tommy Robinson, is slated to ""thank"" their Australian supporters. Key to understanding the perspective of these speakers, is their belief that the women's movement is an attack on men. Men are framed as victims in a world where women's rights have taken away their traditional status. McInnes describes feminism as ""taking masculinity away from men"" and a ""giant suicide bomber meant to blow up tradition"". Leader of the Brexit movement Nigel Farage has stated feminism has been ""hijacked by some people who seem to have an anti-men agenda"". An even more extreme and dangerous manifestation is the emergence of incels (involuntary celibates), whose goal is less about restoration of lost masculinity than the nihilistic and misogynistic destruction of women (and the men who have enjoyed access to them) through terrorist actions. The most recent terrorist attack by an incel was the recent attack on a yoga studio in Florida, where Scott Beierle shot seven women, killing two. Beierle had posted videos, titled The Rebirth of my Misogynism and The American Whore, and called for the crucifixion of promiscuous women. Other cases include Alek Minassian's attack in Toronto earlier this year and Elliot Rodger's 2014 attack on a sorority house designed to ""punish all females for the crime of depriving me of sex"" as outlined in his 107,000 word manifesto. Groups such as the Proud Boys and the EDL readily fill the vacuum in these men's lives. Emphasising honour, pride, empowerment and action, they deploy similar recruitment narratives to that employed by Islamic State recruiters including videos, literature and charismatic appeals to join their brothers in fighting for a return to past greatness. This article contains content that is no longer available. British Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu has stated recently that Islamist and far-right groups are feeding off one another. Far-right terrorism is growing dramatically. British Home Office data reveals that whites constitute the largest proportion of arrested terrorism suspects for the first time in more than a decade. In the US, the University of Maryland's terrorism database shows that 56 per cent of recent terrorist attacks were carried out by right-wing extremists. There is increasing concern in Australia that right-wing terrorism may emerge in response to incitement and inspiration from overseas figures. The greatest threat of the far right however, and their ultimate aim, is the normalisation of the political discourse and rhetoric they employ into the political mainstream. Groups such as the Proud Boys and English Defence League  have a clear paramilitary vision for their organisation, seeking to be accepted by the mainstream political right, thereby legitimising their violence. Most recently, McInnes begged the Republican Party and mainstream political right to ""let us scum in"". This is chillingly reminiscent of the National Socialist Brownshirts and Italian Fascist Blackshirts, both of which developed from outlaws to an official arm of law enforcement. Masculinity is central to the sense of disempowerment driving populism. Any attempt to address the emergence of the new far right must look to the deeper-seated alienation, anxiety and anger motivating many men towards hate and violence.

43,opinion: We're a nation of phubbers in the bedroom,society,"  Phubbing (phone snubbing) happens more in the bedroom than with our friends Have you ever been around people who spend more time looking at their phone than they do at you? Then you know what it feels like to be ""phubbed"" — and you're probably guilty of doing it yourself. Phubbing is the practice of looking at your phone while in the presence of others. And as smartphones become ever more entwined in the everyday lives of Australians, phubbing has become so common that many people think it's normal. With Uber admitting it covered up a major data hack affecting 57 million users, it's urgent we discuss our digital rights. People phub during work meetings, while socialising with friends at cafes, while having dinner with their family, while attending lectures and even while in bed. But how common is phubbing in Australia? And in what social situations is it most prevalent? To find out, we surveyed 385 people and asked them how often they look at their smartphones while having face-to-face conversations with others. They recorded their answers as: never, rarely, sometimes, often, or all the time. We found 62 per cent of those surveyed reported looking at their smartphone while having a face-to-face conversation with another person or persons. Gender made no difference to how often someone phubbed. Neither did geography, with people living in the city and the country phubbing equally as often. But younger people phubbed others more frequently than older people. And people phubbed their partners most of all. The study also revealed smartphone users phubbed their parents and children more frequently than they phubbed their colleagues at work, clients and customers. These findings suggest a professional attitude towards using the smartphone in the workplace. Some social situations are more conducive to phubbing than others. We found people phubbed each other more when commuting together on public transport, during work coffee or lunch breaks, when in bed with their partners, when travelling together in private transport and when socialising with friends. People were less likely to phub others during meetings, during meal times with family, and during lectures and classes. We were interested in finding out whether boredom plays a role in phubbing behaviour so we asked our survey participants to complete an eight-item Boredom Proneness Scale. Sample questions included ""I find it hard to entertain myself"" and ""many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous"". We found boredom did explain why people phub, but that the influence of boredom is very small. Other factors, such as the ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO), lack of self-control, and internet addiction may play a more important role in phubbing behaviour. This article contains content that is no longer available. Looking at the smartphone while a person is having a face-to-face conversation with another person is a relatively new phenomenon. While it may violate some people's expectations, it's no simple task to categorise the behaviour as good or bad. One theory suggests that when people get phubbed they might judge the behaviour according to how important the phubber is to them. For example, phubbing among friends is probably more acceptable than a subordinate phubbing a manager during a work-related meeting. While that might be good news for the workforce, it's not great for close relationships. Phubbing partners can make them feel less important and this can decrease the satisfaction with the relationship. In the case of children, especially those at a vulnerable age, phubbing them can make them feel unloved, which can have a detrimental effect on their well-being. Our findings can be used to inform programs, policies and campaigns that aim at addressing the phubbing phenomenon. It's clear from the research smartphone users are more likely to phub those who are closely related to them than those less close to them. So next time you get phubbed when you are out with someone, take it as a compliment — it could mean they consider you a close friend.

44,China's 'flaunt your wealth' challenge goes viral with people falling out of cars with luxury goods,society,"  China's 'flaunt your wealth' challenge goes viral with people falling out of cars with luxury goods Photos of people lying face down on the ground — surrounded by luxury bags, shoes, and sometimes wads of cash — have gone viral on Chinese social media. The bizarre trend — dubbed the ""flaunt your wealth challenge"" — has generated more than a million posts on Chinese social platform Weibo in the past two weeks. China's growing army of social media influencers have played a role in popularising the meme, sharing images of themselves participating in the challenge with their followers. Dressed up in their finery, the influencers usually pose as if they've just fallen head first out of a luxury car and spilled their most valuable possessions onto the pavement. The trend has puzzled many an outside viewer as to what the appeal may be, and the increased attention has not been an all-round positive experience for the participants. Last week, one influencer had a friend shoot a video of her falling out of a car onto a pedestrian crossing in Taizhou, a city in China's eastern Zhejiang province. The video picked up more than 50,000 views on video sharing platform TikTok, according to Chinese state media People's Daily. Pictures showed the woman, identified only by her surname Chen, lying face down on a pedestrian crossing with luxury items worth thousands of dollars scattered around her. The post attracted more than a thousand comments, with Chinese netizens questioning whether it was safe for the woman to be posing in the middle of the road. Local police later issued Ms Chen and her friend a small fine for parking illegally. The global internet trend started in July in Russia after a DJ posted a photo of himself pretending to fall out of a private jet on Instagram. Since then, more than 100,000 Instagram posts with hashtags such as #fallingstars and #fallingstars2018 have been posted around the world. The craze has also sparked a series of satirical memes with netizens from all walks of life replicating similar poses with objects from their everyday lives. Some posts showed students falling over with books scattered around them, while apparent workers wearing hardhats posed with their work tools. Chinese state-owned media outlets including the People's Daily and CCTV have since publicised some of these images, praising various workers for taking pride in their jobs. The act of showing off wealth also highlights China's rising middle class, who have increasing purchasing power. Chinese nationals accounted for 32 per cent of all personal luxury goods purchased around the world in 2017, according to a Bain Luxury study published by Bain and Company. Haiqing Yu, an associate professor at RMIT and an expert on Chinese digital media, said the challenge was a way for people from different backgrounds to express themselves online. ""The Chinese middle class was the first to respond to the challenge, but it soon spread to [other less wealthy classes],"" Dr Yu said. ""It shows that digital media has become more widespread [in China] and that it's no longer only for people with wealth."" Dr Yu said the development of China's economy had resulted in more people embracing technology as a way to express themselves. But at the same time, China has tightened its monitoring of social networks, she said. She added it was common for netizens to now express their feelings with photos on Chinese social media because text was more easily tracked and censored. ""It used to be more straightforward in the past, but now [social media users] expect you to interpret the meaning of their photos,"" she said. ""You can't overinterpret [the new trend] politically, but it could be related to China's political environment — under the present circumstances, people may be using this popular form of falling over to vent their feelings.""

45,"opinion: How the GFC changed everything, and nothing",society,"  The global financial crisis changed everything, and nothing Ten years on, what was touted at nothing less than financial Armageddon, the global financial crisis has descended into business as usual. Crisis-related scandals weathered, eye-watering financial settlements negotiated in exchange for ""deferred prosecutions"" and bankers avoiding jail time, bank profits are again approaching pre-2008 levels, while bankers' bonuses are now well past that marker. A decade on from the global financial crisis, RN takes an in-depth look at how it changed the world. It's true that so-called ""proprietary trading"" by major banks is now prohibited (on conflict of interest grounds), banks are obliged to hold more equity than they did 10 years ago, and bankers' hubris has lost its edge, but the economy still remains servant to the finance sector master. This hitting of the financial reset button has occurred despite the economic trauma and social dislocation caused by the fallout from the financial crisis — global trade plummeted, 100 million more people were pushed beneath the World Bank's poverty line, social welfare was slashed in Europe (youth unemployment levels in some European countries reached 50 per cent), nine million homeowners in the US lost their homes, and some rich countries savaged their aid budgets based, in our case, on a twisted logic of ""Australia first"". (This is in contrast to the UK which, despite suffering a far deeper recession, has substantially increased its aid contributions). In light therefore of both the consequences and the causes of the GFC, it is truly astonishing how little the language and perspectives of human rights have impacted on the popular (or even specialist) perceptions of what the GFC was about and what lessons we learned from it. Everyday human rights of security, welfare, dignity and respect were all casualties for many millions of people worldwide, yet rights arguments have been barely heard, let alone influenced the din of post-crisis soul-searching and policy reforms proposals these past 10 years. Tin ears and ignorance on both sides of the human rights and finance divide have fuelled mutual suspicion and distrust and have helped sustain or even widen the gap between the two. The result is an abiding detriment to both. For the fortunes of robust human rights protections and of a thriving financial system are in fact inextricably linked. The human rights that most of us take so much for granted (such that we seldom recognise them as human rights) — to adequate food, housing, education, health care, free speech, privacy and equal treatment before the law — are all dependent on either our capacity to pay for them ourselves or have them provided or subsidised out of the public purse. Finance, in other words, is a necessary means for the achievement of human rights ends at their most basic, as well as when they are enjoyed in abundance. The dependency also works in the opposite direction. It is still the largest bankruptcy in US corporate history. So what happened, and how it did unravel so quickly? Finance needs human rights because its very legitimacy is contingent upon the contribution it makes to fulfilling society's conditions and expectations made of it, including human rights goals — in all their everyday ordinariness, as much as when addressing their searing abuse. Indeed, one can fairly ask: what else is finance for, if not to help achieve these ends? The excoriating parade of misconduct in our own silver-tailed financial services unearthed by the Hayne Royal Commission are painful testimony of impact finance can have on the lives of ordinary Australians. To be sure, the spread of financial wealth through our society in recent decades has enhanced the lot of many (and a whole lot more for a select few), but it has also tempted the greedy, encouraged deceit, and engendered something approaching contempt for customers and clients within the financial sector itself. This is not how it should be, in Australia or elsewhere. Banking and finance ought to be a pillar of society, not a modern-day sheltered workshop for bankers. We must reclaim finance for the good of society and for the good of bankers. Most of all we cannot allow finance to stoop so low as to endanger people's human rights when it can do so much to help protect them. So, the understanding, mapping, and measuring of the extent and significance of the byzantine relationship between human rights and finance are tasks that neither community can continue to neglect, no matter how daunting the challenge. The GFC should have made that far clearer and more urgently so than it did. At best, however, it has illustrated the yawning gap in comprehension between these two elemental phenomena of our times and signalled that while bridging the divide is essential, the task will be neither easy nor quick. If we heed these lessons then at least we might be prepared to better understand and more appropriately respond to the full implications of the next financial crisis.

46,opinion: Just a regular Joe (or Bill or ScoMo): How our leaders work hard at being 'ordinary',society,"  Just a regular Joe (or Bill or ScoMo): How our leaders work hard at being 'ordinary' Is it sufficiently dignified to call a prime minister, as distinct from an immigration minister or treasurer, ScoMo? Is this part of Scott Morrison's ""ordinary bloke"" persona? It does sound a bit like Joe Shmoe, which Wikipedia tells me means ""no one in particular"" and ""is one of the most commonly used fictional names in American English"". But it also sounds a bit Hollywood, evoking JLo. So it may well be the kind of game that virtually every politician with serious leadership aspirations has to play. They need to convince us that they are not so far above us that they are out of touch. (""How much is a litre of milk, Prime Minister?"") Yet when they do present themselves as just like us, we can't really take them seriously. We do, in the end, expect our leaders to be different. Each leader plays the game differently. William Shorten is, of course, Bill — who tweeted about doing the shopping with his young daughter on Father's Day. Minus the shopping trolley, Robert Menzies and Robert Hawke were both Bob, and William Hughes and William McMahon were Billy. John Curtin was Jack to his mates but John to the public. Joseph Benedict Chifley was Ben to all, and the unassuming Joseph Lyons was happy enough with Joe. It was hard to do much with Gough (Whitlam) or Paul (Keating), and Malcolm Fraser only became Mal when he was being ridiculed. Everyone knew he was no Mal, and nor was Malcolm Turnbull. ""Johnny (John Winston) Howard"" was almost never complimentary, especially when preceded by ""Little"", and Kevin Rudd might have been from Queensland and here to help, but he never became Kev — not even when worrying over the shaking of sauce bottles — any more than Julia Gillard became Jules. Politicians have long fretted over these matters. When Stanley Melbourne Bruce became prime minister in 1923, he issued a note to the press: Mr Bruce would be very glad if the newspapers would not refer to him by his Christian name, as Mr Stanley Bruce, but always as Mr S.M. Bruce. Today's journalists, cartoonists and comedians — to say nothing of one's political opponents — would be in raptures if a newly minted prime minister issued such a notice. And it was clearly unthinkable that the golf-playing, spats-wearing Mr Bruce would be just plain Stan. Here is a reminder that there is more than one way of performing the role of Australian prime minister. The late political psychologist Graham Little used to give a set-piece lecture on political leadership at Melbourne University, whose major details I can still recall 30 years later — so it must have been good. Mr Little thought there were broadly three types. Margaret Thatcher was a ""strong leader"" — the children's TV program that demonstrated the style was Romper Room. Boys wore boys' clothes and looked like boys. Girls wore girls' clothes and looked like girls. Miss Helena dressed conservatively and had a mirror through which she could keep an eye on us at home. Moral codes were strictly defined, with the help of Mr Do Bee (""Do be an asker. Don't be a help yourself""). Good conduct included being able to walk around with a basket balanced on your head. ""Inspiring leadership"" was exemplified by Mr Whitlam — and Play School. Each, in turn, went out of their way to demonstrate good, inclusive citizenship, and creative, inclusive play, yet without pretending to become an ordinary citizen, or an ordinary child. Like Miss Helena, Play School leaders were grownups. But unlike her — and like Mr Whitlam — they spoke to their audience of children as intelligent equals, dressed a bit like kids (possibly in overalls, not skirts, for women) and played along with them rather than laying down the law. Big Ted was a more gentle soul than Mr Do Bee — who presumably had a sting. Gender differences are more frankly acknowledged, but explored rather than taken for granted. And then there were ""group leaders"", like Mr Hawke — and Humphrey B. Bear. Humphrey, seemingly male yet somewhat ambiguously defined, runs around without trousers (any resemblance here to an Australian prime minister, living or dead, being purely coincidental). He is also a child, not an adult, and to this extent he shares a common identity with his audience. But they are not entirely deceived: Humphrey's not really the same as the kids watching at home. In short, he's rather like Mr Hawke, who at his best convinced us that he was one of us even while being unmistakably ""special"". Not all have even attempted this balancing act. Neither Mr Bruce nor Mr Menzies ever pretended to be everyman, although Mr Menzies occasionally pointed to his humble origins as the son of a country storekeeper. Mr Keating barely made the effort; his adoption of Collingwood Football Club when he became prime minister was widely ridiculed for its cynicism, coming as it did from a man whose interests ran more to classical music and French clocks. Mr Turnbull's leather jacket, never entirely convincing, did not survive his elevation to prime minister. His persona in the job more resembled a Renaissance Florentine merchant-statesman — albeit without the art or culture, which may well have been Mr Turnbull's major concession to the common folk. Like Mr Keating, the very Sydney-ish Mr Morrison is looking south for an AFL club, and he has cultivated what journalist Phillip Coorey calls a ""daggy ordinariness"". But his everyman act is already running up against his evangelical Christianity. The classic Australian plain man is not an evangelical. Russel Ward sketched the ""the typical Australian"" most influentially in The Australian Legend 60 years ago. He is, Ward writes, ""sceptical about the value of religion and of intellectual and cultural pursuits generally"". The latter certainly fits Mr Morrison, but not the former. That said, he leads Mr Shorten as preferred prime minister in Newspoll. It is worth pausing to ask why Mr Shorten, former Australian Workers' Union leader, has never been able to break through as a personally popular figure. He has clearly modelled aspects of his career on Mr Hawke, but no one would ever accuse him of possessing Mr Hawke's charisma. He will never approach his stratospheric approval ratings. Perhaps there are too many stories around of his cosy relations with filthy rich businessmen. He became a national figure on the back of his media profile during the Beaconsfield mine disaster and rescue in Tasmania in 2006, and he campaigned most effectively in the 2016 election. Yet he often seems wooden in front of a camera, as distinct from when talking with ordinary voters. On the couple of occasions I've witnessed him deliver prepared speeches, he was engaging if not magnetic, and improved as he warmed to the message he was delivering. Mr Hawke moved in similar business circles to Mr Shorten, and had his deficiencies as both a public speaker and parliamentary performer. But he was brilliant if unpredictable in a TV interview, before he cut the drinking and learned better to control his temper. His media image in the 1970s, while ACTU president, overwhelmed any popular suspicion that he was in the pockets of the top end of town, although there was a growing chorus of complaints about rich mates during his prime ministership. Mr Shorten, much more than Mr Hawke, has been damaged by the perception of backroom dealing; with bosses, while a union leader, and over the internecine warfare within the Labor Party.

47,Cynical Australia: Take the test to see if you're more cynical than the typical Australian,society,"  Party's over: In a nation of cynics, we're flocking to the fringe  Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the most cynical of us all? Poll after poll shows satisfaction with the political system has plunged to unprecedented lows, in a nation not exactly known for its patriotic fervour. And while Australians may pride themselves on being a cynical bunch, new research has revealed deep divisions between those content with the status quo and a growing underbelly for whom Australian democracy is quickly losing its shine. Delving into the differences between more than 20 demographic groups, the research from the Museum of Australian Democracy and University of Canberra found distrust and disillusionment surpassed 80 per cent among some communities, while in others, more than 60 per cent remained happy with the current system. So, are you more cynical than a swinging voter? More satisfied than the rich? Or more apathetic than Generation X? To see whether you're more trusting or cynical than other Australians, take our quiz below. (You'll need about 2 minutes.) And rest assured your answers are not linked to your identity, nor will they be stored or passed on to anyone else. You trust us… right? This feature isn't available on the ABC app. Tap the link below to go to the quiz on the ABC website or scroll past to keep reading about the research. In a nation of cynics, new research reveals a growing underbelly of discontent forcing Australians to the fringe. Rate the state of the nation to see where you stand. The quiz above includes about one third of the questions researchers posed to a nationally-representative sample of more than 1,000 Australians in July this year. Their findings paint a vivid picture of just how disenchanted we are with our elected representatives. Most Australians no longer trust any tier of government: federal, state or local council. Government ministers and members of parliament — trusted by less than one in four — now rank as the least trusted compared to others such as GPs, judges, business people, journalists or trade unionists. And the federal government is trusted by just 31 per cent of the population, while state and local government perform little better, at just over 35 per cent. Notably, the survey was done before the most recent federal leadership bloodbath and in the midst of a record run of nearly three decades of economic growth. ""It's unusual to see such a crisis in political trust when the economy is going so well,"" said Professor Mark Evans from the University of Canberra's Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis, which conducted the research. ""We are witnessing a vicious cycle of distrust and alienation from politics and the formal democratic process."" The research reveals two shifts: most voters care more about effective and competent government than promises of more dollars in their pockets; and many are voting tactically for independents. This became clear during focus group discussions, which were also part of the research. ""Voters were saying politicians only care about marginal seats…  So they said they voted for independents to attract more resources to their communities,"" Professor Evans said. ""This is a huge wake-up call for Australia's major political parties. They must adapt or die because the new reality is that up to 60 per cent of voters have become swinging, non-aligned voters."" Attitudes to political leadership are also becoming more polarised around age, income and political preference. Those more likely to feel satisfied with the status quo include National or Liberal Party voters, households earning more than $200,000 a year, university graduates and baby boomers (defined as those aged between 56 and 73). At the opposite end of the spectrum, dissatisfaction is most widespread among people aged in their 40s (Generation X), women and households struggling on less than $50,000 a year. The most disillusioned are also more likely to vote for independent candidates or minor parties like One Nation or Centre Alliance (Nick Xenophon's former party) — or to be unaligned to any party. These non-aligned voters could make up 30 per cent of the electorate, Professor Evans said. They are deeply distrustful not only of politicians, but almost every major institution and authority figure included in the survey. The exception was their local GP. Given 15 options to describe what they like about Australian democracy, their most common response was ""None of the above"". These non-aligned voters are ""the most challenged group in our society"", Professor Evans said. ""A significant proportion would be on welfare or low incomes and they're increasingly alienated and angry — just like many Trump and Brexit voters."" Social trust between people has fallen below 50 per cent — to 47 per cent — for the first time since 2001, when researchers first posed the question. Most believe that people are out for themselves, although a majority — apart from the wealthiest households — still believe people in their neighbourhood would help others out. It's a worrying picture, Professor Evans said. Declining political trust can threaten social cohesion and increase marginalisation. ""It opens up more space for extreme left and extreme right… People will increasingly look outside the system for their own answers."" But if there's one thing that unites Australians of all types, it's complaining about their elected leaders. The three biggest grievances? That politicians are not accountable for broken promises, they don't deal with the issues that really matter, and big business has too much power. (Liberal and National Party voters single out trade unions instead of big business.) The research identifies a growing public appetite for reform, including involving ordinary citizens in more decisions. But how likely is it that politicians and political parties would adopt reforms that undermine their powerbrokers? As fate would have it, Professor Evans was in Canberra briefing federal politicians on the survey's grim findings on the day of the first leadership spill. ""They think all they need to do is to get back to more stable government,"" he said. ""But it goes deeper than that now. ""Most Australians simply don't think that they care about them.""

48,analysis: The perplexing ugliness of recent weeks gives leadership a bad name,society," Politics The perplexing ugliness of recent weeks gives leadership a bad name We often do ourselves a disservice by the choice of words we use in describing events. Take ""leadership"" as a prime example. If you played word association games with most Australians these days, and said ""leadership"", they would probably respond ""coup"". Before the roadshow moves on, it's worth pausing to remember aspects of an earlier Liberal coup, lest they contain lessons clearly not learned by the instigators of the most recent shemozzle, writes Laura Tingle. But the reality is, of course, that leadership coups have nothing to do with actual leadership. The perplexing ugliness of the last few weeks — and indeed much of the past decade — concerns struggles for power rather than leadership. They have involved struggles for jobs that give the authority and power of a leader. There has not been even the remote sniff of what most people would think constitutes actual leadership of the country driving these battles. There has not even been any great ideological divide involved in most of these struggles, no matter how those involved may kid themselves. If it wasn't for the fact that some parts of the media consider themselves legitimate forces in these struggles, there might be some quiet agreement to call the phenomenon that now grips the Liberal Party — and before that the Labor Party — for what it is, simply by a change of nomenclature. We would be doing the country a favour, as the whole business has given leadership a bad name. The first parliamentary week of the Morrison Government has only confirmed that we will now be subjected to the entire depressing circus for some time to come. There was one particular dynamic at work last week that we need to think about a lot more if politics is ever going to make sense at some time in the future, writes Laura Tingle. Having got rid of Malcolm Turnbull, but dismally failing to install Peter Dutton, the same forces of destruction are now trying to push Scott Morrison to the right on policy — getting rid of the renewable energy target and out of the Paris climate agreement, for example — just as they did with Malcolm Turnbull. The only trouble is, the schoolyard brawl has now got another gang coming to join the fracas, as Mr Turnbull intervenes to point out that Mr Dutton's eligibility to sit in the Parliament should be tested in the High Court. There is some very, very dark humour in contemplating how the non-Labor side of politics (for perhaps we should really stop calling them conservatives while we are at it) have invested so much political — and taxpayers' — capital in telling voters that they want to keep us safe from forces like terrorism and outside intervention in our politics. Why get outsiders to do it when you can have so much fun at home? Confronted by three of his ministers saying they would abandon him, Mr Turnbull told Mathias Cormann, Mitch Fifield and Michaelia Cash: ""This is terrorism. Why give in to terrorism?"" Equally, there was Barnaby Joyce, who bristled at Mr Turnbull's intervention this week saying, ""it seems like he has an active campaign to try and remove us as the Government"". That would be in contrast to the bumbling incompetence of the political plotters who have done their best to ensure the Government gets removed at the next election, by provoking a leadership change so pointless that they can't explain it, and which voters hate. The reality remains that, whatever Mr Turnbull's motivation for his intervention, he is right. For if there was any lesson to be learned from last year, it should be that no political party benefits from letting the cloud of uncertainty hanging over an MP's eligibility stay there for months at a time. It is a distraction. It undermines the credibility of the MP in question, and the authority of our democratic processes. That applies in spades when the MP in question is the head of our national security apparatus, and has more ministerial discretion — that is open to challenge in the courts — than most of his colleagues combined. In the meantime, we have a Government that has very little discernible agenda to offer voters and a Prime Minister who seems to think leading his team in some bizarre form of parliamentary calisthenics might be a good proxy for leadership. In addition to reporting on the antics in Canberra over the past year, I've been thinking about what political leadership actually should be. Political leadership should be about building a consensus for change, giving people a map to follow, and bringing together different parties to achieve an outcome. It's been a fortnight. Expect to see many more baseball caps as PM 30 keeps distinguishing himself from PM 29, writes Annabel Crabb. But instead, discussion about leadership has become one solely about the machismo of individuals taking on the mob. There is something inherently undemocratic about this trend. It leads to a yearning for autocracy and, whether our American friends realise or acknowledge it, that is exactly what they have given themselves. It is alarming that so many young people in polls — roughly 30 per cent across western democracies — rate democracy so poorly or even as not essential. Billionaire businessman Frank Lowy observed on Thursday that ""democracy needs to be nurtured and treated with care"". Voters increasingly seek leaders who seem strong, who advance black-and-white propositions and have the will to pursue them. A focus on leaders rather than parties has only accelerated as the traditional parties have lost any central idea to frame their cause. (Consider the morphing of the ""conservative"" wing of the Liberal Party from the free marketeers of the 1980s to the socially conservative market interveners of 2018 who look for all the world like the old Country Party). A lack of a central idea means the parties have not only lost their clarity of message but also their commitment to a higher goal. Individual MPs no longer have a sense that they are working towards a greater, common good. A parliamentary party room can be much more easily pulled apart because of a lack of central purpose. The stark result of this is that leaders of political parties begin their time in the job with a much shakier and more transient hold on authority than leaders of even 20 years ago. They have less authority, and less freedom to move, than they once may have had. We rarely talk about ""the Government"" or ""the Opposition"". But we talk a lot about the battle between ""the Prime Minister"" and ""the Leader of the Opposition"". Both Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten arrived in Federal Parliament as the most impatient of men. Both felt entitled to be accelerated into positions of seniority. They therefore had to learn the art of leadership, as opposed to occupying leadership positions, on the job. And now we have yet another leader having to do the same thing. It says much for the derelict state of our politics that the focus is on how he learns to lead his own party, rather than the country. Laura Tingle is 7.30's chief political correspondent.

49,"'Yeah Scotty!': Cronulla locals get behind ScoMo, their Sharks man in the top job",society," Politics Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Cronulla: The Shire's locals get behind their man in the top job It's 4:00pm on Friday in Cronulla on Sydney's south. Tradies are sinking a few well-earned schooners at the local institution, Northies pub, as a few surfers catch the last waves of the day. The sun is setting on another beautiful day in The Shire, the colloquial term for the Sutherland Shire, a place locals refer to as ""God's country"". But for the people of Cronulla — and one resident in particular — things changed forever at 6:00pm on August 24. Their boy, the Cronulla Sharks' number one ticket holder, officially became the 30th Prime Minister of Australia. And outside Scott Morrison's electoral office on the corner of the coastal suburb's main shopping mall, the pride was palpable. ""Yeahhhh Scotty,"" a young tradie yelled out the window of his ute as he drove past the office. ""Goooo Sharks!"" As the ABC walked around the main shopping area of the coastal suburb which, for some around Australia, still harbours negative connotations from last decade's race riots, most residents were backing their boy ScoMo to get the job done. And done well. Most said they had seen him around — when not in Canberra he lives in a nearby suburb — and, generally, they liked him. When he was in town he would come to local businesses and had a genuine interest in the local community, they said. ""He's a straight shooter,"" was one response. ""He seems honest to me, he wasn't involved in all that backstabbing,"" was another. ""He's a liked guy around here in The Shire,"" local Peter Hughes told the ABC. ""People liked what he did with the immigration stuff, I mean it's a conservative place you know. ""But I reckon he's got a chance to do something different."" It was the same in the local barber shop, a place where the new PM had come in for the occasional trim. ""He was a good treasurer, wasn't he?"" said barber Matty Youssef, whose shop is about 20 metres from the new Prime Minister's office, asking for confirmation from his customer. ""Yeah he was, I reckon,"" was the reply. For Mazz Parker and her daughter Ellie, one element stood out above everything else. ""I don't follow politics and all that,"" she said. ""All I know is he's a Sharks supporter, and that means he's a bloody good bloke to me."" The people of Cronulla are proud of their town. In fact, over at Northies pub, Shire pride was a constant theme. ""We get a bum wrap in this place,"" local and self-employed contractor Matt McGloin said. ""But bloody hell, have a look at where we are — it's beautiful. And this pub like's the Zambezi River — everyone comes in for a drink."" Mr McGloin's mate, Sharks supporter and local electrician supervisor Derek Field, said he hoped Mr Morrison would bring back unity to the Liberal Party. ""I mean bloody hell, it's been a farce hasn't it,"" he said. ""It's great to see someone from The Shire as the PM, and I like what he did on the immigration front. ""But we'll just have to wait and see. Hopefully he brings in some better policies and brings back some respect to the Parliament."" But along with the admiration, there was also indifference, scepticism and disgust. Some Cronulla locals the ABC approached just rolled their eyes when asked if they wanted to talk about Scott Morrison or federal politics. Others were a little more direct. ""They are all a bunch of selfish d***heads,"" one local said as he walked by in the mall. ""Tell 'em to sort it out."" Small business owner Craig Bulmer said Australian politics had become a ""laughing-stock"", and Australian politics was as bad as the US and Donald Trump. ""It seems the politicians just have these personal vendettas,"" he said over a coffee. ""They don't like someone, so they just get rid of them. ""What kind of example are we setting to our children? I'm pretty disgusted by it actually."" His daughter, 11-year-old Jessica, who is studying politics at school, is set to head to Canberra next week for a school excursion. She said she understood what happened to Malcolm Turnbull but said, ""I don't really understand why"". The ABC asked if she might want to become a politician. ""Hmmm, I don't think so,"" she said. Finishing off with a beer at Croyden Lane wine bar, the ABC met owner Johnny Rechichi — who was proudly sending an Instagram post saying he now owned ""the bar under the Prime Minister's office"". ""At least people might be able to find us a little better now,"" he said. ""ScoMo did come in here a couple times, I just left him alone, he was probably scheming,"" he said with a laugh. He said owning a small business was tough, and he just wanted one thing: more stability. ""I mean that's not too much to ask is it?"" he said. ""We live in a bloody great place here, and I'm not just talking about Cronulla, the whole country is a great place to live — and this kind of stuff just doesn't help anyone.""

50,analysis: The secret to Aldi's success is choosing what not to do,society,"  Aldi supermarket strategy is unlikely to challenge Woolworths and Coles Dick Smith has laid the blame for closing his Australian-made processed food lines squarely at the feet of Aldi Australia. He accused the German retailer of ""extreme capitalism"" and warned the CEOs of Woolworths and Coles that ""unless your companies move towards [Aldi's limited range and high proportion of private brands], you will very likely become uncompetitive"". But this betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of Aldi's strategy and the limits of its appeal in the Australian market. An important element of Aldi's strategy is a severely limited range of ""preselected"" products, overwhelmingly private brands. The company's smaller range (some 1,500 store-keeping units as opposed to 20,000 to 30,000 in a large Coles or Woolworths outlet) has several advantages — in terms of store footprints, warehousing infrastructure and supplier discounts, to name a few. A proportion of these savings are passed on to consumers to ensure their appeal with households wanting to stretch their shopping dollars further. This strategy and disciplined execution propelled the company's growth. From its first two stores in the Sydney suburbs of Marrickville and Bankstown, Aldi gradually expanded across the eastern seaboard. It was not until 2016 that Aldi started opening stores in South Australia and Western Australia. These new territories promised significant growth opportunities while store openings in the established territories were largely restricted to gap-filling. By 2018, Aldi was operating more than 500 outlets around Australia and claiming roughly 13 per cent of the Australian supermarket industry. Aldi's gain in market share has overwhelmingly come at the expense of the smaller, independent supermarkets (IGA-affiliated as well as others). Coles and Woolworths have chiefly responded to Aldi through price cuts and by boosting their share of private brands. While competition in the Australian supermarket sector has increased, it remains a lucrative oasis in comparison to international markets. As its stores now span the entire nation, Aldi's growth can be expected to slow down. The company is unlikely to ""turn on"" and overwhelm Coles and Woolworths, as Smith predicts, because of the inherent limitations of the Aldi formula. Aldi has successfully appealed to a particular segment of the market. It is a segment of shoppers prepared to trade low prices (coupled with sound product quality) for a variety of conveniences offered by traditional supermarkets. These shoppers readily accept Aldi's highly restrictive range of product, the lack of manufacturers' brands, and austere stores with minimal service at the cash register or in store. The company has also been successful in expanding this segment, by convincing a growing number of people to do at least part of their shopping with Aldi and accept the trade-off at the heart of its offering. But the majority of Australian shoppers prefer to do (the bulk of) their shopping with the two incumbents (Coles and Woolworths who still account for more than two-thirds of the market) as well as a shrinking number of independent supermarkets and a growing set of alternative sources such as farmers' markets or subscription-based retailers (Costco). Aldi exemplifies strategy scholar Michael Porter's dictum that the essence of strategy is choosing what not to do. In embracing the ""Aldi way"", the company has made hard strategic choices. Its strategy appeals to a sizeable segment of the Australian public. But it's turning away shoppers who value things other than what's on offer at Aldi — larger choice, established brands, more service, plusher stores, in-store bakeries and delis or expanded fresh food sections. As a result, Aldi's growth in Australia is going to reach its limits. As far back as 2016, chief executive Tom Daunt acknowledged that growth opportunities were slowing in existing territories. He also acknowledged the onset of cannibalisation between existing Aldi stores, a sure-fire indicator that their segment was becoming saturated: ""Increasingly those stores on the eastern seaboard are less often in virgin catchments and more often than not for the majority of those stores there is some impact on other existing Aldi stores,"" he said. A recent UBS report also picked up the increase in cannibalisation among Aldi stores. UBS analysts suggested Aldi store cannibalisation in South Australia and Western Australia was reaching levels not far behind the more established territories. This indicates that saturation might be achieved sooner in new markets, and puts growth objectives in these states in doubt. Since its arrival in 2001, the company has benefited the Australian public by injecting much-needed competition into the local grocery retail scene, thereby boosting Australian consumers' spending power. While its success is testimony to the appeal of the Aldi formula, growth will inevitably peter out and the company will not overrun Australia's existing retail giants. Aldi's experience in Australia exemplifies the benefits as well as the limitations of clear and focussed strategy.

51,'Auslan is for everybody': Calls for signing to be taught as a second language in schools,society,"  'Auslan is for everybody': Should signing be taught as an inclusive second language for children in schools? Could redefining Auslan as an acceptable second language for hearing children potentially create a demand that could provide opportunities for many, not just the deaf? Mother Maria Roccon, of Unanderra, New South Wales, who is deaf and supports three children, one of whom is also deaf, believes it could. ""My grandfather, my mother, my brother, me, and then my son Kayden — we are all deaf,"" Ms Roccon said. Kayden, 11, wears a hearing aid and, like his mother, has developed skills in lip reading. ""I never pushed or forced them to learn Auslan. It was up to them,"" Ms Roccon said. ""But as my hearing deteriorates I would like them to learn, so I am trying to encourage them now to learn the language. ""Kayden's hearing is deteriorating also, so I think it's important we all learn Auslan now. ""Auslan is a broad language where you can see everything. ""The feelings, emotions … it's just more understandable,"" she said of Auslan, which is short for Australian sign language. ""When you speak it's just words, but with Auslan you can see it all — facial expressions, body language, everything is clearer."" Ms Roccon's eldest daughter, Gabriella, is not deaf but can sign — in fact, she has three first languages. As a child of deaf adults (CODA), Auslan was her first language and she used it at home growing up. In addition to naturally learning to speak English, her mother's family is Italian so Gabriella learned to speak that too. ""There weren't really any difficulties in learning sign language for me,"" she said. ""I grew up with deaf friends — my mum's friends were deaf, everyone was signing … it was normal. Ms Roccon's other daughter, 13-year-old Taylor, is learning French at school. ""Is she enjoying it? No. Is she learning? No,"" Ms Roccon said. ""The thing is, she comes home and who is she going to practice with? ""So I've asked the school if she can pull out of that subject and learn Auslan [instead]."" Acting principal at the school, James Rogers, said the school offered four NSW Education Standards Authority-endorsed languages within the curriculum. ""Auslan is not currently offered, but provisions are made for an Auslan interpreter for key events or on request,"" he said. ""The Illawarra Grammar School looks with anticipation at any NESA curriculum developments that allow the school to cater to the broad interests of our students. ""As with all elective courses, student interest and available teaching resources are key factors in the decision-making process."" NESA media director Michael Charlton confirmed that in Stage 4 (Years 7 and 8) schools were required to teach 100 hours of a language, and this could include Auslan. ""I don't understand why they are not providing it at schools because they provide French, they provide Italian, Japanese,"" Ms Roccon said. ""I just think it won't harm to add an extra language in school."" Unfortunately, according to a document from parliament dated August 2017, the timeframe for implementation of the Auslan curriculum in NSW could take three to five years. ""In order to develop a new syllabus, a feasibility study need to be completed. Once the feasibility study has been completed it will provide feedback about the viability of the course."" ""The recognised timeframe for a feasibility study and syllabus developement would be three to five years."" In short, NESA need to implement the Auslan curriculum, outcomes and indicators still need to be developed, and once the feasibility study is complete Auslan needs to be noted as a viable language to be taught in schools. The not-for-profit Deaf Society also advocates for sharing Auslan with the hearing world and supports making Auslan widely available in schools. ""Auslan is used by thousands of people across Australia and while it is deeply rooted in the Australian deaf community, it is also an Australian language — which means it's your language,"" chief executive Leonie Jackson said. ""We have been teaching Auslan for over 30 years and have seen first-hand the inclusion that it creates, from the barista that can have a chat with his regular deaf customer to the warehouse team that learnt Auslan so they could better communicate with their deaf colleague. ""Deaf people have much to contribute to the community — the more people that learn Auslan, the more inclusive our society will be for deaf people."" Many hearing people who sign go on to become skilled Auslan interpreters, able to work anywhere from court rooms and hospitals to on stage and television to meet accessibility needs across a variety of industries. In spite of this, Australia lacks the numbers needed when it comes to Auslan interpreters. TAFE NSW offers a Certificate II in Auslan, as presented by the Deaf Society. It said it found it increasingly difficult to find employable Auslan trainers despite offering classes to the public. Since 2015 the subject Auslan has been approved as a School Developed Board Endorsed Course (SDBEC). According to NESA, ""a SDBEC is proposed by a school to address the identified local need of a group of students at that school"". Ms Roccon argued that by redefining Auslan as an acceptable second language for hearing children, it would help create that demand and provide opportunities for them as interpreters. However, one reason public schools do not offer Auslan as a second language is due to a lack of trained Auslan teachers. Mr Charlton suggested one way to combat this could be to incorporate training into teachers' professional development hours. ""NSW teachers are required to complete 100 hours of professional development every five years,"" he said. ""This can include Auslan, which can be studied at TAFE and the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children."" The Roccon family believes Auslan is useful for other members of the hearing community, such as people whose first language is not English, people who are hard of hearing, older people who have lost their hearing, and young children who are learning how to communicate. ""It's a good talent to have, especially if someone comes into my work, I can help them,"" Gabriella said. Other hearing people to whom the language is highly useful are the children of deaf adults. ""The best way to learn how to sign is to mix with the deaf community,"" retired teacher David Beswick said. At 88 years of age, Mr Beswick, who was a teacher working with the deaf and hearing for 50 years, is one of Australia's oldest CODAs. He regularly visits the Deaf Society's community group in Wollongong on Friday mornings. Auslan is Mr Beswick's first language. As the eldest of three, he grew up with deaf parents, becoming a child caught between the hearing and the deaf worlds. ""In a sense you are living with your parents in the deaf world, but outside in the wider community, you're in the hearing world,"" he said. ""The deaf regard me as a bit old fashioned but they recognise that I am very fast in finger spelling, because that was the norm when I was growing up."" Mr Beswick said people's attitudes to signing had evolved over the years. ""I used to feel very awkward when out with my parents signing in public. People were curious I suppose,"" he said. ""People now sign in public. [It is like they are] extravagantly saying 'I am proud of my language'. ""It's a thing to be admired — and in fact it quite often results in people saying 'Well, I'm going to get a second language and Auslan looks to be one that is useful'."" Mr Beswick said hearing people who used Auslan were readily welcomed to the signing world. ""Those people who come into the deaf community and learn signing, Auslan, can become very skilled,"" he said. ""In fact I feel embarrassed with the skill of many who have acquired that language.""

52,opinion: Why can't we all just get along? Because we seem to have forgotten how,society,"  Civility is on the decline and we all bear responsibility Standards of common courtesy and decency seem to be disappearing fast from our society. At one time, we might have looked to our civic leaders — including politicians — to set an example when it comes to living among people whose opinions we neither share nor like. But the ongoing spat between two senators suggests we might have met a new low when it comes to respectful behaviour. And it's not just the politicians who are behaving badly. John Collier, principal of an elite private school in Sydney, has written to warn parents about the abusive behaviour frequently directed at teachers. Dr Collier recognised that a number of factors might explain this spike in rudeness. For one thing, parents are increasingly anxious about their kids' performance and fret about their future prospects. For another, parents who fork out substantial sums each year in fees sometimes think — wrongly — they are entitled to treat teachers like lackeys. Schools must teach young people how to take part in community — a role threatened by the kind of parental behaviour Dr Collier has flagged. But he also pegged parental agitation to what he identified as a more general decline in civility. Civility is more than being polite. It also includes showing respect for others — both those we know and those we don't. In other words, civility is what equips us for living daily with strangers. Respecting those we know is easy; especially since we will most likely have dealings with them on a regular basis. But strangers are those we may never encounter again and to whom we have no emotional ties. However, civility has another element: doing the right thing even when it might not be in our own self-interest to do so. Being civil means we desist from doing what would be pleasing to us for the sake of good relations with strangers. When a video went viral of the French President insisting that a teenager address him as ""Mr President"" and not ""Manu"", many felt such deference to history and respect for office could not come soon enough. When French President Emmanuel Macron ticked off a cheeky teenager at a solemn commemoration for World War II heroes, he was — quite properly — recalling the boy to an appropriate standard of civil behaviour, and reminding him that the values of the French Revolution (liberté, egalité and fraternité) have not displaced the virtue of civility. Being polite, showing respect, and exercising self-restraint don't depend on our feelings about other people — especially strangers. Civility is about how we should treat others and is quite independent of how we feel about them; whether it's the French president or the person next to you on the bus. The problem is that these days we place a premium on individual freedom and personal autonomy. We want to make decisions about our lives and do whatever it is that happens to please us at that moment — and never mind what anyone else wants. There is a ""downward assimilation"" at work here. When we no longer care about what others think of us and simply want to please ourselves, we eventually loosen the customary moorings of self-esteem that were anchored in the ways we were perceived and treated by others. But you can't have freedom without responsibility. I am free to put my feet up on the train seat opposite or sport vivid and confronting tattoos. But when things go wrong, I have to be willing to accept full responsibility for the consequences of my actions — whether it's a fine from the guard, or failure to make the short-list for a job. Some free speech absolutists hold the misconception that individual freedom from constraint is the high point of social and political evolution that trumps every other demand upon us. Only then, they often say, can we be truly free to think and act just as and when we please. But that view is wrong: it ignores society's need for a common culture that we share and in which we live together. One reason multiculturalism is becoming less popular is not that Australians are racist, but that the fetish of diversity is loosening those essential social bonds of civility. Personality traits reflecting how well we treat others can be separated into politeness and compassion, which are each linked to different kinds of prosocial behaviours. Have we lost our civility already? No, we have not, but we are increasingly confused about what civil behaviour requires of us. So we need to pay heed to the kind of warning issued by Dr Collier. Schools and community and religious groups all have a role to play in promoting civility in our society. But civility is primarily a matter of how individuals engage with one another. It can be strengthened or weakened by what governments and other organisations do, but the health of civility in Australia ultimately depends on each of us taking responsibility for how we behave to others each day.

53,opinion: Pauline Hanson's breakdown doesn't fix what's wrong with the major parties,society,"  Pauline Hanson's breakdown doesn't fix what's wrong with the major parties All this gloating is deafening. There is almost a sense of celebration that Pauline Hanson's One Nation party has hit troubled water. While some are cheering the fall of Senator Hanson herself, others are proclaiming personality politics will never work in Australia. ""Just look at Clive Palmer and Nick Xenophon,"" they say. They are missing the point. There is huge and growing frustration with the two major parties. Senator Hanson's faltering power won't silence that. Average Joe and Joanna on the street have no more faith in Bill Shorten than Malcolm Turnbull. Both leaders are seen by many as being out of touch with the real issues of down-to-earth people doing it tough in this country. There is a sense that they are both trading shallow sound bites and virtue signalling without having genuine insight, understanding or empathy. Or clue, frankly. Rather than digging in and really getting to grips with tackling terrible atrocities in Aboriginal communities, they're busy polishing their white ribbons. No-one wants to discuss attempting to tackle all domestic violence equally. There is no faith that either party would seriously rip up inefficient government departments like the Child Support Agency and start again. And the country's debt is so immense that any economic discussions involve fantasy Monopoly money rather than being realistic. Meanwhile, the citizenship fiasco has anyone outside politics shaking their heads despairing of those who are meant to be running the country while the rest of us currently endure sleepless nights preparing for tax time. Politicians live in a different world — and they can't even organise that. Senator Brian Burston may now have left One Nation to sit as an independent but this doesn't conveniently magic all of the frustrations over the major parties away. The ground swell of fury will find its voice through independents. When former Labor leader Mark Latham was recently asked about whether he'd re-enter politics he described conversations with minor parties as being ""like herding cats"". But Australia will find its ""cat whisperer"" — a voice of reason that will enable these strong, growing, independent players to unite for the common good. Crucially, egos will need to be left at the door and serious discussion placed on the table about cohesive policy offerings. Right now there are many who simply don't see their leader. They don't want to vote for either of the major parties because they know it won't instigate real change. This utter dissatisfaction with politics runs deeper than a quick easy fix; Mr Shorten may be different but would unlikely be any better. The independents haven't nailed it — yet. Those who trust Cory Bernardi's conservatism may like a fraction of David Leyonhjelm's views on less state interference, while agreeing with elements of Senator Hanson's tough stance on immigration. They are pieces of a jigsaw that is yet to fully take shape. To suggest — and dismiss — Senator Hanson's appeal as simply being a ""battler"" is to miss the real depth and complexity of frustration that's festering in this country. Politics is speaking a language that isn't resonating. Talk is focused on a worldview that isn't aligning with how real people see the world they're challenged by. But they can't express themselves because someone somewhere will decide to be offended. Politics is increasingly being viewed as little more than an elite sport, a pastime with a juicy expenses account that enables a luxurious lifestyle rather than actually having to work. It has drifted away in a bubble and is removed from the daily reality of debt and crippling lack of hope that many are grappling with. This is the mood that an independent ""cat whisperer"" could capture — but, as we all know, political success can't be purely achieved by a mood so it's what comes next that counts. Anyone thinking the demise of Senator Hanson's party means this mood will conveniently dissipate is in for a shock. And taking the time to hear what's really being said rather than dismissing the mood entirely would be a valuable first step. Corrine Barraclough is a freelance writer.

55,"When a freak accident severed Terry's hands and leg, a hospital became home",society," Posted 
    
      June 09, 2018 08:33:58 When a freak basketball accident severed his hands and leg, Terry Vo spent six months of his childhood getting familiar with the corridors of Princess Margaret Hospital.  It's been more than a decade since Terry Vo spent six months in Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) as a 10-year-old boy, after both his hands and one of his legs were cut off in a horrific accident while playing basketball at a friend's house. As the now 23-year-old medical student sits in the near-empty hospital room where he spent half a year of his childhood, his perpetual smile momentarily leaves his face as the memories from his time at PMH come flooding back.  ""This room was a part of my life for six months,"" Mr Vo says. ""Every day, every night — and I guess it's kind of sad, but I'm glad in a way. ""I am not sure how to describe the feeling. It's nostalgic."" Mr Vo quickly notices the overwhelming silence of the once bustling ward. It has just closed in preparation for the move to the new Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) on Sunday. The nurses' station is still. There are no children in the playroom. There are no worried parents pacing the hallways. ""The beeps, the bells, the alerts,"" Mr Vo remembers. ""It's so quiet. It's very eerie.""   Even without the normal bustle and chaos of the hospital, every part of the room — the four walls, the windows, the bed — remains hugely significant to Mr Vo. ""Like, even that cupboard over there,"" he says, laughing. ""It's just really strange being here again and seeing it, not from a hospital bed.""  The horrific accident happened on a Saturday night of a long weekend in March, 2005. Mr Vo was at a friend's house playing basketball with his mates, and was about to head inside to grab a drink when someone threw him the ball. ""Everyone was like, 'yeah, dunk it, dunk it!'"" Mr Vo recalls. ""I ran up and I dunked it and I held on and I remember it being very, very quiet. Everything went silent. ""I started to hear the walls crack from left to right, and it was like slow motion."" Mr Vo remembers closing his eyes as the garage wall to which the hoop was attached collapsed onto him. ""I didn't feel any pain just because of the shock."" Often extreme trauma is coupled with memory loss, but Mr Vo remembers every moment. ""When I opened my eyes, it was all gone,"" he says. Both hands and his left leg had been severed. ""There was a bone sticking out of my right arm and my left arm was torn."" ""My foot was cut off as well … I could still feel it but I couldn't move it."" Mr Vo tried to walk, unaware of his extreme injuries. ""But obviously, I fell down. I landed on my elbows,"" he says.  ""That's when sound started coming back to me and I heard screaming from the parents."" But even through the pain and shock, he began telling jokes to calm those around him. Paramedics arrived and asked his age. ""I'm 10 and I've got 90 to go,"" he told them. Mr Vo remembers seeing the emergency sign outside PMH, the hospital ceiling as he was rushed to surgery and ""dreams and reality"" mixing together in the intensive care unit. ""The next thing I knew, I was in this room,"" he says, looking around. What he does not remember is the eight-hour surgery performed well into the night by three surgical teams. Specialist plastic surgeon Robert Love led the complex operation to save Mr Vo's limbs.  ""It became immediately obvious that this was a very unusual injury,"" he recalls. ""[We knew] we would need to muster all of the resources that a hospital of Princess Margaret's excellence would be able to muster."" The hospital itself almost stood still as medical staff, some who weren't even on call, rushed to help. A complex plan was quickly mapped out and the staff got to work. ""This is where it was very unusual to try and mount three separate teams so that all three parts could actually be replanted synchronously within an acceptable period, such that it would give all the parts the maximal chance of survival,"" Dr Love says. ""That meant multiple different teams. ""Whilst in the operating theatre … there was a feel of enormous comradery and enormous spirit."" Dr Love wasn't just impressed by his surgical team, but the child whose limbs they were desperately trying to reattach. ""People will approach their injuries in many different ways,"" Dr Love says. ""Terry himself has touched the hearts of many of those who were involved in his care because of his positive attitude and his preparedness to find good in every part of his care.""  Mr Vo was able to maintain that attitude even when doctors were forced to amputate his foot nine days later because the reattachment was unsuccessful. Dr Love told reporters at the time his young patient was ""a little bit happy, and a little bit sad"" at the prospect. ""He saw the need for the foot to be amputated and was far more accepting of it, and far more in favour of it, than the staff or the parents,"" Dr Love said at a media briefing. Mr Vo was fitted for a prosthetic limb, leading to one of his favourite memories during his recovery. ""I took my first steps in the corridor outside this room,"" he says. ""All the nurses were looking. I remember them cheering me on."" Those momentous steps are just one of many significant achievements which took place in the corridors, rooms, and operating theatres of PMH over more than 100 years.  The hospital opened its doors in 1909 after a determined campaign led by Perth businessman Charles Moore. It opened with 40 beds and one operating theatre. There would be few West Australian families who didn't have at least one tale to tell from PMH — a visit for a high temperature that caused alarm, a broken arm or something more serious.  From the neon pink emergency lights, to cartoon characters that adorned the walls, to the starlight room and the sounds of Radio Lollipop, those intricate details remain etched in the memories of its young patients. It was a decade ago that the Carpenter Labor government revealed a pledge to build the new Perth Children's Hospital. PCH was dealt several construction blows, including a lead contamination scare in the drinking water, which contributed to its lengthy delay. But finally, three years behind schedule, a staged opening began in May, and the first elective surgeries have been carried out. Now PCH is ready to take on the full responsibility of the state's sick children.  At 7:00am on Sunday, PMH will close its emergency department and the new Perth Children's Hospital will open its own. The state will say goodbye to an institution, but its impact and memories impressed upon those who needed it will not be forgotten. ""PMH, it means … it's almost like another family,"" Mr Vo says. ""It's weird to associate happiness with a hospital. I think that's a really, really awesome thing to have."" PCH will allow current and future staff to provide WA families with another century of quality care. ""The heart of healthcare in Western Australia rests very, very much with all of the providers and the staff,"" Dr Love says. ""I would say that the heart has remained, it's just been transplanted to a new site.""  Topics:

56,"Leader of 'Jedi faith' seeks recognition, based on census numbers",society,"  May the 4th: Australian Jedi 'head of the faith' calls for peace and formal recognition The ""head of the Jedi faith"" in Australia, Peter Lee, cites strong census numbers and a thriving online community as evidence of a practising Jedi population in Australia. The Lithgow-based Star Wars fan said that in 2001 more than 70,000 Australians marked themselves as Jedi in that year's census. Initially taken as a flippant response, the figure would go on to remain relatively stable, with 64,390 Australians marking Jedi as their religion in 2011, up from 58,053 in 2006. Concerned about wider data implications, the Australian Bureau of Statistics removed any Jedi answers in the 2016 census and pooled them under ""not defined"". This raised questions around the definition of a belief system and freedom of practice. ""You can never get that question wrong. If a person decides that their wheelie bin is their God, then we have absolutely no right to deny him, or to question it,"" Mr Lee said, as Star Wars fans around the world marked May the 4th. ""I'm saying for me, I believe in The Force. It's real, I've felt it. I've used it in my life, I've used it to heal myself and others."" Mr Lee became the spokesperson for the faction after the 2001 census and has since spearheaded the movement. ""I declared myself Jedi during the 2001 census because I saw something happening and I wanted to be a part of it. I saw that people were starting to say 'We're allowed to believe in what we want to believe in'. ""In every census since and every May 4th since I'm the most public person who stands up and says I'm a Jedi and I have no problem talking about it."" When declaring the 2016 census outcomes, the ABS confirmed that, as a non-recognised religion, all Jedi answers would be removed. The Atheist Foundation of Australia also campaigned against those considering marking themselves Jedi as their effective non-answers would skew the data. Policy, future infrastructure and fund allocation are, to some extent, informed by census results. But Mr Lee believes the fact the number of people identifying as Jedi in the censuses prior to 2016 remained stable, is cause enough to open a serious discussion on the addition of a new religion. ""I am calling precedent on this one. We don't have a membership base of 50,000 Australians. But what we do have an ongoing consistency in the last three censuses where there's a consistent 50,000 Australians who identify themselves as being Jedi. So therefore, we have 50,000 Jedi in Australia and as the Jedi faith,"" Mr Lee said. Fearing ridicule, Jedis are typically reluctant to declare themselves Jedi in public, a factor Mr Lee contributes to the group struggling for traction in society. ""We have a great deal of trouble getting people to gather together and to publicly stand there and say I'm a Jedi. And that could be because of the level of bullying in society. ""At least once a week we have to ban someone from off our Facebook group for coming on and being a smartarse about 'Where's your light sabre?' or 'You guys believe in Yoda, how silly is that?' Blocked. Easy. We'll talk to anyone who is asking a serious question."" The tenets of the Jedi faith are more familiar than many people might think. Jedi's practice meditation to maintain calmness and believe all animals, all plants, all people and all things share a life force or energy. George Lucas based his Jedi on the Samurai and a class of warrior monks. Everyone knows Luke, Leia and Han — but do you know your Twi'leks from your Togrutas, or your Tuskens from your Tauntauns. The Force is based on Asian mysticism and the concept of the life force, such as Japan's Ki, India's Prana or China's Chi. ""Two thirds of the world's population believe in The Force. They just have a different name for it,"" Mr Lee said. It is a reference he has exploited in the name of education. ""As a martial artist, I teach people about the life force energy that we call 'Chi' in Kung Fu. But I found it much easier to call it The Force. And my students had a much quicker understanding, because Star Wars is actually part of our culture."" The enduring appeal of Star Wars can be found in its use of the Epic Saga story formula; a story style that uses moral tales to illustrate right and wrong. ""George Lucas didn't just come up with a story out of the blue. It is based on the moral tales of ancient history, a modern Gilgamesh or Bhagavad Gita, both of which are long religious stories,"" Mr Lee said. ""It's a formula. We as a species, it's embedded in our DNA. It's accepted by us as The Story."" This May the 4th, Mr Lee was keen to issue a statement on behalf of the Jedi faith in Australia, to all Jedi and non-Jedi members, in the spirit of the day. ""As Jedi, we strive to live our lives in harmony with the life force energy of the universe,'' he said. ""We strive to live harmony with all beings, with nature itself. We seek to make peace within ourselves. This Star Wars Day we ask all people to strive towards making peace within. Because once we have peace within, once we have inner peace, we will find it easier to make peace in our families, our actions and our world.""

57,opinion: Why we mustn't squeeze social sporting teams out of public spaces,society,"  Why we mustn't squeeze social sporting teams out of public spaces Park soccer, social cricket and street basketball bring the public spaces of our cities to life. For many of the most marginalised communities, access to public space for sport is crucial for developing and maintaining a sense of belonging. But as populations grow and competition for playing fields, courts and parks becomes fiercer, many communities are losing access to their sporting spaces. Our research project is exploring informal team sport, social inclusion and urban space in Sydney and two other cities, Singapore and London. We are focusing on ""pick-up sport"" —  regular or semi-regular team sports played in public spaces where people join in on a ""turn up and play"" basis. On Friday nights in Sydney's Blacktown, people of all ages from Filipino and African backgrounds play basketball in neighbourhood stadiums and public courts. In Redfern, Aboriginal youth play street ball on outdoor playgrounds in a rapidly gentrifying neighbourhood. Ashfield Park in Sydney's inner west comes alive in the late afternoons as Sudanese, Nepalese, Indian, Chinese, Afghan, Iranian and Turkish people gather for park soccer. On Friday nights, a group of Colombian men play against Chileans. Both groups wear homemade team jerseys. On Sunday afternoons in summer the informal Sydney Nepalese Soccer Club uses the park to train. Later in the evening, men from Nepal and India play social cricket. These games have histories. Many of the players have gathered weekly for years. In some cases, informal teams have evolved into official ethnic leagues. For new arrivals, getting involved in pick-up sport can be an important first step into the friendships and social networks that help a newcomer with settlement, integration and belonging. Structured sport programs are often used to increase community cohesion and assist migrant settlement. However, many marginalised city inhabitants prefer informal sport to official club sport. Registration costs, language barriers and stigmatisation of racial minorities — including Aboriginal youth — make joining an official club difficult. For transient groups, like temporary migrants, the constraints of organised club sport are prohibitive. And, of course, women face a number of barriers to participating in sport. For many, just finding and registering for a formal neighbourhood team is a leap into the unknown. Pick-up sport, on the other hand, allows for relaxed rhythms of encounter. These unhurried interactions allow space for the ""slow cook"" that is needed for new forms of community and ""multicultural conviviality"" to emerge. Interactions across ethnic and socioeconomic lines, and between newly arrived and longer-term residents, help city communities to thrive. Pick-up sport provides the perfect opportunity for this. But this social activity is increasingly under threat. The threat is palpable for one group of migrant and refugee men we have been observing in Sydney's inner west. They have been playing social soccer in the same park for over a decade. The players come from Afro-Caribbean, Chinese, Afghan, Iranian, Turkish, Nepalese and South American backgrounds. They are a mixture of longer-time immigrants and relative newcomers, including refugees and international students, with ages ranging from early 20s to 60s. The group is always evolving as people come and go. For these men, playing soccer gives them a real sense of community and belonging. It also cultivates an openness to meeting new people who regularly join in. Their games have run through summer, while official club games run over winter. Traditionally, this sporting ground has been happily shared between the formal and informal teams. However, the council has recently started renting the fields for private summer competitions and training, ending its support for ""time share"" between paid and unpaid use. The group of men were reportedly politely told, ""Sorry you can't play here"" and that the clubs were paying, had booked the space, and thus had a ""right"" to it. The team has since been forced to play on sloping bumpy ground among the trees. These displaced players feel angry, marginalised and discriminated against. Their long-term use of the space was not recognised, nor was the social value their activity brings to the area. This story is repeated around Sydney and across the country as sporting clubs compete for space and increasingly cash-strapped local councils look for ways to increase revenue. We met a social soccer team of young Muslim girls who were displaced because, they were told, the council needed funds from paying club sport to maintain the fields. Meanwhile the New South Wales State Government is pushing ahead with plans to spend more than $2 billion on two major Sydney stadiums, despite considerable community backlash. These commercialising forces ultimately undermine the social benefits of both formal and informal sport and the inclusivity of cities. Beyond sport, these instances raise important questions about urban planning, gentrification and the privatisation of public space. These forces have real consequences for the formation of new communities and integration in diverse cities. As the sociologist Iris Marion Young argues in her book, Justice and the Politics of Difference, public space is where the city's strangers come together. Sport can produce great community benefits. We urge planners and politicians to consider the important role that open spaces have for informal social team sport in enhancing community cohesion in our big cities.

58,"opinion: Why where you're educated, where you live and who your parents are matter",society,"  Inequality isn't getting worse, so why do we feel like it is? Inequality drives a wedge between those seen to be benefitting from economic growth and those who are not, undermining social cohesion. Conversely, improvements in income, wealth and the opportunities that underpin them, when shared broadly through society, support economic development and proactive economic reform agendas. We should seek to ensure that each person is offered as equal a starting point as any other. Has Australia done enough to ensure equality of opportunity? Have we done enough to deliver the ""ladders of opportunity""? The answer to that is in some areas, no. A very large number of people have come to feel that they are just cogs in a machine — counting for nothing more than their capacity to work and vote. They are angry. They are disappointed. They are vengeful, writes Simon Longstaff. Since the global financial crisis, concerns around inequality may have grown — yet measures of income inequality in Australia have not risen. By international standards we are doing OK. To give some international context, we rank better than 13 other OECD economies but worse than 21 others. From the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, while the proportion of households on lower incomes decreased the proportion on much higher incomes increased. Since the global financial crisis, the distribution of household income has been stable. Income inequality, according to the HILDA survey, has remained largely the same since 2001. Those concerned that Australia is becoming a less egalitarian society may be surprised by these results. But there are some other important issues to consider. The first is weak wages growth. Since 2007-08, income growth has stalled — average weekly household incomes grew by just $27 to $1,009 per week over this period. Stagnant wages growth is a significant factor in people feeling as if inequality is on the rise. Another is the increasing income of the top 1 per cent of income earners. Concern about the impact of technology on the structure of our workforce is another. Finally, despite our strong egalitarian ""fair go"" culture, where you live, go to school and work and the education levels of your parents still has a significant impact on your future prospects. While overall Australia is doing well, there are four areas where we need to do better: educational inequality, postcode inequality, intergenerational inequality and emerging technological inequality. These issues go to the heart of inequality of opportunity. Australia has a class system, and it has real consequences in people's lives. Explore the full RN series. We know there are significant gaps in education achievement between students with lower- or higher-educated parents. This gap can be up to 4.5 years of schooling. Rural schools face a significant shortage of teachers while disadvantaged schools can suffer from a more limited curriculum. Location also plays a big role in equality. Disadvantage is geographically concentrated. For example, in New South Wales, just 37 or just 6 per cent of postcodes account for almost 50 per cent of the greatest disadvantage in that state for indicators such as unemployment, domestic violence, criminal convictions and disengaged young adults. That disadvantage is often entrenched. After 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the persistence of this kind of concentrated geographical disadvantage, and lack of progress in reducing it, is deeply concerning. There is little doubt that technology is reshaping our world with dramatic implications including less certainty about future careers and occupations. The exponential growth of the gig economy raises concerns about workers falling outside common employment arrangements like superannuation and the potential for future economic insecurity. These issues are central to Australia's future economic development and prosperity. They go to the heart of how we choose as a society to translate continuing economic growth into increased living standards across a range of dimensions. The Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) has spent over a year examining the benefits and cost of economic growth. In its new report How unequal? Insights on inequality, CEDA analysed Australia's position on inequality, considering whether Australians enjoy equality of opportunity and how inequality might change in the future. In light of its findings, CEDA is calling for a regular independent and comprehensive assessment of inequality in Australia with Productivity Commission five-yearly reviews. The government should explore the adequacy of superannuation, pension and savings products for contingent workers. CEDA also adds its voice to those calling for Newstart payments to be lifted to a more adequate level and for measures to be implemented to increase housing affordability for younger Australians. All Australians should have the opportunity to reach their intellectual and economic potential, that's good for our economy and our society.

59,Archaeologists discover an ancient Vietnamese society,society,"  How a flat tyre uncovered evidence of a 3,000-year-old Neolithic society in Vietnam Archaeologists have discovered tools, ceramics and other objects that indicate evidence of a mysterious society who lived on Vietnam's islands thousands of years ago. The discovery was made by the Vietnam Maritime Archaeology Project (VMAP) on Quan Lan Island in the Ha Long Bay region. The project was managed by Western Australian archaeologist, author and historian Bob Sheppard, who said the discovery was made by chance after one of his team members had a flat tyre in 2016. ""One of the guys walked along the road cutting and discovered some very old pieces of ceramic,"" Mr Sheppard said. ""These ceramics — as they turned out — are around 3,000 years old."" The team went back two years later after receiving permission from the local Vietnamese government to excavate the site. ""We did excavations this year at that site and we've come up with material from the ancient people who lived on the islands in Vietnam 3,000 years ago,"" Mr Sheppard said. In Vietnam, when someone dies their body is buried for four or five years. After this time it is dug up and the bones are placed in a pot inside a crypt. Mr Sheppard said the knowledge of this method of secondary burials as well as the unearthing of a recently-exhumed grave led to further discoveries. ""When they [Vietnamese locals] dig the bones up they leave the grave open,"" Mr Sheppard said. ""The archaeologists were walking through the grave yard and found this open grave. ""There, in the spoil mound from the grave, was all this Neolithic ceramics and a beautiful polished stone axe,"" he said. Mr Sheppard said the discovery had created a series of unanswered questions about an ancient, unknown society. ""I think the biggest mystery is what happened to them,"" he said. ""There is no evidence in the stratigraphy [rock layers] in the archaeology above this level. ""It seems to be some cultural or natural event happened that destroyed this culture around 3,000 years ago The team will return next year and hope to find an expert on South-East Asian archaeology to help them find out more about the mysterious, ancient culture. VMAP hold a seminar in Ha Long Bay every year to liaise with local heritage officers from provinces across Vietnam. The seminar also involves looking at how historic sites can be protected. Mr Sheppard said important heritage sites have been destroyed and lost. ""There is one site we've been looking at which is one thousand years old. It is an old well site,"" he said. ""We had been surveying it for three years and when we arrived this year somebody had put a bulldozer right through the site and completely destroyed it. ""We are trying to find ways to make sure these sites are protected and the local provincial government really seems to be on our side with trying to work through that.""

60,opinion: We're starting to give up on the ideal of Australia as a nation of equals,society,"  We're starting to give up on the ideal of Australia as a nation of equals One of the most significant findings to emerge from the work of behavioural economists is that human beings would rather go without than be treated unfairly. This was discovered in a series of experiments involving two people — one of whom had $100 and the other who had nothing. The person with the money was told they must offer an amount to the other — with each keeping the amount agreed. Older economic theory assumes the person with nothing should be happy to receive as little as one dollar. After all, they are then better off than they would be with nothing. Australia has a class system, and it has real consequences in people's lives. Explore the full RN series. However, the theory seemed to bear little or no relationship to practice. It turned out that most people would rather have nothing than accept anything less than about $40. That is, people expected to receive a fair — rather than equal — share of the money. What might explain this behaviour which seems, on the face of it, not to be rational? In my opinion, the best explanation is that those insisting on fairness did so because they could see no fundamental basis for distinguishing between themselves and the lucky person who had the $100 in hand. In other words, there is a presumption that — at the most basic level — people are equal in intrinsic dignity. This idea is deeply written into the ethical codes of most societies. Whether arising out of religious beliefs (e.g. that all persons are made in the image of God) or from the work of philosophers like Immanuel Kant (all persons belong to the ""kingdom of ends""), the idea runs deep that human beings possess intrinsic dignity — that can neither be earned nor diminished. It is this concept of ""respect for persons"" that lies behind the prohibition of slavery — or any other practice that reduces a human being to the status of a mere tool to be exploited by others. Yet, in recent years, there has been a growing sense of discontent — and this is despite a general increase in affluence across the developed world. It used to be that the feeling of being marginalised was experienced by those who were literally on the margins of society. The most egregious cases of deprivation, in Australia, have fallen on a significant number of Indigenous Australians — precisely because of a failure to acknowledge their fundamental equality. However, that unsettling feeling has been spreading. My sense is that a growing number of Australians feel that the mythic ideal of Australia as a nation of equals is losing all credibility. They are angry. They are disappointed. They are vengeful. Above all, they are fearful that the nation's underlying ""social compact"" could have been so carelessly broken — and that the presumption in favour of basic equality has been replaced by indifference to a widening gap between: city and country, ""elites"" and ordinary folk, the ""haves"" and ""have nots"", the ""political class"" … and just about everyone else. What you read, watch and listen to reveals a surprising amount about your place in society. Take our quiz to see how you compare. In essence, a very large number of people have come to feel they are just cogs in a machine — counting for nothing more than their capacity to work and vote. They feel they serve a system that is indifferent to their hopes and interests — and that will exploit and discard them at will. They feel robbed of their intrinsic dignity — and the basic equality that is their due. The Committee for Economic Development of Australia's (CEDA) latest research report, How unequal? Insights on inequality, turns the spotlight on this dimension of contemporary life. It provides a factual account of the extent of the problem — along with analysis and recommendations for addressing the underlying issues. My contribution to the report has been to provide a philosophical underpinning to the discussion of inequality. But beyond this, I have tried to show how the current situation is at odds with the intentions of philosophers like Adam Smith, who established the intellectual foundations for market economics. Economics as a discipline — and the market as a tool — were originally conceived of as means for increasing the stock of common good. Smith had no time for a kind of dog-eat-dog, let-it-rip economy. He championed a free market that depended on the maintenance of solid ethical foundations. He denied the legitimacy of those who lie, cheat or use power oppressively because all such vices distort the market. Furthermore, the market was supposed to be an arena in which all could transact as equals — not in terms of outcome but in terms of opportunity. Despite this idea being written into competition legislation, we seem to be a long way from realising Smith's ethical ideal. Technically, the market is ""open"" and ""free"". In reality, too many people are denied the basics in education, health, civic infrastructure, etc. to be on a genuinely equal footing. Worse still, the lack of opportunity, for some, has nothing to do with merit — but everything to do with mere accidents of birth. We can and should do better. We should reform markets — and our democratic politics — to realise their original purposes as arenas in which all are fundamentally equal.

61,opinion: Educational outcomes will suffer as long as schools promote social segregation,society,"  To reduce inequality in Australian schools, make them less socially segregated According to the OECD, 17 per cent of Australian young people leave secondary school without achieving basic educational skill levels. They conclude that eliminating school underperformance would reap enough fiscal benefits to pay for the country's entire school system. Educational inequality takes many forms, and is a problem because it stunts the potential of young people. This underachievement has negative impacts for young people themselves, which in turn has negative impacts for the larger society. Low educational outcomes are related to diminished health, unemployment, low wages, social exclusion, crime and incarceration, and teenage pregnancy. Inequalities between students from different social backgrounds already exist when they start primary school. Worryingly, these inequalities increase as students progress through the education system. This week, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) published a report about inequality and its negative effects for people and the larger society. The report includes chapters on inequality in education, workplaces, geographic inequality and inter-generational inequality. A recent report shows NAPLAN achievement gaps between year five students from high and low educated parents are the equivalent of more than two and a half years of learning in reading and about two years in writing and numeracy. For year nine students, the gaps are even larger: about four years in reading and numeracy, and four and a half years in writing. Do you understand how our schools get their money? Here are some jargon-free facts to clarify how it works. Data from PISA shows similar inequalities. Australian students from the highest socio-economic status (SES) quartile substantially outperform those from the lowest SES quartile in reading, maths and science. The equity gap represents almost three years of schooling in all three domains. These inequalities of educational outcomes are partly driven by poverty and disadvantage outside the school. But these socioeconomic inequalities are then amplified by schooling. This is because socially advantaged students in Australia often receive more educational advantages than their less privileged peers, not less. Inequalities of educational opportunities and experiences are a result of socially segregated schools. Australia has one of the largest resource gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged schools in the OECD. Australia has large the largest gap in the shortage of teachers between disadvantaged and advantaged schools among all OECD countries. Disadvantaged schools in Australia also have far fewer educational materials (books, facilities, laboratories) than high SES schools. This gap is the third largest in the OECD, with only Chile and Turkey showing larger inequalities between schools. 1. Give early, targeted and intensive support to students as soon as they start to fall behind. This is what Finland does, with almost 30 per cent of its students receiving such an intervention at one time or another. It's one of the best ways to ensure students don't fall between the cracks. But it requires resources, so we need to give more money to the schools and students who need it. This is where needs-based funding plays a role. 2. Make our schools more socially integrated. It's the most effective way to raise achievement. A socially mixed or average student composition creates conditions that facilitate teaching and learning. Middle-class and/or socially mixed schools are also much less expensive to operate because they have fewer students with high needs. Less expensive running costs frees up funds which can be used for targeted and intensive support for students who need it. If we look to Commonwealth countries that have less segregated schooling than Australia, such as New Zealand, Canada and the UK, we can see two inter-related things. They have a much smaller proportion of schools that charge fees, and smaller qualitative differences between schools in terms of their facilities and resources. These countries show both of these things can be done while maintaining diverse schooling options. We can still have schools with different faiths, philosophies and orientations, in addition to a strong and robust public school system. While the latest federal school funding approach is moving in the right direction, it's still based on an inherent contradiction that reduces its effectiveness. On the one hand, we have a funding policy that promotes unequal resourcing between schools via a large fee-paying school sector. This inevitably leads to a socially stratified school system, which increases educational inequalities and underachievement. We then try to mitigate those negative consequences of our funding policy with a different funding policy (redistribution via needs-based funding). The two prongs are working against each other, which is not only educationally ineffective but also fiscally inefficient. Needs-based funding is necessary, but it can only do so much. It's much more effective if we don't have schools with high concentrations of poverty and disadvantage. Needs-based funding will not be much more than a band-aid if it's not accompanied by greater structural reform in the way we fund and organise schools. Needs-based funding redistributes some funding from schools with lower needs to those with greater needs, but it will do little to reduce school segregation. And so the result of our efforts to reduce underachievement will be modest at best.

62,opinion: What Australians think is good leadership might just be Anglo traits,society,"  What Australians think is good leadership might just be Anglo traits Some leadership attributes, like being trustworthy or encouraging, are viewed the same way in all cultures, but there are other characteristics that only spell leadership to people of Anglo-Celtic backgrounds. This may present a problem for the 5.1 per cent of Australian senior business leaders who are neither European nor Anglo-Celtic background or for others who aren't Anglo but want to climb the corporate ladder. Especially when an estimated 24 per cent of the Australian population come from non-European or Indigenous backgrounds. While we all know what leadership is (especially when we see it), our implicit theories of what constitutes good leadership shape both how we judge our leaders, and how we exercise leadership. The most comprehensive exploration of these theories of leadership comes from the The GLOBE project. Started in the early 1990s, the project surveyed more then 17,000 mid-level managers from 62 countries (including Australia) in a first phase (2004) and more than 1,000 CEOs and 5,000 senior executives in 24 countries in a second phase (2014) to find what attributes defined good leadership in each culture. It found being a loner or irritable is seen as counterproductive in all cultures. However, other attributes, such as being independent or a risk taker, were seen as positive in some cultures, but not in others. While researchers have not always agreed that leadership has a cultural component, thousands of studies compared leadership approaches and preferences across two or more cultures over years. The basic conclusion of these studies is that leadership has both universal and cultural specific aspects. These findings showed up even when the participants were students. They are also confirmed by in-depth, single country or region-focused investigations. For example, leadership in China has been described as being the combination of Chinese historical and philosophical traditions (for example, Confucianism and Daoism) and Western thinking. In Arabic countries like Morocco and Qatar leadership has been described as a ""bridge between East and West"" given Muslim, European and Ottoman Empire influences on people's backgrounds. The GLOBE project revealed six types of leadership linked to culture: charismatic/value-based, team-oriented, participative, humane-oriented, autonomous and self-protective. For instance, those from Anglo backgrounds strongly endorse a charismatic/value-based leadership where leaders inspire, motivate, and expect high performance, while also valuing a team-oriented and participative approach. Being human oriented (or supportive) contributed somewhat to being seen as a good leader, while being self-protective (a focus on face-saving and status) detracted from it. In comparison, self-protection is not seen as negative in other cultures, such as southern Asia, Middle East, Eastern Europe, or Sub-Saharan Africa. Those from a Confucian Asia background (including China) stand out as rating participative leadership the lowest in desirable styles. Those of a Latin American background favoured team-orientation and rejected autonomous leaders. The GLOBE project groups Australians into people of Anglo backgrounds, implying that culturally we are not too different from England or the US, and that we might look for the same kind of leaders. The study cleverly distinguished between practices (""as is"") and values (""as it should be""), but if you're asking just those who lead how leadership should be, the distinction between current and desired might be lost. Indeed, a more in-depth follow-up to the initial GLOBE project identified other specific and contradicting features. For example Australians favoured egalitarianism and individualism, or appreciation for visionary leadership — but without too much charisma. And an industry-commissioned study conducted in 1993 and revisited in 2010 identified that Australians value a ""Captain-Coach"" approach, consistent with the idea of ""mateship"". That is, a ""volunteer"" attitude, focused on a cause, supportive, and willing to share the pain. While trying to understand leadership in Australia through cultural lenses can be helpful, we must be cautious in setting up a direct link between cultural background and leadership approaches. Cultural background does not always translate into behaviour — especially in the workplace or official positions. In a study I have conducted on workers in multinational corporations, I found that some local employees behaved in a way that was very different from what their background would suggest. This was the result of exposure to the culture of the organisation they worked for. Such mismatch between background and behaviours or attitudes is even more likely in multicultural societies like Australia. A leader with an Anglo background might have developed an inclusive approach to leadership, via extensive international experience or by developing their own understanding of how people from other cultures work. We can also internalise more then one culture, becoming what we call a bicultural, or multicultural individual. At least some of the leaders identified as having Anglo-Celtic, European, non-European, or Indigenous background might identify with more than one culture. Their leadership approach might be influenced by one, more, or none of the internalised cultures. Repeated studies have revealed that people adapt to their environment and apply their cultural knowledge selectively. For example, this means a bicultural Indigenous Australian leader might not ""bring in"" their unique perspectives, if their environment rewards a focus on a dominant Anglo perspective. So we need to ensure not only that different backgrounds are brought into the leadership of Australia, but also that people feel comfortable to use their different perspectives, as opposed to being stifled by a natural desire to fit in. To a large extent, this can only happen if we are willing to see beyond an Anglo, or any other particular leadership approach, and working towards a view of leadership that is informed by, but transcends, any one culture.

63,"Good taste, bad taste? Here’s what your habits reveal about your social class",society,"  Good taste, bad taste? What your habits reveal about social class  If you've ever changed the radio station when stopped at the traffic lights or pretended to have read George Orwell's 1984, you already have some idea that your cultural tastes betray something deeper about who you are. New research from the Australian Cultural Fields project — one of the most detailed investigations into how cultural tastes and lifestyles connect with privilege in Australia — sheds light on what that might be. The findings, to be published later this year, reveal how strongly our cultural tastes — such as the books we read, the music we like, the TV shows we watch, and so on — align with characteristics like class, education, age and gender. More than that, the research shows that cultural privilege is often passed from generation to generation — a finding with all the more importance at a time of widening class inequality in Australia. So, are your tastes upper class or working class? Middle-age or teenage? For a light-hearted look at how your cultural tastes compare, take our quiz, based on the project's results. (You'll need around 6 minutes.) And don't worry, your answers are not linked to your identity, nor will they be stored or passed on to anyone else. This feature isn't available on the ABC app. Tap the link below to go to the quiz on the ABC website or scroll past to keep reading about the research. What you read, watch and listen to reveals a surprising amount about your place in society. Take our quiz to see how you compare. The quiz contains a fraction of the questions put to a nationally-representative sample of more than 1200 Australians as part of the Australian Cultural Fields project, funded by the Australian Research Council. The survey asked participants around 200 questions about their tastes and activities in the visual arts, sport, heritage, literature, music and television. It also gathered detailed information about participants' personal characteristics, such as income, occupation, education, housing and assets — even the work and education characteristics of parents and partners. A team of researchers from Western Sydney University, the University of Queensland, New York University and the University Diego Portales in Santiago, Chile, then calculated how strongly each of these hundreds of variables connected to one another. Turns out that whether you rock out to Madonna, can't stand Jane Austen or binge watch Grand Designs or Game of Thrones (or have never heard of either) is largely shaped by factors that have nothing to do with how cool you are. ""The strongest drivers in taste are occupation and education,"" Tony Bennett, project director and research professor in social and cultural theory at Western Sydney University, said. So, the higher your class, the more ""highbrow"" your tastes are likely to be. The research defines class by the type of work you do. It considers not just the job itself but also things like whether you're self-employed; how much autonomy you have at work; the degree of control you have over others; and how much economic capital you own (for example, if you own a small business or a large corporation or significant property assets). Class is often, but not always, closely linked to education, the researchers found. ""By and large, people with postgraduate degrees have the most distinctively high cultural tastes,"" Professor Bennett said. ""And if you've been to a private school, the chances of your having… higher cultural tastes are much greater than if you've been to a state school."" But class and education doesn't always have the biggest influence on taste. In sport, the most powerful divider is gender; in music, it's age. ""Similarly, in some aspects of television, age can be a more powerful divider than class and education,"" Professor Bennett said. By mapping how our cultural tastes and personal characteristics fit together, the researchers were able to show overlapping patterns in the preferences at the heart of our cultural selves. ""We can't predict exactly what any individual will like or not like,"" Professor Bennett said. ""What we can do is predict the strong likelihood that tastes and social positions will stitch together."" So people who love Tim Winton's books and Monet's art, for example, are more likely to play tennis than rugby league and to listen to classical music than pop. They're also more likely to have postgraduate qualifications and work in management or professional occupations. Age and gender are also part of the mix. Generally, women tend to have higher cultural tastes than men, and younger people tend to have more cutting-edge, contemporary tastes than older people of the same class, Professor Bennett said. The research goes further, revealing not only the connections between class and culture, but also that these connections are reproduced across generations. The researchers found these tastes and characteristics tend to go together: The findings build on the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu's theory that power in society is made up of a combination of three kinds of capital: economic, social and cultural. Bourdieu argued that people from the upper and middle classes were more likely to grow up in homes where they were exposed to ""highbrow"" cultural activities and tastes. This familiarity with high culture pays off in the education system by giving people the kinds of cultural capital rewarded in the education system, according to Bourdieu. This means people from upper and middle-class backgrounds, who are rich in cultural capital, are more likely to go university. ""And if you go to university, you're more likely to get a better job,"" Professor Bennett said. ""There's a cycle here of reproduction and inheritance here."" Widening class divisions mean these findings are potentially more important now than when Bourdieu first developed these ideas in the 1960s. Class inequalities have increased dramatically since then, both in Australia and other western societies, Professor Bennett said. ""These class relations are also power relations. The owner of a large enterprise exercises a degree of control over the lives of routine workers, for example, in ways that the reverse is not true."" The researchers found these tastes and characteristics tend to go together: The patterns connecting culture and privilege operate in much the same way for Australia's multicultural and Indigenous communities as for Australians generally, the research found. ""Indeed, they're often more pronounced,"" Professor Bennett said. ""The connections between cultural capital, education, and class show that Australia still has a fair way to go before it can truly claim to be a society of the fair go. This is even more true if we take the full complexion of Australia's cultural diversity into account."" In addition to the 1202 respondents in the main sample, the researchers surveyed a further 260 Australians from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, Lebanese, Italian, Indian and Chinese communities. Their analysis found these groups tended to engage more with Australian authors, music, art, celebrities and so on, than with international ones. The ACF research has its limitations, Professor Bennett cautioned. It doesn't capture Australia's elite — ""that very small percentage of the population that exercise significant economic power through their accumulation and inheritance of economic capital"", he said. It also doesn't produce a comprehensive picture of working class tastes and interests because it was designed to analyse what advantage accrues to those with higher cultural capital. ""So, we already knew that very, very few people go to opera, but we put it in the questionnaire because it's a sign of distinction,"" he said. Australia has a class system, and it has real consequences in people's lives. Explore the full RN series. It's also possible that some respondents could be reluctant to admit to tastes seen as ""lowbrow"". If we read survey data alongside ratings figures, for example, reality television seems to be ""universally disliked but universally watched"", Professor Bennett points out. Nevertheless, the research reveals connections between culture and privilege in Australia that cannot be explained by economic forces alone. Take just one example: visual art. ""Entry to art galleries is free in Australia but… our research showed that something like 35 per cent of people have never been to an art gallery,"" Professor Bennett said. ""This clearly isn't because of the cost. Powerful social and cultural barriers make many people, especially from lower class positions, feel that art galleries just aren't meant for them.""

64,opinion: I was expecting Book of Mormon to be an attack on religion. Here's why it's not,society,"  I was expecting Book of Mormon to be an attack on religion. Here's why it's not If you are a nice and decent person, does it matter what you believe? Some of the nicest people you could ever meet are Mormons — or, as they prefer to be called, Latter Day Saints. They've responded to the open ridicule of their faith in hit musical The Book of Mormon with smiles and an offer to audiences to check out the book itself. Enjoy your chocolate this Easter, writes Julia Baird. Then, if you want something to reflect on, perhaps think of those for whom Easter means sacrifice, suffering and grief. They also believe some of the strangest things of any religion I've come across — including that ancient Israelite tribes built boats and sailed to America, and that there's a planet or star called Kolob next to the throne of God, and that Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon from a language called ""Reformed Egyptian"" inscribed on golden plates that he discovered near his home in New York state. I saw the musical The Book of Mormon last week. I was expecting it to be a scathing satirical attack on the LDS church and on religion in general. I was excepting to feel pretty uncomfortable, to be honest, as a person of faith. But, despite the profanity and the satire, the show was surprisingly pro-religious faith as a transformative power to bring hope in the world. The musical tells the story of two young Mormon missionaries who are sent to convert people in Uganda. They find the remote village where they've been sent to be a desolate place, beset with AIDS, female genital mutilation, disease, and being overrun by a local warlord. The people survive these calamities by shaking their fists (and more) at God. It's one of the oldest human responses to suffering and confusion. Protest against God for allowing terrible things to happen even finds its way in to the pages of the Old Testament. The young Mormon missionaries are dismayed. What does their faith have to say about AIDS, female circumcision, and crop failures? But they discover that there is a great power in belief, in and of itself. Elder Price finds his courage to stand up to the warlord by reminding himself that ""a Mormon just believes"" (it helps if you get to sing it in a musical theatre style of course!). The people of the village find hope and resolve in the contorted, but more practical, version of Mormonism that Elder Cunningham teaches them. And that seems to be the message. It doesn't matter what you believe. It's belief that matters. Any belief. Believing in some source of meaning and hope, such as a religion, makes your life go better. And the lives of those around you. You are more kind, more healthy, more generous, and less isolated. You are less prone to addictions. You are more resilient when disaster hits, as it inevitably does. Religious communities do the heavy lifting in Australia when it comes to volunteering and welfare work. This is not particularly controversial, and it is widely substantiated by research. Even atheist journalist Matthew Parris, after a visit to Africa, wrote a piece entitled: As an atheist, I truly believe Africa needs God. He could see that it was people with faith who were opposed to corruption, committed to building their nation, and filled with compassion for the needy. But is that enough? If a flaky idea makes us nicer people, is that OK? I am with atheists like the late Stephen Hawking here in saying, ""no, it isn't"". To happily believe an illusion is simply tragic — like imagining you are happily married while your spouse has multiple affairs, unbeknown to you. It's surely a vital part of the human gift that we are capable of inquiry and reason. To shut that capacity off surely diminishes us. And it opens us to the possibility of believing things that are really poisonous, too. Faith isn't the opposite of reason. Faith is a necessary complement to reason. For one thing, since we cannot know everything, we have faith in the work of others. For another, we proceed by faith that the world is a coherent and knowable place. We take it on trust that there is good and evil. But faith in anything, however weird, is not a good thing in an of itself. Trust a scam artist, and you'll be scammed. Believe in a lie, and you'll be taken for a fool. The apostle Paul even admitted this, arguing that if the resurrection of Christ was a hoax, then the Christian faith is a pathetic joke. Easter can't just be a myth about re-birth, or a vague story about hope. It's either based on events that actually occurred in time and space, or it is nothing at all. That's where I am putting my faith on the line. I believe some strange things, too. A guy rose from the dead, for starters. But I am not going to hide behind the ""take it on faith"" mantra or suggest that you should overlook my odd beliefs because I am a nice guy. The Christian faith offers itself for scrutiny, especially over its historical claims. Either it is convincing or it isn't.

65,"opinion: A lonely death in Melbourne, unnoticed by neighbours and friends",society,"  I'd seen him only once. He was patting down dirt in a pot plant on the communal landing; hunched over the way my Russian grandmother would be, feet wide apart, knees slightly bent, one hand balanced on the glass patio table next to him. There were two chairs, and I hoped that meant he was married. Because the second I heard his Eastern European accent, I felt the familiar wave of sadness that comes over me whenever I meet a fellow from the Eastern Bloc. Especially an elderly one, who, like so many had swapped a bleak reality for one safe but desolate. My parents had no friends in Australia. Even though they were together, they struggled with the disconnectedness. People often asked them to repeat themselves, and their smiles were blank whenever someone made a joke. Later they'd ask me what it meant. Did he have children to explain jokes to him? When did he come here? Was there a tragic backstory? These questions flitted through my mind quickly. I had more pressing thoughts. I'd just cycled home from work. I was sweaty and hungry. The guy I liked had messaged before I left and on the way home, I'd composed the perfect response. So I smiled kindly and hurried up the stairs. Next time I'd talk to the man properly. What did it matter when? I'd only just moved in and he wasn't going anywhere. The smell was putrid. It clashed with the core of me. It didn't feel like one of life's common unpleasant odours, but something that doesn't belong with life at all. It wafted up through the kitchen sink, lingered near the stove and came out of the plughole in the shower. Washing the dishes or showering seemed to flush it back down. But a few hot hours, and it snuck back up again, like a type of raw meat I'd never smelt before. I couldn't remember if it had been there when I first moved in. That night, I got up to get a drink of water and gagged as I neared the sink. Together with the darkness, it seemed evil. The next morning, I opened the front door to two cops asking if I had known the man in the unit underneath. He had been found dead that morning. ""Do you know how long he'd been there for?"" I asked ""Probably a few days, but we can't be sure."" And it hit me, as violently as the gag reflex: I knew the source of the inexplicable smell. Guiltily, I told the cops I didn't know him. The couple in the unit adjacent to his had made the call after they also noticed a smell. But they didn't know how long it had been either. ""We hadn't seen him for a while, so we started to get worried,"" the girl said. He'd lived alone, like me. No partner. And like my parents, few friends. ""The two years or so we've lived here,"" she said, ""I think I can remember one visitor."" I asked if she knew where he was from, and she said likely Slovenia. That was the return address on one of the envelopes in his letterbox. The French girl from the unit just above the stairs knew him a bit better. She said she'd seen him on Christmas day, ""sitting on the stairs, drinking his usual aperitif"". He spoke French to her sometimes, and loved French cinema. ""He told me he was Italian,"" she said laughing. ""I think he liked to tell people different things about himself."" The coffin stood at the front of the Roman Catholic Slovenian church, the wearily smiling stranger in the photo above it lying quietly inside. I hadn't gone to the funeral when my grandmother died in the Ukraine. We didn't have the money to go back. I counted 12 people, not including us four awkward neighbours. The service was all ritual; in Slovenian. But I caught a lot of the meaning. Mainly prayers. ""His mother was Italian,"" a friend of his said afterwards; the one who had made that visit. ""But his father was Slovenian. He came here in 1953."" ""I think it was in the '60s,"" another chimed in. Neither could decide. Nor did they know if he had been a tailor or tram conductor. Maybe both. Maybe neither. Everyone agreed on one thing though: he had kept to himself. The priest had a letter from a brother in Slovenia. In the 1940s, his Roman Catholic father was murdered by Communists, another brother taken away. So my neighbour had escaped, first to Italy, then Australia. And here he spent half a century, watching the odd French film, maybe punching holes in tickets, maybe fixing pants, sometimes, on Christmas day, drinking an aperitif alone, while keeping a rich history of a life to himself. And when it ended, nobody knew. Not until we caught wind of it through the pipes. Sasha Petrova is a Melbourne writer and journalist.

66,Think Australia is classless? There's actually six of them,society," RN The six-class system dispelling myths of an egalitarian Australia While most of us have an intuitive understanding of social class, we often struggle to define it beyond simple financial metrics, like how much money someone has in the bank. The three-stratum model, which splits all of us into either the working, middle or upper class, is a mainstay of 20th century sociology. It's a rigid structure, but a recent report out of the Australian National University posits a more nuanced approach to the way we define ourselves and where we sit on the social ladder. The end result? Six social classes. Australia might like to consider itself a classless society, but these new methods of social modelling tell a far more complicated story. Jill Sheppard, who co-authored the report Class, Capital and Identity in Australian Society with Nicholas Biddle, says recent studies of social class, particularly in Australia, have been one-tracked. ""Over the last 20 years or so, the easiest and most reliable way … to measure class, was to just use occupation,"" she says. ""For example: do you have a blue-collar occupation or do you have a white-collar one? Do you do low-skilled manual labour or high-skilled manual labour?"" Dr Sheppard says this method, while easy to use and measure, ignores the more complex, social aspects of class. As part of their research, Dr Sheppard and her team surveyed 1,200 randomly selected Australians, and asked them questions about their relative wealth, their pastimes, and the occupations of the people they regularly socialised with. She says socialisation — what those around us think and feel — has long-lasting effects on how we manifest our class behaviour. ""What your parents did, where you're from, all these little things that leave little indelible marks along the way, … [they] are really hard to shake off,"" Dr Sheppard says. The new, six-class model that the ANU report proposes, based on a similar study in the UK, takes these complexities into account by measuring, along with savings and income (your economic capital), two other metrics: social capital and cultural capital. Cultural capital, Dr Sheppard explains, is broadly defined as how you spend your free time. ""If you have the night off or away from the kids, what do you do? Do you go to see a movie? Or do you go and see the theatre or do you sit at home and play on Facebook?"" she asks. The activities are tabulated along a scale of relative prestige and used as an indication of education, socio-political access and spending habits. Similarly, social capital is measured by prestige — but it's also contrasted by variety. ""We ask subjects the kinds of people that they know from a range of occupations. That is, 'what sort of jobs do your friends and family have?'"" ""We're working on the basis that there is a difference between people who only socialise with people who do the same things as them, and people that have a broad range of social contacts."" If you mostly socialise with people who do the same things as you and those things rank lower on the prestige hierarchy (looking at Facebook vs. going to the opera, for example), then your overall score will be lower. We asked your thoughts on the six classes to describe Australian society. Read the discussion below. While Dr Sheppard accepts that no demographic study can account for all of society's complexities, she believes the resulting six classes are as close to accurately representative as possible — at least in Australia. ""Six classes does a pretty good job of describing Australian society, both intuitively and statistically, based on the data,"" she says. The precariat – Accounting for 13 per cent of the sample, the precariat comprises Australia's most poverty-affected citizens. They have the lowest mean household income, many are unemployed or claiming government aid and their social and cultural capital scores are the lowest. Ageing workers – This class has the highest mean age of any of the classes (58 years) and counts for 14 per cent of the population. A large portion of this class are pensioned retirees and are the least likely, along with the precariat, to be engaged in gainful employment. New workers – In contrast, almost half of all new workers, whose mean age is naturally younger, are employed fulltime. While the relative prestige of the occupations of people in this class is slightly lower than that of ageing workers, they are more financially successful and have better social and cultural capital scores over all. Established middle – While reporting slightly lower fulltime employment rates compared with new workers, the established middle class ""appear more entrenched and comfortable in their status than the new worker class."" Due to more accumulated wealth, they also enjoy ""greater advantages"" overall than new workers. Emerging affluent – The emerging affluent class reports higher income levels than the established middle but, interestingly, lower ""wealth accumulation"" (i.e. assets and savings). Established affluent – The closest Australia has to an aristocracy, reporting the highest scores of social, economic and cultural capital of any class. One of the most compelling aspects of the report's results, Dr Sheppard says, is the fact that the six classes seem to make intuitive and anecdotal sense. While we're starting to dismantle the idea that class is meaningless in Australia, we still like to think of ourselves as a society that's blind to these kinds of social divides. ""One problem is that lots of people have written really well about this issue in Australia,"" Dr Sheppard says. ""But they tend to be academics who don't have any incentive to make their work accessible — and while that work remains inaccessible, this sort of mythology can persist."" The idea of the Australian 'fair-go', and the notion that we're all egalitarian, is part of the mythos around Australian identity. And Dr Sheppard believes this is, in part, related to a historical anti-British sentiment. ""We're like their rebellious daughter, who wants to kick back against everything we see in the United Kingdom,"" she says. But it's not all bad news — there is one small thing in which Australians can take solace. ""There is good evidence to suggest we aren't as socially hierarchical as England,"" Dr Sheppard says.

67,"Seagulls — they're everywhere, but it wasn't always that way",society,"  Seagull numbers swell in line with growth of modern 'throwaway society' They seem to be everywhere — the coast, inland, our sporting venues and shopping strips — but why are there so many seagulls? And did you know they are a protected species? Researchers say Australian seagulls could be the unwitting beneficiaries of an increasingly ""throwaway society"" ready to pounce on discarded food at the risk of their own health. The often misunderstood native bird — officially called the silver gull — is increasingly populating areas away from the coast, even in industrial areas, as well as traditional hunting grounds like the beach and picnic grounds. Editor of Australian Birdlife Magazine Sean Dooley said seagulls were an often misunderstood bird, yet one with an interesting societal pecking order. ""They are essentially scavengers, so they will go were the food is which is a large factor in the growth of populations,"" Mr Dooley said. ""They were not that common a sight 50 years ago. Indeed they were fairly thinly scattered around the coast, but since we've had human settlement with our wasteful and throwaway society, they've really bred up in numbers because we've provided a whole lot of food for them."" Mr Dooley said the social structure within seagull flocks followed strict lines. ""They are a highly social bird with really strong social structures and hierarchy,"" Mr Dooley said. ""You'll see the gulls with bright red bills — which indicates age — and they're usually the ones hunching and towering over the others making all the noise while the others will look rather sheepish and submissive."" Mr Dooley said male seagulls, like many other species of bird, do not have a penis. Instead both sexes have a multi-tasking orifice called a cloaca. The female typically lay broods of one to three eggs a year, but could produce that number twice a year if conditions permit. ""They are quite opportunistic when it comes to mating,"" Mr Dooley said. ""And it's not uncommon for them to make use of mating grounds set up by other species of birds either. Basically if conditions are good and there is plenty of tucker around, they're good to go at any time of the year."" Coupled with an increasingly available source of food, Mr Dooley said while there was no definitive data to prove so, seagull numbers were ""more than likely"" on a sharp rise. ""We are seeing more and more of them in places we wouldn't have not so long ago,"" Mr Dooley said. ""It's now a matter of how best to manage those numbers in a humane way."" As a result, new methods of deterring gulls are being sought. However, as the seagull is a protected species options thus far appear to be limited. Victorian falconer Graeme Coles said other larger birds of prey, including wedge-tailed eagles, brown goshawks and peregrine falcons had been successful at venues such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Flemington Racecourse and Rod Laver Arena-venue for the Australian Open tennis tournament. Mr Coles said due to safety reasons, the eagles were not able to be released and were instead tethered to the roof of the MCG which he said was still enough of a deterrent for the seagull. ""It's what we call a prey, predator response,"" Mr Coles said of the hierarchical relationship between the birds. ""It's not much different to humans going to the beach. ""If we know there's a shark swimming in the water you'd be pretty brave to jump in. All preyed birds, such as the seagull have that in built fear response so when we introduce a predator into that environment, it really puts the willy up them."" Mr Coles said he'd noted increased numbers of seagulls in industrial areas with abundant sheltered areas for large populations of seagulls. It's increasing in certain areas due to the availability of discarded food,"" Mr Coles said. ""They call into these large scale sporting venues for the free feed, so a residential bin, picnic ground of factory is not really any different."" Similarly, Mr Dooley said seagulls were as opportunistic when it came to their diet. ""Their primary source of food is found in clumps of seaweed or while foraging along the seashore as they don't tend to find much of their own prey,"" Mr Dooley said. ""But of course, it's a rare day when a seagull turns its nose up to a hot chip which of course is not naturally a part of its diet. They are quite clever and adaptable. While the chip is not really that great in nutritional value, there's a lot of energy in it so they'll happily take it.""

68,Prison inmates give up food to help hungry kids,society,"  No Kid Hungry program reaps rewards as NSW inmates give up their food to help Inmates from the Mid North Coast Correctional centre are donating seven weeks' worth of rations and commissary food buy-ups to disadvantaged children. Oats, rice crisps, noodles, and tins of tuna filled the 200-litre tub which rolled out of the correctional centre at Aldavilla, New South Wales, last week. The goods were donated to South Kempsey's No Kid Hungry project at The Saving Place. Behind the prison walls, a team of inmates designed colourful posters to plaster around the grounds and in staff areas. One inmate said he believed all 650 prisoners contributed to the project in some way. ""We obviously are in jail, meaning we have taken from the community in the past [and] this project has given us a chance to give back,"" he said. ""Some blokes in here are pretty short on money or don't have a job inside, so they decided to save up their own breakfast packs and have gone without food themselves as a way to contribute."" Many of the inmates are from the local area and have personally lived on the fringes of poverty which Correctional Service Governor John O'Shea said was the major motivator for inmates to donate. Mr O'Shea has been with the Department of Justice for 28 years and said he had never seen a prison program so popular among inmates. ""These inmates recognise the circumstances some Macleay Valley kids are growing up in, and these men have been through tough times themselves,"" he said. ""If they can put food in the belly of one child or a family... you cannot put into words or money how much it means for inmates and their rehabilitation."" Another driving force behind the program, apart from inmates, was the facility's chaplain James Deanton. He said the program not only allowed inmates to connect with the local community but also to feel valued through their actions. ""To show compassion in jail can be dangerous so to provide an avenue where they can give without a threat is incredibly important,"" Mr Deanton said. ""A lot of these guys feel totally worthless, but to be able to provide for somebody else makes them feel like a human being; it's been very humbling for them."" The Mid North Coast Correctional Centre does not allow Christmas Day visits although inmates have a day off work and are allowed to relax and contribute to a BBQ with other inmates. Mr O'Shea said it could be a very isolating day. ""The inmates don't want families travelling on Christmas Day [because] if there was an accident, it would crush them,"" he said. ""It is a very emotional day, being away from family, but the men do the best they can, considering the circumstances, ""I think we lose sight of how important this sort of charity drive is for these men back into their community — it really appeals to their heart and soul."" The No Kid Hungry project was started in America by local man Dave Davis in the 1990s, but when he returned home to Smithtown, on the Mid North Coast, he noticed a need in his own area. The program provides breakfast to local schools in the Macleay Valley and feeds nearly 300 families per week. In the lead up to Christmas, Mr Davis said he and some volunteers would be preparing hundreds of hampers using food donated by local shops and the inmates. ""An inmate's son was being fed by our project and that inmate instigated the fundraising from the inside,"" Mr Davis said. ""This project was close to his heart, and these men are awesome with their generosity."" Mr Davis said he believes there is a public perception of men behind bars and hopes this contribution to community changes that stigma. ""They don't earn a lot of money inside, and in the last seven weeks, most of that money has come back to us,"" he said. ""These men are no different to us — they have family, they hurt and feel pain — and this opportunity allows them to show they are human."" Mr Davis said he has been speaking with the Minister for Correctional Services in hope of extending the fundraising program into correctional facilities across the state.

69,What would the Queen do? The very British problem of politeness,society,"  What would the Queen do? The very British problem of politeness Does Britain have a problem with politeness? A British thinktank says manners have degraded so much it's suggested introducing a 'civility code'. The Centre for London says the British capital's residents live, walk and move in their own bubbles, and while some people are polite, many are not. The report has since sparked a wider debate about whether a country renowned for its tradition of good manners might in fact be losing them. Sam Taylor, editor of The Lady, Britain's oldest women's magazine first published in 1885, agrees manners are slipping. ""People are easy to anger, and that isn't a helpful reaction for the world,"" Ms Taylor said. ""I'm sorry if people haven't been well mannered and I've seen it myself, for example, when you go to a restaurant and children don't say thank you or please to the waiter. ""That's not good enough."" Commuters not offering up seats on the tube, pedestrians pushing past each other on the street, and coffee orders barked across counters have all bothered Ms Taylor. After all, this is a magazine that knows its manners. In its early days, The Lady published a Dilemmas column that has now returned as a Modern Manners page. In October, columnist Thomas Blaikie offered advice to house guests not to outstay their welcome and to provide 'thoughtful contributions'. And he also tackles the great problem of whether cake should be served upright or on its side (the latter, he decided, is the best etiquette). ""There are slightly different dilemmas but actually most of them are universal,"" Ms Taylor said. ""Most of them revolve around someone has not been very nice, [whether] you feel slighted, or you don't know how to behave in a certain way."" Personality traits reflecting how well we treat others can be separated into politeness and compassion, which are each linked to different kinds of prosocial behaviours. Social media has caused even more dilemmas around social etiquette, according to Ms Taylor. ""If someone has taken the time to invite you for the weekend or even for supper, it takes you no time at all to write a thank you note,"" Ms Taylor said. ""Princess Diana would come home from every function and immediately before she went to sleep would write her thank you notes. ""Within the first week of returning from a weekend visit or having a nice dinner at someone's house, you can send a little note and then you can pat yourself on the back."" After 41 years at The Lady, production manager Kath Hanley is one of the magazine's longest serving employees. She too is dismayed by Britain's decline in manners. ""In the years I've been here it's manners on trains, on public transport, sometimes even here in the office,"" Ms Hanley said. ""The younger people don't seem to understand it's nice to be polite and apologise. Manners are manners aren't they?"" Editor Sam Taylor disputes any suggestion the magazine and good manners may be becoming a quaint part of the country's history. ""In a fractured society where it's very confusing with religious and political differences, there's a common thread and that has to be human decency and it's dressed up as manners,"" she said. And if she is ever in any doubt she simply thinks to herself 'what would the Queen do?' ""We have to remind ourselves that is a way that as a nation we should present ourselves. We can be firm, don't want to rushing around gushing,"" Ms Taylor said. ""We just have to be polite and that will actually change the world.""

70,How our pets strengthen neighbourhood ties,society,"  How our pets strengthen neighbourhood ties Talk to any pet owner and you are bound to invoke stories about the joy and companionship of having a pet. But evidence is mounting that the effect of pets extends beyond their owners and can help strengthen the social fabric of local neighbourhoods. Now a cross-national study involving Perth, Australia, and three US cities has lent weight to the observation that pets help build social capital. This is not a frivolous notion, given the erosion of sense of community is often lamented. As Hugh Mackay recently observed, not knowing our neighbours has become a sad cliche of contemporary urban life. I stumbled into pet-related research some 15 years ago when undertaking a PhD on neighbourhoods and sense of community. I was curious about the elements of a neighbourhood that might help people connect to one another, so I threw some in some survey questions about pets. In what has become my most-cited academic paper, we found that pet owners were more likely to have higher social capital. This is a concept that captures trust between people (including those we don't know personally), networks of social support, the exchange of favours with neighbours and civic engagement. Fast-forward a decade to a much larger study to look at the relationship between pets and social capital. Pet owners and non-owners were randomly surveyed in four cities: Perth, San Diego, Portland and Nashville — four cities reasonably comparable in size, urban density and climate. In all four cities, we found owning a pet was significantly associated with higher social capital compared with not owning a pet. This held true after adjusting for a raft of demographic factors that might influence people's connections in their neighbourhood. It is often assumed that the social benefits of pets are confined to social interactions that occur when people are out walking their dogs. Lots of dog owner anecdotes support this. In this large sample study, however, levels of social capital were higher among pet owners across the board. We did nonetheless find that social capital was higher among dog owners and those who walked their dogs in particular. Dog owners were five times more likely to have got to know people in their neighbourhood. This makes sense, as dogs are the most likely to get us outside the home. Yet our survey data and qualitative responses show that a variety of pets can act as a social lubricant. Pets are a great leveller in society, owned and loved by people across social, age and racial strata. Perhaps it is having something in common with other people that strikes a chord, regardless of the type of pet. That pets can help build social capital is not just a social nicety or quirky sociological observation. Hundreds of studies internationally show that social capital is a positive predictor for a raft of important social indicators, including mental health, education, crime deterrence, and community safety. Given pets are entrenched in the lives and homes of many Australians, it makes sense to tap into this as a way to strengthen the social fabric of local communities. Not everyone can or wants to own a pet. But two-thirds of the population does, so our cities and neighbourhoods need to be ""pet friendly"". Australian suburbs are generally pretty good for walkable parks and streets. In this study, we also found that having dog walkers out and about contributes to perceptions of community safety. Given the broad social benefits of pet ownership, perhaps we need to rethink 'no pets' rules where possible. However, in Australia, pets have traditionally belonged to people living in detached housing with backyards. Many rental properties, apartment complexes, and retirement villages still default to a ""no pets"" policy. Other countries, where renting and higher-density living is more the norm, seem more accepting of pets across the housing spectrum. Given ageing populations, housing affordability and the need to curb urban sprawl are critical social trends in many countries including Australia, maybe we need to recalibrate our notions of who can own a pet and where they can live. This is not to say that pets have to be allowed everywhere, but the default to ""no pets allowed"" is questionable. My father-in-law in his 80s, for example, couldn't downsize to a retirement complex because his extremely docile rescue greyhound exceeded the ""10 kilogram pet"" rule. He couldn't bear to part with Moby, a faithful companion through whom he met many local residents daily at the park nearby. A lot of my current research is around homelessness. Chatting recently with a man who was homeless with his dog on the streets of Melbourne, he told me how his dog gets him up in the morning, keeps him safe at night, and gets them both walking daily. His dog was one of the few stable things in his life, so he needed a public housing option that would allow pets. People who are homeless also need crisis accommodation options that accept their pets. Hence it is great to see places such as Tom Fisher House in Perth, opening its doors to rough sleepers with pets needing a safe place to sleep. Beyond the practical implications for pet-friendly cities, the potential for pets to enrich the social fabric of communities has strong appeal in an era of global uncertainty, frenetic ""busyness"" and technology-driven communications. As cultural analyst Sheryl Turkle has said, the ways people interact and forge relationships have undergone massive change and we can end up ""connected, but alone"". By contrast, humans have been drawn to companion animals since early civilisation. In many people's lives, they remain a tangible constant that can yield enduring social capital benefits.

It is slowly becoming easier, (I find taking photos helps), but before my last move I found a large box that had been stored in the garage for four years.

72,Noorat: The town that doesn't officially exist,society,"  Noorat: The town that doesn't officially exist If you were to ask a statistician, Noorat technically doesn't exist. Nestled in the shadows of a dormant volcano, the south-west Victorian community lost its official town status in 2012, after its population dropped below the census threshold of 200 residents. To the naked eye, Noorat is yet another casualty of the gradual demise of country towns. Abandoned buildings, disused fuel pumps and frayed shopfronts are all that remains of a bygone era, when children would flock to the local milk bar for sweets after Sunday church. But over the past four years, proud locals have set out to prove that a community is defined by more than just a label, and that even the oldest of dogs can learn new tricks. When Brooke Coolahan and her partner passed through the township some 15 years ago, they could not have anticipated that a spot of lunch would see them relocating their lives more than 2,000 kilometres from far north Queensland. ""We went across to the Beehive for lunch one day, and I thought, what an amazing little shop supported by such a small community,"" she said. When the couple returned eight years later, the café had shut its doors. It was an ominous caution to the self-described ""outsiders"", but proved no deterrent. The pair bought the town's former fire station, and transformed it into The Shed café — one of just three businesses still standing. It's a feat Brooke attributes to Noorat's country spirit. ""The community around here supports each other 100 per cent,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, what goes around comes around in small towns like this."" Moving from the hustle-and-bustle of city life to Victoria's dairy belt was a natural transition for Michael Leo, and his partner, Richard Conheady. The pair wanted to live closer to Richard's parents, who had retired to the town, when the local pub came up for sale. ""We just decided we didn't want to see it bought and turned into someone's house like what happens with a lot of small country towns,"" Mr Leo said. ""It's just such and old and beautiful building, and really the community centre for the town."" With that, the former public relations officer from Sydney had become the unlikely new owner of Mount Noorat Hotel. Though the site required ""a bit of TLC"" at first, these days it's not uncommon to find a third of the town there on a Friday night. ""We've got to know all the locals as bar mates,"" Mr Leo laughed. ""One night of drinking will do that."" Despite its recent revitalisation, locals are keenly aware of the boarded shopfronts and for sale signs that continue to line the streets. The demise of small business has had a ripple effect throughout the humble community, leaving no-one immune. It is now hoped the town's turnaround will herald a new era for Noorat, bigger and better than ever before. ""There's these little old stores that back onto people's houses, and they're sitting there empty,"" Mr Leo said. ""You can do something really fun and interesting with these places for a fraction of the price of Melbourne or Sydney."" It's a sentiment mirrored by Ms Coolahan. ""We'd love to see a little bakery here, or a clothes shop or gift shop,"" she said. ""These empty stores are really just opportunities waiting to happen.""

73,"opinion: Fear, trust, and the social contract: What's lost in a society on permanent alert",society," RN Fear, trust, and the social contract: What's lost in a society on permanent alert Trust suffers in a world on permanent alert. But it's not the only thing we lose, writes Laura D'Olimpio. Trust is vital for individuals to flourish. A trusting society allows people to feel safe, work together, communicate with one other and engage with those who are different to themselves without feeling fearful. But the news isn't good. Some recent research shows that fewer and fewer people think that others can be trusted, and the youngest cohorts of people are less likely to believe that people are honest. Analysis of time series data indicates that in the 1960s in the USA, 55 per cent thought you could trust others, yet by 1999 that figure had dropped to 34 per cent. In Australia social trust fell by 8 per cent between 1981 and 1997, and in Britain social trust fell from 56 per cent in 1959 to 44 per cent in 1990 to 30 per cent by 1996. In the US only 25 per cent of young people believe that others are honest, compared to 34 per cent of adults. We need to ask how we can raise children to be trusting and trusted citizens. Parents shape a child's attitude when they give their children messages that it is a dangerous world outside and strangers are not to be trusted. We can see the importance of teaching children to be wary given their vulnerability, but it is also true that most strangers will not cause a child any harm, and, in fact, are likely to be helpful if a child hurts themselves or needs assistance. Political scientist Robert Putnam speaks about how children are socialised to trust (or not) through technological means such as media and television. When seeing and hearing scary news reports about extreme incidents that have occurred, parents may feel justified in alleviating their anxieties about their children's welfare by warning them about potential dangers. However, these narratives are then imparted to the children who worry when they are out in the world. An analysis of the crimes against children reported in the news demonstrated that there has been a dramatic increase in the coverage of child-related crimes since 1980, yet there is no evidence that crime against children has actually increased. Hear from philosophy academics about the fear overload that's undermining our social contract. This increase in reporting such crimes correlates with the same time span that sees generalised trust diminish. We do seem to have some innate capacity for trusting and meeting trust. In formative years, trust should be nurtured so that children develop into trusting and trustworthy citizens. Cultural expectations of trust can differ, and certainly there are varying climates of trust that are influenced by history and social context. Certainly trust needs to be warranted and if you have reason to distrust, this should be heeded. Yet we need to trust others if we are to cohabit and live in communities. Generalised trust allows individuals to connect with and support others. Fear can damage trust and such fear can be engendered through the example set by role models, or through media reports and televised news programs. One effect of fear, as we may call it, is that we may feel uneasy in society and feel as though we are less able to trust others, particularly others who we judge to be different from ourselves. A reduction in generalised trust can result in diminishing feelings of well-being. Generalised trust is an important ingredient for social and political life. In the political sphere, generalised trust allows citizens to work collaboratively in social and political groups and in the social sphere, generalised trust supports people working and playing together across national boundaries and accommodates cultural diversity; it fosters acts of tolerance, and promotes acceptance of others. In the introduction to Spooked: The Truth about Intelligence in Australia, political scientist Daniel Baldino writes: Media explanations of tragic events tend towards state-of-emergency speculations that highlight the many potential pathways to death, decay and harm. Thugs, misfits and criminals are elevated into insane holy warriors with a supervillain status, who pose an existential threat. Baldino argues that historically we are not living in a time of peak terrorist attacks, even though it might feel that way. So if the hard evidence doesn't bear this out, why are we so scared? If there are not actually a higher number of terrorist attacks than there have been historically, and if we are not more at risk, then why are we seemingly so scared of terrorism and threats against our personal and national security? Is this fear reinforced by media messages: keep alert and alarmed""? We live in a 24-hour news cycle where there is a constant demand for stories on tap and an accompanying audience to listen to every thought and opinion, particularly tragic tales or fear inducing reports. However, I'm not convinced that the world really is such a scary place. Is our media partly to blame for increased anxiety around issues of personal and national security and our willingness to accept increasing intrusions into our privacy in an effort to keep us safe from harm? Fear and threats to our safety can undermine the social contract, which relies upon trustworthy citizens and feelings of generalised trust to remain intact. Social contract theory is the view that our moral and political obligations are dependent upon an agreement that is implicit or explicit in the society we form. The idea of the social contract theory is best linked to modern moral and political theory, defended by philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and John Rawls. The premise asks us to consider the rules we want in society to ensure it is fair and just. Imagine if you do not know who you will be in such a society. Rawls' test of the veil of ignorance requires us to consider that we may be a man, woman, able-bodied or not, intelligent or beautiful, perhaps, sporty or any of the opposites to these. What rules would be fair to all, regardless of which position we ended up occupying? The criticism of Rawls' veil of ignorance is that it is impossible to be objectively detached from one's beliefs, values and experiences in the world. Race, gender and class run the risk of being trivialised or omitted from this picture as the social contract is unlikely to be perfectly implemented in practice. Thus unless you consider real people in a context, your perfect contract will only be a pure form that fails in its application to the real world. However, the social contract exists, even if we forget it is in place. It is the social contract that provides us with protection and a feeling of security that allows us to trust our rights and liberties will be upheld. This is often in exchange for us giving up some of our freedom. So, the intrusion into our privacy may be defended if it is claimed that this intrusion is for our own safety. Yet it is important to analyse the work such intrusion does and whether or not it really will prevent something bad from happening. Certainly the media with its 24-hour news cycle can activate our alarm bells. But if such disasters were to actually come to pass, would our worrying about them actually help at all? Worry is a very human existential by-product of a fear of loss and a fear of mortality. As creatures of habit, we want to protect what is familiar — to guard against unpredictable threats that could alter the way we live and prevent us doing what we want to do. Therefore, such fears are bound up in our sense of identity, how we think about ourselves and our ideas about liberty and the meaning we make in our lives. Yet, the very freedom of living our lives in a sense of peace and security is itself tied into our feelings of trust for one another. Learning to trust in a background of alarm is difficult, but it's non-negotiable if the social contract is to remain intact.

74,Peak social services body prioritises far west,society,"  Far west NSW named a priority by social services body for extra funding to fight inequality Far west and western New South Wales have been named as priorities in a report calling for increased government funding to combat poverty and inequality. The NSW Council of Social Service (NCOSS) has asked the State Government to invest in transport, health and legal services for both regions in its next budget. NCOSS chief executive Tracy Howe said after consulting communities and members across the state, the organisation found the west deserved a special focus. ""Things that were being raised [were] things like lack of water, and there was impacts of housing and homelessness,"" Ms Howe said. ""The distance that you have to travel and the cost of even using electricity in the region is more."" Among the list of recommendations is that $8.8 million be spent to improve transport accessibility in the region, including travel subsidies for medical patients, and driving programs for young people. ""It's not possible for NCOSS to say ... 'invest X billion number of dollars into 20 new bus routes and three train lines,'"" Ms Howe said. ""What we do know is that there are existing infrastructure and resources already available that can be tapped into and used more innovatively. ""We also know communities could make some capital purchases themselves of vehicles and use them in a collaborative and community-structured way."" NCOSS has also called on the State Government to invest in mental health support for offenders, specifically for the far west. The organisation is calling for about $1.1 million to appoint two court officers in the far west who would provide mental health assessments and advice on diversion for treatment. Ms Howe said mental health court liaison officers work effectively in other courts across the state and were needed in the far west. ""People living with mental ill health are over-represented in the criminal justice system in the far west,"" Ms Howe said. ""The mental health court liaison officers ... make a huge difference to actually stop pathologising people, particularly Aboriginal people .... then putting them in a justice frame. ""This is about actually providing support and ensuring they don't end up back in the system. ""It's something that works, it's not that expensive and it particularly is something that's required in the far west.""

75,"Malaysia to debate bill that could see stoning, amputation reintroduced",society,"  Malaysian sharia laws: Parliament to debate hudud bill that could introduce stonings and amputations in state of Kelantan The Malaysian Parliament is set to debate a controversial bill that could see stricter forms of sharia law introduced in the state of Kelantan, but critics have warned the so called hudud bill would result in whippings and even the amputations of limbs for crimes such as theft. The Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party — commonly known as PAS — is pushing to introduce the proposed laws in the conservative north-eastern state, but first the bill must be passed by the Malaysian national parliament. Kelantan is a major stronghold for PAS, which was founded in 1951 and is among the country's oldest and largest opposition parties. ""Among the mandate from the people is to try to establish the Islamic system here, including the Islamic criminal law,"" PAS executive council member Mohd Fadzi said. Kelantan's state capital Kota Bahru is deeply religious and many of its citizens live by a strict adherence to Islam. At shops and supermarkets there are separate queues for males and females, while signs advising women to cover up are common outside offices and government buildings. Earlier this year, PAS tabled a private members bill to amend act 355 of the federal constitution with the support of Prime Minister Najib Razak's United Malays National Organisation party (UMNO). The bill aims to increase the powers of sharia courts to enforce some aspects of hudud, which is the Islamic system of crime and punishment that includes amputations and stoning. Rozana Isa is a member of Sisters in Islam, a non-government organisation working on the rights of Muslim women. Sisters in Islam maintains that the implementation of hudud has the potential for enormous injustices and said it finds PAS’s justification for advocating hudud unconvincing and worrying. ""[It's] on the cards in relation to whipping especially and the cutting of limbs for the acts of robbery,"" Ms Isa said. However there is a groundswell of popular support for the Islamic penal code within Kelantan, with many believing it will help tackle crime and violence. Others believe, as an Islamic country, Malaysia and in turn Kelantan should follow the strict religious laws. These sorts of sentiments have many citizens in the more cosmopolitan national capital of Kuala Lumpur worried, especially minorities, who fear the hudud bill may set a precedent for other states to follow suit. UMNO's political partners — the Malaysian Chinese Association and the Malaysian Indian Congress have threatened to quit the coalition if the bill is passed. As the parliament braces for debate, UMNO is keeping its cards close to its chest in relation to exactly how the parliamentary vote will proceed. ""I don't know what our instructions are for us, we still have to wait for the whip to instruct us what to do after this,"" Tourism and Culture Minister Nazri Aziz said. ""Whatever we do with regards to Islamic laws, it must never encroach on the rights of non-Muslims, that's very important."" PAS insists non-Muslims will not be affected and that changes would only apply to the state of Kelantan. ""We are living now in a multi-cultural, multi-religious, multi-racial country and then at the same time we just want our right to practice our own religion and Islam,"" Mr Fadzi said. While minorities have expressed their concerns, the hudud bill is also dividing the majority Malay Muslim community. ""As a Muslim I feel very unsafe,"" Ms Isa said. ""Under the hudud law, pregnancy of a single woman would be regarded as evidence of having committed illicit sex."" Lim Guan Eng, leader of the Democratic Action Party, fears UMNO will not follow the correct parliamentary process with the proposed laws. ""They are trying to amend these laws by a simple bill, which only requires a simple majority when the proper approach to take is through a constitutional amendment — two-thirds majority."" Political analyst Chandra Muzaffar said there are political motivations behind the UMNO party's support for the proposed laws. Supporting the laws is seen as a pragmatic way to shore up support within Kelantan ahead of a general election in 2018. ""I suspect that UMNO will find some way of supporting the bill, because they're preparing for elections and they would see this as something which is electorally useful.""

76,'He has no weapon': Wife releases video of Charlotte police shooting,society,"  Wife releases video of Charlotte man's shooting by police The wife of the African American man whose death has triggered days of unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, has released video footage of the moments before and after her husband was shot by police. State of emergency declared in Charlotte Police in the city have so far refused to publicly release their own body-cam and dashcam footage, which they say shows Keith Lamont Scott posed a threat to officers. Mr Scott's death on Tuesday (local time) was the latest in a seemingly steady string of police involved killings of black men that have fuelled outrage across America. The smartphone footage, filmed by Mr Scott's wife Rakeyia and released by her lawyers to The New York Times and NBC News, will add to mounting pressure on Charlotte authorities to make the video public. The two-minute, 16-second clip does not show the shooting itself, but captures the moments leading up to it, as Mr Scott's wife pleads with officers not to open fire. ""Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him, he has no weapon. He has no weapon. Don't shoot him,"" she is heard saying as the footage begins. ""He has a TBI, he's not going to do anything to you guys,"" she says, referring to a traumatic brain injury. Several neighbours have told AFP Mr Scott, 43, was disabled, and had a stutter among other issues. As Mr Scott's wife records, police are heard yelling: ""Drop the gun! Drop the gun!"" ""Don't let them break the windows. Come on out the car,"" she asks her husband. ""Keith. Don't do it. Keith get out the car,"" she says. ""Keith. Don't you do it,"" she adds, a moment before the sound of four quick gunshots, at which point the phone is pointed away from the shooting. Moments later, Mr Scott is seen lying face down on the asphalt surrounded by officers. ""Did you shoot him? Did you shoot him?"" Ms Scott screams. Mr Scott at this point is seen lying motionless on the ground. ""I'm not coming near you, I'm going to record you,"" his wife says. ""These are the police officers that shot my husband, and he better live. He better live, because he didn't do nothing to them."" The victim's family, along with many in Charlotte, dispute the police assertion that Mr Scott was armed with a handgun. His family says he was holding a book. No gun is visible in the video, which shows Mr Scott stepping backward when he was shot, one of the family lawyers said. ""His hands are down by his side. He is acting calm,"" Justin Bamberg said. ""You do see something in his hand, but it's impossible to make out from the video what it is."" Charlotte Police Chief, Kerr Putney, has said a handgun was recovered at the scene, and that no book was found, contradicting the family's assertion. He said the video footage does not provide ""absolute definitive visual evidence that would confirm that a person is pointing a gun,"" but he stressed that the footage indicates the officer was justified in shooting Mr Scott. ""The officer perceived his failure to comply with commands, failure to drop the weapon and facing the officers as an imminent threat,"" Mr Putney said. Charlotte has been rocked by three nights of violence-marred protests in the wake of the shooting, prompting the Governor to declare a state of emergency. Protesters defied a curfew overnight, marching through the streets amid a heavy presence of police, National Guard troops and highway police officers. Hundreds of demonstrators also protested in the southern city of Atlanta organised by the NAACP, the black community's main civil rights organisation, calling for police reform. The case has touched the US presidential race, with Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign announcing a visit to Charlotte on Sunday, before postponing it to a week later, after Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts asked both major candidates to delay visits, citing ""very stretched resources for security"". Celebrating the opening of the Smithsonian's African American Museum in Washington, President Barack Obama called for understanding, saying the museum, ""allows all of us as Americans to put our current circumstances in a historical context."" Mrs Clinton earlier weighed in about the video issue, tweeting that police should release its footage ""without delay"". But Mr Putney said releasing video of the incident could make the situation worse. ""If I were to put it out indiscriminately and it doesn't give you good context, it can inflame the situation and make it even worse,"" he said. ""It will exacerbate the backlash. It will increase the distrust. ""I know the expectation that video footage can be the panacea, and I can tell you that is not quite the case."" Charlotte's handling of the case stands in stark contrast to a similar police shooting last Friday involving an African-American man in Tulsa, Oklahoma. There, the video has been released and the white officer involved has already been charged with first degree manslaughter. In Charlotte, the officer identified as having shot Mr Scott, Brentley Vinson, is black.

77,Reframing risk and using technology to keep an aging population connected to community,society,"  Reframing risk and using technology to keep an aging population connected to community A WA health researcher says Australia needs to look at new models for aged care services, and view ageing not as a risk to be managed, but an opportunity to enrich communities. Caroline Langston is a WA health manager and she was a recent recipient of a Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowship. Having spent a career working in aged care, she used the grant to travel to Canada, Denmark, Holland and Scotland, studying the delivery of aged care services and in particular the role of technology. Ms Langston said for regional communities in particular, Australia's ageing population was putting pressure on infrastructure. ""As people leave small communities, the people who are leaving are younger,"" she said. ""They're leaving to go to school, they're leaving to get work — so the paradox is, the community becomes older,"" she said. She also pointed to an inward migration of people from metropolitan areas moving to the regions to take advantage the lifestyle and affordable real estate in retirement. ""Over time those rural communities have had a loss of infrastructure and a loss of funding. ""So you've got this almost perfect storm of a need for good healthy ageing in rural communities that isn't being addressed,"" Ms Langston said. In Holland Ms Langston visited a community specifically designed for 154 residents with severe dementia. She said from the outside, these dementia villages appeared like any other normal village complete with restaurants, shops, cafes, a bridge club, and a wine bar. Here people share houses in groups of five to six, and they can move around freely and continue to lead as normal a life as possible. Staff for example, involve residents in day-to-day tasks like shopping and preparing meals. ""They get to have the smell, touch, feel, taste of the meal cooking in the home like we always do,"" Ms Langston said. ""So that's the thing, it's taking things we already know really well, and continuing to do them. ""In some of our models in aged care and dementia care, we put a whole bunch of people in big rooms and the meal comes in, three times a day, and they've had no connection to it."" For people with dementia, living in a setting more closely aligned with their normal life, Ms Langston said there was a reduction in medication. ""What the research is saying is that there's much less agitation,"" she said. ""So because people have full and active lives, they're tired at the end of the day and they sleep better, so they need fewer drugs. ""There's less agitation because you can get out and walk around — you're not restricted, you're not cocooned in a small environment, there's a big open space,"" she said. Another model included in Ms Langston's research was a trial of an advanced remote monitoring system in Scotland. Researchers fitted out the homes of elderly people with sensors that could monitor people's movement through the home, and detect when doors were left open, or ovens or irons weren't turned off. This remote monitoring also took into account individual medical history, running complex analytical processors to detect subtle changes in physical movement that could help predict when someone was about to have a fall. Ms Langston said how society has dealt with ageing in the past was rooted in a fear of getting old and dying. ""You've just got to look at it — we're busy botoxing our faces — we say to people 'you don't look your age', and that's a compliment. ""Wouldn't it be nice to say 'you look your age', and not be fearful of ageing because there's so much life to be had as you age. ""And if we can continue to contribute as we age, then we are valued and we are not isolated, and we're not lonely."" Ms Langston said the challenge was to reframe society's perspective on the risks to health involved with ageing. ""We see someone that's getting a bit frail, and might get a bit of early dementia. ""Families want to lock them away to keep them safe, [but] they want to have their own life. ""We should be brave enough to let them have their own life, and see this risk of keeping them in a community for all of us, for them and an opportunity to enrich that community,"" she said.

78,Nun who spent most of her life in Melbourne convent turns 100,society,"  Sister Angela O'Donoghue, who spent most of her life in Abbotsford Convent, turns 100 A nun who has spent most of her life at the Abbotsford Convent in Melbourne has celebrated her 100th birthday. Sister Angela O'Donoghue spent her birthday surrounded by family and friends, who shared cake and sung her happy birthday. Kathleen O'Donoghue was born into an Irish Catholic family in Middle Park, in Melbourne's south, on August 11, 1916. She was in her 20s and training to be a nun with the Good Shepherd Sisters at Abbotsford when World War II began. Life changed for everyone in her family. ""Her parents, on the cusp of the World War, were unwell, so she left the convent,"" Sister Angela's niece, Gay Bourne, said. Over the next two decades, she worked full time as a typist and secretary, including for Ansett Airways and Shell Australia. ""Working for Shell Australia, she was quite the modern typist and pretty active with work,"" Ms Bourne said. Sister Angela returned to Abbotsford Covent to become a nun after her parents died in the late 1950s and early 60s. ""Contrary to usual habiting, she stayed in touch with the nuns, and re-entered the nunnery,"" Ms Bourke said. Edna Neubecker, an old school friend, said Sister Angela always knew she wanted to go back to the convent. ""In you went, straight away, never hesitated. [There was] nothing else in view, [she] wanted to be a sister,"" she said. Sister Angela continued to use the skills she gained in her working career when she was a nun. ""She was the creator of the Good Shepherd archives,"" Ms Bourke said. ""When the computer was invented, she typed faster than the computer, which is one of our family stories the children can't quite believe."" Her love of music has also endured; she particularly enjoys musical comedy such as the Mikado. Sister Angela said she would only want to turn 100 once and said the secret to a long life was having people do things for you. She received birthday letters from the Queen and the Premier, as well as a certificate from Pope Francis acknowledging her dedication to the Catholic faith.

79,opinion: Survey says: Still static after all these years,society,"  Survey says: Still static after all these years Economic wellbeing is no longer advancing as it was prior to the global financial crisis, but the effects of the slowdown have been relatively equitably distributed. The challenge for Government is to ensure they continue to be, writes Roger Wilkins. Poverty in Australia has declined, welfare reliance has stabilised and long-term poverty is becoming rare - but overall economic wellbeing is no longer improving, and household wealth has remained static, despite rising property prices, according to Australia's most respected longitudinal study of economic wellbeing. And there is a rapidly growing wealth divide between generations, with median wealth increasing by 61 per cent among people aged 65 and over, compared to just 3.2 per cent among people aged 25 to 34, since 2001. This is the picture from the latest statistical report of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, collected by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research. Collected every year, HILDA is Australia's only nationally representative household longitudinal study, and has followed the same individuals and households since 2001. Perhaps best summarising the experience of Australian households since 2001 is the path taken by median income, shown in the figure below. The HILDA data shows that in the early years of this century, the median household income (after taxes, and adjusted for both inflation and household size) grew strongly. However, since 2009 growth has stalled, with the median income stagnating at approximately $45,000. HILDA data on household wealth, collected every four years since 2002, shows a somewhat similar pattern. Median household wealth grew strongly between 2002 and 2006, but has since grown very little - despite continued increases in house prices. In some respects, Australia has handled this slowdown quite well. There has been relatively little change in income inequality since 2009, and measures of poverty have actually declined slightly in recent years. For example, the percentage of the population with an income less than half the median income was 10.3 per cent in 2014, down from its 2007 peak of 13 per cent. Furthermore, while HILDA shows that the large decline in welfare reliance among working-age people between 2004 and 2008 was arrested by the 2008 global financial crisis, welfare reliance has increased only slightly since 2008. Nonetheless, it is clear that overall economic wellbeing is no longer advancing as it was prior to the global financial crisis. Financial pressures have also increased for families using child care and for those with private health insurance. These markets have experienced substantial real price increases, effects of which have been exacerbated by government policies which in recent years have acted to reduce subsidies. HILDA correspondingly shows that households' expenditure on these items has been rising faster than their incomes. There are, moreover, some concerning trends evident in the HILDA wealth data. The proportion of adults who are home owners has declined from 57 per cent in 2002 to less than 52 per cent in 2014, and on current trend will be below 50 per cent by next year. There is an important intergenerational dimension to this decline: home ownership has declined from 39 per cent to 29 per cent among people aged 25 to 34, from 63 per cent to 52 per cent among people aged 35 to 44, and from 76 per cent to 67 per cent among people aged 45 to 54. There has been almost no decline in home ownership among older age groups. Associated with this, but also strongly connected to changes in superannuation holdings and to a lesser degree, investment property ownership, has been a growing divide in wealth between the young and old. Between 2002 and 2014, median wealth grew by 39 per cent among people aged 55 to 64 and by 61 per cent among people aged 65 and over. By contrast, median wealth grew by only 3.2 per cent among people aged 25 to 34, 7.4 per cent among people aged 35 to 44 and 10.8 per cent among people aged 45 to 54. HILDA also shows that particular groups in the community have continued to experience high rates of disadvantage over the entire period since 2001. Most notably, people with disability, poor general health or poor mental health have not fared well economically, and poverty rates among children living in lone-parent households have consistently been above 20 per cent. The longitudinal nature of the HILDA data further provides important insights into the prevalence and determinants of persistent or long-term disadvantage. Long-term poverty is in fact relatively rare, with 85 per cent of poverty spells lasting three or fewer years. That said, poverty is considerably more likely to be long term for people with disability, Indigenous people, immigrants from non-English speaking countries, the elderly, single people, people living in rural areas, and people with low levels of education. Perhaps most surprising are HILDA's findings on welfare reliance over the longer term. While only around 18 per cent of people aged 18 to 64 receive income support payments in any given year, nearly 45 per cent of people in this age range received income support at some stage in the 14 years to 2014. Indeed, nearly 70 per cent of all working-age people were at some stage in a household that received income support payments. Contact with the welfare system is therefore very high, but is typically only for relatively short periods, suggesting the welfare system in many cases works as a temporary safety net rather than as a long-term income source. In 2014, new questions on ""material deprivation"" were included in the HILDA Survey to provide more direct information on the groups in the community faring worst economically. Among the findings were that 12 per cent of households did not have $500 in savings for an emergency, 8 per cent did not have home contents insurance because they couldn't afford it, and 5 per cent could not afford dental treatment when needed. Consistent with findings using more traditional income-poverty measures, rates of deprivation were found to be highest among lone-parent families, Indigenous people and people with severe disabilities. The more direct material deprivation approach does reveal, however, that the elderly have very low rates of deprivation, despite having high rates of income poverty. This suggests that income needs are lower for the elderly, for reasons such as their high rates of (outright) home ownership. The detailed picture of the economic lives of Australians that is provided by the HILDA Survey is necessarily somewhat complicated. It is nonetheless clear that the current trajectories of income and wealth are in general much lower than in the early years of this century. The HILDA Survey data suggest that the effects of this slowdown have to date been relatively equitably distributed, notwithstanding some concerns about trends in the wealth distribution. Of course, there is no guarantee that this will continue to be the case in future, particularly in the context of the need to reduce the government deficit. The form that deficit-reduction policies take will be profoundly important to the distribution of economic wellbeing over coming years. This article was originally published in The Conversation.

80,"Star Trek cast, director talk Hollywood diversity at Sydney premiere",society,"  Star Trek Beyond cast and director talk Hollywood diversity at film's Sydney premiere The highly anticipated film Star Trek Beyond has premiered in a wet and windy Sydney with the cast and director highlighting the franchise's contribution to human stories and diversity. Star Trek is known for its multicultural cast, with Gene Roddenberry's original series at the forefront of casting actors from a variety of racial backgrounds at the time. Director Justin Lin said Star Trek's diverse casting had a major influence on him when he was young. ""When I was growing up I'd never seen anything like it. People see [characters] Sulu and Chekov and it was ahead of its time,"" Lin said. ""And I think now being a part of this franchise is really about embracing that, it shouldn't be a big deal. ""I think that's the way we treated it in this film. It's just human beings hanging out and going through this shared experience."" Korean-American actor John Cho returns as Hikaru Sulu, a role made famous by George Takei in the original series of the 1960s, and said diversity in Hollywood needs to be talked about. ""Obviously as a person of colour I think the discussion is long overdue,"" Cho said. ""I'm glad that we're having it now, better late than never and we'll see how far we can take it."" Lieutenant Nyota Uhura was one of the first African-American characters to be featured in a television series during the 1960s. Chris Pine, who plays Captain James Kirk, agreed with the push for diversity. ""Films should represent the diverse peoples of this planet and I think [the push for diversity] is fantastic,"" Pine said. In June, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, which bestows the Oscars, admitted a record 683 invitees, with over half of those invited women, and almost as many African-American. That came after backlash at the Oscars, where the Academy was criticised for nominating an all-white group of actors for the second year in a row. It sparked a social media uproar under the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite. Star Trek Beyond is the third instalment in the series reboot led by J.J Abrams in 2009, with Taiwanese director Justin Lin taking over the third instalment when Mr Abrams left to direct Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The cast also paid tribute to cast member Anton Yelchin who died in June. Beyond, the plot of which has been kept tightly under wraps, follows the USS Enterprise led by Captain Kirk as they travel into the reaches of uncharted space where they are forced to confront a new enemy.

81,opinion: 'Look up'? How about you rack off,society,"  'Look up'? How about you rack off I'm sick of being told to look up from my phone. I'm tired of social media posts mocking a supposed addiction to technology (shared without a hint of irony). The apps on my phone help me to be *more* social, writes Deirdre Fidge. Life is what happens to you while you're looking at your smartphone ... or so says the graphic image that we see shared around Instagram, without a hint of self-awareness or irony. ""We share the best bits [online], but leave out the emotion,"" the narrator of the incredibly popular Look Up short film tells us. ""We edit and exaggerate, crave adulation / we pretend not to notice the social isolation."" Yes, I'm deeply sorry to say that the entire clip is a long poem; essentially a nightmarish first year Arts student's idea of a social experiment-cum-creative non-fiction piece. This smug young man rhymes his way through telling us why phones are evil; how we are losing friends and feeling lonely. But are we all feeling this? Or is it just him, a pompous Dr Seuss for Millennials, and could it be because he spends all his time making arrogant videos for YouTube and shopping for boring sweaters? (Sorry - that was mean, I for one am a keen appreciator of a fine-knit woollen jumper.) To be frank, I'm sick of being told to put down my phone. I'm tired of photo series that depict our alleged addiction to technology. I'm bored with people telling me that every time I use my mobile, I'm disconnecting with the world. Recently, my Facebook feed was flooded with a photo taken back in 2014 at an art gallery of teenagers visiting a show featuring prominent works by Rembrandt. The post criticises the young people for focusing on their phones. If there's anything social media loves it's a bloody good outrage, and let me tell you, some people really enjoyed lambasting these young people on that post for having the audacity to use their phones while at a gallery. ""Back in my day..."" shouts the Baby Boomer, but we can't hear him over the sound of his negative gearing profits. How dare the youth enjoy a new game, or want to connect with a friend! How dare that person take a photo of themselves instead of hiding in shame and disgust at their own appearance! How dare people enjoy their lives in a way that is different to mine! The truth is, this particular museum - the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam - has incredibly detailed multimedia tours, which require the downloading of an app to one's phone. These teenagers were most likely using the app to plan their trip around the gallery, or to hear audio information about the pieces they are viewing. But that doesn't make for such an interesting story, does it? ""Technology improves gallery experience and increases interaction with art."" No, let's go with: ""Stupid teens play games on their iPhones because they hate culture."" There, that's better. It is argued that being on our phones is inherently anti-social; that we have created a generation of narcissistic, selfie-taking millennials who can't put down their forks without tweeting about tonight's dinner. [Great parma tonight, mum. 7.06pm. 0 retweets, 1 like] A recent study surveyed 1500 adults and 500 teenagers and found that actually, it was adults who were 70 per cent more likely to reach for the phone during dinner. Still, this was a study funded primarily to encourage families to turn their phones off during mealtimes and really engage, connect, share their darkest secrets, sing Kumbaya, and so on. I find all of this anti-technology talk incredibly boring. Nobody is forcing you to use your phone, and if someone finds an app beneficial, or prefers messages to phone calls or love letters or faxes or carrier pigeons - what's the harm? If it weren't for the several apps on my phone, I would be significantly more anti-social, because I spend a lot of time interacting with my friends via Facebook and Twitter. This isn't because I'm a self-obsessed young adult (OK: I might be, I don't know how all those selfies ended up on my camera roll), it's because anxiety stops me from attending large social events and I prefer to communicate on my terms. I genuinely love seeing big announcements shared on social media, with people I know who live interstate or overseas - or even around the corner. It's much easier for them to announce their engagement/new job/birth of their third child Kexxlyn as a single post, than to call every one of their family members and friends. It makes me feel more social and connected: being a part of that exchange and being able to immediately pass on my congratulations. Look around a crowded train or tram and yes, most folks will be on their phones. This is not a problem. I might be one of those pesky Millennials but I am still old enough to remember when the Fairfax newspaper was an enormous broadsheets and could easily accidentally smuggle a small elderly passenger just by flicking to page six. It's far simpler now to scroll on a phone or tablet. Mindfulness apps and tools to help people quit smoking or improve their health are constantly being downloaded and used. I often am out and about running errands and will reply to work emails on my phone. People might be Skyping with a sick relative. They might be checking world news to stay updated with the world. Even if someone is just mindlessly scrolling through social media - how does that affect you in any way? I recently admired a colleague's very fancy looking smartwatch, and she told me she bought it solely because her daughter is non-verbal and it allows them to communicate easier. Stop judging and preaching your disdain for useful technology that is constantly evolving to improve people's experience with the world. I'm living my life, I am fully engaged and socially connected, so for God's sake - stop telling me to look up. Deirdre Fidge is a Melbourne-based comedian, writer and social worker.

82,New initiative seeks to remove unconscious bias from job applications,society,"  'Blind' job applications: Victoria Government seeks to remove unconscious bias from employment A trial of ""blind"" job applications, which leave out personal details from CVs in an effort to avoid unconscious bias and discrimination, will be conducted by the Victoria Government. The initiative will see specifics such as names, ages and genders removed from job applications. Research shows people from culturally diverse backgrounds need to submit more applications to receive job interviews compared with their Anglo-Saxon counterparts, even if they have the same qualifications. Abselom Nega, chief executive of iEmpower, an organisation that assists young people from refugee backgrounds, said the move could help level the playing field. ""When a person puts their name on a job application as Mohamed or Ahmed, employers won't even look at the resume of that person,"" Mr Nega said. ""We find chances of one of our clients to receive a call for a job interview are significantly improved if they should use a Western name, which is wrong."" The research conducted by the Australian National University (ANU) showed Indigenous people needed to submit 35 per cent more job applications for each job interview compared to Anglo-Saxon applicants. We are all susceptible to unconscious bias, and we need to do something about it, Michael Bradley writes. Middle Eastern applicants need to submit 64 per cent more job applications, the research found. Victoria's Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Robin Scott, said the initiative would help ensure fairness in employment. ""By removing unconscious bias, we really hope to create a an equal opportunity for all Victorians,"" she said. Ms Scott said a similar trial was also conducted in Canada and the UK with improved employment diversity. ""Ultimately this is about fair employment practise and enabling Victorians to apply for jobs without fear their personal information will effect their initial application,"" she said.

83,Kalgoorlie attitudes towards alcohol shift in the not so wild west,society,"  From swillers to sippers: Kalgoorlie attitudes towards alcohol shift in the not so wild west With a reputation as a tough, hard drinking mining town, some people are saying that attitudes towards alcohol in Kalgoorlie-Boulder are changing. Nick Galton-Fenzi operates an award winning micro-brewery in the industrial back blocks of Boulder. Hidden away amongst the container parks and machinery yards, the pleasant beer garden and benches seem out of place. ""We wanted to be off the main drag of Kalgoorlie itself. ""It came down to one simple ethos, we wanted people find us because they enjoy our products. ""Those people would explore more, those people who would seek us out specifically for our products, rather than those people who just like to drink,"" he said. Mr Galton-Fenzi said that with their clientele, less was more. ""They are spending more money, on less product. ""Even amongst our own social groups, we tend to buy one or two fairly expensive bottles (of beer), and we'll sit down and we'll share them, share a single bottle — a 750ml or a one litre squealer or growler between six to eight of us,"" he said. Dr Michael Livingston is a policy researcher at the Centre for Alcohol and Policy Research at La Trobe University in Melbourne. ""Our per capita consumption at the moment is as low as it's been since the 1960s. ""We've seen a real decline in the last eight or nine years in drinking, and that's really be driven by big changes amongst young people. ""Teenagers in particular, but also with young adults, drinking is way down as well, we're seeing a big shift,"" he said. Dr Livingston was the author of July 2015 report titled, Understanding Recent Trends in Australian Alcohol Consumption. It drew on data from the National Drug Strategy Household Survey and involved more than 120,000 respondents. One of the most significant trends it found, was an increase in the proportion of the Australian population, aged 14 years and over, who over the last decade, reported a lifetime of abstaining from alcohol. From 9.4 per cent in 2001, the number rose to 14.1 per cent in 2013. Dr Livingston said this could be the result of people becoming more informed about the health risks associated with drinking. ""There's certainly evidence of attitudes changing. ""If you look in surveys, people are more worried about alcohol and potential harms from it. ""They're more supportive of restrictive policies in general."" He also noted that organisations providing information for people about their drinking, were beginning to pop up. ""There's a shift in general attitudes around drinking which seems to now be reflected in reduced drinking,"" Dr Livingston said. Dr Livingston said that historically, Australia has been a heavy drinking country, particularly during the 1980s. ""It's something we almost pride ourselves on, this idea that we can handle our booze and drink to excess,"" he said. But he also pointed to the changing demographics in Australia and the influence that might be having. ""We're a much more multicultural country now, we have a lot of people with different backgrounds and different drinking cultures integrating into society and that might be moderating this historical pattern."" Richa and Gaurav Hira are from India, but have called Kalgoorlie home for the last five years. Sitting in their lounge room with their two young children, drinking homemade tea, Ms Hira explained how she had never had a drink, and did not plan to. She said she happily attended the social occasions with her friends who did drink. Mr Hira however, does have the occasional, one-off drink. ""Depends, but in India, as per the weather conditions, Indians mostly prefer whisky,"" he said. After a pause, he tried to remember the last time he drank. ""I had (some) last time, at a party in Kalgoorlie, around four of five months ago,"" he said. But, by Kalgoorlie standards, the amount Mr Hira would drink in one year, would barely register. ""Tough question, but around, two glasses, three glasses,"" he said. Dr Livingston said that weighing up the role of government and the individual was not straightforward. ""That's the constant dilemma of public health in general, this balance between structural factors and individual factors. ""I think you've got to find a reasonable balance and individuals have got to be well informed about their choices, we are getting there in Australia. ""There's certainly evidence in the survey data we have that people are more aware of this risks around drinking. ""You don't get good individual choices until you have informed individuals, so that's a promising sign."" And while passionate about his alcoholic drink of choice, boutique brewery operator Mr Galton-Fenzi was not apathetic about the fundamental realities of alcohol. ""If alcohol had been invented today, and someone fronted up to the legislators and said, 'hey look what I've just created, I've just created alcohol. It impairs your judgement; it causes you not to be able to drive; it gives you a cracking hangover the next day — let's sell this on the open market and go for broke.' ""No one in their right mind nowadays would say, 'yeah that's an acceptable outcome.' ""It would be banned.""

84,World Photo Day: Hobart camera club member numbers continue to grow,society,"  World Photo Day: Hobart camera club member numbers continue to grow with the times As photographers globally celebrate World Photo Day, a Tasmanian camera club with humble roots is boasting more numbers than ever before. A successful membership base of 140 registered camera enthusiasts, the Hobart Photographic Society has grown from its humble beginnings with a handful of members around a kitchen table in the late 1960s. But the day has brought mixed emotions to the club as the outgoing president, Reg Ashman is stepping down from his role late this week. My family had box brownies, I'm not sure if they knew how to use them because I certainly didn't. Mr Ashman joined Tasmania's largest photography club more than 10 years ago. A decade later, he says that photography in Hobart is headed in the right direction. ""We've got great people in the club so, as much as it's photography, I enjoy going along and meeting up with colleagues,"" Mr Ashman said. The club has separate groups on social media for each style of photography. Each group contains members with different skill sets helping one another from beginner to advanced. Mr Ashman enjoys taking photos more than ever before with landscape, portraits and sport photography his favourite genres. ""We have a whole range from extremely advanced members through to people who are using their camera very much for the first time,"" Mr Ashman said. ""The beginners are well catered for because our club is very 'sharey', we don't have a secret ingredient for experienced members and they work alongside [each other]."" Mr Ashman's interest in photography began at a young age, when he asked for a ""box brownie"" from his parents for a present. ""When I was a little tacker, my family had box brownies, I'm not sure if they knew how to use them because I certainly didn't,"" he said. ""I had no idea how to use it, I didn't know what the numbers stood for and in those days; it was slide film that I used to use. ""If I got back two out of 20 that was properly developed, my understanding at that stage as a little tacker, gee you've got a good film. ""I didn't realise it was down to the camera and the operator. I just thought it was good luck that you got a good film that worked properly, so it continued from there."" Mr Ashman has been president of the club twice for a total of six years. He has seen the changes in photography over the years of his experience with cheaper equipment and film, and more scope to experiment with ideas. Mr Ashman recalled a time when he was shooting at an event with a film camera and his friend Larky had already transitioned to a digital camera. ""Larky was beside me going click, click, click,"" he said. ""I was sitting there taking photos going, 'click, that's a dollar, click, that's a dollar, click, that's a dollar', because that's what it cost me to get the slide film developed. ""When we came home I think I had about 36 shots and $36 worth. Larky probably had a card full of images and he could use the card over and over again."" World Photo Day began in 2009 by Australian photographer Korske Ara to commemorate the date that the first Daguerreotype photograph was released to the world by the French government in 1839. This was the first practical photographic process known at the time. Mr Ashman can be sure to be seen gearing up to recognise the day by rolling through his photos with his digital camera as he continues to strive for the best shot. ""There's no such thing as a perfect shot, but I just like to think I can get a better one next time,"" Mr Ashman said.

85,Queensland Rail celebrates 150 years,society,"  Queensland Rail: Looking back at 150 years When Queensland's first railway opened on this day 150 years ago, four trains were welcomed at Bigges Camp station, west of Brisbane, with much fanfare and cannon fire. Lady Bowen, the wife of Queensland's first governor, had only 18 months earlier spiked the project's first sleeper, with one of the trains also named in her honour. That sleeper was held up by 12-year-old William Morrow who laboured on the railway and would do so for the next 58 years. ""Although in itself a very simple matter, the spiking marked the commencement of trials and struggles of a primitive and isolated colony of vast dimensions settled by a population of some few thousands,"" the boy wrote in his diary from the day. At the time, Queensland was a fledging colony of about 40,000 people. Nearly half the population was uneducated and prosperity rested on wool. Mineral wealth was yet to be exploited and agriculture had made little progress, partly because of the difficulty getting produce to markets. The first track ran for 34 kilometres between Ipswich and Bigges Camp, now Grandchester, to bring the wool and produce from the fertile Darling Downs. It was then taken up the Brisbane River to the capital's ports via steam train. Over 150 years, Queensland Rail has evolved from a fleet of four trains running on wood, to an expansive network of trains that has joined the vast state. Queensland Rail's first fleet of four trains took a combined 500 passengers on their first journey on July 31, 1865. Aboard was the who's who of Queensland - ready for the biggest social event in the state's colonial history. After rounds of long-winded speeches, the day was celebrated with champagne toasts and a sumptuous lunch in a marquee past Bigges Camp where the tunnel works on the Liverpool Ranges could be viewed. Fruiters hawked their wares and cannon fire was let off by the local military, some of whom had bear-skin headwear. The historic event was capped off with a ""glittering ball"" at Ipswich, Queensland Rail historian Greg Hallam said. ""People knew history was being made, but what was more important [was] that they knew they had a part in it,"" he said. ""It symbolised to them that they had joined the rest of the modern world and had become an important part of the British Empire, the industrial revolution. ""They called it a new epoch, they said it marked a new age for everyone."" Peter Turner's great grandfather John Smith drove the Lady Bowen train that day, taking dignitaries on the first trip to Bigges Camp. Mr Smith, whose son and grandson both went on to work at Queensland Rail, had come from England for the job. ""I knew since I was six, in 1949, that my great grandfather played that historic role in Queensland's history,"" Mr Turner said. ""I'm very proud."" Nearly everything the railway needed to operate - staff, locomotives and carriages - were imported from Britain. Mr Hallam said the enterprising colony chose a narrow gauge, the first in the world to do so for public rail, to save on cost. The network expanded to 11 separate railways over the next 50 years and Queensland eventually had more than any other state in Australia. For nearly half a century lines were used to unlock the land and put people on farms. ""It was almost a policy that no farmer should be more than half a day's cart ride from a railway,"" Mr Hallam said. Townships sprang up around the new stations and tracks. Simon Miller from the State Library said the population was quickly growing and the railways were key to opening up large areas, which had been connected in part by ""terrible"" roads. ""You can actually still see where the railway lines go inland, those areas still have large centres of population,"" he said. ""There was a lot of politics involved. ""Of course everyone wanted the rail line for their area, they wanted it to come to their particular town."" When gold was discovered, railways were built in the late 1800s to Mt Perry, Gympie, Charters Towers and Mount Morgan. ""If it wasn't pastoralism, it was the mineral development of Queensland that needed the railways,"" Mr Hallam said. ""Wherever the lines expanded basically, they created those industries further."" The same happened when coal took over and there was a mad rush to build the Great Northern Railway, from Charters Towers to Cloncurry, in 1908. ""They got that rail line open before it was properly built because the world-wide demand was enormous,"" Mr Hallam said. ""They opened it really before bridges were properly built, to get it exported to places like Germany. ""Big money was being made."" It was not until 1924 that the final connection in the state's railways were made. The so-called ""ribbon of steel"" went from Cairns to Brisbane, stitching up all of Queensland's rail lines. Since the rail heyday, the number of rail lines in the state have contracted with the rise of the car. Many development branch lines closed from 1948, Queensland Rail said, but at the same time the main lines were upgraded to provide contemporary services. From the 1970s an extensive network of new lines was developed, particularly to service export coal mines. The organisation's coal freight company QR National was privatised on a 99-year lease in 2010, raising more than $4 billion for the state.

86,"Drugs, abuse, unemployment: Life in Braybrook, Victoria",society,"  Life in Victoria's 'Bronx': Braybrook, where 'every second house was dealing drugs' Little Marissa Allen-Heffernan is the shining light of her family, which has big hopes for her future. The gorgeous toddler is not yet two years old, but if you believe the statistics her future holds more hardship than many other children her age. She is from Braybrook in Victoria, which is among the 10 most disadvantaged suburbs in the state. There, unemployment and criminal records lay the foundation for many residents futures. So far, Marissa's life has already had its challenges. The 20-month-old shares a bedroom with mum Kirsty and dad Kevin. I used to chrome, spray paint, then I went on to the speed then to the heroin then to the ice. I've taken all drugs. It comes with the chaos and sleep-deprivation you might expect, but lately there has been added drama. In April, Kirsty Heffernan's mother's drug addict ex-partner tried to smash his way into the family home and Kirsty had to escape over the back fence with baby Marissa in her arms. ""Ever since then, if you yell near [Marissa], anyone bangs near her, she's really, really nervous,"" Kirsty said. Kirsty's older sister Bianca was a ward of the state from age 12, running away because of violence and abuse. Bianca was sexually abused as a toddler by someone outside the family. ""Mum ... couldn't control me, I was running amok heaps,"" she said. ""I used to be on the streets for days, never had showers, never ate. I used to chrome, spray paint, then I went on to the speed then to the heroin then to the ice. I've taken all drugs."" Violence has marred Bianca's life at every turn; two years ago her father was stabbed to death. Her half-brother is in prison for murdering a young man. Her older brother Tim died after a heroin overdose. ""I've been in and out of hospital myself for suicidal thoughts. I used to cut myself,"" she said. People might wonder how one person manages so many overwhelming setbacks in life, Bianca said she looks to her beloved niece Marissa to keep going: ""Yeah, I love her too much."" Her mother, Diane Heffernan, has little support outside her family. ""I think once a month I just build it all up and I just crack it, or when I go to bed at night because I've got a lot of photos of Tim in my room and just cry myself to sleep,"" she said. The family lives in the house of mother and Heffernan matriarch Diane. Diane's brother Derek moved in six weeks ago. Like the rest of the family, Braybrook is in his blood, having lived in the suburb since he was 16 years old. ""It's an old commission area, so a lot of people on the pension and on the dole and stuff like that,"" Derek said. ""Six years ago people were getting shot around here for half a point of ice, it's only 50 bucks worth and you know, it's shocking."" Derek's moved in after getting clean. ""I was pretty fucked on the drugs. I was smoking ice every day, smoking marijuana everyday, smoking cigarettes every day,"" he said. ""A friend of mine just said to me, he goes 'you look like you've just been hit by someone', because my eyes were all black and I hadn't slept for five days. ""Then I went and looked in the mirror and I was like 'waaaah' and that was the turning point."" Despite their circumstances, the Heffernan family is determined that demography will not be their destiny. Derek has a job driving trucks and he has been clean for six weeks. He said his plan is to ""work, sleep and eat ... that's about it really"". Bianca has her own place. ""Now I don't get into no trouble no more,"" she said. ""Get a job and have kids, that's what my future is. And stay off the drugs forever."" Diane said Braybrook is trying to turn its future around. The suburb is on the up. There is more to do and property prices are reflecting the change. ""This used to be the Bronx. I reckon every second house was dealing drugs,"" Diane said. She too, is trying to help her kids stay the course. She hopes the youngest three, including 20-year-old Kirsty, go on to further education and employment. Kirsty hopes to get training and return to work. ""I just want to be a good role model where I could be working instead of just sitting around and not really doing much,"" she said. Diane is also looking forward. She says her future holds ""happiness, for my kids, with my kids"".

87,Push for rock fishermen to wear life jackets in bid to reduce deaths,society,"  Life jackets required for rock fishermen in bid to reduce deaths, NSW coroner says The NSW deputy coroner is calling for laws to make life jackets compulsory for rock fishermen in an attempt to reduce the enormous ""emotional and social"" cost of their deaths. Thirty-five people have died while rock fishing in NSW since 2012, with around seven deaths per year. Deputy coroner Carmel Forbes has been investigating eight deaths between 2012 and 2015. ""The emotional and social cost of these deaths to family, friends and the community is enormous,"" she said. Rescue operations are ""dangerous, resource intensive and normally undertaken in treacherous conditions"". In 2011, rock fishing deaths cost the community, on average, between $450,000 and $600,000 per incident. The deputy coroner noted that the current measures in place to protect rock fishermen have not seen any reduction in deaths. She said life jackets should be mandatory and that the cost of the proposed measure would be ""far outweighed by the saving of lives and subsequent reduction of social and financial costs associated with the loss of lives in rock fishing"". Ms Forbes said consideration should be given to a 12-month grace period, an education campaign and coupons or gift vouchers for free or subsidised life jackets. She also recommended a review of current signage warning of the dangers of rock fishing and the use of ""shock signage indicating the number of deaths associated with rock fishing"". Recreational Fishing Alliance president Malcolm Poole said rock fishermen are not reluctant to wear life jackets, but the designs are not suitable for the sport. ""Life jackets are currently designed to an Australian standard for boating,"" he said. ""What we're looking for is an appropriate life jacket designed to the Australian standard for rock fishers. ""You have to understand that rock fishers are a mobile person on a rock platform, they move around a fair bit."" However, Surf Life Saving New South Wales lifesaving manager Andy Kent said introducing new laws would compel life jacket manufacturers to improve their products. ""Manufacturers may start, or should start, making life jackets which are actually suitable for the actual cause of rock fishing,"" he said.

88,Adult industry lobby group wants tobacco sale restricted to 18+ premises,society," Updated 
    
      May 31, 2015 12:51:30 Adult industry lobby group the Eros Association and the Australian Sex Party want tobacconists and other cigarette sale points to become adults only premises. The idea is supported by the Cancer Council and Quit Victoria, who say the suggestion warrants consideration, along with other restrictions on tobacco sales. The Eros Association has encouraged its more than 200 members to seek a licence to sell tobacco, saying it is an adult product and should be sold in an appropriate environment. The association's membership is largely made up of adult retailers, but also includes tobacconists and legal high shops. Australian Sex Party Victorian MP Fiona Patten, who was the Eros Association CEO for 20 years, said she planned to raise the issue in Victorian parliament. ""It just makes common sense that adult material is sold to adults in adult areas,"" she said.  ""It doesn't mean the traditional sex shop necessarily, but it does mean a tobacconist or it does mean age-restricting parts of your supermarkets, for example, where adult material is sold, like alcohol and tobacco."" Tasmanian independent MP Ivan Dean said the idea had merit. ""I would certainly be prepared to look at it here in this state,"" he said. Mr Dean has a private members bill before Tasmanian Parliament that would make it illegal to sell tobacco to those born after the year 2000. ""The harder we make it to get tobacco products, the better, as far as I'm concerned,"" he said. Quit Victoria and Cancer Council Australia said the idea should be considered by states and territories, along with other measures to restrict the availability of tobacco, saying children seeing the sale of tobacco helped normalise smoking. Cancer Council director of public policy Paul Grogan said the organisation did not ""necessarily support the sale of tobacco being confined to adult shops"". ""However, restricting its retail availability to premises that only adults can enter, or premises restricted in some other way, warrants consideration,"" he said.  States and territories have responsibility for the regulation and enforcement of the sale of tobacco. The ABC was alerted to the case of a tobacconist in suburban Melbourne, called Cigarettes Tobacco Cigars, that was largely stocked with toys designed for young children. Shopper Michael Banner said he thought the store was a toy shop and was outraged when he realised it was a tobacconist. The Victorian Department of Health confirmed the shop was not categorised as a speciality tobacconist, despite its name, and had no restrictions on selling products specifically for children. Mr Banner complained to his local council but was informed it was not a council issue and told to complain to the shopping centre. ""They [children] come in looking at toys while mum and dad get their smokes, which of course they're entitled to do, but it normalises being around tobacco for children,"" Mr Banner said. The ABC has approached the shop for comment.  Topics:

89,Threats puts dampener on South Arm skate ramp,society,"  Threats puts dampener on South Arm skate ramp South Arm mother Jo Barwick bought a skate ramp for her children for Christmas as a way of getting them off the streets. Little did she realise that it would create a divide within the small community with a letter containing a threat left at her house. Ms Barwick gave the present to her children so that they would no longer have to skate on the streets or outside the local shops and school where they were getting in trouble. She received an anonymous hand-written note in the mail with a threat of arson about the skate ramp stating: ""Get rid of that skate ramp or it 'will' be torched"". ""[I was] really disappointed that somebody would want to take that approach,"" Ms Barwick told Ryk Goddard on 936 ABC Hobart Breakfast. I don't even know what the issue is; whether it's noise, whether it's 10 kids walking up the street...I don't know. ""I think if they had have knocked on the door and we had a chat about it and I actually knew there was an issue, it would've been a lot easier to take on board."" Ms Barwick's sons Will and Sam had also spent hundreds of dollars upgrading the ramp, getting new wood and coping for the top and paint that would not wear off in the rain. ""I read it and I was absolutely shocked, beside myself, and I thought it was absolutely disgraceful, it was terrible,"" Sam said. ""One of the worst things that have happened in South Arm."" Ms Barwick did a neighbourhood call to see if anyone else knew of the letter but found they were shocked as much as she and her family. The skate ramp in Ms Barwick's backyard is surrounded by bush and open spaces, so the complaint was not expected. Police have been informed but said they cannot do much unless something does happen to the skate ramp. Ms Barwick said while the skate ramp could get a ""bit noisy"", she said it came mainly from boys having a good time. ""I came home from work last week and there were 13 boys in the backyard — they were having a blast,"" she said. ""We ended up having to put a skate ramp in the backyard to keep all these kids from getting into trouble on the streets, and now that we've done that, this is what's happened."" Ms Barwick would often drive the group to the closest skate park in Lauderdale as there is only one bus service on a weekend. This led her to the idea of building the backyard skate ramp with a neighbour's help, and the ramp has attracted many local children and teenagers to come and use it. ""I don't want it to discourage these boys from getting out there and doing what they love to do,"" Ms Barwick said. ""We wanted to provide somewhere for them to hang out and be safe."" Sam and Will Barwick with their friend Liam Meagher, and the group of local skateboarders, approached the Clarence City Council to try and get a public skate park in South Arm. According to Liam, there are plans to get the skate park built; with the help of the local council, local parents groups, Southern Tasmania Skateboarders Association (STSA), and skateboarder Jimmy McMacken. ""We've just had a big survey to figure out what the community wants and it seems that everyone seems all for the skate park,"" he said. ""Getting a note like this seems like a pretty major setback but [it] definitely [is] not going to discourage us in actually putting our point across."" Liam also has a skate ramp in his backyard and the group is determined not to stop skating. Ms Barwick said that she would just like to speak with the person who wrote the note so that they could talk about it. ""I don't even know what the issue is; whether it's noise, whether it's 10 kids walking up the street ... I don't know,"" she said. ""Knock on the door next time I think, just give us a knock and we can talk about it. ""If it's a barking dog or kids on a skate ramp, or tools in the backyard, knock on someone's door and just have a chat because we can work something out.""

90,"40 years on, people remember Cyclone Tracy",society,"  Cyclone Tracy Memorial: Aboriginal elder fears another cyclone could hit soon Hundreds of people at a Darwin memorial service have heard stories of survival during Cyclone Tracy, and a word of warning from an Aboriginal elder who believes another severe storm will hit soon. About 250 packed into the overflowing Christ Church Cathedral in Darwin on Wednesday for the 40th anniversary commemoration of Cyclone Tracy, which struck the city on Christmas Eve 1974, killing 66 people and destroying about three quarters of the city's homes. Aboriginal elder Bilawara Lee from the Larrakia people welcomed those to the service, and said her people believed that the spirit Dareba Nungalinya, known also as Old Man Rock and visible as a rock off Darwin's cost, caused Cyclone Tracy. ""His spirit, when aroused or upset by the actions of humans wreaks havoc by way of severe storms and cyclones,"" Ms Lee told those in the cathedral. ""We believe that Dareba Nungalinya was responsible for 1974. ""With all the rapid construction and the disturbance of Mother Earth here in the Top End I honestly fear we may experience another such disaster and it is not too far away. ""I ask that you tread softly and learn well here in Larrakia country and treat Mother Earth with love and respect as the Larrakia people do,"" she said. The service heard from Darwin Lord Mayor Katrina Fong Lim, whose uncle died in Cyclone Tracy while she and the rest of her family were away. I stood in this eerie silence, looked up to the sky and thought, how fantastic is that, because we were covered in Christmas tinsel. ""What it did was make you realise that things in life are very temporary and you needed to actually grab a hold of life and just do as much as you can because you just don't know what is around the corner,"" Ms Fong Lim said. Northern Territory Administrator John Hardy said Christmas Eve in 1974 was not a night he would forget. ""I remember people making comparisons to Hiroshima, the devastation was so severe,"" Mr Hardy said. Palmerston Alderman Geoff Carter who was part of the Arafura Wind Ensemble, which performed at the service, remembered being in the eye of the storm. ""I stood in this eerie silence, looked up to the sky and thought, how fantastic is that, because we were covered in Christmas tinsel,"" Mr Carter. ""Two o'clock in the morning I looked again and realised that it was roofing iron, suspended above the city, waiting to descend upon us in that even more ferocious second half of Cyclone Tracy,"" he said. ABC personality Charlie King also recounted his memory of when the cyclone hit. ""We did think that we might not survive the night,"" he said. He said information was coming through from the ABC giving them information, which was lucky. ""The only other information we were given was by our mum, who told us we would need to find the nearest coconut palm and hold on for dear life,"" Mr King said, to laughs from those present.

91,Aztec warriors descend on Sydney,society,"  Aztec warriors descend on Sydney Thousands of tonnes of terracotta and stone artefacts make up the new Australian Museum exhibition Aztecs. Project manager Fran Dory has been working for four years to bring the 200 ancient objects to the Sydney public. ""It's been a long and mostly enjoyable process, but now we are starting to see the fruits of our labour,"" said Ms Dory. The priceless antiquities have been drawn from over 20 Mexican institutions. Staff at the Australian Museum have been joined by their counterparts from Mexico working for the last three months to prepare and assemble the displays. The Aztecs, often mistakenly believed to be a mythological civilisation, ruled over Mexico for 500 years before the Spanish conquistadors wiped out the blood-thirsty natives. The exhibition aims to tell the story of the spectacular and ultimately tragic rise and fall of the Aztec empire. The Aztecs implemented a mandatory universal education system, educating both girls and boys in practical and military studies, writing, astronomy, statesmanship and theology. They developed advanced agricultural systems; terracing hillsides, damming and irrigating valleys, and converting swamps into intricate canalled farmland. At the same time they were bloody-thirsty warriors for whom ritual human sacrifice was an important tradition. ""The Eagle warriors were the elite warriors,"" explained Ms Dory. ""Every male in Aztec society was called on to train as a warrior. ""Everyone aspired to be a warrior, and those at the top were Eagle Warriors and Jaguar Warriors. ""Part of their job was to collect victims to be sacrificed to the sun god Huitzilopochtli."" In Aztec lore the elite warriors and victims of human sacrifice were united with Huitzilopochtli upon death. Women who died during childbirth were considered equal to the bravest warriors and were also united with Huitzilopochtli in the afterlife. A long journey through the nine levels of the underworld awaited the more ordinary citizen. ""It wasn't an easy journey, and it wasn't the underworld of choice,"" explained Ms Dory. ""Most people would have wanted to die in battle, or as a sacrifice, so they could be with the sun god."" The stone-age civilisation proved no match for the well-armed Spanish invaders led by Cortes. Obsidian-edged wooden swords were the fiercest weapons the natives could wield against the armoured invaders. These weapons, clay-fired terracotta eagle warriors, gods of the underworld, and stone jaguars now stalk the halls of the Australian Museum. ""Priceless,"" is how Ms Dory describes the antiquities. ""They are the epitome of Aztec and Mexican culture."" The exhibition will be open to the public from September 13.

92,Push strengthens for National Thank A Farmer Day,society," ABC Rural Push strengthens for National Thank A Farmer Day The seed has been planted to introduce a Thank A Farmer Day to the national calendar. School chaplain Moira Thompson, from Biggenden in Queensland, staged her own celebration in her town, and wrote to Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce suggesting it be taken up countrywide. He responded late last month to commend the initiative and ensure the Federal Government's commitment to agriculture, particularly through Landcare Australia. As a result, the ball's now rolling to discuss celebrating Thank A Farmer Day during Landcare Week held every September. Ms Thompson has emailed the organisation asking to consider the idea that weaves into Landcare's ethos. ""On their website, they talk about 'do you know where your food comes from?' so that's a really good target for city people to say 'hey' let's stop, think about what we eat, and thank farmers for it'."" She says it would be fantastic for a small town like Biggenden to be the catalyst for a national movement. Ms Thompson has also registered to include the day on the Australian National Event calendar. Director of Landcare's farming and major projects Shane Norrish says it's not a possibility this year, but could happen in the future. ""(Landcare Week) aims to create an increase in awareness of the value of Landcare... and because Landcare's roots have come out of the farming section, I think it (Thank A Farmer Day) would be a great addition."" He says thanking a farmer could help fill the 'deficit' in urban understanding of farming and land management. The concept of better recognising farmers and bridging the divide between city and bush is gaining more traction. Earlier this week, Buy A Bale distributed about 3,000 thank you cards to farmers as part of World Thank You Day. The initiative has been extended to the end of the month.

94,Harvard appoints Rudd to lead major research project,society,"  Kevin Rudd takes on Harvard University senior fellow role researching United States-China relations Former prime minister Kevin Rudd has taken up a new role with the prestigious Harvard University where he will lead a major research project into United States-China relations. The appointment will see him split his time between Boston, Beijing and his hometown of Brisbane. Mr Rudd, who has worked in China and speaks Mandarin, says he is delighted to be taking on a role as senior fellow at the Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. ""I am very much looking forward to working in America's oldest university, as well as the leading university in world rankings,"" he said in a statement released on the university's website. ""I believe the China project is important if we are to advance both the concept and the substance of what the Chinese call 'a new type of great power relationship' between Washington and Beijing."" Harvard University says the former prime minister will bring a unique perspective to what will be one of the defining geo-political relationships of this century. With China's economy set to surpass the US during the next decade, the university says Mr Rudd's research project will explore the new shape of the relationship between the two superpowers. ""As a former head of government, who is also extremely knowledgeable about China and many topics, prime minister Rudd was a hit with students as an institute guest speaker last April,"" Harvard's Institute of Politics director Trey Grayson said. ""As an institute-visiting fellow this spring, here for a much longer period, we are sure even more undergraduates will take advantage of the opportunity to learn from and engage with him - and that his presence will create strong interest among faculty and the entire university community.""

95,opinion: So you think you can spot a liar?,society,"  So you think you can spot a liar? We like to think we can tell when someone is lying, but justice can easily go awry when good people overestimate their ability to see truth in another's eyes, writes Stephen Dawson. Australians this week received - or should have received - a lesson in humility. It is one of those lessons that recurs every few years, yet is promptly forgotten. The lesson was delivered by former ALP MP Craig Thomson. Or, rather, the magistrate who found him guilty. The lesson is not that you shouldn't misuse funds provided by your employer to perform your duties. Almost all of us learn that as children under the general heading of ""don't steal"". The lesson from Thomson concerns a certain vanity that is widespread: We think we can look into the eyes of someone and know when they are lying, or when they are being truthful. Indeed, some of us can for some people. The problem is that none of us really knows with certainty who we can ""read"", and who we can't. And both game theory and evolution suggest that it will always be neck-and-neck between the ability to tell lies that can't be detected and the ability to detect those lies. There are advantages to any group of people for all to be (reasonably) truthful. But there can be even greater advantages to an individual if he or she can lie and get away with it. There lies the ability to be a free rider on the efforts of others. As some people are better at spotting liars than others, so some are better at telling lies than others. Some can be very good at it indeed. Which brings us back to Craig Thomson. A magistrate has determined that Craig Thomson did use his employer-issued credit cards to, among other things, employ the services of sex workers. Yet who among even the most cynical of us, watching Thomson's speech in Parliament in May 2012, did not experience a twinge of doubt as to his guilt? Were we not at least a little moved by the emotion in his voice as he pointed at then opposition leader Tony Abbott and accused him: ""You have unleashed the lynch mob"", as he waved at the press gallery: ""and you have fanned it."" Mixed metaphors aside, it was a masterful performance. As it happens, I wasn't. I am relatively immune to such performances because I know for a fact that I am a sucker for lies. I learnt this as a young constable several decades ago. Many times. We had a teenager in custody who had broken into a house. He denied it repeatedly. I was the junior officer, so the Senior Constable was asking the questions. I was increasingly convinced that the youngster was innocent, despite the evidence to the contrary. My partner slapped his hand down on the table, hard, loudly. The young fellow jumped a little, and then admitted what he'd done. He calmly named the others involved, gave details he wouldn't have otherwise known. Job done. Lesson learned. For a while. I soon learned that in court cases in particular, I had to reserve judgement. On more than one occasion at the end of the defence's argument I'd be having doubts about the guilt of the defendant, even though it had been my fingers on the typewriter keys that had punched out the words of confession I'd heard with my own ears. But when I heard the prosecution's closing argument, my faith in the defendant's guilt would be restored. Regular citizens are all too frequently conned by the sincerity of criminals. Which is another way of saying the victims have placed too much weight, often without even thinking about it, in their ability to detect false claims. Yet even the most implausible of criminal claims fail to raise suspicions among many regular people. In the Fraud Squad my partner and I had arrested one Arthur James Nelson for passing stolen cheques. I can name him because he is now dead, shot by the Victorian Police in 1988. Nelson had an extraordinary ability to seem sincere. One of the cheques he passed was in the main Canberra branch of a major bank. Which bank? Yes, that one. Nelson had large spider-web tattoos at the corners of his eyes. He had completed this cheque using a thick black texta, signing it with a scrawl that in no way resembled that of the cheque's owner. Yet when we interviewed the teller she had no recollection of this unusual transaction. She simply accepted his verity and handed him $900 cash. Justice can easily go awry when good people overestimate their ability to see truth in another's eyes. Even those accompanied by tattoos. Good solid people. In 1973 James Finch along with an accomplice set fire to the Whiskey Au Go Go nightclub in Brisbane. Fifteen people died. Finch and his accomplice (who later died in prison) proclaimed their innocence throughout the trial, insisting that they had been ""verballed"" by the police. They self-harmed (the accomplice's death followed a hunger strike in prison) and Finch managed to get his appeal all the way up to the Privy Council (in 1984, two years before the passage of the Australia Act 1986 which abolished such appeals). He recruited solid citizens to argue his innocence on his behalf. And they were wrong. In 1988 the Queensland government got rid of this problem by releasing him and deporting him back to the land of his birth: Britain. And there he confessed, explaining how he'd committed the crime. He soon changed his mind, of course, when it was pointed out that not all the deaths had been the subject of trial, so the possibility of extradition and retrial remained available. How galling for those who had allowed themselves to be convinced by this violent mobster. If you need a lesson on how hard it is to tell whether someone is being truthful, look up Craig Thomson on YouTube and watch his speech in Parliament. Experience the work of a master liar. Some say that his defenders, such as the then prime minister, were cynically supporting him to maintain the government's numbers. But if you watch that video, it's at least equally plausible that she looked into his eyes as he spun a tale of dark enemies out to frame him, and simply believed that he was telling the truth.

96,Malaysia's opposition willing to work with government,society," Australia Network News Malaysia's opposition willing to work with government Malaysia's opposition says it's willing to help tackle a range of problems in the country, showing signs of softening its stand towards the government for the first time since a disputed May election. The opposition, led by former finance minister Anwar Ibrahim, has refused to accept the election victory of the ruling coalition, which extended its 56-year rule but saw its parliamentary majority reduced. In an Independence Day message, Anwar said the opposition maintains its ""strong protests about the validity"" of the vote, but, for the first time, he indicated willingness to heal divisions the election brought. ""We are prepared to put aside our differences for the sake  of the nation's wellbeing and future,"" Mr Anwar said. Prime Minister Najib Razak's coalition lost the popular vote in the election although it won the most seats. Mr Anwar listed problems facing the country including flagging public finances, slowing economic growth, surging rates of crime and corruption. He also referred to an increasing number of media reports on ""race baiting"". ""Not only is there a lack of leadership in ameliorating the  situation but it appears that the government is encouraging this  phenomenon to worsen,"" Mr Anwar said. Relations between majority ethnic Malays and ethnic Chinese and ethnic Indian minorities are a sensitive issue. While ethnic Malays tend to support the ruling coalition, many members of the economically important ethnic Chinese minority rallied to the opposition in the last polls. ""We believe that it is imperative for the prime minister to convene without the slightest delay a round-table meeting  between the ... government and Pakatan Rakyat in order to deliberate on the issues raised and formulate a comprehensive  solution,"" Mr Anwar said, referring to the alliance he heads.

97,Study looks at drivers giving 'the finger',society,"  Study reveals mysteries of driver 'bush salute' Hand gestures are part of every culture in the world...most Australians would be familiar with the thumbs up, the peace sign and the bird, just to name a few. Now an Australian anthropologist has documented a salute that's unique to our vast Outback highways. In his study, Dr Adrian Peace has dubbed it the 'phatic finger'. It's that friendly gesture between two strangers driving at high speed, in the middle of nowhere, in opposite directions. ""The greeting system is not random or serendipitous,"" Dr Peace said. ""It doesn't happen between everybody. ""People are really quite selective as to who they acknowledge when they are out on the open road."" Truckie Spike McInerney said it was about friendliness. ""Say g'day to each other without talking,"" he said. For grey nomads like Danny Currie, it's a chance to share a moment with like-minded travellers as they zoom past. ""It's so beautiful that people go, hey mate, and that's all it's about really, just acknowledging, that you are a grey nomad,"" Mr Currie said. Overseas backpackers play along with the ritual to enhance their cultural experience. ""They find rather quaint, rather exotic, the fact that people on the highways of the Northern Territory greet one another so regularly,"" Dr Peace said. Backpacker Julie Springer said she really liked it. ""It gives me a really positive feeling because you communicate on the street and it's not so usual for Germany or Europe, let's say,"" she said. Dr Peace's study points the finger at road train drivers as being the least likely to reciprocate. ""I describe the latter as the lords of the road, who are sort of somewhat arrogant in their behaviour,"" Dr Peace said. ""They do see the road or the highway as very much their property."" But truckie Spike McInerney said waving was dangerous at times. ""A lot of roads you can't wave,"" Mr McInerney said. ""Too much concentration hanging onto these big ones. Yeah."" Dr Peace describes the gesture as a secular ritual and says the term 'phatic finger' is used to describe the communication of shared feelings. ""It's simply an expression of, if you like,  hello, how are you? That kind of fairly ephemeral greeting that we use all the time."" The phatic finger has geographic boundaries ... pretty much anywhere in the middle of nowhere, especially in the Top End. And it seems everyone has their own unique style. Backpacker Daniel Ruppert says he feels weird doing just a single finger. He prefers to wave. Mr McInerney says most, except women, usually use one or two fingers. ""The women they seem to use the whole hand,"" he said. Mr Currie said it was usually ""a two-er"". ""But it's not that two fingered, like, it's the other way round, you know what I mean.""

98,Record numbers for Courage to Care in Broken Hill,society,"  Record numbers for Courage to Care in Broken Hill More than 1 000 far west students have visited an exhibition designed to teach them about bullying. The courage to care exhibition closes on Sunday, after six weeks at the Broken Hill Regional Art Gallery. The exhibition is designed to teach children not to bully each other, using first-hand accounts from the Holocaust. Courage to Care Chairman, Andrew Havis said more than 3 500 people have been through the exhibition. ""We've empowered 1 197 students, that have attended from the region,"" he said. ""Which is virtually, I would say from our statistics, it would be close to 90% of the student population of years five to 12."" Mr Havis, said Broken Hill compares very well to other regional centres the exhibition has visited. ""It's compared very well, it's probably one of the best uptakes of any country regions that we've been to,"" he said. ""Broken Hill is the 35th regional area that we've been to since our inception in 1999."" The next stop for the Courage to Care exhibition is Goulburn.

100,Spotlight on important role of Blue Light Discos,society,"  Spotlight on important role of Blue Light Discos More than a hundred delegates have met in Darwin today for the start of a two-day conference about Blue Light Discos. The discos started in Melbourne in the 1970s and were brought to the Northern Territory in 1981. They provide a safe place for teenagers to have a night out without the risks of alcohol and drugs. Ward Tucker, the coordinator of Blue Light Disco in the Territory, says the events are particularly important in remote communities. ""It is an absolute highlight when we go out there,"" he said. ""It still is an essential thing to their communities. ""When I first began going out there five years ago, a lot of the communities had no police presence whatsoever. ""Since the federal intervention came in, there is a lot more community engagement."" The conference is focusing on police programs to engage young people and prevent crime. The Police and Citizens Youth Club is also holding special celebrations to mark the 30-year anniversary of Blue Light Discos in the Territory.

101,Hunter gatherers aim to beat Territory census heat,society,"  Hunter gatherers aim to beat Territory census heat Collectors have begun working around the Northern Territory today for the 2011 Census. The Australian Bureau of Statistics collects personal information every five years to determine demographic changes around the nation. Territory director of census Julie Nankervis says taking data is a difficult job in the Top End. ""We've got a lot of travellers,"" she said. ""Everyone from down south is up in the Northern Territory or northern Australia sort of catching some sun, so we've got to capture them. ""We have a lot of fly-in, fly-out workers ""We've also got a lot of distances and a lot of indigenous communities in quite remote places that we have to get to and make sure that they can fill out a census form and participate in the census. A youth homelessness campaigner says young Territorians need to fill out census forms to improve youth services. Kassandra Gould says she has been homeless for almost two years, and wants young people in similar situations to complete their census forms. ""If we can get more young people to actually fill in the forms correctly and say, 'look, we need help', then it means the organisation which helps me will get more funding,"" she said. ""The organisations that help people get rent assistance will get more funding to help people get their own stable environment.""

102,opinion: Brand Crisis,society,"  Brand Crisis I googled the word “crisis”. There are about 359,000,000 pages that feature the word. Give or take a million, I assume. I narrowed my search by selecting “news”. I assume it means mentions in the media. It suggests recent coverage. There are 47,500 news articles. When I narrow the date range to in the last month I get 74,000 results. The past week’s count is 89,500. The past 24 hours - 88,800. Past hour - 112,000. I have no idea why you get more returns as you narrow the time frame. I had to chuckle at that the first news article, at the time of my search: Telegraph.co.uk - Harry Wallop - ‎20 minutes ago‎ A global shortage of coconut milk has led to empty supermarket shelves, leading to a crisis for middle-class gourmets hoping to whip up a Thai curry this weekend. By Harry Wallop, Consumer Affairs Quick, act now! Stock up on coconut milk. I shouldn’t laugh. For a lot of people, not being able to grab a can of coconut milk might be a serious matter. A crisis, I think not. Looking through the first few dozen pages of search returns I am led to believe that there are crises going on in footy teams, sport governance, recruitment efforts, and local kindergartens in parts of the U.S, to name just a few examples. Even Europe has its very own crisis – the European Crisis, as it is imaginatively branded. Not that this is so special. Dozens of countries have a crisis named after them. Libya, Yemen, Syria, and other traditional hotspots have their own unique and all-encompassing crisis. Some of these nations seem to have been in crisis for a long time, some decades. Of course, most crises reported are economic. Environmental, health, and morality are all close behind. Heading further down into the search returns, one can find all manner of slightly amusing crises. Of course, I am sure each situation, a.k.a. crisis, is not the best thing for the people involved. But, a crisis, I think not. All this talk of crises makes one think about the psychology of the human race. It seems certain that we are not a half-glass full species. We are surely not even glass half empty. We seem to be a glass empty bunch. Or more correct perhaps, we are a “glass empty and going to blow up in your face” mob. Of course, if we take a pure dictionary definition of crisis, it means a stage in a sequence of events at which the trend of all future events, especially for better or for worse, is determined. A crisis is a turning point. But in the way it is used on the nearly half a billion pages across the web, it often means that everything is dire, at dangerous levels, and about to collapse. There are several things that worry me about our maniacal obsession with crises. Firstly - the effect on the children. If all us adults seem to talk about is the end of the world, or part thereof, what are kids to think? I think it’s a form of global child abuse. I worry about the effect on us as individuals. As consumers of these endless dire straits, we must get affected. We must feel less light. It must bring us down, in some way. What about all the people living their lives in the middle of the crises? Obviously there are the journalists who write about this stuff. Do they take their work home, even subconsciously, and create their very own personal crisis? Then there are the sources of most of the crises. To put them in one big pen, I will call them pressure groups. They are often the ones that first attach the term “crisis” and disseminate the urgent matter to an eager media. Are these organisations corporate anxiety clusters? What about all those political advisers and public servants? They are the people who will field the ultimate question – what are we going to do about it? One can only imagine what it must be like for their bosses – the politicians. How can they possibly make good policy decisions if everything is in crisis? One thing can be said for us humans, give us more time to think about something and we will probably come up with a better decision. Forced into a corner, cajoled to act immediately, we make bad decisions. A key difference between considered and rushed decisions is the ability to ponder inadvertent outcomes. Acting in crisis mode must leave us more open to inadvertent outcomes. There is always a chance of collateral damage. Friendly fire is a potent potential outcome of crisis. There must be bad policy outcomes that can be blamed fairly and squarely on the lack of time caused by a sense of crisis. Sadly, we seem to have created a master brand – CRISIS. Sadder still, it seems to be a love brand, in a twisted way. We seem to like the steady diet of really huge problems. If I was king, I would set up a crisis commission. People would only be able to use the word with the commission’s permission. I would kick off a public information campaign that educates my subjects on the wondrous nature of life and the power of positive thinking. After a suitable period of consultation, I would outlaw the word entirely. I would aid the transition to a crisis-free community and economy with a little book that I would wave at my adoring flock. It would be called “The Golden Book”. The full title would be “The Official Guide To Other Words For Crisis.” Each child would receive a copy of The Golden Book at birth.
