0,Prime Minister to visit Paris to 'reset' Australia's relationship with France,politics,"  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to visit Paris to 'reset' Australia's relationship with France Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has confirmed he will visit French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris next week to formally ""reset"" diplomatic relations, which were flung into the freezer after the Morrison government scrapped a massive deal to build 12 submarines. In an interview on the ABC's 7.30, Mr Albanese said he was invited to France by Mr Macron and expected to receive a warm welcome. ""We do need to reset. We've already had very constructive discussions,"" the Prime Minister added. Earlier this month, the new Labor government announced it had agreed to pay French shipbuilder Naval Group $835 million in compensation for the scraped deal. In total, $3.4 billion was spent on the program, a figure Mr Albanese labelled an ""extraordinary waste"" of taxpayer money. ""France, of course, is central to power in Europe, but it's also a key power in the Pacific, in our own region as well,"" Mr Albanese told Leigh Sales. ""It's just one of the reasons why this needs to be a relationship that's nurtured, not damaged. ""What we can offer is a relationship between our respective leaders that won't be leaked in order to make an opportunistic headline in the newspaper, one of respect and honesty in the way that we deal with each other."" The submarine deal with France came at a time when Mr Macron was talking up the country's future as an ""Indo-Pacific power"" fully committed to the region. On a visit to Sydney in 2018, the President said the submarines were just the ""very beginning"" of a closer relationship with Australia that would be developed for ""the coming 50 years"". France is considered a key partner in efforts to limit China's expanding power and influence in the Pacific. Mr Albanese will be in Europe next week for a larger-than-normal NATO summit, where the Russian invasion of Ukraine will be the main item on the agenda. The Ukrainian ambassador in Canberra, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, is hopeful the Prime Minister might use the trip to offer more military assistance to his war-torn country. ""We need more heavy weaponry,"" Mr Myroshnychenko said, adding he hoped Australia would send more Bushmasters, a Bendigo-built troop carrier. ""We've got 40 Bushmasters … it would be great to get another 20,"" he said. ""I think it's coming that we'll get a young [Ukrainian] boy called Bushmaster. ""I think it's coming because Bushmaster is probably the most recognisable brand name of Australia in Ukraine right now, because if you mention Australia the next thing you hear is 'Bushmasters'."" Mr Albanese has also been invited to visit Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. However, as is usually the case for trips near conflict zones, he declined to confirm whether he was taking up the offer. ""We're getting national security advice on that,"" Mr Albanese said. ""We don't want to cause a circumstance whereby there's risk to Australian personnel by undertaking such a visit. ""We'll take that advice and we'll act accordingly."" Even though much of the discussion at NATO is going to be about Russia's invasion, some defence and intelligence experts are urging the Prime Minister to use his trip to remind allies of China's growing aims for our region. ""They're trying to push us around and coerce us in our region of immediate strategic concern,"" Paul Dibb, a highly regarded analyst, said. Mr Dibb had an extensive career in Australian intelligence and defence, and was the primary author of the 1987 Defence White Paper. ""Our Prime Minister, our Foreign Minister and our Defence Minister need to keep at the centre of their minds, deeply etched in, their first priority is the defence of this country and making sure that our immediate region is not dominated by an aggressive expansionist power,"" he said. ""That has to be their first priority and it must not be eroded by being excited, if I may so, about Europe and NATO."" Faced with a number of international and domestic challenges, the new government has also inherited a budget that is on track to be more than a trillion dollars in debt in a few years' time. With inflation and interest rates rising, the Prime Minister has said some things he would like to do in the government's first budget in October will have to wait. ""We're going to have to really put the brakes on some of the spending which is there,"" Mr Albanese said. ""I've made it very clear there are a range of things we would like to do that we won't be able to do in our first budget. ""We will also be going through, line by line, looking for the waste."" A number of economists predict the government will have to start a difficult conversation about how the nation pays for the services Australians have come to expect. ""I expect the October budget will be simply about delivering on the promises they took to the election,"" Danielle Wood from the Grattan Institute said. ""I think by the time we get to next May, those fiscal challenges are going to be really starting to bite."" Labor's election commitment was to not raise taxes or have new ones — except on multinationals — though, in the longer term, broader reform may be required. ""I think tax has to be on the agenda,"" Ms Wood said. ""That may just be making the case for changes that the government might take to the next election.""

1,"WA's lowest paid workers just got a pay rise, but it's well behind Perth's inflation rate",politics,"  WA workers on minimum wage to get 5.2 per cent pay rise to help with cost of living The minimum wage in Western Australia will increase by 5.25 per cent, giving the state's lowest paid workers an extra $40.90 per week, following a decision by the WA Industrial Relations Commission. The increase is lower than what Unions WA and the WA Council of Social Services [WACOSS] had been seeking and is below Perth's inflation rate of 7.6 per cent. However, it is slightly ahead of last week's federal Fair Work Commission decision to raise the national minimum wage by 5.2 per cent. Chief commissioner Stephen Kenner said while the state's economy was strong, some low income households were finding it difficult to make ends meet given the rate of inflation. ""This has had a significant impact on the cost of living for the low paid,"" he said. ""A substantial body of data was before the commission in relation to low income households and the difficulties they have in meeting rising living costs in terms of rents, food and energy costs and rising fuel prices."" Commissioner Kenner noted that since last year's decision, health and border restrictions in WA had eased and there was record low unemployment. The hourly minimum wage will be lifted to $21.38 from July, a 5.2 per cent increase, after the cost of living increased dramatically. He said the IRC was mindful of increased costs to employers, including changes to compulsory superannuation contributions. There was a risk that businesses would pass on rising costs to consumers. The minimum wage will rise to $819.90 per week, up from $779, while other award wage workers will get rises of 4.65 per cent. The rise has been welcomed by unions and WACOSS, with UnionsWA secretary Owen Whittle calling on all employers to increase wages. ""This needs to be the first step to ensure that all workers get a significant pay rise,"" he said. ""We know the cost of living in WA has been the highest in the country and that's why we needed to see a minimum wage increase that was larger than the federal minimum wage increase."" WACOSS chief executive Louise Giolitto said it would make a huge difference to families. ""We know that West Australian families are really struggling at the moment,"" she said. With everything from mortgage rates to grocery prices and energy bills going up, more Australians are under financial pressure. We want to hear how it's impacting you. ""This will go some way of helping them keep the roofs over their heads, the lights on and three meals on the table. ""We know in Western Australia we've got an inflation rate of 7.6 per cent, so to some extent it's gone back slightly in real wages. ""But we're pleased it's at least kept pace and slightly better than the federal wage case."" She said the community services sector had seen increases of 20-30 per cent in people seeking income support. But the Chamber of Commerce said this was not the time to increase labour costs to this degree. It said the decision ""further increases"" the gap between the state and federal minimum wage and would ""pile on"" higher costs for sole traders and partnerships at a time of surging costs of materials and labour. WA businesses would be further disadvantaged when compared to the majority of businesses covered by the national system, the chamber said in a statement.

2,Bureaucrats said plum US job would be handled internally one day before Barilaro quit politics,politics,"  Changing rules for recruitment of new trade commissioners discussed days before John Barilaro quit politics In the days before John Barilaro announced his plans to leave politics, emails show bureaucrats discussing changing the rules for the recruitment of new trade commissioners, then deciding the plum US role would be handled ""as an internal matter"". The former NSW deputy premier was named last week as the state's new senior trade and investment commissioner (STIC) to the Americas, to be based in New York, a job which comes with a salary package topping $500,000. Documents obtained through parliament show there was a previous round of recruitment, in which two candidates were rated very highly, yet the role was readvertised in December. Emails in those documents reveal that in early September, Investment NSW had identified a preferred candidate and a draft contract was being prepared, with a target for them to start in October. But on September 21, Investment NSW's general counsel wrote to the director of people and culture, saying an issue had been raised about the employment of several STIC roles under the government sector employment act. Dominic Perrottet says once complete, he will make the investigation into the $500,000 appointment public. ""We are now asked to consider whether there are alternative methods that STICs could be employed,"" he wrote. ""Specifically, we have been asked whether there is an option for ministerial appointments."" Ten days later on October 1 — the same day Gladys Berejiklian announced she would step down as premier — the chief of staff to Investment NSW CEO Amy Brown sent another email to several colleagues. ""FYl — Amy will speak with Marianne [Broadbent from the recruitment firm], but needless to say, there are no more STICs whose appointment Investment will be involved with now — so shortlisting/panels etc are no longer needed."" Two days later, Ms Brown emailed Dr Broadbent. ""I appreciate that you'll keep this confidential, but we've now had confirmed instructions to commence the preparation of legislation to convert the global senior trade & investment commissioners to statutory officers (ie ministerial appointments),"" she said. ""The Agent General for London and STIC for Tokyo will be transitioned across to the new arrangements. This means that the recruitment process for the STIC positions in Singapore, India/Middle East and China will need to be ceased, and all candidates informed that we're not going any further with the process. ""We will be handling the STIC New York position as an internal matter."" Mr Barilaro announced his intention to leave politics the next day. The ABC sent detailed questions to both Investment NSW and Trade Minister Stuart Ayres's office asking why the department had been asked to convert the roles to ministerial appointments, and by who. ""Senior trade and investment commissioner roles are not statutory roles, they are public service roles established under the Government Sector Employment Act and regulations and they are employed by Investment NSW,"" an Investment NSW spokesperson said in a statement. A NSW Government spokesperson said in a statement the Department of Premier and Cabinet would review the recruitment process. ""It is not appropriate to make further comment on the matter at this time,"" the statement read. ""The review will be made public as soon as it is received."" Mr Barilaro referred the ABC back to Investment NSW. The ABC has also sent questions to the office of Treasurer Matt Kean, as well as the former premier Gladys Berejiklian. On Wednesday, a motion was passed in the upper house calling on the government to delay the appointment until a parliamentary inquiry into the appointment reports back in a few weeks' time. Greens MLC Cate Faehrmann, who chairs the committee which will be inquiring into Mr Barilaro's appointment, said there were serious questions to be answered. ""This looks like there was an intervention from the top to deal with a political problem. And that was John Barilaro,"" she said. ""What we need to know now, though, is who within the current government knew what — what did the Premier know and what did the Treasurer know?"" That committee will meet tonight to decide on terms of reference and hearings, but could call witnesses as early as next week. On Thursday, Premier Dominic Perrottet announced he had asked the secretary of the Department of Premier and Cabinet to conduct a review. ""He will provide that report to me, I will review it and make it public,"" he said. During question time, Mr Perrottet said it was not required that the six STIC roles be approved by cabinet, but two had gone to cabinet in error. ""It's not necessary or appropriate for such appointments to be approved by cabinet, given the positions are senior executive positions appointed by the CEO following a merit recruitment process,"" he said. ""Cabinet approval would have raised risks in terms of the actual or perceived non-compliance with the merit principle in the GSE Act 2013. ""Having regard to these factors, the advice we've received, Mr Speaker, is that the cabinet could not intervene in that process.""

3,'Not satisfactory': SA government investigates how a patient was left to wait on ED floor,politics,"  The South Australian government says an investigation is underway after a photo emerged of a patient laying on the waiting room floor of an emergency department. The photo, posted on social media, shows a person on the hospital floor with a white blanket covering them during a reported five-hour wait. Premier Peter Malinauskas said the fact someone felt the best place for them was to lay on the floor was ""not satisfactory"". ""And it's important that, while we acknowledge failures in the system, we don't confuse that with the extraordinary effort that is being undertaken on a daily, hourly basis from nurses, doctors, orderlies, cleaners in the hospital system who have been working back-to-back-to-back-to-back,"" he said. ""So, we acknowledge their efforts, but also acknowledge that what happened wasn't acceptable and that's why there's an investigation into that particular case."" On Wednesday, the doctors' union sounded the alarm of what it said was serious safety problems in the overstretched emergency departments at the state's two biggest hospitals. The hospital overcrowding problem has been brewing for years under successive Labor and Liberal governments. But SA Liberal leader David Speirs said the government made health ""a massive issue"" leading up to the March state election and urged them to ""get on with what you promised"". ""They've now been in office for three months and things have been worse than ever,"" he said. Opposition health spokeswoman Ashton Hurn said the government was focused on ending ramping at the expense of issues inside the hospital, and a system-wide review was needed. ""Our health system is under enormous pressure and it's just getting worse as we're plunging into the depths of winter,"" she said. But Mr Malinauskas said his government was moving at ""warp speed"" to try and improve the situation it inherited. ""This time last year in South Australia our hospital system was under the pump with record ramping and there was zero flu and zero COVID and now we've got both all at the same time,"" he said. ""Now we've put hundreds of extra beds into the system in the space of 10 weeks, which has been working flat-chat we're recruiting more staff than ever before. ""But naturally you get to a point where there's only so much you can do before the long-term investments that we're making come into effect."" ""And we're moving at warp speed to try and achieve that in the context of health service delivery, but the system is under massive strain around the nation at the moment and South Australia is no exception unfortunately.""

4,Andrews government facing frontbench exodus ahead of November election,politics,"  Health Minister Martin Foley among high-profile Victorian Labor ministers to retire before November election Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is set to lose decades of experience from his frontbench, with the mass resignation of four of his most senior government ministers just months from the November election. Health Minister Martin Foley, Deputy Premier James Merlino, Sport Minister Martin Pakula and Police Minister Lisa Neville are expected to stand down from their portfolios as early as Friday. They are set to join Planning and Housing Minister Richard Wynne, who announced last year he would not recontest his seat at the next election, with some in Labor also expecting him to stand down from his portfolio on Friday. It gives the Premier the opportunity to refresh his frontbench ahead of the November polls. The ministers will remain in parliament until the November election, but a cabinet reshuffle is expected in the coming days, with Speaker Colin Brooks, Sonya Kilkenny and Lizzie Blandthorn already put forward as possible replacements. The group joins the long list of ministers who have left the ministry since the last election, including Jill Hennessy, Jenny Mikakos, Gavin Jennings, Adem Somyurek, Marlene Kairouz, Luke Donnellan and Robin Scott. As Health Minister, Mr Foley oversaw some of the biggest decisions regarding Victoria's COVID-19 pandemic response, and was a frequent fixture at the daily press conference updates. His expected retirement comes as Victoria's healthcare system remains under severe strain, with critical staff shortages, ambulance ramping and triple-0 call delays plaguing the state's hospitals. Once touted as a future leader, James Merlino stood in as Acting Premier last year while Premier Daniel Andrews recovered from a serious back injury.

5,'There is a better way': NSW Labor Leader makes election promises in budget reply speech ,politics,"  NSW Labor Leader Chris Minns uses budget reply to accuse government of 'spin', promises pre-schools, toll relief NSW Opposition Leader Chris Minns has criticised the state government for being all ""spin"" in his budget reply speech delivered in parliament today. Mr Minns used the speech to start outlining policies which Labor will take to the state election in March, as an alternative to the Coalition government. ""After 12 years of Liberal and National government, after four Liberal premiers and four Liberal treasurers,"" Mr Minns said. ""This Premier and this Treasurer have a press release for almost everything, but a plan for almost nothing."" He promised that a Labor government would build 100 pre-schools on existing primary school sites within its first term of office and stated that all new primary schools should be built with a pre-school. Mr Minns said the plan would help deliver the government's proposed universal pre-kindergarten a year quicker than the current timeline of 2030. ""I think we've already waited long enough,"" Mr Minns said. ""All this will help deliver universal pre-school for four-year-old children well before 2030."" The Opposition has also committed to spending more on toll relief for commuters than the government. In the state budget, the government allocated $520 million over two years to a toll rebate scheme where commuters would get up to $750 shaved off their annual toll bill once they spend $375. There's plenty of health spending and some big reforms for first home buyers — this is how NSW Treasurer Matt Kean's first budget will affect you. Labor said it would keep that rebate scheme and add a further $130 million by using the government revenue earned from the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel tolls. But it doesn't have a policy as to how the toll relief would be delivered. Mr Minns has also ruled out privatising both pieces of infrastructure, as the government will have to make a decision about the tunnel because the contract expires in August after three years of tolling since it opened. ""The government has refused to reveal what they will do with this critical piece of transport infrastructure,"" Mr Minns said. ""A NSW Labor government will keep Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel in government hands."" The Opposition Leader also used to his speech to announce that he would set targets for government contracts, to ensure more go to local industries. A Labor government would also abolish the controversial Transport Asset Holding Entity, which was set up to run the state's rail profits and under legislation has to turn a profit. ""We will deliver a sound plan, similar to the model previously managed,"" Mr Minns said. ""Where rail operators owned the assets they operated."" The Treasurer Matt Kean has criticised the budget reply speech for having no vision. ""It wasn't a small target strategy, it was a small minded strategy,"" Mr Kean said. ""There were no policies for women, no policies for the environment, no policies for climate change, no policies for health, no policies for transport and no policies for housing."" Mr Minns said more policy announcements would be made in the lead up the election, but declared ""there is a better way"" to run New South Wales. ""Together we can change the way this works,"" Mr Minns said. ""Only if we turn the page on this government, and begin anew, with a government with a real and credible plan.""

6,Union chief says Reserve Bank in 'boomer fantasy land' over wage-price spiral fears,politics,"  ACTU Secretary Sally McManus says Reserve Bank in 'boomer fantasy land' over wage-price spiral fears ACTU Secretary Sally McManus says the Reserve Bank is out of touch and living in ""boomer fantasy land"" if it thinks workers can afford real cuts to their wages. The union boss said the RBA governor Philip Lowe changed his tune in his speech earlier this week about wages. ""He was the one who said that so long as wages keep up with inflation and productivity, they're not inflationary,"" she told RN Breakfast. On Tuesday, Dr Lowe warned pay rises above 3.5 per cent, which is half the 7 per cent inflation forecast by the end of the year, could force the RBA to go harder on interest rates and prolong high inflation. ""Three-and-a-half per cent is kind of the anchoring point that I want people to keep in mind,"" Dr Lowe said in his speech. Last week, the Fair Work Commission lifted the minimum wage by 5.2 per cent, to $21.38 an hour, and workers on award rates will go up 4.6 per cent. This would affect more than 2.7 million workers. The RBA's view on wages growth was backed by Employment Minister Tony Burke that workers might need to take a real wage cut to prevent high inflation. The Reserve Bank Governor expects inflation to crest at 7 per cent by year's end, before gently easing in the new year after a series of interest rate rises. A recession will be avoided and employment will remain strong. At least that's the plan. ""I know that [RBA] board doesn't have anyone there who participates in negotiations for wages or the wage-setting system from the workers side,"" McManus said. ""And that’s a pretty big problem if you’re, you know, making assumptions or trying to understand trying to analyse how things work."" Although Dr Lowe said there were signs of domestic factors contributing to the current high inflation, Ms McManus argued that inflation ""has absolutely nothing to do with wages"". ""We're not achieving 3.5 per cent, let alone 5 per cent, let alone 7 per cent. And so to think somehow that the system is going to deliver across-the-board pay increases of 5 or 7 per cent is boomer fantasy land,"" she said. ""Not realising that whole system would be incapable of delivering that. We do not have centralised bargaining in this country. It would not be possible for that to happen."" The RBA admits it suffered ""reputational damage"" when it tried to wind back its COVID-19 pandemic stimulus program. Ms McManus rejected the warning of a 1970s-style wage-price spiral as a notion used by employers to deny pay increases. ""Nurses and teachers will be pushing to make sure this year that their wages don't go backwards, their wages have gone backwards for years now,"" she said. ""Even the Reserve Bank governor is saying, 'it's fair enough this year or this catch up for what happened during COVID'."" Nurses and midwives across NSW will walk off the job next week in protest of the state government's budget decision of a 3 per cent pay rise for public sector workers.

7,"Women in WA's FIFO industry victims of 'appalling behaviours', landmark sex assault report finds",politics,"  Inquiry into sexual assaults and harassment in WA's FIFO industry urges reporting overhaul, training A scathing report into sexual assault and harassment within WA's fly-in, fly-out mining industry has found women have been subjected to ""an appalling range of behaviours"". Titled 'Enough is Enough', the report details how sexual harassment is ""generally accepted or overlooked"" and describes the ""failure"" of miners to recognise what was happening in their workplaces. Included in the report are stories of several women, including one who was ""knocked unconscious in her donga and awoke to find her jeans and underpants around her ankles"". Another said a man ""forced his hand down her top numerous times in front of other workers, and no one did anything"". Another shocking account details a ""powerplay behaviour"" described as ""shovelling"", where iron ore would be dumped on the cabs of trucks driven by women if they didn’t comply with sexual requests. ""To hear the lived reality of the taunts, attacks and targeted violence, the devastation and despair the victims experienced, the threats or loss of their livelihood that resulted, was shattering and it's completely inexcusable,"" the inquiry's chair, Libby Mettam, told parliament. ""This represents a failure of the industry to protect its workers, and raises real questions about why government was not better across this safety issue,"" she said. The report makes 24 recommendations, including overhauling reporting and training in the sector. A suggestion that surfaced during hearings was an industry-wide ""blacklist"" to prevent known offenders from being employed on other sites, as the inquiry heard was common. But Ms Mettam said that raised issues of confidentiality and natural justice, as well as what the threshold would be for inclusion. ""We have recommended the industry explore options, which could operate effectively and fairly to prevent habitual sexual harassment offenders continuing to be re-employed in the mining workplace,"" she said. ""It is a complex policy issue but it's too important an issue to ignore."" Minister for Women Simone McGurk said the government would consider the recommendations, including the idea of a blacklist, to see whether it was practical. Chamber of Minerals and Energy chief executive Rob Carruthers said the industry was already working to improve its recruitment and vetting procedures, but would consider the idea. ""Any such process needs to be practical and drive better outcomes, so we'd review that in full detail,"" he said. Representing some of the state's biggest miners, Mr Carruthers said it was a ""very challenging day"" for the industry. ""To those that have been impacted by sexual assault and harassment in our industry, on behalf of our industry, I apologise,"" he said. While acknowledging it would take time to digest the report, Mr Carruthers said the industry was already committed to stamping out sexual assault and harassment and would support recommendations which were practical. The report's recommendations include: The inquiry's report also questioned why the industry regulator, the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety, had only received 22 reports of sexual harassment across a seven-year period, despite police investigating 23 in just two years. Senior WA Police reveal the number of sexual harassment claims stemming from mine sites in the state. ""It is difficult to believe the regulator could have accepted this level of reporting as reflecting the true situation on the ground,"" Ms Mettam said. However, she said there had been positive steps made by Worksafe WA, which had issued a new code of conduct naming sexual harassment as unacceptable behaviour, and moved to improve its data collection. But the report also recommended more should be done, particularly to improve the sharing of data between different agencies, including Police and CrimeStoppers. Worksafe only recently took over responsibility for mine safety, and commissioner Darren Kavanagh said work was already underway to help the industry improve and to lift reporting rates. ""I'm confident that with the implementation of [new work health and safety] regulations and clearer reporting obligations, that industry now have that guidance, and so I expect industry will comply with that from now on,"" he said. Committee member and Labor MP for Collie-Preston Jodie Hanns said the core of the problems raised rested with mining companies themselves, and that the job of fixing the issue could not be left to taxpayers. Mark McGowan urges the mining industry to take action in the wake of a report commissioned by Rio Tinto that revealed widespread experiences of sexism, sexual harassment and assault. ""This is a multi-billion-dollar industry, it earns billions of dollars from the resources owned by the people of Western Australia,"" she told WA Parliament. ""The industry has failed in its efforts to do the things it must do, ensure a safe workplace for its workers."" Ms Hanns said the inquiry also led to her realising she would not want her own daughter to work in the mining industry. ""The answer for me is not the laws that we can make as government, it's not the role of Parliament even, it's the very real risk to her safety, to her personal safety, and a risk of sexual assault and sexual harassment,"" she said. ""That should terrify every parent in Western Australia of young girls and women."" Reporting procedures, both internal and external to companies, were another area of concern raised by the report, which called for ""victim-centric procedures"" to deal with complaints. ""We were surprised how many of the people who made submissions to us were ignorant of available reporting systems or clearly mistrusted them,"" Ms Mettam said. ""The key to change is embedding a workplace culture in all mining workforces that does not tolerate sexual assault or abuse, empowering bystanders, like the culture change programs that have addressed physical safety with such success. ""Now it is up to the mining industry and government to seriously address the recommendations in this report. ""It is time to come together to make the cultural, system and legislative changes required to equip, prepare and educate the workforce."" Mines Minister Bill Johnston said the government would stand with and support victims in any way possible, adding the industry had work to do. Ms McGurk said while the issue was not unique to mining, the circumstances of many sites exacerbated the problem. ""This is of course a vicious cycle, where women aren't attracted to work in the industry, let alone stay in the industry, because of the dominance of men and a disregard of women's experiences, but it does need to be addressed,"" she said. She said the government was taking sexual harassment and assault in the workplace seriously, and said it was up to the mining sector to deliver on its promises. The inquiry ran for almost a year, receiving nearly 100 submissions and examining some of the state's biggest miners as well as government regulators. It heard that BHP had terminated the employment of 48 staff for inappropriate conduct over two years while  Rio Tinto had sacked at least 12 people for sexual harassment or assault last year. BHP reveals in the past two years it has sacked 48 workers in relation to inappropriate sexual behaviour. One woman gave evidence she had allegedly been propositioned for sex at two separate mine sites and would only use the gym at 3am when no one else was around. Ahead of Thursday's report, the government-appointed workplace culture expert Elizabeth Shaw reviewed the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety's responses to sexual harassment and assault within the mining industry. Earlier this year, Rio Tinto released an internal review into its culture, which detailed accounts of bullying, racism and sexism.

8,"Queensland Labor MPs make 'extraordinary move', delay decision on CCC's Trad legal costs",politics,"  Queensland Labor MPs fail to show up to Parliamentary Crime and Corruption meeting on CCC's Jackie Trad legal costs All government MPs sitting on a corruption watchdog oversight committee failed to turn up to a meeting where they would have had to vote on whether to release costs relating to former deputy premier Jackie Trad's legal action. The Parliamentary Crime and Corruption Committee (PCCC) was due to meet on Thursday over whether to publicly release the legal bill incurred by the Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) in court action brought by Ms Trad. Ms Trad has taken action in the Supreme Court to have a CCC report withheld from public release. It is not known whether the report makes any findings against Ms Trad. Taxpayers are funding some or all of Ms Trad's legal costs but the details of those and the CCC's legal bill remain secret. In a move the committee chair has branded ""extraordinary,"" the four Labor MPs sent their apologies ahead of the PCCC meeting and did not turn up, meaning a quorum could not be reached and the meeting could not go ahead. The chair of the PCCC, LNP member Jon Krause, told reporters it was ""disappointing the government members haven't seen fit to show up to integrity matters in Queensland"". Queensland does not have an upper house, so committees are tasked with investigating issues and reporting back to parliament, scrutinising legislation, and monitoring bodies like the CCC. Last month Labor members of the committee blocked an attempt to reveal the legal costs incurred by the CCC in Ms Trad's court action. The watchdog has provided its Parliamentary oversight committee with details of its legal bills so far, but Labor's committee members opposed releasing it because the matter was ongoing. That meeting was postponed until today, with Mr Krause saying he ""would have consulted with other members of the committee about a new meeting time"". ""These are matters both on the public agenda but also the private meeting that needed to be dealt with in the committee, important matters, and it's disappointing they haven't been able to show today,"" he said. ""It's an extraordinary move."" He said the CCC had not indicated the information relating to the legal costs should be kept from the public. ""It was a question on notice asked in public, it should be answered in public,"" he said. ""I'm trying to enhance the committee process and having information held up in committee which the CCC in this case have clearly said should be made public could be considered an abuse of process, an abuse of the government's majority on committees. ""What you have just seen here is emblematic of the government controlling all the committees in parliament."" The committee consists of seven members – four Labor MPs, and three LNP MPs, including the chair. Asked why she was not able to attend the meeting, Labor MP and committee member Jonty Bush said she had other appointments. ""The reality is, we did have other appointments this morning and that was made known last night,"" she said. ""It is a really busy week for us, regrettably as you'd understand. Very happy to work with the committee, of course, and work with them about getting some future dates up and keep the work progressing."" The other Labor MPs who did not show up were Jess Pugh, Jennifer Howard (who was substituting for Jimmy Sullivan) and Don Brown (who was standing in for Melissa McMahon). In response to questions from the ABC, Mr Brown replied: ""I don't discuss committee business, especially PCCC."" ""At 8.30am I was doing my whips job, which is what I do at that time before every sitting day,"" he said. The other Labor MPs have also been contacted for comment. MPs who are members of a parliamentary committee currently receive an additional salary of $25,118 per year – taking their total annual wage to $191,074. A union boss has also hit out at the state government, saying it has not taken meaningful action on political lobbying. In a statement released on Wednesday, Michael Ravbar — the state secretary of the CFMEU, a Labor-affiliated union — said if the Premier was serious about restoring public trust, ""she must move swiftly to excise this cancer"". ""The CFMEU raised this issue at the last Labor State Conference, yet regrettably the Palaszczuk government has displayed a terminal reluctance to do anything more than hope the problem will go away,"" he said. Last week the CCC revealed it found a small number of key groups and individuals appeared to have a ""disproportionate amount of access"" to the government and may be using those relationships to ""influence government decisions"". We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Asked in parliament about his comments, Ms Palaszczuk said she has previously spoken about looking at tightening the requirements around lobbying. ""I've said publicly, and I'll say it again today publicly, I absolutely do believe that we need to tighten up some of those definitions around lobbyists,"" she said. ""I cannot be clearer, Mr Speaker. ""Peter Coaldrake is due to bring down a report very soon and the government will be acting.""

9,Wind farm connection causes lights to flicker across South Australia,politics,"  Wind farm's connection to power grid causes lights to flicker across South Australia A connection between Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park and the national electricity grid is under investigation for causing lights to flicker and dim across South Australia for hours this morning. Energy distributor ElectraNet said the privately-owned power generator connected its new wind farm to the grid in South Australia's north about 1:30am, causing a ""voltage issue"". There have been widespread reports of house and street lights flickering across the state as a result. South Australian Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis said the issue was not related to AEMO's gradual end to its intervention to wholesale price caps, which started from 4am and would go for 24 hours. The minister stopped short of assigning blame but said it could be ""a connection issue"". ""We don't know what the actual cause is. We know the source of the problem but we don't know who was causing it,"" he said. ""It could have been [the] renewable energy park, it could have been ElectraNet."" ElectraNet said it worked with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to identify the cause and the third party was disconnected from the network. It said power supplies returned to normal about 5:30am. ElectraNet interim chief executive Rainer Korte said the fluctuations had less of an impact than they otherwise would have because the wind farm generator concerned was only in the commissioning phase. ""We don't like to see these impacts, but the reason we take a cautious approach to commissioning the gradual release of capacity is exactly for this reason — to identify any issues and limit the impact of any issues that may be identified,"" he said. A suspended electricity spot market, rolling blackouts, a ""botched transition"" to renewable energy – these terms were all used to describe SA's 2016/17 energy crisis. Mr Koutsantonis said large operators such as GFG and BHP noticed the ""voltage fluctuations"". He denies there was an inherent problem with renewable energy. ""I don't think it was anything malicious or dangerous. I just think it's probably testing, probably either a new generator that's attempting to establish its connection to the grid after commission,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide this morning. ""There was testing and as demand started to increase into the day, they pulled the testing and the flickering stopped."" Premier Peter Malinauskas said ElectraNet controlled the transmission lines from power stations to localised networks. ""The transmission lines issue sits with ElectraNet and apparently there's a frequency issue there with one of their feeders,"" he said. ""I understand there is an investigation underway from AEMO with ElectraNet."" AEMO last week suspended the market and directed generators to pump power into the network to keep lights on.

10,"analysis: The RBA boss has a message, but you might not like it if you have a job",politics,"  The RBA boss wants you to follow his path away from recession — even if that means more real wage cuts for workers ""We are not on a preset path,"" Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe observed on Tuesday, in the economic understatement of the week. Indeed, the path ahead looks no more predetermined than it has for the past two-and-a-half years. Since COVID came along, followed by the war in Ukraine, no official forecast has survived more than a few months. The outlook remains uncertain, but Lowe is trying his best to show the way — the path he would like everyone to stick to. The RBA Governor sees the inflation wave cresting at 7 per cent by year's end, before gently easing in the new year after a further series of interest rate rises. A recession will be avoided and employment will remain strong. That's the plan. It involves some pain for mortgage holders along the way, but no economic crisis. Don't panic. And definitely don't do anything unnecessary that could drive inflation even higher and send the economy onto an entirely different path. Lowe has publicly outlined this preferred path scenario twice in two weeks. He's keen to get the message out. Last week he appeared on the ABC's 7:30 program to talk about his chosen course. This week he delivered a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia. He wants everyone to know about the planned path. He is showing the way. And he's warning of the dangers involved if we veer off course and end up somewhere else entirely. To stay on the path, Lowe wants everyone to do their bit. This includes workers who might have hoped for some real wage growth after the election of a Labor government, which campaigned successfully with an argument about ""everything going up except your wages"". Minimum wage earners will see an increase of 5.2 per cent after a decision by the independent umpire last week, something the newly elected government was quick to welcome. This is what life looks like for people in some of the world's most expensive cities where inflation surges are taking hold. The RBA boss, however, doesn't want that repeated across the workforce. Inflation might be headed to 7 per cent, but Lowe is advocating a wage rise of half that amount. ""Three-and-a-half per cent is kind of the anchoring point that I want people to keep in mind,"" he says. In other words, it's a continued real wage cut for most workers in the short term — if we're to stay on Lowe's preferred path. Labor isn't exactly celebrating that suggestion of only modest wage growth, but nor is it disputing the logic of avoiding a wage-price spiral. That would be far worse economically and politically for the Albanese government. But wages aren't the only threat that could see us veer off the path. Government spending is the other risk. So far Treasurer Jim Chalmers appears to be heeding the warnings from the RBA. From July 1, more than $12 billion will be pumped into the economy in the form of turbo-charged Low and Middle Income Tax Offset payments, announced before the election by the Morrison government and promptly backed in by Labor. Beyond that, Chalmers has resisted calls for additional cost of living relief. In fact, he's begun laying the groundwork for cuts, telling the Australian Financial Review on the weekend there was ""a case for a more substantial look"" at spending in his October budget. State governments, however, appear to have missed the memo. On the very day Lowe delivered his speech about the path ahead and repeated his warnings about veering off course, two state Treasurers announced big spending budgets. In NSW, the Coalition government is boosting spending by more than $24 billion over the next four years. Almost half of that, or $10 billion, will flow in the coming 12 months, when the government just happens to be facing an election. The spending, to be clear, is not all bad or necessarily inflationary. New childcare centres, an extra year of pre-kindergarten education and tentative steps towards replacing an inefficient stamp duty with land tax, should all have a productive benefit. They're all aimed at growing the economic pie. Less productive is the $7.2 billion in ""cost-of-living"" measures announced by the NSW Treasurer to help with everything from road tolls, school costs, and energy bills. Similarly, the Queensland budget wasn't all bad. A big boost in health funding should ease pressures on the system. The multi-pronged cost of living crisis has spared few Australians from increased financial stress. In response, cash-strapped households have been forced to find new ways to cut back. But an extra $6.8 billion to help Queenslanders with ""cost of living pressures"" is again pumping more money and stimulus into the economy — just as inflation climbs higher. The temptation for politicians to pump cost of living relief into voters' pockets is understandable. Whether it wins votes is debatable, as the recent federal election showed. Whether it further fuels inflation and drives us off Lowe's path, we're about to see. ""It's a fairly narrow path,"" Lowe said in his speech on Tuesday. ""It's highly unlikely that we'll get it exactly right. We'll make mistakes. I hope the mistakes are not too large and we can self-correct."" Nothing is preset.

11,analysis: I'm on Putin's naughty list for my work — and I couldn't be prouder,politics,"  I woke up on Friday morning a pawn in a Kafka-esque story. Except I hadn't been transformed into a chess piece but was a diplomatic pawn, a small player in a much larger international story. I read the news that I and 119 other ""prominent"" Australians were banned from travelling to Russia ""indefinitely"". The Russian sanctions were a response to Western sanctions and the ""spreading of false information about Russia"". The Russian Foreign Ministry announced 121 people had been sanctioned but, in a beautifully Russian bureaucratic bungle, Air Vice-Marshal Darren Goldie was banned twice, making it just 120 of us on the list. As usual, I was the second person in my family to know. My wife had woken before me and was listening to the news. ""Russia has banned a bunch more Australians,"" she told me. ""Bet you're on the list."" The rest of the list was made up of journalists, business people, army officials, politicians and the odd academic like myself. What unites us is our outspoken criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. This is one club of which I am proud to be a member. And rather than silence the critics, Russia's actions only give our concerns more exposure. After all, you wouldn't be reading this if Russia hadn't banned me. I have a number of Russian friends and colleagues that I am saddened now not to be able to visit. I was at a conference in Moscow a few years ago and had a great time. I promised then to return to see the delights of St Petersburg. And I always imagined one day I'd follow Paul Theroux's footsteps on the trans-Siberian express. But it seems I will now only ever read about such adventures from the comfort of my armchair. This brings me to my outspoken criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. At the start of last week, I had the pleasure to speak about artificial intelligence (AI) at DevFest Ukraine, an online charity event put on by the tech community that raised more than US$100,000 ($143,500) for those impacted by Russia's invasion. And, in acknowledging the ownership of the land on which I was speaking, I acknowledged the ownership of all lands illegally occupied, including those in Ukraine. Among the sanctioned individuals are journalists from ABC News, Sydney Morning Herald and Sky News, as well as various defence officials. But I am sure it was another act that was the cause of my sanction: casting doubt on Russia's claims about AI. In April, I was interviewed for a story about Russian weaponry in The Australian — and as the author is the only tech journalist who made the Russian list, I'm confident that article is to blame. I can just imagine the Russian official in some non-descript office in bowels of the Foreign Ministry reading The Australian and pulling out the file to which my name was added. The article reported my significant concerns about Russia's use of the ""smart"" AI-enabled POM-3 anti-personnel mine in Ukraine. Such mines are banned by the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines (informally known as the Ottawa Treaty or the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention). Russia is not a party to this treaty but 164 states are parties to it, including Australia and every country in Europe including Ukraine. The POM-3 is a particularly barbaric mine, designed to cause maximum damage to humans. It's a descendant of the German Bouncing Betty mine used in World War II. When the mine is triggered, an expelling charge projects the warhead roughly one metre above ground level, at which point the warhead detonates. The warhead is packed with toothed rings designed to harm vital organs in a target's body many metres away. The mine is triggered by a seismic sensor that detects approaching footsteps. Russia claims the mine is equipped with AI that can recognise friendly soldiers, thus minimising the risk of collateral damage. This is an absurd claim. The footsteps of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers will produce the same seismic footprint. No AI can tell them apart. Russia's wild claim illustrates a worrying trend where states will say weapons use ""AI"" to target combatants rather than civilians. Handing over battlefield decision-making to AI is a hugely dangerous proposition. And this is just one the many dangers of AI in warfare. Others include the lowering of the barriers to war, and the development of new weapons of mass destruction. Ukrainian forces pushed out Vladimir Putin's men from the eastern region of Kharkiv but, in the Russian military's wake, they found explosives hidden everywhere, from fields to a child's bedroom. Fortunately, it's not too late to regulate this space. Indeed, the increasing use of hi-tech drones in the conflict in Ukraine has been a wake-up call to militaries around the world that technologies like this are fundamentally changing how we fight wars. Discussions are moving slowly at the United Nations to limit the use of lethal autonomous weapons. Australia has an opportunity to take leadership in this area. Australia has long been at the forefront of international efforts to combat the spread of chemical and biological weapons but has taken a back seat in the diplomatic efforts around autonomous weapons. It's time we took up the cause of regulating weapons that use AI to identify, track and target humans. I could then get back to reading about the wonderful history of Russia from my armchair.

12,analysis: The West must not forget the 20th century's hard-learned lessons of war,politics,"  A large-scale, brutal conflict of the kind that many assumed lay in the past but no longer in the future has been witnessed by governments, military organisations and the public at large in the 116 days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is important to learn from this because it is possible that other massed attrition-style wars may occur in our near future. This is something that democracies have dealt with before yet we have, unfortunately, forgotten many of the hard-learned lessons of the 20th century. Perhaps one of the most important lessons to have been forgotten is that a vital part of any national deterrent is the capacity to design and produce the artefacts of war – weapons, ammunition and trained humans – in large quantities. In the wake of the Cold War, and the draw down on military spending, military forces were downsized (reducing demand), and militaries engaged in operations that only had short periods of high intensity combat. As a consequence, most military organisations lost the institutional memory of industrial scale activities. In an essay this week, former US Army officer Alex Vershinin explored the issue of ammunition shortages, particularly for artillery, in the Russo-Ukraine War. His findings make sobering reading. This isn't just because of the huge increase in artillery ammunition that will be needed for the Ukrainians to sustain their defence against Russia. It is because this is also an issue that applies to many other aspects of contemporary military institutions beyond ammunition production. There are three key aspects requiring attention to ensure countries like Australia, the United States and others are able to sustain their militaries in wars that may last more than several days. One area is equipment. As seen in Ukraine, war is expensive in consuming equipment. In war, tanks, trucks, artillery, weapons and even personal protective equipment are destroyed by the enemy, in accidents or it just wears out. This can occur in large quantities — and it has in Ukraine. Even if the Ukrainian updates on Russian losses overestimate the destruction of Russian equipment by 100 per cent, that is still 700 tanks and more than 1000 other armoured vehicles destroyed in four months. Contrast this with the US tank production which currently sits at about 130 per year. Despite the barbarity of the Russians and the suffering of the Ukrainian people, the war has been a tragic opportunity for governments and military institutions to learn crucial lessons. The most heartbreaking of all is that theories about the decline of war are obsolete. Therefore, an important component of strategies that prepare military forces for 21st century conflict must be the scaling up national capacity to build large numbers of complex modern weapon systems. Tanks and trucks, artillery and helicopters are expensive and are currently produced in limited numbers. The problem is magnified for ships and aircraft which are produced at a limited number of shipyards and factories. Because of the huge cost and time in building these systems, we will see the greater use of smaller, cheaper autonomous systems. Necessity will drive this in even the most conservative and risk adverse military cultures. But they cannot fully replace tanks, ships and aircraft. We will still need to produce these as well. A second area requiring attention to build more sustainable forces is infrastructure. This is an often-overlooked element of building military capability. Militaries need infrastructure such as bases (where they live and store equipment), jetties and ports, airfields and fuel farms, logistics bases, transport hubs, and training areas. Currently, most western military forces have scaled their infrastructure for their ""force in being"". Bases are sized and supported for a known number of occupants, with minimal expansion capacity. Consequently, any expansion to larger military forces for a large-scale future threat must consider expanded infrastructure. Finally, Western military institutions must review their personnel policies. The central capability of any good military institution is its people. This includes recruiting (or conscription), training, education, experience, leadership, personnel policies, pay and conditions. Unfortunately, wars are expensive in people. Since the end of the Cold War, most military institutions have moved to smaller all-volunteer forces. These smaller forces are trained and educated to a very high level, regardless of their speciality. However, the exquisite training and education systems we have developed in the last three decades are unlikely to scale up if we need to undertake a significant expansion in the size of military forces. The throughput of current training institutions is designed to fill the force in being, not a much larger institution. And systems such as Australia's would not cope with the need to replace hundreds of casualties each day. Additionally, the length of many military courses, which is suitable for peace time, will be too long for expanded organisations. A shift to industrial scale warfare requires a different approach to training and education. One that has a massively increased throughput capacity, and one that focuses just on combat needs. A key trend in 21st century conflict is that ""mass is back"". As I wrote in my book War Transformed, this ""involves large-scale conventional forces, the massed use of autonomous systems, and the wide-scale use of the tools of influence, including sophisticated algorithms."" We are seeing this play out daily in Ukraine. As Vershinin describes, there is much we can learn from the war in Ukraine. But to demonstrate we have learned about war on the industrial scale, Western military institutions will also have to act. They will need to convince their civilian masters of the need to invest in the capacity to build military forces and employ them at industrial scale.

13,analysis: Why superannuation losses will be worse than we think,politics,"  Why superannuation losses are likely to be worse than we think after horror year on global markets Even before last week's market conflagration, the scene was looking ugly. While it may have come as a shock to many, superannuation balances — which ballooned last year through the worst recession in more than a century — had already dipped into the red by late last month just as the financial year was drawing to a close. After last week's gravity pull from rising interest rates, the rout on global stock markets has turned that bleak prospect into a painful reality. Best now to mentally prepare for a significant decline in your retirement savings when that June 30 statement hits the inbox. Even those who have erred on the side of caution — with a more-conservative superannuation option — are likely to see significant declines. The only ones who will be spared are those with the foresight — or good luck — to switch to cash at the beginning of the year. Until last week, it somehow had appeared that global monetary authorities had managed to engineer a major downturn on financial markets — without the usual accompaniment of panic and despair. No more. A mood of despondency has settled over financial markets and — unlike previous downturns — there appears to be little room to hide. Everything of late has been falling. That's made life extremely difficult for investors, home-spun and professional alike. And it's likely to continue. After more than 30 years of declining interest rates and minimal inflation, the world seems poised to enter a new era — or maybe re-enter an old one — of sluggish growth, escalating costs and more expensive capital. It's a world that many investors have never before experienced. Australia has been an outlier on the global stage this year. While Wall Street has been grinding lower since January, higher commodity prices — courtesy of Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine — have kept financial markets news off the front pages here. Until now. After Australians collectively took a bath in the wash-up from the global financial crisis, our big superannuation funds reviewed their investment strategies. Most figured out they had way too much invested in Australian shares, that their portfolios were too closely tied to the local stock market. So, they actively diversified into offshore shares, property, infrastructure, bonds and other alternative assets in a bid to reduce the volatility of your fund's performance. The idea was that, if the bottom falls out of one asset class, it should be offset by others that perform well. Even after that realignment, however, a normal balanced fund would have about 20 per cent of your savings invested in the local market. Luckily, that bias was working well until April because our stock market was shrugging off the global woes. Most other assets, however, were doing rather badly and, unusually, all at once. The sudden re-emergence of inflation — and the drastic rate hikes from central bankers to tame it — temporarily junked the theory around diversification. And, now, local stocks have joined the plunge. International shares, which make up about 30 per cent of most superannuation portfolios, have been on the slide since Christmas. If you've been stunned by the sudden drop in our market last week — which has helped shave 15 per cent from April's peak — consider this. Wall Street is down 23 per cent since January. The technology-heavy Nasdaq, which has driven the stellar performance on Wall Street for more than a decade, is off 32 per cent. As for cryptocurrency, well, don't even go there. At last glance, the entire market was in chaos, with overall losses now more than 70 per cent from the peak. This may come as a shock, but the driving force behind all investments is not the stock market. It is bond markets. Essentially, bonds are IOUs. Both governments and corporations issue them when they raise debt, usually with the promise of a set interest or coupon rate for a given period of time, say 10 years. Once issued, they are traded on open markets that dwarf stock markets. Vast trillions of dollars are invested in them, and the sheer weight of that money makes them the foundation, the bedrock that dictates performance in everything, from interest rates to property, stocks and currencies. In fact, Bill Clinton's advisor, James Carville — the man who famously coined the phrase ""It's the economy, stupid"" — is just as famous for this line: ""I used to think that, if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the President or the Pope. But now I want to be the bond market because you can intimidate everybody."" The past year has been truly intimidating. It has been the worst year on record for US government bonds, with losses of 12 per cent. To put that into context, the second-worst year was 1984, when they shed 2.9 per cent. Because governments rarely default, bonds are considered to be risk-free. That's why they attract so much money and so much attention. For the past 40 years, as interest rates have declined, they have delivered huge gains. Being risk-free, however, doesn't mean you can't lose money on them as many big professional funds managers suddenly have discovered. There's an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices. If punters think rates will fall, they bid up bond prices. And that's been the one-way bet for more than 40 years. Suddenly, however, everything has been thrown into reverse. So, what does this have to do with you? You've got US bonds in your superannuation fund portfolio. In any balanced fund, about 10 per cent of your savings are in what's known as fixed-interest investments. Because they are — or at least were —considered to be relatively safe, there are fewer of them in higher-risk options such as growth funds. But, if you have opted for safer alternatives such as a stable or conservative option, around a quarter of your investment is sitting in bonds … which have been shaken and stirred. Ask five different economists and you'll get 10 different answers. On the one hand … However, it is difficult to see any quick market recovery any time soon. The surge in stock prices that rapidly followed the crash in February 2020 came about because central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, not only slashed interest rates to zero, they also printed money like there was no tomorrow. Global financial markets have taken a hit lately, and super has been caught up in the turmoil. Should you be worried? They'd been doing it for a decade — ever since the GFC wreaked havoc — and it hadn't even looked like firing-up inflation. So, during the pandemic, central banks — including our very own RBA — jumped in on the action. In the past few years, each time the Fed tried to withdraw some of that printed cash, stocks tanked and the Fed nervously retreated. Now, with inflation on the march, it has no option. It is going to start aggressively pulling that cash back out to take the heat out of the economy. And, since the pandemic pump, it now has an eye-watering $US9 trillion ($13 trillion) to retrieve. That, effectively, will amplify the impact of rate hikes. Instead of buying up US government bonds — as it was doing during the GFC and pandemic — it will be selling them, mopping up cash and pushing interest rates higher. Mounting deficits, a mountain of debt, an overstimulated economy and ill-disciplined spending all await incoming prime minister Anthony Albanese, writes Ian Verrender. That will also cause bond prices to continue tanking, which will continue to weigh on all asset markets and on your superannuation fund. Until last week — when the US Fed rammed through a triple rate hike in one go — it seemed as if the retreat on financial and property markets would be relatively orderly. However, with another triple hike expected next month — followed by doubles in September and November and singles in December, January and March — orderly isn't the adjective that readily springs to mind. The only thing that might cause the Fed to back off and chill out a little is the prospect of recession, which is not really a comforting scenario.

14,"analysis: The RBA boss has a message, but you might not like it if you have a job",politics,"  The RBA boss wants you to follow his path away from recession — even if that means more real wage cuts for workers ""We are not on a preset path,"" Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe observed on Tuesday, in the economic understatement of the week. Indeed, the path ahead looks no more predetermined than it has for the past two-and-a-half years. Since COVID came along, followed by the war in Ukraine, no official forecast has survived more than a few months. The outlook remains uncertain, but Lowe is trying his best to show the way — the path he would like everyone to stick to. The RBA Governor sees the inflation wave cresting at 7 per cent by year's end, before gently easing in the new year after a further series of interest rate rises. A recession will be avoided and employment will remain strong. That's the plan. It involves some pain for mortgage holders along the way, but no economic crisis. Don't panic. And definitely don't do anything unnecessary that could drive inflation even higher and send the economy onto an entirely different path. Lowe has publicly outlined this preferred path scenario twice in two weeks. He's keen to get the message out. Last week he appeared on the ABC's 7:30 program to talk about his chosen course. This week he delivered a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia. He wants everyone to know about the planned path. He is showing the way. And he's warning of the dangers involved if we veer off course and end up somewhere else entirely. To stay on the path, Lowe wants everyone to do their bit. This includes workers who might have hoped for some real wage growth after the election of a Labor government, which campaigned successfully with an argument about ""everything going up except your wages"". Minimum wage earners will see an increase of 5.2 per cent after a decision by the independent umpire last week, something the newly elected government was quick to welcome. This is what life looks like for people in some of the world's most expensive cities where inflation surges are taking hold. The RBA boss, however, doesn't want that repeated across the workforce. Inflation might be headed to 7 per cent, but Lowe is advocating a wage rise of half that amount. ""Three-and-a-half per cent is kind of the anchoring point that I want people to keep in mind,"" he says. In other words, it's a continued real wage cut for most workers in the short term — if we're to stay on Lowe's preferred path. Labor isn't exactly celebrating that suggestion of only modest wage growth, but nor is it disputing the logic of avoiding a wage-price spiral. That would be far worse economically and politically for the Albanese government. But wages aren't the only threat that could see us veer off the path. Government spending is the other risk. So far Treasurer Jim Chalmers appears to be heeding the warnings from the RBA. From July 1, more than $12 billion will be pumped into the economy in the form of turbo-charged Low and Middle Income Tax Offset payments, announced before the election by the Morrison government and promptly backed in by Labor. Beyond that, Chalmers has resisted calls for additional cost of living relief. In fact, he's begun laying the groundwork for cuts, telling the Australian Financial Review on the weekend there was ""a case for a more substantial look"" at spending in his October budget. State governments, however, appear to have missed the memo. On the very day Lowe delivered his speech about the path ahead and repeated his warnings about veering off course, two state Treasurers announced big spending budgets. In NSW, the Coalition government is boosting spending by more than $24 billion over the next four years. Almost half of that, or $10 billion, will flow in the coming 12 months, when the government just happens to be facing an election. The spending, to be clear, is not all bad or necessarily inflationary. New childcare centres, an extra year of pre-kindergarten education and tentative steps towards replacing an inefficient stamp duty with land tax, should all have a productive benefit. They're all aimed at growing the economic pie. Less productive is the $7.2 billion in ""cost-of-living"" measures announced by the NSW Treasurer to help with everything from road tolls, school costs, and energy bills. Similarly, the Queensland budget wasn't all bad. A big boost in health funding should ease pressures on the system. The multi-pronged cost of living crisis has spared few Australians from increased financial stress. In response, cash-strapped households have been forced to find new ways to cut back. But an extra $6.8 billion to help Queenslanders with ""cost of living pressures"" is again pumping more money and stimulus into the economy — just as inflation climbs higher. The temptation for politicians to pump cost of living relief into voters' pockets is understandable. Whether it wins votes is debatable, as the recent federal election showed. Whether it further fuels inflation and drives us off Lowe's path, we're about to see. ""It's a fairly narrow path,"" Lowe said in his speech on Tuesday. ""It's highly unlikely that we'll get it exactly right. We'll make mistakes. I hope the mistakes are not too large and we can self-correct."" Nothing is preset.

16,Fears grow that many Australians could default on their housing loans,politics,"  As fixed mortgages end and rates rise, many risk losing their homes Sarah Ibrahim is worried about what will happen when her fixed rate ends in January. Ms Ibrahim and her partner took on a home loan of more than $1.5 million in Sydney, with a deposit of 10 per cent. They are among almost 40 per cent of Australians with mortgages who have locked in ultra-low fixed rates and will roll off them as soon as next year, and potentially face a world of financial pain. ""We fixed the majority of our mortgage for two years, and we assumed that in the next few years, they wouldn't really go up much,"" Ms Ibrahim told ABC News. She and her husband had been saving for a deposit for years and finally broke into the Sydney property market at the end of 2019. ""It took us years of going to auctions, it took us years of going to inspections, and years of savings, and a lot of bulk shopping and buying second-hand clothes and not buying certain things. Sacrifices were made,"" she said. The couple initially had borrowed with a variable rate, but last year shifted to a part variable rate of 2.75 per cent and part fixed rate of 2.15 per cent to have certainty on ongoing repayments. Ms Ibrahim says she relied on repeated statements from the Reserve Bank that interest rates would not go up until 2024. But now the RBA has stated that the cash rate will lift to 2.5 per cent and possibly more, until it can get inflation down within its target band of 2 to 3 per cent. As interest rates rise, almost 300,000 people who took large and risky home loans during the pandemic could fall into severe financial hardship or even default. For Ms Ibrahim and her family that means a rise of almost $20,000 a year on their mortgage repayments. ""That has been really anxiety-inducing — to think that interest rates will go up by that much and that we would have to try to weather such a large increase at a time when there [are] obviously other upward pressures in relation to the cost of living,"" Ms Ibrahim said. ""It's been really stressful thinking about that and thinking about how we're going to manage such a loan."" For many Australians that stress has already started, with financial counsellors reporting an uptick in banks trying to repossess people's homes because they've been missing mortgage repayments. And economists fear that coupled with higher costs of living, and possible unemployment down the track, the financial system could be at risk. Since moratoriums on mortgage repayments – which were introduced during the pandemic to account for the fact that people had lost or been stood down from their jobs and were not generating enough income – have been lifted, more Australians have been falling behind on their repayments. Stephanie Tonkin, director of mortgage stress at Westjustice, says in the past two months alone the organisation has seen 60 clients and about half of them have been hit with eviction notices. She says they are now trying to negotiate with their lenders for those clients to not lose their homes. ""We're seeing clients coming up to us with a whole range of legal, emotional [and] financial issues, and we are calling on the banks to take a compassionate approach to this real tsunami of home owners who are finding themselves at real risk of homelessness,"" she said. ""We're already seeing banks ramping up their action to enforce mortgage debts and repossess homes already against the background of relatively low interest rates, but with rising cost of living, we're calling on the banks to take a more compassionate approach."" Ms Tonkin notes that many of her clients are still getting back on their feet post COVID. She wants banks to use evictions ""as a last resort"" and be understanding of ""some of the underlying emotional drivers of mortgage stress, be it family violence, gambling, mental ill health"". The desire to make housing more affordable also needs to address the worrying flip side: falling house prices for many Australians. The latest data from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), shows that of $2.2 trillion worth of loans held in March 2022, about $9 billion belonged to borrowers who are 30 to 89 days overdue on their repayments. This is slightly up over the quarter, from $8.4 billion in December 2021, but well down from the $14 billion in March 2019. APRA also provides data on non-performing loans — those that are more than 90 days overdue or where the bank thinks they'll take a loss on the loan. As of March, there was about $10.5 billion in non-performing loans held by owner occupiers, up from $9.6 billion in March 2019. And mortgagees in possession — people whose homes are repossessed by the bank because they have defaulted on their loan — were valued at around $308 million, down from $705 million in March 2019. ABC News also contacted all big four banks – Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac and National Australia Bank. CBA reported that current home loan arrears are at record low levels of less than 1 per cent and one in two borrowers were three months ahead of their repayments. Westpac said more than two thirds of customers were ahead their mortgage repayments and 90-day delinquencies were less than 1 per cent. NAB said that 70 per cent of its customers were ahead on their mortgage payments but did not indicate default rates. But financial counsellors are worried that with more people coming off fixed rates and variable rates heading above 5 per cent, more people will default on their home loans. Financial Counselling Australia chief executive Fiona Guthrie said ""a lot of people have borrowed to the hilt"" and she is shocked banks have been letting people borrow six or more times their incomes with very low deposits. The number of people who face mortgage stress is still high, but since the regulator introduced tighter lending standards late last year, people borrowing six or more times their income with low deposits is starting to fall. From being smart about shopping for everyday items to making lifestyle changes to save on power, our readers share ways you can cut costs. APRA March 2022 quarter data shows about 23.1 per cent of new mortgages ($32.7 billion worth) had a debt-to-income ratio of six times or more in dollars terms. This was down from the record high of 24.3 per cent (or $40.6 billion) in the previous quarter but still almost triple the rate from March 2019, when it was $11.4 billion. In terms of new home loans written, in March 2022 about $10.5 billion worth had loan-to-value ratio of 90 per cent or above (meaning a deposit of 10 per cent or less was put down). This is slightly down from $13.3 billion in December 2021. Ms Guthrie said they are already seeing signs of people in financial stress and that is set to worsen under higher interest rates. ""We've also got [the cost of] petrol going up, the cost of food going up, the cost of electricity [rising], so all of those factors are playing into what could be quite serious financial problems for a group of people in our community,"" she said. ""People are going to have to tighten their belts, and sometimes quite substantially. And we are particularly worried that for some people, it might be enough to tip them over the edge so that they can't pay their mortgage. While house prices are expected to fall nationally as interest rates continue to rise, that won't necessarily improve affordability. ""For every percentage point increase in interest rates, that will mean more and more people will experience financial stress. And the larger that group of people, the bigger that reverberates through the whole of the economy."" Some people will also be stretched because they already make interest-only repayments rather than any principal off their home loan. These interest-only loans are now a small portion of the $2.2 trillion home loan market — valued at $225 billion, which is down from $405 billion in March 2019 (as that was before APRA introduced tighter lending standards). The big positive for most borrowers is they saved money during pandemic lockdowns, with balances in offset accounts lifting from $162 billion in March 2019 to $228 billion in March this year. Rate City research director Sally Tindall said this total could drop in coming quarters as the RBA continues to hike official rates and people start to dip into their savings to keep up with their growing monthly repayments. But she said most Australian households were well placed to ""take these rate hikes on the chin"" and ""there will not be people just defaulting on their mortgages on mass"". ""However, there will be some people that cannot chart a path through the rising cost of living and the rising cost of mortgage repayments at the same time,"" she said. ""Losing a home … has an everlasting impact on that person's finances."" This week, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe noted that when the bank signalled interest rates would likely not rise until 2024, it did so under pandemic circumstances, imagining the worst-case scenario. But Mr Lowe said now, with the cost of living in Australia running towards 7 per cent, interest rates will keep rising until inflation falls back within the central bank's target band of 2 to 3 per cent. Ms Guthrie said the Reserve Bank had to take greater care in its messaging. ""There would certainly have been people who would have listened to those predictions [of no rate rises until 2024] and made decisions based on them, and there will be some degree of reckoning for the RBA,"" she said. ""I think it is fair to say that when the Reserve Bank makes quite definite statements about what interest rates are going to do, and when that doesn't happen, they've got a degree of responsibility for that. They need to learn from what looks like quite a serious mistake, that could have quite serious implications for a number of people."" Steven Hamilton, Assistant Professor of Economics at The George Washington University and visiting fellow at the Crawford School at the ANU, said now rates will rise far higher than anyone had anticipated and ""more and more people [will] get close to the edge and get pushed over"". ""The risks are that they go too hard, too fast. And that that leads to an increase in defaults and a really aggressive downturn in the housing market. And I think that does threaten the financial system to some degree,"" he said. Ms Ibrahim said both regulators like the RBA and APRA, as well as lenders, have an obligation to Australians to ensure they do not get false hopes that interest rates will stay low and get over-indebted. ""I definitely took the message [from the RBA] that you can start making plans, knowing that interest rates are going to remain stable and low. This is not just home-loan plans, I mean, business plans based on that. So, it's a really big deal,"" she said. ""And I also appreciate that there's a lot of different variables that the RBA has to consider. But I definitely feel that one of them needs to be highly geared mortgages and people in that situation."" Consumer groups fear that axing safe lending laws during a pandemic could prove risky, fuelling an overheating housing market and leading to a situation where borrowers are saddled with unaffordable mortgages. Ms Ibrahim said while they are middle-class working professionals – she is a lawyer and her husband works in consulting — the couple have two daughters Ameila, 5, and Sophia, 9, and have already had to cut back on essentials to account for the rising cost of living. ""We're [already] thinking about what we buy at the grocery shop … How long do you keep the heater on?"" she said. ""But now we're thinking, what other costs do we have? One of our children is in early childcare, and that's quite expensive. So now we're thinking, 'well, what does that mean for their future'? … This is going to be a lot more stressful. ""There's a lot of middle-class Australia that have really big mortgages. … If [rate hikes are] done really fast, that could see a lot of people … go through mortgage hardship."" Ms Ibrahim said they will do everything they can to hold onto their home, but with such a high loan-to-value ratio (given their low deposit of about 10 per cent), having to sell is a thought that ""crosses our minds"". ""It felt like a huge weight was lifted off our shoulders when we finally got into the Sydney property market. Now it's about how you stay in the market,"" she said.

17,Anthony Albanese has been invited to visit PNG – but which leader will be meeting him?,politics,"  Anthony Albanese is invited to visit PNG but its citizens must first elect a prime minister Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been invited to visit Papua New Guinea in September, but it is not clear who will welcome him. Papua New Guineans will head to the polls in less than a fortnight for a national election that is being closely watched, given the current geopolitical tension in the Pacific region. The most likely contenders for prime minister are the incumbent James Marape and the man he deposed, former prime minister Peter O'Neill. For years the two were close political allies, but now they are bitter rivals and the rivalry is being played out on the campaign trail. In the wake of the Solomon Islands security deal, Mr Marape has felt obliged to clarify that there are no plans for a military base as part of a development proposal in PNG that has garnered Chinese-government interest. The development idea for PNG's southern coast, north of Australia, was first proposed in 2018. It includes ambitious planning drawings that outline a possible ""military base"", ""naval base"" and port among the commercial and residential areas. ""It's just a concept — maybe military [sites] were thrown in to make the place look commercial,"" Mr Marape said. ""Certainly, you can take it from me, there's no military base to be set up."" Mr Marape said he had extended an invitation to Mr Albanese to visit Port Moresby in September. ""It doesn't matter whether I'm in power or not, that invitation has been placed to him,"" Mr Marape told the ABC. ""There's a letter going his way for him to come."" Mr Marape said he had proposed a PNG-Australia ministerial forum could be held after the leaders' meeting. It is expected Mr Albanese will be the first foreign leader to visit the new PNG government – whoever forms it. Mr Marape and Mr O'Neill have both been flying around the country, holding massive campaign rallies, and meeting with voters and candidates as the poll approaches. It is the latest chapter in the political tussle between the two that started more than three years ago. On an uneventful day in April 2019, PNG's then-finance minister Mr Marape called a press conference at his office in Port Moresby and made a shock announcement: He was resigning from his ministry. It set in train a protracted period of political uncertainty in PNG that finally ended more than a month later, with Mr O'Neill's almost eight-year tenure leading the country over and Mr Marape being sworn in as the new Prime Minister. After three years, Mr Marape is now on the campaign trail fighting to keep the title. On a charter plane flying from the capital, Port Moresby, to the Highlands city of Goroka for a series of campaign events, Mr Marape told the ABC he would resign as leader of his party if he lost, but he was hopeful of retaining the top job. ""I think our people will pass good judgement,"" he said. ""Based on past trends we may come back, but we're not taking it for granted. We are out there."" History shows incumbent governments are usually returned at election time, but Mr Marape is coming up against a well-funded and well-organised campaign from Mr O'Neill. During his campaign rallies, Mr Marape has not only been advocating for his candidates and his party's political record, but also urging people not to allow Mr O'Neill to return to power. ""I would never ever want to go back and work in a coalition that he is leading or a government that he is leading,"" Mr Marape said. ""He started off well, but when power got into his head he moved away from the goalpost of serving our country and we moved into the space of personal interest."" Mr Marape came to power with big promises to ""take back PNG"" and make the country the ""richest black Christian nation"". His government has introduced economic reforms and changes to the country's lucrative mining and resource industries, but some voters say they have not seen the changes and benefits they had hoped for. ""Richest black Christian nation has got nothing to do with really deep and big money in the pocket,"" Mr Marape said. ""It's about us, as a nation, having the ability to ensure we sustain life in all our service sectors, as well as getting the infrastructure worked on and getting people engaged properly in what could be a country that they're proud of. ""It's very much achievable."" Mr O'Neill said he was ""naturally disappointed"" to see people he had ""trusted and worked with for many, many years"" walk out on his government and leadership back in 2019. He said reflecting on it now, he blamed a ""lust for power"" among those who wanted to be prime minister. ""I think they found it's not that easy,"" he said. ""The job in a country that has got many, many challenges, like Papua New Guinea, it's not easy to satisfy every tribal group in every district. ""Every remote community around the country is very hard to satisfy with very limited resources."" Mr O'Neill's party is running more than 90 candidates in the election and it looks like he will go close to visiting every province in the country before the campaign is over ""We want to give a strong message about the party's commitment to the nation,"" he said as he drove to a rally in Port Moresby. ""And we'll look forward to coming back, if it's the wish of the people, to form government."" As he approached the venue, he wound down the window to greet and shake hands with his supporters. Despite his time on the opposition benches and the allegations of corruption that have dogged his time in power, he can still draw a crowd. ""Over the last three and a half years, as many Papua New Guineans know, I have been arrested, I've been charged, I've appeared before courts, and found not guilty on many of the allegations, which were virtually politically motivated,"" he said. He said the investigations had not proven any misuse or abuse of power and the issue had now been ""put to bed"". ""I'm not saying that there was no corruption or there were no issues of that within a bureaucracy and within the political structures, of course, but you can't be responsible for everything everybody else does,"" Mr O'Neill said. Corruption is a pervasive issue across PNG. Legislation to set up an independent commission against corruption passed in 2020 and it is being established. Both Mr Marape and Mr O'Neill told the ABC they were committed to it and to funding it properly. Papua New Guineans will head to the polls in July. Three weeks have been set aside for voting and one week for counting. After the counting, the newly elected MPs will go into camps to form coalitions before the make-up of the new government is revealed. Those coalitions could prove vital in deciding who has power. And while Mr Marape and Mr O'Neill are the frontrunners, there are others in the wings eying the top job. As the start of voting approaches, violence has been escalating in some areas. Already, 30 people have died — some in car accidents and others shot in clashes. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has visited PNG in the midst of the election campaign, and Australia's new government is keen to come as soon as it is over. A local PNG outlet has reported that, while he was in PNG, Mr Wang recommitted China to an ambitious development idea on the country's southern coast, known as the Ihu Special Economic Zone. ""The bilateral meeting held was a very important one for our project,"" project director Peter Kengemar told Loop PNG. The plan, which is in the electorate of PNG Foreign Minister Soroi Eoe, has been proposed since 2018. A drawing for the proposal includes a ""military base"", ""seaport"" and ""naval base"" among commercial, industrial, and residential zones. But Mr Marape said it was ""purely an economic investment zone."" ""There are boundaries for investments and boundaries for other sovereign matters,"" he said. ""So, I can give you my honest assessment, assurance rather, that it's not a military base to be set up."" The Chinese ambassador has visited the site, and some memorandums of understanding (MoU) have been signed between the proponent and Chinese state-owned companies, but the viability of the project remains unclear. The ABC put questions to the Chinese embassy about the report Mr Wang had committed funding to Ihu. ""As a principle, the Chinese side respects PNG's decision on where and how to use the assistance China has provided,"" it said in a statement. ""The two sides are keeping good communication on specific projects."" There is a long way from MoU to actual development in PNG, and the project is far from becoming a reality. ""I think some of these farfetched projects need to be realistically looked at again and negotiated properly,"" Mr O'Neill said. ""So, I shouldn't worry too much about what has been proposed Both Mr Marape and Mr O'Neill said they were committed to PNG's relationship with Australia. We asked Australia's Pacific Islander community how they feel about Canberra and Beijing's diplomatic tug-of-war in the region. ""We have no desire to change our position on security,"" Mr O'Neill said. ""We are aligned with the Australians and the United States and New Zealand on that aspect. ""I think as [the Australian government] have reset the relationship with New Zealand, I think there is some resetting to do in PNG as well, and I hope we can do that constructively."" Mr Marape said he wanted all international partners to focus on commercial partnerships and developing PNG's economy. ""We're very, very close — only five minutes by boat into the Australian side in the Torres Strait waters,"" he said.

18,Defence sent second jet into South China Sea hours after 'dangerous' interception by Chinese air force,politics,"  RAAF sent second jet into South China Sea hours after Chinese air force's 'dangerous' interception A second Australian military aircraft was dispatched over contested waters in the South China Sea last month, just hours after the Chinese air force conducted a ""dangerous interception"" of another RAAF plane. Defence is refusing to discuss the May 26 incident further, but flight data obtained by the ABC reveals new details of the dramatic flight as well as other recent Defence Force maritime surveillance missions being flown out of the Clark Air Base in the Philippines. Earlier this month, the Defence Department revealed an RAAF P-8 Poseidon was ""intercepted by a Chinese J-16 fighter aircraft"" during what it described as ""routine maritime surveillance activity"" in international airspace in the South China Sea region. Defence Minister Richard Marles later described how the J-16 flew close to the side of the P-8 Poseidon while releasing flares, then ""accelerated and cut across"" the front of the RAAF surveillance aircraft. ""At that moment, it then released a bundle of chaff which contained small pieces of aluminium, some of which were ingested into the engine of the P-8 aircraft,"" Mr Marles told reporters earlier this month. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data records the RAAF aircraft involved was P-8 Poseidon A47-008, which departed the Clark Air Base at about 11:23am Canberra time on May 26. The P-8 Poseidon, operating under the call sign ASY189, was initially tracked heading south-west from the Philippines towards the South China Sea before eventually flying out of detection range. Just over three hours later, the P-8 Poseidon came back within detection range as it returned to the Philippines following its ""dangerous"" encounter with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) fighter aircraft. ADS-B data compiled by Canadian researcher Steffan Watkins reveals the total length of the interrupted surveillance flight was roughly five hours, of which three hours were spent ""out of range"" in the South China Sea. ""They were not squawking 7700 [the emergency code] on their return, no emergency was declared,"" Mr Watkins notes in his analysis of the RAAF's recent movements from Clark Air Base. The ADS-B data does not precisely track where the P-8 flew in the South China Sea, but Beijing claims it ""endangered"" China's national security and sovereignty when it ""stepped up close-up reconnaissance into airspace of the Paracel Islands"", a disputed archipelago. P-8 Poseidon A47-008 did not conduct another surveillance mission until June 2, a week after its confrontation with the PLA jet but another P-8 Poseidon, A47-007, flew out the following day towards the South China Sea. After resuming surveillance duties on June 2, Poseidon A47-008 conducted another flight from Clark Air Base on June 3, before being deployed to India on June 8 for ""joint maritime surveillance activities"" with that country's navy. The RAAF has deployed two P-8A Poseidons to Clark Air Base to conduct intelligence collection activities over the South China Sea, and to help the Philippines government with the fight against Islamic State. The Defence Department has not responded to several specific questions from the ABC about the deployment to the Philippines.

19,New Defence Minister Marles calls on China to respect international law during India trip,politics,"  Defence Minister Richard Marles visits India to boost military ties, compares notes on approach to China The Defence Minister Richard Marles says Australia and India have been drawn together because both countries are wrestling with the ""difficult problem"" of how to reconcile strong economic ties with China and shared anxieties over Beijing's growing military might. Mr Marles has met his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh in New Delhi, with both ministers vowing to further expand military ties and intensify cooperation on defence technology. In an interview with the ABC, the Deputy Prime Minister gave a blunt assessment of the strategic circumstances facing both India and Australia. ""I don't think there's ever been a point in both of our country's histories where we've had such a strong strategic alignment,"" Mr Marles said. ""For [both] India and Australia, China is our largest trading partner. And for India and Australia, China is our biggest security anxiety. ""We are both trying to reconcile those things which is not an easy problem to solve. This is the time to be comparing notes with friends."" Australia has significantly ramped up defence cooperation and joint military exercises with India over the last decade. The two countries are holding increasingly sophisticated bilateral naval training exercises, while Australia has recently participated in Operation Malabar — a naval exercise drawing in India, Japan and the United States – despite initial hesitancy in New Delhi. Indian aircraft will also again participate in the Exercise Pitch Black multilateral air force exercises conducted in Australia this year. India deployed a P-8 maritime surveillance plane to Darwin in April, while Australia sent its own P-8 to India earlier this month. Mr Marles told the ABC that he also wanted Australia and India to deepen ties to allow for greater intelligence and information sharing, while looking for new opportunities to expand training. ""All of those are good signs, but we want to continue that trajectory, and see a greater operational engagement between our two nations' defence forces"" he said. ""Ultimately, it is trying to grow the interoperability and comfort of engagement between our two defence forces … we are looking at ways to give our defence forces more exposure to each other."" After their meeting, Mr Marles and Mr Singh issued a joint statement saying they welcomed the ""growing diversity and frequency of defence exercise and exchanges"" between India and Australia, and vowing to give a ""fillip"" to a working group designed to boost ties within the defence industries in both countries. Mr Marles also used a speech at the National Defence College in New Delhi to again urge China to be more transparent about its sweeping military expansion. ""China's military build-up is now the largest and most ambitious we have seen by any country since the end of the Second World War"" he said. ""It is critical that China's neighbours do not see this build-up as a risk for them. Because without that reassurance, it is inevitable that countries will seek to upgrade their own military capabilities in response."" Indian and Chinese troops fought a series of violent border skirmishes in 2020 and 2021, and the Defence Minister said Beijing's incursion into disputed territory in the high Himalayas highlighted the risk of China fuelling ""insecurity"" and a regional arms race. ""India's own experience illustrates this maxim more than most. The assault on Indian forces along the Line of Actual Control in 2020 was a warning we should all heed. Australia stood up for India's sovereignty then and continues to do so now,"" he said. ""It is vital that China commits to resolving this dispute through a process of dialogue consistent with international law. The global rules based order matters everywhere, including in the highest place on earth."" And Mr Marles briefly suggested that Australia and India should try to strike new agreements which would allow military planes and ships from both countries to regularly access and use each other's defence facilities. ""As we continue to lift our defence and security cooperation, exploring longer-term reciprocal access arrangements is the logical next step,"" he told the College. Dr Ian Hall from the Griffith Asia Institute said it made sense for India and Australia to test the idea. ""Reciprocal access is a logical next step, especially for working together with India on maritime surveillance in the Bay of Bengal and the access points into the Pacific,"" he told the ABC. ""We have a common problem, we have proved we can work together to address it, and we have interoperable systems in the P-8s. ""So there is no real reason not to find ways to work together as effectively as possible.""

20,"Public servant who rorted $27 million started scam two days into job, corruption probe told",politics,"  Paul Whyte corruption hearing told he started charging for fake services two days after being hired A senior public servant who perpetrated one of the biggest rorts of taxpayer funds in recent Australian history jacked up his corporate credit card limit and started charging for fake services within two days of being hired. Paul Ronald Whyte late last year pleaded guilty to stealing $27 million from the WA Department of Communities, in part by invoicing a company for work never provided on his corporate credit card. His old boss, former Department of Housing director general Graham Searle on Wednesday appeared at a rare public hearing by the Corruption and Crime Commission. The commission is examining how a person in such a senior position as Whyte was able to systematically defraud the state to such an extent and whether the governance of the department had contributed to or enabled it. Mr Whyte reported directly to Mr Searle. The day after Mr Whyte was hired as the general manager of commercial and business operations in October 2009, he applied for the limit on his corporate credit card to be increased from $20,000 to $50,000 per month, the commission heard. He also requested the individual transaction limit be jacked up from $5,000 to $20,000. Mr Searle told the commission he could not recall what had been used to justify that change. Whyte was granted the increase despite departmental policy at the time capping the cards to $20,000 per month. The day after that he made his first purchase, to a company called Boldline, totalling more than $19,000. Boldline was paid for ""project services"". No project was named, just a string of numbers. Whyte continued to pay Boldline for amounts totalling just under his $50,000 monthly limit for many months, adding up to $1.1 million over about two years. There is no suggestion Mr Searle was aware that Mr Whyte was perpetrating the fraud. Mr Searle said he had relied on his ""senior lieutenant"" to provide him with the right information but conceded he had taken those payments at face value. It was not departmental policy for the credit cards to be used for procurement, the commission heard; rather, they were to be used to pay for staff transport and accommodation. Mr Searle worked with Whyte at Landgate for a number of years before Mr Searle moved across to the Department of Housing,  where he became director general in early 2009. ""We were friendly, we were not personal friends,"" Mr Searle told the commission. ""I mean, we didn't socialise outside of work."" He said he knew Whyte owned racehorses as he spoke about them. Whyte owned multiple race horses and was an inveterate gambler. Over 2009 and 2010, the department was restructured, bringing the number of senior people reporting directly to Mr Searle from five to four. All but one of the senior executives were replaced in the space of about 12 months. Whyte and another woman who filled two of the four senior roles had worked with Mr Searle at Landgate. Counsel assisting the commissioner, Anthony Willinge, asked whether it was ""all a bit cosy"" that the senior executives and former Landgate employees sat on each other's job panels for the positions. Mr Searle said this was mitigated by other people also being part of the selection panels. Mr Searle was also asked about why the move combined two roles which saw financial approvals and commercial project applications handled under one position that was ultimately filled by Whyte in October 2009. Mr Searle said at the time, he was less concerned about the conflation of those roles, which allowed the person holding that position to procure contracts and then authorise their payment. He said he believed he had been brought into the Department of Communities to ""revitalise it and make it more responsive to government policy directions"" and agreed he had a mandate to reform it. ""Government sets a lot of targets for departments, housing wasn't renowned for meeting any of these targets or even aiming for them,"" Mr Searle said, adding it was clear the agency felt ""relatively defeated"". ""They were very reluctant to look at doing anything outside of a very narrow band,"" he said. He also described an uncomfortable reception when he started with the agency. ""I still have this vivid memory of sitting at my first corporate executive meeting and not one of them giving me eye contact, and I thought 'this is going to be fun'.""

21,Andrew Constance with no regrets after 'frustrating' federal election loss as he looks to life post-politics,politics,"  Andrew Constance reflects on his Gilmore federal election loss, looks to life after politics Defeated Liberal candidate for Gilmore Andrew Constance says he has no regrets after failing to win the marginal seat on New South Wales' south coast at the federal election. Labor MP Fiona Phillips retained the seat by 373 votes and was officially sworn in last week, after a request from Mr Constance for a recount was denied by the Australian Electoral Commission. The former NSW transport and infrastructure minister said he did not regret the decision to quit his state politics career for a tilt at federal parliament. ""That's life,"" Mr Constance said. ""I gave it a crack, pulled up just short, but I wish Fiona the best. ""I wish the community the best. It's been an amazing 20 years for me."" Gilmore experienced a 2.5 per cent swing to the Liberal Party and was the last seat to be called for Labor. Mr Constance, who was the state member for Bega for 19 years, said he was proud of a ""13 per cent swing on our primary"" even if he considered it ""a little bit frustrating"". ""You see members of parliament getting elected with 29 per cent primary,"" he said. ""I'm 16, 17 per cent higher than that, and I can't get in there."" Reflecting on the Coalition's election loss, Mr Constance felt that the party had lost its way, but said it had been a wake-up call for both major parties. ""Politics has got to change in Australia. That's why you're seeing the election of teal independents,"" he said. Mr Constance also said the changing nature of the media and the rise of social media had made being a politician a much tougher job. ""When I started out in politics, you didn't have Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. ""It's a very different environment from when I was first elected. ""There is this need for politicians to take the best of advice, but also to stop, pause, and not feel like they have to respond to the media every five minutes."" Mr Constance was blunt when it came to the impact of 20 years in state politics. ""My personal life has suffered very badly,"" he said. ""It's an unnatural profession, politics, because you're away a hell of a lot. ""It put a lot of pressure on the home environment, and I'm very sorry for that. ""I feel like I've lived 10 years in the last three, to be honest, since Black Summer."" Want more local news? Sign up for the weekly ABC South East NSW email newsletter Mr Constance fought to save his Malua Bay home during the Black Summer bushfires, and rose to national prominence for his regular public appearances during the crisis. He became a vocal supporter of more funding for mental health issues, and also criticised former prime minister Scott Morrison after his awkward visit to one of the bushfire-affected communities. With his election loss now official, Mr Constance said he was keen to continue playing a leadership role in the community, particularly in the wake of the bushfires. ""I never ever want to see the pain and suffering that we went through with Black Summer again, so if I can find an opportunity in that space, I'll snap it up,"" he said. But he said he would be taking a break before considering anything. ""The phone has gone really quiet, so that's a good thing,"" Mr Constance said. ""I'm just going to put my head down and take a little bit of time and go from there. ""In politics, people don't look backwards. ""They only look forwards, but I do feel like I've left the community in a better shape than when I found it.""

22,Nurses and midwives in NSW to strike next week after budget 'slap in the face',politics,"  NSW nurses and midwives to strike next Tuesday in response to budget Nurses and midwives across NSW will walk off the job next week in protest of the state government's recent budget announcements. Members of the NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association from 80 hospitals will stop work for between two and 24 hours next Tuesday. Striking workers at Liverpool and Bankstown Hospital will stop work for 24 hours, while staff at Westmead, Blacktown, Campbelltown, and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital will walk off the job for 12 hours. The industrial action comes after demands by the union were unmet in yesterday's budget, including pay rises in line with inflation and staff-to-patient ratio requirements. The Royal National Bank has said inflation was likely to reach 7 per cent this year, increasing from 5.1 per cent at present. Public sector workers will receive a 3 per cent pay rise this year, and depending on productivity, a further 0.5 per cent next year. And all healthcare staff will get a $3,000 ""thank you"" bonus for their work during the pandemic. As part of a $4.5 billion package funding the health sector, more than 10,000 extra staff, including 3,517 nurses and 200 midwives will be hired. But Michael Whaites, spokesman for the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association, said the government's offer was like a ""slap in the face"". ""We know that nurses and midwives can't stay if their workloads are not safe,"" Mr Whaites said. ""So, until this parliament enacts nurse-to-patient ratios on a shift-by-shift basis, we will not see the fundamental reform that is needed in our public hospital system."" It will be the third time nurses and midwives have voted to take industrial action this year, after striking for 24 hours in February and March. The industrial action will include a stop work meeting from 2pm at Sydney Town Hall, where members will determine a response to the budget. A union spokesperson has told the ABC that further industrial action was likely. A NSW Health spokesperson said they were ""committed to reaching a resolution"" with the union. ""NSW Health acknowledges and greatly appreciates the nurses and midwives in our public health system for the critical work they do and the difference they make every day,"" the spokesman said. ""The NSW government and NSW Health continue to engage in talks with the union and remain committed to reaching a resolution in the best interests of our patients and our healthcare workers."" The spokesman said all health districts would have plans in place during the strikes to minimise disruption and ensure people in need of emergency care were looked after. Teachers from NSW's public and Catholic schools will go on strike on Thursday, June 30, over a dispute about pay and staff shortages.

23,'It's a joke': Indigenous leaders lament debate over $25m Harbour Bridge flag plan,politics,"  Indigenous leaders lament debate over $25m Harbour Bridge flag plan Indigenous leaders have labelled a debate about the $25 million price tag to install a third pole that would fly the Aboriginal flag on top of Sydney's Harbour Bridge ""a joke"". The government revealed its plan to install a third flagpole on the bridge, as part of its latest budget. Premier Dominic Perrottet on Sunday said the quote to permanently install the flag was a ""small price to pay"" for unity, and that he wasn't sure what the cost breakdown was. And, while the project will go ahead, treasury has since confirmed it will get a second opinion on the price. The $25 million price tag includes the installation of a new pole, from which the Aboriginal flag will fly, and the refurbishment of the two existing poles. Tribal Warrior Aboriginal Corporation chief executive Shane Phillips said criticism of only one portion of the project was being used to divide people. ""It's a smokescreen. Only last week they were talking about shortages of power and money, then all of a sudden they throw this into the equation — it's a joke,"" he said. Usually, the Australian flag and the NSW flag are flown on the bridge, while the Aboriginal flag is flown on select occasions. Mr Phillips, who runs mentoring and exercise programs in Redfern, said the government needed to be ""called out"" for mishandling the important task. ""If this is not motivated to divide people — black and white — I don't know what it is,"" he said. The new pole will be installed 97.4 metres above the road, and will match the two other 20m poles already in place. The project will be paid for by using money from a $91.1 million fund for First Nations culture included in Wednesday's budget. A spokesperson for Transport for NSW said the $25 million figure would be used to remedy a larger issue. ""The project is complex and requires sophisticated engineering work on a heritage asset,"" a spokesperson said. ""The scope of this project is broader than installing a third flagpole on the Harbour Bridge. ""These works must be done in a way that ensures that the structure and heritage fabric are maintained. Importantly, the scope also involves relocation of the aircraft beacon to provide space for the third flagpole."" Kamilaroi woman Cheree Toka, who launched the campaign to include the Aboriginal flag on the Harbour Bridge five years ago, said while the cost was ""a little rich"", the project would be invaluable. ""It will hopefully symbolise and set an example of how Australia needs to unite as an equal nation,"" she said. ""I hope other First Nations people are proud to see their flag fly every single day and hopefully it diminishes the racism that happens."" Options floated as a replacement to reduce costs included replacing the NSW flag with the Aboriginal one. But Ms Toka said that wouldn't work. ""They can easily replace it [the Aboriginal flag] with the NSW flag again and we'll be back at square one,"" she said. There's plenty of health spending and some big reforms for first home buyers — this is how NSW Treasurer Matt Kean's first budget will affect you. Wiradjuri and Badu Island woman Lynda-June Coe said the issue was ""bittersweet"". ""I do understand the many voices from our community stating that $25 million could easily be injected into other areas that our mob have been crying out for for a long time,"" she said. ""I can't help but feel proud but also at the same time I feel a little bit robbed to be honest."" Nadeena Dixon, a Gadigal, Bidjigal and Dharawal woman, said: ""We have to make it normalised to see Aboriginal flags everywhere."" ""Years ago even when you wore a T-shirt with the Koori flag … it was an act of resistance and defiance to wear the colours."" Ms Dixon, the granddaughter of Dr Charles ""Chika"" Dixon — an instrumental figure in the recognition of Aboriginal people in the 1967 referendum — said the prominent position atop the bridge would be powerful. ""It's a miracle that we even survived,"" she said. ""[Now] we're holding space for the fact that we are still here … and that mob are standing strong together, this is about acknowledging our people were here."" Mr Phillips said questions about the price tag detracted from the benefits of flying the Aboriginal flag on the bridge. ""It would change the whole relationship; it would actually show that we have value and that we matter,"" she said.

24,Mother of murdered baby pardoned over conviction for police assault on night son abducted,politics,"  Tamica Mullaley pardoned over conviction for police assault on night baby Charlie abducted A woman whose baby was abducted and brutally murdered by her ex-partner after he bashed her and left her naked and bleeding in a Broome street has received an apology and pardon from the WA government. Warning: This story contains images and names of Indigenous people who have died. In making the apology, Attorney-General John Quigley recounted how in March 2013, Tamica Mullaley endured the ""unthinkable"". Ms Mullaley endured a ""sustained and vicious attack"" at the hands of her partner Mervyn Bell and was left bleeding from her injuries and naked on the streets of Broome in Western Australia's Kimberley. Police were called, but in the chaotic scenes that followed, a ""confused"" Ms Mullaley was arrested for assaulting a police officer, and later handed a 12-month suspended prison sentence. Her child's grandfather, Ted Mullaley, had asked officers to take baby Charlie, but he was instead passed to friends before Bell took him from their house while Ms Mullaley was receiving treatment for her injuries in hospital. In the 15 hours that followed Bell tortured the child, before rushing his lifeless body to a roadhouse near Karratha, almost 1,000 kilometres away. Charlie's injuries included burns, broken bones, internal bleeding and severe abrasions. At the time, Mr Mullaley was also charged with obstructing police. Wearing a tie with Aboriginal designs and speaking from isolation after testing positive to COVID, Mr Quigley announced both had been pardoned by the Governor under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy. ""Ted and Tamica deserved compassion,"" he said. ""Instead, the system we thought we could rely on to support victims of crime failed Tamica and Ted, and they were dragged through the courts themselves,"" he said. ""These pardons are a show of mercy, for Tamica and Ted, it has been a long time coming."" With both Ms Mullaley and her father in Parliament, Mr Quigley also apologised for a ""clearly deficient"" police response. ""Tamica was not treated by police at the scene as a victim of domestic violence,"" he said. ""On behalf of the government of Western Australia, Tamica and Ted, I am sorry for the way you were treated by the government and the WA Police, both before and after losing baby Charlie. ""Tamica and Ted, for that, I am truly sorry. You deserve much better from the police and from the government. We are sorry."" Speaking outside state parliament following Mr Quigley's apology, an emotional Ms Mullaley said the apology and pardon meant her son was now being remembered properly. ""You can tell in someone's voice if they mean something, and I think now that they've heard actually the real truth of what happened nine years ago ... it's touched them,"" she said. ""Sorry means a lot."" Ms Mullaley said the police force seemed to be moving in the right direction when it came to dealing with Aboriginal people. She continued to cite racism as a key reason for what happened on the night she was assaulted. It is understood the police officers involved on the night Ms Mullaley was arrested are still in the force and have not been reprimanded. Mr Mullaley said they needed to be reprimanded for what they had done, and particularly their treatment of him and his daughter. ""There are going to be ongoing actions about holding the police accountable for what happened,"" the family's lawyer and principal solicitor of the National Justice Project, George Newhouse, said. ""The family are still seeking accountability and justice, so that other families and children are not put at risk again in the future."" He said that would also include continuing their push for a coronial inquest. Wednesday's apology and pardon followed a meeting between the family, Mr Quigley, Police Minister Paul Papalia, Minister for the Prevention of Family and Domestic Violence Simone McGurk and incoming police commissioner Col Blanch. ""While there is always more work to be done, there has been significant progress in how the Western Australian police force respond to family violence, and how officers work with Aboriginal people, since 2013,"" Mr Papalia told Parliament. ""Baby Charlie's legacy will be a commitment from this government to do everything in its power to prevent another senseless, tragic death in our community."" Ms McGurk said the tragedy ""reminds us to do better"". ""The events that unfolded over the course of the evening, and the following day, demonstrate how an inadequate understanding of family and domestic violence can have utterly devastating consequences,"" she said. Greater involvement of Department of Justice staff in family and domestic violence incidents, particularly to help understand the risks around perpetrators, was a specific area of progress Ms McGurk pointed to. ""While we cannot change the past, I sincerely hope that today's events can support you and your family's healing journey,"" Ms McGurk said. Police commissioner Chris Dawson said discussions were taking place with the family. ""We're working very, very closely with the family to ensure that we can do as much as we can to ensure that such an event never occurs again,"" he said. In 2014, Bell was sentenced to at least 27 years in prison for murder, in a crime that was described as ""evil"" and one which ""shocks the public conscience"" by then-Justice John McKechnie. The next year, Bell took his own life in the special handling unit of Casuarina Prison. A report by the Corruption and Crime Commission in 2016 found there had been a ""delayed and ineffective response"" by individual officers on the night Ms Mullaley was arrested, but concluded it was ""impossible to know"" whether a more rapid response could have changed the outcome. Ms Mullaley and her family had been campaigning for a coronial inquest into baby Charlie's death, but that was rejected by Supreme Court judge Rene Le Miere in 2020. An inquest, from a legal perspective, is held to produce new evidence or clarify the facts around a death, with any recommendations about police policy or procedures ancillary to that function. At the time, Ms Mullaley had been hoping to appeal directly to Attorney-General John Quigley to order an inquest.

25,'I can get my life back': Kerryn is looking forward to the end of the cashless debit card,politics,"  Mixed views over federal government's promise to scrap Cashless Debit Card While the new Labor government has promised to scrap the Coalition's controversial Cashless Debit Card, questions remain about what comes next. For Bundaberg single mother Kerryn Griffis, who has been on the card for more than three years, the changes can't come soon enough. ""I'm not anticipating I'll be off it tomorrow or anything like that,"" she told 7.30. ""But the point is I will be getting off it eventually, there is hope for the future and soon I can get my life back."" However, her local federal MP and long-time champion of the card, the Nationals' Keith Pitt, wants the new government to tread carefully. ""They need to talk to the community. You can't make these decisions without consultation,"" he said. ""The feedback that we've been given that's across the community is that it's had a positive impact."" The card was first introduced in South Australia's Ceduna region and Western Australia's East Kimberley in 2016. The trial was later extended to WA's Goldfields, the Northern Territory, and Queensland's Bundaberg/Hervey Bay and Cape York regions. More than 16,000 welfare recipients in these areas have been forced to use a card — operated by the private company Indue — which limited how much cash they could access and prevented the remainder of the benefit from being spent on alcohol and gambling. Labor promised to abolish the card and, after the election, the auditor-general found the program's monitoring and evaluation were ""inadequate"". ""DSS (Department of Social Security) has not demonstrated that the CDC (Cashless Debit Card) program is meeting its intended objectives,"" the auditor-general's report said. The Mayor of Fraser Coast Regional Council, George Seymour, said the findings were upsetting. ""It's almost like they're guinea pigs in this experiment that no-one was actually analysing,"" he said. But East Kimberley Indigenous leader Ian Trust said the feedback he had received over the past few years was mostly positive. ""For a certain target group, such as old people, women and so on, they would be protected from harassment, or they call it 'humbugging' up here, for their money,"" he said. ""I think it had a big impact on gambling."" Mr Trust fears making the card voluntary could make things worse. ""The people who the card should be targeted at are going to be the first ones who are going to put their hand up and say, 'We're wanting to come off,' and they're the ones who probably need more help."" Shelley Bielefeld from Griffith Law School surveyed community leaders and card users in all trial sites and found the Department of Social Services tended to rely on people who supported the card when seeking feedback on its effectiveness. ""Some voices of power holders in communities were given the equivalent of a microphone or megaphone in front of them and some voices were dialled right down in volume,"" she said. Ms Griffis said she found her three years on the card to be a humiliating experience, as she struggled to find enough cash to buy second-hand goods and pay for school activities. ""To tackle the social issues in this town – it's not like a blanket approach, we're going to have this, we're going to control you — people need to be supported,"" the mother of five said. ""All this card did was to push people down when they were already down."" Watch this story on 7.30 tonight on ABC TV and ABC iview.

26,Adelaide City Council votes no to using facial recognition in CCTV,politics,"  Adelaide City Council votes against purchasing facial recognition software for city security cameras Police have refused to speculate on whether they would invest in facial recognition software after Adelaide City Council voted unanimously not to include the technology in new security cameras being installed across the CBD. Councillor Alex Hyde and two other councillors requested an urgent council meeting to discuss the upgrade of city CCTV cameras following publicity about the surveillance capability of facial recognition technology. The council had written to SA Police asking if they could delay using facial recognition technology if it was installed in city cameras until safeguards measures were in place. But police indicated they would likely still use the technology. The motion, which passed unanimously, reiterates the council's commitment to not use camera facial recognition technology until the South Australian parliament draws up rules around biometric surveillance and privacy. ""In actual fact we were never going to procure the necessary hardware or technology in order to activate that facial recognition software,"" Mr Hyde told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""It somewhat is a cost-prohibitive exercise anyway because the software is very expensive as well. ""From our perspective, [SA Police] won't be receiving the necessary hardware or software support from the feed that we have throughout the city in order to use the [facial recognition technology]."" Mr Hyde clarified that camera feeds from the council's security network would not be high enough quality even if SA Police were to buy and use facial recognition software to analyse footage captured. He said the council has no say in what technology SA Police would use. ""I supposed the silver lining is that this has elevated in the public consciousness about what this technology could do, the fact that it is going to be introduced by other government agencies and they should be aware of it going forward,"" he said. Police Commissioner Grant Stevens could not say whether police would purchase facial recognition technology. ""This type of infrastructure is not cheap. I won't speculate in terms of how we might implement something like that beyond the existing network,"" he said. Mr Stevens said police are using facial recognition technology as set out in the current laws. ""Whether there was a need for further legislation or a consideration of measures to manage the control of this technology, that's a matter for the parliament,"" he said. ""I'm certainly keen to take advantage of advances in technology that make it easier for police officers to respond to and detect crime, [and hold] people accountable for the crimes they commit."" At the meeting on Tuesday night, Councillor Anne Moran said to include facial recognition technology in the city's security camera network was unnecessary and scary. ""It's not just a little crime-fighting thing, it's a big, big step [for the council],"" she said.

27,Emails show there were two strong candidates for US trade job before John Barilaro landed role,politics,"  Dominic Perrottet says there were no suitable candidates for trade job before John Barilaro was appointed The NSW Premier says no suitable candidates were found in an initial recruitment push for John Barilaro's new US trade job. However, documents obtained by Labor show two candidates were ranked very highly on three out of four criteria. The former deputy premier has been named the state's trade commissioner to the Americas, to be based in New York, with a salary package expected to top $500,000. Documents obtained by Labor through the parliament show there had been a previous round of recruitment with a shortlist and interviews conducted in mid-2021. A spreadsheet shows four people were interviewed, and two — Jenny West and Rob Fitzpatrick — exceeded in three criteria, and met the fourth. But the job was readvertised in December, and Mr Barilaro was announced as the successful candidate last week. ""The advice I received is there was an initial process and the secretary of the department formed the view the process had not found an appropriate candidate for that appointment, and a second process was commenced,"" Premier Dominic Perrottet said. ""The advice I've received is (Jenny West) was not offered the job … but I'll get further advice in relation to that."" Labor's Penny Sharpe said that was not believable. ""The idea that a suitably qualified woman, with this level of skills on paper could just be cast aside so that we can get John Barilaro just tells you really where the commitment is,"" Ms Sharpe said. Mr Perrottet said recruitment was conducted independently by the public service and did not need to be approved by cabinet. But another email obtained by Labor states that the appointments were supposed to be put to cabinet. ""I've spoken to the Minister for Investment in relation to getting some information in respect to the process and details in relation to that, and once I've received those details I'm more than happy to make them public,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""I'm not across the exact details as to how that process was finalised but I'll make sure everything was in place. ""As long as the process was followed and there were good reasons behind the decisions I'll be satisfied. If they were not then I'll take action."" Labor is calling for Mr Barilaro's appointment to be delayed until a parliamentary inquiry looking into the decision reports back. A motion supporting that call was passed in the upper house earlier today, with the support of the crossbench — except for One Nation. The motion isn't binding, but has ratcheted up pressure on the government to delay Mr Barilaro's start in this new job. During Question Time, the Premier said Mr Barilaro's employment had already been formalised. ""It would not be lawful for me as Premier to intervene in any step of the process,"" he said. Mr Barilaro himself announced the creation of five NSW senior trade and investment commissioners (STIC) and an agent general in November 2020, when he was the deputy premier and trade minister.

28,Crown granted approval to operate Sydney casino,politics,"  Crown Resorts granted approval to operate Sydney casino Crown Resorts has been given conditional approval to open its Sydney casino, 16 months after being deemed unfit to hold a gaming licence. The NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) has given Crown the green light but says it will closely monitor the casino's initial operations. Last year, ILGA found the gambling giant unfit to hold a gaming licence for the casino at Barangaroo after a months-long public inquiry, which exposed allegations of money laundering. ILGA chair Philip Crawford said Crown had rebuilt its gaming model from the ground up, which has meant deep structural change around governance, anti-money laundering measures and corporate culture. ""After more than one year's work with Crown, the Authority is pleased to have reached a stage where Crown can open its casino operations on a conditional basis,"" Mr Crawford said. He said there had been a ""ground up rebuild"" of Crown, but added the ILGA only granted a conditional license because it had still not found the company ""suitable"". ""The company that went into the Bergin inquiry as Crown has emerged from our discussions over the last 12, 14 months as quite a different company with a lot of different personnel,"" Mr Crawford said. ""In particular their operational procedures and the work we've done on their culture."" However, Mr Crawford says granting a conditional license would allow the ILGA to ""keep a very close eye"" on Crown. ""We want to see them operate,"" he said. ""We want to see that happening so we've retained that independent monitor role. ""At the moment they can't have a complete, unfettered license until we find them suitable."" Mr Crawford said Crown needed to ""blow themselves up to save themselves, and that's pretty much what's happened"". Crown's chief executive officer and managing director, Steve McCann, said it could now finalise opening plans and details would be ""announced shortly"". He said Crown had spent the past 15 months showing the ILGA it had ""the right measures in place"" to open its gaming facilities in Sydney. ""Today is an important day for Crown, our customers and our people, who have been eagerly awaiting this announcement for some time and cannot wait to share the full Crown Sydney experience with the world,"" Mr McCann said. ILGA's initial decision meant the casino section of Crown's skyscraper on Sydney Harbour was blocked from opening, however, the hotel and restaurants within the building have been free to operate. ILGA has also given operating approval to Blackstone, the US private equity group set to take over Crown from June 24. Earlier this month, the Federal Court approved Blackstone's $8.9 billion takeover  bid. Crown's sale means its founder, James Packer, will receive a $3.3 billion payday for his 37 per cent stake. Last year, Crown Resorts made new commitments with the ILGA in a bid to open the casino. It committed to paying a portion of the costs of last year's inquiry, paying a casino supervision levy, ceasing all international junket partnerships, adopting a cashless gaming model and phasing out indoor smoking. Crown is tyring to clean up its image after being fined for illegally promoting gambling in China where 14 staff were jailed, and several damaging inquiries which found the casino operator enabled money laundering and had links to criminal gangs. This month, the Western Australian government found Blackstone suitable to hold a licence for Crown's Perth-based complex. The private equity giant has also passed that hurdle in Victoria, home to Crown's flagship Melbourne casino. Inquiries held in both states delivered scathing findings which had left Crown's future in limbo until the prospective Blackstone sale. In Sydney, Crown's $2.2 billion development at Barangaroo has been mired in controversy. Its ""high-roller"" gaming facility remained closed when despite its restaurants and serviced apartments opening in late 2020. The skyscraper itself, first proposed unsolicited by Mr Packer in 2012, was built on land originally slated as public space. In 2016, the Department of Planning recommended Crown's hotel, casino and apartment complex should go ahead despite some community backlash.

29,New offensive conduct laws introduced in Victoria after Eastern Freeway tragedy,politics,"  New offensive conduct laws introduced in Victoria after Eastern Freeway tragedy New laws criminalising grossly offensive conduct have been introduced into Victoria's parliament today in direct response to the 2020 Eastern Freeway tragedy. Four police officers died after a truck ploughed into them while they were detaining driver Richard Pusey for speeding offences. After the crash, Pusey filmed the dying officers while making vulgar commentary and later posted the video on Facebook. He was ultimately sentenced to 10 months' jail after pleading guilty to outraging public decency, drug possession, reckless conduct endangering serious injury and speeding. Only three months of his sentence was related to his actions in filming the dying officers. Constables Glen Humphris and Joshua Prestney, Senior Constable Kevin King and Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor are remembered at a memorial service. Victoria's Attorney General Jaclyn Symes said the new laws target grossly offensive behaviour with jail time of up to five years. ""What we had in the Eastern Freeway tragedy was conduct that Victorians we're appalled by, and what we found was there wasn't really an offence that fit that behaviour,"" she said. ""What it exposed, that behaviour, was that there was a gap in statute laws and I want to fix it. ""It's not designed to target low-level offensive behaviour. In Victoria we have very high thresholds for offensive language, offensive behaviour."" The new laws were prompted by calls from Stuart Schulze, whose wife, Senior Constable Lynette Taylor, was one of the four officers who died in the crash. ""It allows the courts to make the decision what they find to be the most offending, which is the correct thing to do because as society changes and society changes, what's offensive today is not offensive tomorrow,"" Mr Schulze said. The new laws look set to pass with the support of the Victorian opposition. ""I think it's a very good proposal, it's obviously come out of a tragic circumstance, but I can't imagine a circumstance in which the opposition wouldn't support that,"" Opposition Leader Matthew Guy said. Meanwhile, Liberty Victoria president Michael Stanton said he was concerned about how the new laws could be applied in the future. ""We're always cautious when it comes to expanding the criminal law because there can be unintended consequences and eventually mission creep and an expansion of new offences over time — we've seen that time and time again,"" he said.

30,AEMO to end its intervention in east coast market,politics,"  Australian Energy Market Operator to end its intervention in east coast market An unprecedented intervention in Australia's east coast energy market will be gradually removed over the next day, with authorities increasingly confident in the supply of wholesale electricity. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) last week seized control of the east coast energy market for the first time in its history after days of volatility put several states at risk of blackouts. The federal government backed the intervention, acknowledging the energy market had effectively failed, and credited the AEMO with successfully managing to avoid both blackouts and load shedding as temperatures on the east coast plummeted. AEMO on Tuesday signalled there was sufficient supply to get through Wednesday but confirmed it was still directing generators to pump power into the network. AEMO chief executive Daniel Westerman said the market would begin to set the price from 4am on Thursday, with the market fully reinstated 24 hours later, provided supply was guaranteed. ""We are taking a number of steps operationally and working very closely with generators to make sure that the dysfunctional behaviour doesn't re-occur"" he said. With the electricity sector last week dealing with soaring costs, AEMO initially imposed a price cap and compelled generators to offer their services. But AEMO then suspended the spot market entirely across the national electricity market — which includes Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, NSW and the ACT — saying it was impossible to ensure reliable electricity supply under the current circumstances. ""We put the security of the grid and keeping the lights on above everything else,"" Mr Waterman said. The crisis has been caused, in part, by soaring global coal and gas prices and an ageing fleet of coal-fired power stations in Australia operating below capacity. Even after AEMO has left the market, it has warned the east coast could face challenges maintaining supply and demand. Energy Minister Chris Bowen dubbed AEMO's action's ""prudent"" and endorsed the staged approach to reimposing normal market conditions. ""Risks remain in the system and I know that AEMO remains vigilant about what needs to be cared for in the coming days,"" he said.

31,An elective surgery 'blitz' may be needed to clear a backlog that has left people like Karen suffering every day,politics,"  WA health authorities are considering elective surgery ""blitzes"" to deal with a waitlist that has grown by 10 per cent over the last year and is keeping more patients waiting longer. Karen Boyd is among more than 33,000 West Australians stuck on the growing public elective surgery waitlist. She had been preparing for surgery on her spine late last year, but when her specialist decided to stop operating on public patients, Ms Boyd was sent to the back of the public queue. Now she has been told that an appointment with another surgeon is not likely to happen until December, with surgery to take place sometime after that. Yet Health Department guidelines recommend Ms Boyd be left waiting no more than a year. ""I do suffer most days with it, in one way or another,"" she said. ""Within the last 12 months it has deteriorated, so I would only imagine that it will deteriorate a lot more over time."" In the last year, the waitlist has grown from 29,980 cases to 33,206 – a jump of 10 per cent. That is due in part to elective surgeries being paused at various stages to help hospitals manage pressure, and more recently because of staff furloughed by COVID. But worryingly, the number of patients waiting more than the recommended time for their surgery has also increased, from 8 per cent to 20 per cent. ""That means diseases progress,"" Australian Medical Association WA president Mark Duncan-Smith said. ""There's also the psychological consequences on patients, who know they need the surgery but they can't get it."" In the most serious cases, classed as category one, 26 per cent of cases had not been seen within the recommended time of 30 days, compared to 9 per cent a year ago. ""There has been a slight increase because we are in the middle of a COVID surge,"" was Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson's response when asked in state parliament about the increase last week. ""Over the month of May we had 3,300 staff furloughed. That is why. We had a short, sharp, planned six-week scale-down of elective surgery."" Confirmed cases so far: 871,777 Active cases: 28,603 Cases in hospital: 260 Deaths: 370 WA population aged 16+ triple-dosed: 82.5 per cent Latest information from the WA Health Department That is despite Health Department figures showing the number of ""over boundary"" cases steadily growing over the last year. This week New South Wales, which is also juggling a budget $11.3 billion in the red, announced it would put $400 million towards clearing the state's elective surgery backlog. That would be done by increasing staff and making operating theatres available on evenings and weekends. The head of WA's health system, David Russell-Weisz, revealed in budget estimates yesterday that WA was thinking about doing the same. ""We are considering — as staff furlough gets better — short, sharp, what I would call blitzes,"" he said. ""We are considering having theatre times at weekends, or extended hours, all of that is considered by the health service providers. ""But they obviously are working with a system that has significant emergency demand and still significant staff furlough."" Dr Russell-Weisz said ensuring elective surgery waitlists did not get worse would be ""a constant theme"" for WA Health in the years to come. Opposition health spokeswoman Libby Mettam said the government was not moving fast enough to tackle the growing issue. ""If New South Wales can provide some urgency to addressing their elective surgery backlog, then surely the McGowan government, who are sitting on a $5.7 billion surplus, can do the same,"" she said. She pointed to a growth in elective surgery waitlists, from around 15,000 when Mr McGowan took office to the more than 30,000 case backlog now. ""Unfortunately, it's WA patients who will ultimately pay the price of a government who continues to ignore the elective surgery backlog, which has continued to grow since 2017,"" she said. ""The real concern here is that there will be other impacts on acuity levels and it will see other issues come up, because patients aren't being treated within an acceptable time frame."" In a statement, a spokesperson for the Health Minister said WA was in a different position from other states, because its Omicron wave came later. ""We continue to experience staff furlough and hospitalisations due to COVID-19,"" she said. ""However, each of the health service providers is looking at ways they can safely reduce elective surgery waitlists."" Dr Duncan-Smith said regardless of the government's plans, more staff would be needed. And with both New South Wales and Victoria offering health workers $3,000 bonuses, he expected attracting people to WA would be difficult. ""If [WA Health] don’t keep up with the other states, there's a good chance that we won't get that recruitment, and in fact we may even lose doctors and nurses from Western Australia,"" he said. The government appears to be standing firm on its wages policy, which caps increases at 2.5 per cent a year, plus either a $1,000 sign-on bonus or an extra 0.25 per cent per year, as agreed to by unions. A major headache is brewing for the West Australian Labor government as unions prepare to ramp up their battle for public sector wage rises. ""The state government's wages policy is set,"" Ms Sanderson's spokesperson said. ""We continue to look at ways to better support our staff, and recruiting additional staff is a significant focus for us."" On Monday, the state's public school teachers agreed to a 2.75 per cent increase under the policy, despite having earlier asked for a larger rise. Ms Sanderson yesterday told parliament there had been a net increase in the health nursing workforce between June 2020 and May 2022 of 12.8 per cent, with the medical workforce increasing by 13.5 per cent. For those on the waitlist, the head of WA's Health Consumers' Council Suzanna Robertson said it was important to ask questions. ""Keep contacting [your doctor] and saying 'where am I on the list now, what’s the criteria, who do I need to talk to, do you need a new referral?'"" she said. ""Keep people appraised if your situation is deteriorating [and] make sure that you are accessing services and supports in the meantime."" Ms Robertson also said it was important to remember that elective surgery did not mean patients were waiting without consequences. ""It's impacting potentially their mental health, their ability to care for themselves, their ability to care for others, their ability to work to their usual capacity or at all,"" she said. ""So it's really important if we can, to link them up to other services while they're waiting to make sure they have the best quality of life possible."" That is little comfort for Ms Boyd though, who still faces a six-month wait to first meet with her new surgeon. ""I don't work, I can't work at the moment,"" she said. ""I'm on medication, that medication is taking away some of the pain, but I only have to bend down [and] it's an issue getting back up again.""

32,Anyone who displays a Nazi symbol in Victoria now faces up to a year in jail,politics,"  Victoria parliament passes bill banning Nazi symbol, with offenders facing up to a year in jail Victoria has become the first Australian jurisdiction to ban the Nazi swastika, with those who defy the ban to face jail terms and hefty fines. Legislation passed both houses of parliament on Tuesday making it a crime to publicly and intentionally display the Nazi symbol — known as the Hakenkreuz. Those who do so could face up to 12 months in jail and a $22,000 fine. The symbol will still be able to be used in appropriate contexts, given its cultural and historical relevance. The swastika, an equilateral cross with the arms bent at 90 degrees to the right, is an ancient symbol that is 15,000 years old and used in a number of religions as a symbol of divinity. The state government said it consulted ""religious, legal and community groups … to understand the religious use of the swastika and ensure exceptions are in place for appropriate displays of the Nazi symbol, such as for educational or artistic purposes"". The government will fund a campaign to educate the public on the importance of the symbol to these communities, and how it is different from the Nazi symbol. Attorney-General Jaclyn Symes said in a statement that the symbol ""does nothing but cause further pain and division"". ""It's a proud moment to see these important laws pass with bipartisan support – I'm glad to see that no matter what side of politics, we can agree that this vile behaviour will not be tolerated in Victoria,"" she said. Dvir Abramovich, chairman of the Anti-Defamation Commission, welcomed the ban, for which he has been campaigning for the past five years. ""As our nation confronts the deep stain of a resurgent white-supremacist movement that peddles a dangerous and dehumanising agenda, this parliament has declared that the symbol of Nazism will never find a safe harbour in our state,"" he said.

33,$23.6 billion spend on Queensland Health was needed 'yesterday',politics,"  'Record' Queensland state budget spend on health really only keeping up with inflation, AMAQ says The Queensland government has spruiked a record health spend in its state budget, but the response from health advocacy groups has been lukewarm, with the peak doctors lobby group saying the funding was needed ""yesterday"". The state budget includes $9.8 billion for expanding capacity in the health system, delivering a total of 2,220 beds over six years through expansions to existing hospitals and the construction of three new ones in Bundaberg, Toowoomba and Coomera. The government will also reallocate nearly $230 million of existing funding to add 289 beds across the Metro South, West Moreton, Gold Coast and Cairns and Hinterland hospital and health services over the next two years. It also says it is on track to deliver on a promise of an extra 9,475 health staff in this term of government. The total Queensland Health budget in 2022-23 is $23.6 billion. Treasurer Cameron Dick said yesterday the budget for health had increased 13 per cent over two years. ""The AMA called for 1,500 beds and we're delivering 2,200 across the length and breadth of Queensland and we're delivering more than 250 over the next two years alone,"" Mr Dick said. ""When we get those beds built, that will free up capacity in the hospital system and that will help Queenslanders wherever they live."" Australian Medical Association Queensland (AMAQ) president Maria Boulton said the ""record"" spend the government was touting was only keeping up with inflation. Find out where the Queensland government is spending money in the budget and what that will mean for you. ""Those hospital beds needed to be available yesterday,"" Dr Boulton said. ""While, yes, it is more spending from Queensland … we needed that spending to be had yesterday. ""Over the next year, what we're seeing is just an increase really to cope with inflation, which is not enough to make up for the neglect that the state system has been in. ""Patients are waiting on hospital ambulance ramps. That's ridiculous. ""Patients are waiting to access mental health services. That's ridiculous … we're playing catch-up and we needed to do more."" Dr Boulton said there would need to be collaboration between the state and federal governments and stakeholders to ensure there were enough doctors to staff hospital beds. She said the budget was also a missed opportunity to increase funding for palliative care. Fiona Scalon, ambulance coordinator for the United Workers Union, said the record health funding was pleasing to see. ""There isn't, however, any talk of any extra resources for ambulance, and that's disappointing to our members considering they're struggling at the moment,"" Ms Scalon said. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. ""We were hoping that the advocacy we had done around the fact that our members still can't get their breaks on a 12-hour shift, they can't finish on time, is clear that there isn't enough bodies on the ground and they need to put more on. ""I think the big story there is the number of hours the ambulance service loses to hospital ramps — there's a hospital system that isn't working. ""They have put a lot of money into trying to address that, which is really pleasing to see … but in the meantime, our paramedics are going to struggle because it's going to take years for that kind of thing to have an impact."" Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said the big health spend would tackle long ambulance wait times by making more hospital beds available. ""The log-jams that we get with ambulances goes to the heart of having bed capacity when people either need it for elective surgery or for emergency care and what we need to do is increase our bed numbers and we need to increase it significantly,"" she told ABC Radio Brisbane. ""This is the biggest uplift this state has ever seen in building new beds for our hospitals."" Bruce Willett, chair of the Queensland Branch of the RACGP, told ABC Radio Brisbane that family doctors would be glad to see the increased staffing and beds in hospitals. But Dr Willett said there was a shortage of doctors and nurses, particularly in the bush, and they should not be pulled from general practice, where they were also needed, to work in hospitals. ""We do need to invest in training more GPs and nurses particularly to work rurally,"" Dr Willett said.

34,Half the cost but only 6pc of the benefit? Tasmania's obstacle to Marinus Link,politics,"  No guarantee Tasmanian households won't be hardest hit by Marinus Link bill It was the hot topic of letters between former prime minister Scott Morrison and the Tasmanian government — and it appears there's still no guarantee Australia's poorest state won't pay half the cost of a massive new power project and reap a fraction of the benefits. Marinus Link is a $3.5 billion plan to build two new undersea power cables between Tasmania and Victoria Most of the benefits will go to mainland power users, but under current rules Tasmanians will have to pay half the cost of Marinus Link Former prime minister Scott Morrison told the Tasmanian government last December he doubted that rule could be changed in time for Marinus Link to be built on schedule The undersea electricity interconnectors and new transmission infrastructure between Tasmania and Victoria, dubbed Marinus Link, are estimated to cost $3.5 billion to build. The Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments have already committed over $200 million to pay for feasibility studies and a business case, and a Final Investment Decision is set for 2024. But both governments privately acknowledged most of the benefits will go to mainland electricity customers and Tasmanian energy generators, including Hydro Tasmania and wind farm owners, and not to Tasmanian consumers. This was made clear in a letter from former Tasmanian premier Will Hodgman and current Energy Minister Guy Barnett to then prime minister Scott Morrison, made public under a Right to Information request. ""Given the overwhelming majority of benefits from Project Marinus will flow to National Electricity Market (NEM) regions other than Tasmania, the Tasmanian government cannot justify a funding scenario in which Tasmanian taxpayers or electricity customers incur additional costs to benefit other NEM regions,"" they wrote. Mr Hodgman and Mr Barnett were making it clear to Mr Morrison that a way would have to be found to ensure Tasmanians didn't have to pay for half of Marinus Link since they wouldn't get half of the benefits. But Mr Morrison wasn't certain that could happen before a final decision was made on whether to build the new interconnectors. Marinus Link is proposed to be a regulated interconnector — that means the investors who pay for it to be built will get a guarantee they will be repaid whatever money they put in, as well as a set extra return on top of that. The suspension of Australia's east coast energy market could be lifted as early as Thursday, but the market operator is warning the challenges managing supply and demand may continue. Goanna Energy principal consultant Marc White said under Australia's current energy market rules, it would be power users like households and businesses that would have to pay the investors back through higher electricity bills. ""The question is where is that money coming from and, the answer is — as a regulated interconnector  — that money is coming from consumers to repay the capital and to provide a return on that capital to investors,"" he said. Under the Australian energy market rules, the costs of interconnectors, or electricity transmission cables between states, are shared equally between the states that are connected. That means Tasmanian consumers would be up for 50 per cent of the cost of Marinus Link. TasNetworks, which is managing the Marinus Link project, has acknowledged Tasmanian consumers will get about 6 per cent of the benefit, with 94 per cent going to other stakeholders including generators and interstate consumers. ""Under the current market rules, paying 50 per cent for an asset that we only get 6 per cent benefit from doesn't make any sense, and we would certainly argue against Tasmanians paying roughly half the share of Marinus Link,"" Mr White said. ""The fact is that it's the Australian market that needs our clean, reliable and dispatchable energy, and therefore they should fund Marinus Link."" In their letters to the former prime minister, former Tasmanian premiers Will Hodgman and Peter Gutwein said getting a fair price deal for Tasmanian power users was a ""threshold issue"" for the state government. ""The state has been very clear since the outset that we cannot proceed with the project without achieving a fair cost allocation, and as you would be aware, the current regulatory arrangements do not allow for the costs of project Marinus to be fairly allocated among customers,"" Mr Gutwein wrote in December 2021. They wanted the Commonwealth government to support an application to the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) to change the rules so that Tasmanians wouldn't bear 50 per cent of the cost of Marinus Link. But later that month Mr Morrison warned it probably wouldn't be possible to change that rule in time for Marinus Link's proposed Final Investment Decision date. ""I am advised reform of the current transmission investment framework, either through the ENCRC or through an AEMC rule change, is unlikely to present a viable way forward in time for a final investment decision to be taken on the project in 2024,"" Mr Morrison wrote. He suggested that Tasmanian consumers would have to pay based on the current rules, but that would be made up for by Hydro Tasmania and other generators getting higher revenues. Mr Morrison also said that the Commonwealth would pay to build Marinus Link if private investors didn't want to. The then-prime minister and then-premier Gutwein agreed that the Commonwealth would support Tasmania's application to AEMO for a cost recovery rule change. The correspondence between the federal and state leaders was obtained by the Tasmanian Labor Party through Right to Information. Labor's Energy spokesman Dean Winter questioned Tasmania's Energy Minister Guy Barnett about it during a budget estimates hearing earlier this month. On Tuesday, Mr Barnett said the Tasmanian government was working with the Commonwealth and AEMC to make its application for a rule change. He said he was confident a rule change could be made in time for the Final Investment Decision for Marinus Link in 2024. ""Written into the Memorandum of Understanding and funding agreement for Marinus Link and Battery of the Nation, is a commitment from both the Tasmanian and Australian Governments to work together to submit a cost allocation rule change to the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) for Marinus Link,"" Mr Barnett said. ""This agreement was signed on the 3rd of April 2022."" ""This is an important step to ensure interconnector pricing and cost allocation to those jurisdictions that would benefit from Marinus and access Tasmania's low-cost renewable generation, and I expect the rule change application to be lodged shortly."" Consultant Marc White was less confident a rule change could be secured before 2024. He said it would usually take one to two years to get AEMC to agree to and carry out a rule change. ""This (rule change application) appears to be a very complex one because it may have unintended consequences for other interconnectors either now or in the future, and so it looks to me like this is such a complex issue that it doesn't appear that it's going to be likely to happen before Marinus is planned to progress,"" he said. Mr White was concerned by the prospect that the Tasmanian and Commonwealth Governments might green-light Marinus Link even if a rule change, protecting Tasmanian consumers from bearing an unfair proportion of costs, wasn't yet in place. ""It's looking like the Marinus train has a fair head of steam up, despite any cost recovery obstacles, this train looks like it's going to be kept pushed down the track."" Labor's Dean Winter said his party would support Marinus Link if it's in the best interests of Tasmania, but said Labor did not have the information needed. If it [Marinus Link] can't get its rule change by Final Investment Decision date, I'm not sure how it's going to be able to make a decision,"" he said. ""We can't be in a situation where Tasmanians have to pay over and above the benefits they get, that's obviously not fair."" Marinus Link is projected to inject $2.9 billion into the Tasmanian and Victorian economies, and create 2,800 jobs while the infrastructure is being built. Independent Murchison MLC Ruth Forrest has reservations about the project. She said Tasmanians had very little information about how they will benefit from Marinus Link. ""We know that there'll be more benefit in terms of the energy supply to the mainland,"" Ms Forrest said. ""Ongoing employment will be very limited in terms of even during but particularly after the build, should it proceed. There are so many unknowns the require clear answers before we really do commit to such a major project.""'

35,Is it the beginning of the end for stamp duty?,politics,"  The NSW government's land tax announcement explained — is this the beginning of the end of stamp duty? From next year, some first home buyers in NSW will be able to choose between paying the lump sum of stamp duty or an annual land tax. While first homeowners will be the only immediate beneficiaries, NSW Treasurer Matt Kean was not shy about voicing ambition to extend it. ""This is the first step in making sure that we start testing the waters for tax reform in New South Wales,"" said Mr Kean. Under the plan first home buyers purchasing a property up to $1,500,000 can opt to pay an annual fee of $400 plus 0.3 per cent of the land value. There's plenty of health spending and some big reforms for first home buyers — this is how NSW Treasurer Matt Kean's first budget will affect you. For example, buying a $1.35m house, with a land value of $810,000, the stamp duty would be $59,125. But if a buyer is holding on to the property for less than 20 years, they are better off paying the $2,830-per-year land tax — which would total $56,600. For apartments, the deal is better because land value is less. An $830,000 apartment, with a $265,000 land value, would require an up-front payment of $32,440 stamp duty, or the buyer could pay $1,195-per-year land tax. For Ryan Dalusag, who is both a real estate agent and a prospective first home buyer, the plan to replace stamp duty with land tax has merit. ""Being spread out over a longer period of time it helps me personally, not having to put up as big deposit,"" Mr Dalusag said. ""After hearing the announcement today, I find that it's a little more doable, achievable to secure a property."" ""For most first-time buyers, the biggest challenge is getting that initial deposit together,"" Ray White chief economist Nerida Conisbee said. ""If a first-time buyer doesn't need to pay $20,000-$30,000 in stamp duty to buy their first home, it allows them to get in a bit earlier and certainly with a much smaller deposit."" But it will cost the NSW government a lot of money to make changes to stamp duty, which is a key stream of revenue. ""It's a big revenue earner, it accounts for around a quarter of total revenue for the state government,"" Ms Conisbee said. ""Moving to a land tax system will take a lot of work, for people to get used to paying an annual land tax and for the government coffers to get used to less revenue."" From being smart about shopping for everyday items to making lifestyle changes to save on power, our readers share ways you can cut costs. Despite stamp duty being a good revenue raiser, it is not good for much else, according to Property Council NSW executive director Luke Achterstraat. ""Stamp duty is volatile, it's inefficient, it actually traps people in their homes,"" he said. ""People feel they've made a really significant cost to purchase a property, so stay in their homes for longer than really is appropriate. Mr Achterstraat says stamp duty is a ""triple threat"" that is bad for home ownership, household mobility and jobs. ""What the government's done today is put a bit of a stake in the ground and say we're going to trial this change."" The land tax option will save some first home buyers money, particularly those who do not want to stay in the same house for a long time. However, NSW Labor say there are better ways of supporting home buyers, including extending the stamp duty concessions. The NSW government has extended the stamp duty exemption for properties under $650,000 and reduction for homes before $800,000. ""If you're going to put money on the table for first home buyers, why introduce a brand new land tax system for New South Wales when we've never had one before, rather than just extending the exemptions to allow people to pay no land tax at all,"" Opposition Leader Chris Minns said. Social services and community housing advocates are also disappointed that there was not more in the budget for vulnerable people. ""There are more than 50,000 households on the social housing waiting list in New South Wales,"" Caitlin McDowell, from the Community Housing Industry Association said. ""Some of these people wait 10 or more years to be housed. ""The New South Wales government has committed to build just 320 new social homes over the next 12 months, that is an absolute outrage.""

36,Chinese investment in Australia plunged to 'literally none'. Has China already bought what it wanted?,politics,"  Chinese investors fast abandoning Australia but still hold vast amounts of infrastructure, land and water Chinese investors are fast abandoning Australia as a frosty bilateral relationship dampens trade, with a report showing Chinese investment in Australia nosedived by almost 70 per cent last year to the lowest level since 2007. A report by KPMG and The University of Sydney found Chinese firms laid out $778 million in Australia in 2021, compared to $2.5 billion in 2020. At its peak in 2008, when Beijing desperately needed natural resources to boost the economy, investors from China splurged about $US16.2 billion  ($19.1bn based on 2008 exchange rate) in Australia, which was 24 times more than last year. The number of deals last year almost halved to 11, from 20 in 2020. Four transactions — related to acquiring iron ore and lithium mines — accounted for most of the total Chinese investment inflows last year. Since 2017, Chinese investment in Australia has been plummeting, but last year's results have shocked experts who have been monitoring the trend. ""The decline really has now gone to a level where there is literally none or very little investment coming from China,"" Hans Hendrischke, report co-author and professor in Chinese business and management from the University of Sydney, told ABC News. ""We are surprised in a sense that it's dropping so fast."" While there has been a diplomatic breakthrough and a significant shift in tone towards China from the new government, experts say it might take some time for Chinese investors to return. In recent years, Chinese investors have been facing the double whammy of a domestic clampdown on capital export and stricter screening from Australian regulators. In 2016, Beijing started to impose restrictions on capital outflows due to concerns over excessive debt, inappropriate investment and capital flight. At the same time, Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board's (FIRB) tougher application process subdued interest from potential Chinese buyers. Professor Hendrischke said the current geopolitical climate was another obstacle. ""US, very strongly, and Europe, [including] the UK, Germany and France, are screening Chinese investment now for any potential conflicts that they could have with Chinese controls over certain assets [and] Australia is part of that,"" he said. ""The relationship between Australia and China is not a very good one at the moment and diplomatic contacts are interrupted. That does not allow us to go ahead or even approve more investment."" An example is Chinese-owned tech giant Huawei. The Turnbull government banned it from taking part in the rollout of 5G mobile infrastructure due to national security concerns. Despite the highly politicised atmosphere, Wei Li, a lecturer in international business at the University of Sydney, said Chinese investors were holding on to their Australian assets. ""I don't see a major trend of Chinese companies withdrawing their investment in Australia yet,"" Dr Li said. ""The main sentiment is to wait and see. For a lot of Chinese companies, Australia is their first overseas country that they have ever invested [in]. There's a lot of commitment."" Traditionally, Chinese firms view Australia as a ""test market"". They get a ""Western experience"" by investing in Australia and then expand to other similar economies. Analysts argue the huge loss of foreign funding from China means Australian companies may miss out on future opportunities, including access to the Chinese domestic market. Between 2007 and 2021, China's state-owned enterprises and private companies poured a total of $158 billion into Australia, including by investing or acquiring mining and energy companies, infrastructure, wind turbine farms and a dairy processor. Last year, Suzhou CATH Energy-Technologies invested $318 million in lithium explorer AVZ Minerals and Clive Palmer's Balmoral Iron was bought by CITIC for $187 million, according to the report. In 2017, Chinese mining group Yancoal acquired Rio Tinto coal assets Coal & Allied, including the Hunter Valley's Mount Thorley and Warkworth sites. Two of Australia's biggest energy companies were acquired by Chinese firms in the past decade. Energy Australia was sold to China Light and Power Company by the NSW government in 2011, while the sale of Alinta Energy to Chinese company Chow Tai Fook was approved by then-treasurer Scott Morrison in 2017. In terms of infrastructure, Chinese company Landbridge Group secured a 99-year lease of Darwin Port for over $500 million in 2015, and a Chinese-backed consortium successfully bid $1.75 billion for a 98-year lease of the world's biggest coal port, the Port of Newcastle, in 2014. The controversial lease Darwin Port remains in the spotlight amid China’s new security pact with Solomon Islands. So, how and why did it happen? However, both deals drew criticism from politicians and national security experts. According to 2021 government reports on foreign ownership of agricultural land and water, Chinese companies were also big stakeholders in those areas. Currently, 14.1 per cent of Australia's agricultural land is foreign owned, and China is the largest foreign owner (2.3 per cent). China is also the third-largest stakeholder of Australian water behind Canada and the US, owning 604 gigalitres or 1.5 per cent of the total Australian water entitlement. About 11 per cent of the Australian water is foreign owned. Under the ""going out"" strategy, initiated by the Chinese government at the turn of this century, Chinese firms were encouraged to invest aboard. The aim was to secure natural resources and intellectual property to support the growth of the economy. ""Over the last decade or so, China has really become one of the world's largest foreign investors,"" according to Gerard Burg, senior economist at National Australia Bank. ""This was a conscious decision. Initially, it was very heavily resource intensive. A lot of investment in countries like Australia was seeking access to things like iron ore and coal. ""But more recently, it has moved away from those sort of investment targets, more towards things like technology."" Professor Hendrischke agreed, saying that after the mining boom, when state-led Chinese firms acquired enough assets, they shifted towards health care, agribusiness and renewable energy. But more recently, as the geopolitical competition between China and the US flared, investment interest in Australia shifted from bigger acquisitions to safe assets. About one-third of total investment over the past two years was held in commercial real estate. ""There is a degree of insecurity and uncertainty,"" Professor Hendrischke said. ""How the relationship between the US and China plays out over the long term will have an impact on Australia."" The report also found Chinese companies were flocking to Europe and countries associated with the Belt and Road Initiative. Last year, Chinese investment in Europe grew by one-quarter. ""Just as we've been debating how to diversify away from China here in Australia, China has already started diversifying away from Australia in this regard,"" Pichamon Yeophantong, a senior lecturer at UNSW Canberra, said. Despite the pandemic, China has continued to invest abroad at a steady pace. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, outbound direct investment from China rose by 9.2 per cent to $208 billion. In 2020, while investment globally was falling, China's government claimed to be the world's largest investor, with total spending of $220.5 billion. Economists have noticed big discrepancies between official and unofficial measures, such as the American Enterprise Institute’s China Global Investment Tracker. ""There is some uncertainty around the accuracy of this data,"" Mr Burg said. ""The key destinations for China's private investment, according to that official data, have been Hong Kong, as well as two notable tax havens, the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands. ""One possibility is that the investors are trying to mask the origin of investment funds. By going through the tax havens, they can wash away the concerns in other countries about Chinese investment. ""Or it's the possibility that Chinese firms and high-net-worth individuals maybe try to get their capital out of China. That would be a major negative for China's long-term growth prospects, particularly concerns around its financial sector."" President Xi Jinping's ""common prosperity"" policies have sparked fears of wealth redistribution in recent years, especially in the tech and financial sectors. Mr Burg noted that Australian data showed the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands were the sources of the ninth-largest and 20th-largest stock of foreign direct investment in 2020, while Hong Kong ranked 11th overall. China's official data also shows Chinese investment in countries affiliated with the Belt and Road Initiative increased by 14 per cent to $28.6 billion last year. The initiative aims to connect more than 65 countries across various continents for trade, with a particular focus on infrastructure-starved developing nations. It has also been widely viewed as a tool for Beijing to exercise soft power. But the lack of transparency in Chinese loans terms and the alarming debt levels among poor nations have sparked speculation about ""debt-trap diplomacy"". The theory is when a country defaults or keeps borrowing more to repay its loans, Beijing will have some leverage in demanding concessions or other advantages in exchange for debt relief. ""China's share of outstanding external debt to emerging market countries has increased sharply over the past decade,"" Carmen Altenkirch, from asset management company Aviva Investors, said. ""This reflected a desire on the part of some emerging market governments to access capital for infrastructure investment, and a willingness on the part of Chinese entities to lend. ""China is one of the largest creditors to emerging market countries at a time when debt is, or is quickly becoming, unsustainable for many."" The trade war between Beijing and Canberra is hurting both sides greatly, but will the change of Australian government bring it to an end? However, Ms Altenkirch said there was no evidence Chinese authorities had actively tried to put certain countries into too much debt. China's former central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, rejected suggestions his country was using debt-trap diplomacy, saying debtor countries demanded Chinese lending and it provided long-term economic benefits. ""There is a certain degree of difficulty in this process, and it must be carefully considered and designed to find a way to alleviate the debt problems of the countries along the Belt and Road, while avoiding suggestions that there are bad motives,"" he said at an economic forum in April.

37,Activists say a WA 'carbon bomb' will damage Queensland's Great Barrier Reef,politics,"  Conservation group seeks injunction to stop Woodside gas project to protect Great Barrier Reef It is 3,000 kilometres from the Great Barrier Reef, but according to a Federal Court challenge mounted by conservationists, a gas project in Western Australia could have disastrous impacts on Queensland's embattled World Heritage site. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) has applied for an injunction against Woodside's Scarborough gas project, asking that it be halted until new federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek has assessed whether the operation will damage the Great Barrier Reef by exacerbating climate change. ACF boss Kelly O’Shanassy said the west coast project posed a major risk to Australia's precious World Heritage site. ""People in Australia would be shocked to know that the Scarborough gas mine that is proposed has never been approved under Australia's environmental law or assessed for the impact that [it] will have on places like the Great Barrier Reef,"" Ms O’Shanassy said. ""It's a really, really big carbon bomb."" ""It's like turning on 15 coal-fired power stations across Australia."" Woodside said gas produced by the project would generate enough electricity to power 10 times the number of homes in Perth, and it would do that with emissions of about half of what would be generated by coal. In a statement, Woodside CEO Meg O'Neill said: “The Scarborough Project has been the subject of rigorous environmental assessments by a range of regulators. ""The project will deliver significant local and national benefits in the form of employment, tax revenue and reliable gas supply in the energy transition for decades to come. “Woodside will vigorously defend its position in these proceedings."" According to the documents filed to the court, predicted emissions from the project would cause global temperatures to rise by nearly 0.0004 degrees Celsius, ""which will result in the deaths of millions of corals during each future mass bleaching event"". ACF also argued that additional warming presented ""a real risk"" that could in turn trigger a spiral of further, runaway warming, which would all but destroy the Great Barrier Reef. Any increased warming would result in additional death of coral on the Great Barrier Reef, Selina Ward, a coral reef scientist at the University of Queensland, said. ""Already at this stage, we are losing vast numbers of corals in bleaching events that are becoming more frequent,"" Dr Ward said. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg from the University of Queensland agreed. ""We're at a point now where every bit of carbon going into the atmosphere has a price and that price is growing by the day,"" Professor Hoegh-Guldberg said. This year, the Great Barrier Reef experienced its sixth mass-bleaching event — a phenomenon driven by global warming, which was never observed prior to 1998. Scientific arguments similar to those used by ACF were presented to the Federal Court by a group of young people trying to establish a duty of care on the environment minister to protect them from climate change. At the time, then-environment minister Sussan Ley accepted the scientific arguments, instead disputing the legal implications of them — an argument she won on appeal. There were all the signs that 2022 was going to be the climate election — and this year's election results speak for themselves, writes Michael Slezak. A spokeswoman for Ms Plibersek said she was unable to comment on the legal challenge to Woodside's Scarborough gas project because the case was before court. But new Resources Minister Madeleine King has backed the project, and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said the government will support fossil fuel projects that ""stack up environmentally and then commercially"". Woodside plans to open up the new Scarborough gas field, lay about 430km of gas pipes on the sea floor, and significantly expand existing liquefaction facilities, known as ""Pluto"", near Karratha in Western Australia. The project has received key environmental approvals from state and federal governments, and last year Woodside announced a final investment decision had been made to progress the project. The federal environmental assessment was conducted by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA), rather than the environment minister, under devolved powers given to the agency. All offshore projects would normally undergo assessment by NOPSEMA. However, projects likely to have a significant impact on the Great Barrier Reef cannot be assessed solely by NOPSEMA, and are required to undergo a full assessment by the environment minister. As a result, the Environmental Defenders Office, on behalf of ACF, argued that if the project proceeded, it would do so without the required approvals. According to Woodside, the project will create up to 3,200 jobs during construction and ""nearly"" 600 ongoing jobs. But Bill Hare, a scientist from consultancy Climate Analytics, said emissions figures claimed by the company ignored emissions from the existing LNG facilities at the site. He said the emissions would actually be about 40 per cent higher — nearly 1.4 billion tonnes. ""Its lifetime emissions would be equivalent to about three times Australia's present national emissions,"" he said. Most of those emissions would occur when the gas was burned — much of which would occur overseas. But according to Mr Hare, the project would contribute 41 million tonnes to Australia's domestic emissions by 2030. He said that was about 7 per cent of our 2005 emissions — the baseline Australia has now committed to cut emissions to 43 per cent below. Woodside has said its estimate of 878 million tonnes of emissions is a figure that has been accepted by Australian regulators.

38,Adelaide 500 track needs resurfacing before race in December,politics,"  Traffic woes expected as Adelaide 500 track gets resurfaced ahead of December race More than half of the Adelaide 500 track will need to be resurfaced before the supercar race in December and traffic disruptions are expected. SA Motor Sport Board chief executive Mark Warren briefed the Adelaide City Council on Tuesday night about what work would need to be done to get ready for the race in less than six months. ""We've found the track surface in quite a dilapidated state,"" he told the meeting. ""A lot of the surfaces haven't been replaced since the grand prix days."" He said pit paddock in Victoria Park had ""deteriorated beyond its design life"" and had become unsafe and an ""eyesore"". Mr Warren told the council that he wanted to extend the concreted part of the pit area. Resurfacing will take place from the Britannia roundabout, down Wakefield Road, through Victoria Park and to the corner of Hutt Street and Bartels Road. Work is set to start on August 1. ""I think there's going to be some minor road closures but a lot of the works are actually done overnight, and [we are] looking at how we might have some lane reductions and things like that, but generally it's well managed,"" Mr Warren said. In the latest South Australian budget, the state government allocated $18 million to bring back Adelaide 500 in December, following through on a Labor election promise. Victoria Park, which has been used as a major COVID testing drive-through site since 2020, will close on July 1 to make way for race preparations.

39,Unprecedented intervention in energy market could be ended within days,politics,"  Australian Energy Market Operator signals it will likely end its market intervention this week The unprecedented suspension of Australia's east coast energy market could be lifted as early as Thursday but the market operator is warning the challenges managing supply and demand may continue. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) last week seized control of the east coast energy market for the first time in its history after days of volatility put several states at risk of blackouts. The federal government backed the intervention, acknowledging the energy market had effectively failed, and credited the AEMO with successfully managing to avoid both blackouts and load shedding as temperatures on the east coast plummeted. But after a meeting with the energy sector on Tuesday, guidelines have been drawn up for a ""staged process"" to resume regular operations, with the AEMO suggesting the suspension could be lifted as early as Thursday. After a mere two weeks to assess the state of the National Electricity Market, Chris Bowen has found it crumbling in his hands, writes Melissa Clarke. ""These criteria will … give AEMO sufficient confidence that it can end the market suspension with minimal risk of the same conditions re-emerging in the very short term,"" AEMO said in a statement. ""AEMO anticipates monitoring will continue for at least 24 hours and, if AEMO is confident the criteria are being met, the next step is to formally remove the market suspension and resume normal operation under the market rules."" The market operator has confirmed there is sufficient supply to get through Wednesday but has revealed it is still directing generators to pump power into the network. ""Conditions remain dynamic, requiring AEMO to manually direct generators to be available to meet consumers' energy needs,"" it said in a statement. And it has warned, regardless of when the suspension is lifted: ""There may continue to be challenges managing supply and demand."" The crisis has been caused, in part, by soaring global coal and gas prices and an ageing fleet of coal-fired power stations in Australia operating below capacity.

40,Could Julian Assange be freed now there are new leaders in the US and Australia?,politics,"  Julian Assange is facing extradition to the US, so will Prime Minister Anthony Albanese intervene? Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he will not be pressured into publicly intervening in the Julian Assange extradition case, despite international law experts arguing that direct involvement by Australia would carry ""significant"" diplomatic sway. The Biden administration is seeking to extradite the WikiLeaks co-founder to the United States to face hacking and espionage charges. Mr Assange has been detained at the maximum-security Belmarsh Prison, east of London, since April 2019 but his time there may be drawing to an end, with British Home Secretary Priti Patel declaring on Friday she had approved the American extradition request. Lawyers acting for Mr Assange, who is an Australian citizen, say they are working on an administrative appeal to that decision, and experts say even if it fails, there are further legal avenues to explore. And while the Australian government is not a party to the British court process, international law expert Donald Rothwell, of the Australian National University's College of Law, said Canberra could have real influence, if it chose to wield it, to try to stop the extradition. ""Australia is clearly in a position to try to exercise significant diplomatic influence,"" Professor Rothwell told the ABC News Daily podcast. ""There could be a political solution found, but whether or not the Albanese government wishes to invest that level of political capital at this point in time, I think really remains to be seen."" On Monday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters he would not publicly intervene to prevent Mr Assange's extradition. That was despite him saying in December, while he was the opposition leader, that he ""did not see the point"" of American authorities' ""ongoing pursuit"" of Mr Assange. The Prime Minister said he had not changed his position since making those comments, and added on Monday that he would not be influenced by pressure from Twitter users either. ""There are some people who think that if you put things in capital letters on Twitter and put an exclamation mark, then that somehow makes it more important — it doesn't,"" Mr Albanese said. The ABC's 7.30 has reported that the federal government has raised the Australian citizen's plight behind the scenes with close allies, and senior ministers have said publicly they will not conduct diplomacy via ""megaphone"". ""I intend to lead a government that engages diplomatically and appropriately with our partners,"" Mr Albanese said at the Monday press conference in Melbourne. Mr Assange has been in British custody since being expelled from the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2019. He's been pursued by the United States government for more than a decade and now Julian Assange is closer than ever to being extradited there on a string of charges including espionage. His lawyers argue extraditing Mr Assange to the United States for the hacking and spying offences would be illegal under UK law, and a breach of his human rights. Mr Assange is facing 18 separate charges in the United States over the publication of a range of highly classified information relating to the US-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Professor Rothwell says Mr Assange's prosecution under the US espionage act would set a major precedent. ""Importantly, it needs to be understood that what the United States allege is that Assange breached US law by the publication of material via WikiLeaks without actually physically entering the United States to obtain this material,"" he said. ""Any conviction on the basis of these charges would send out a very significant message to anyone involved, not only as a journalist or as a publisher, but also in relation to persons who come into possession of national security-classified information."" ""The ramifications of that would be very longstanding."" Mr Assange's WikiLeaks website was first launched in 2006, and it first gained international attention in 2008 with the release of classified information about procedures at the American military prison camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Friends and family of Julian Assange are urging Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to publicly call for the Wikileaks co-founder's extradition to the United States to be stopped. Two years later, in 2010, WikiLeaks was in the spotlight again, after it published its Afghanistan and Iraq War files, assisted by whistleblower and former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. While Manning was convicted and jailed for hacking and spying offences in 2013, she was subsequently granted a pardon by then-US president Barack Obama in 2017. But Professor Rothwell says there is no indication the US will show similar leniency to Mr Assange, either by dropping the charges or through the exercise of a pardon following any conviction. ""The Assange extradition matter could end tomorrow if the US Department of Justice seeks to drop the extradition request,"" he told ABC News Daily. ""There was some thought that the election of Joe Biden could see a change of direction by the United States in terms of its pursuit of Julian Assange, but there's no indication at all that [it] is not going to continue to pursue this matter."" ""The Biden administration has really been no different to the Trump administration."" ""Looking at the precedent of Chelsea Manning, there may well be a pardon or there may well be a political determination reached following a conviction being made, but once again we're looking at some period down the track here before we even reach that point."" Following the British Home Secretary announcement on Friday about the decision to extradite Mr Assange, the WikiLeaks co-founder's lawyers are now preparing an administrative appeal against her determination. But even if that fails, Professor Rothwell says there remains another option: an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. That body, based in Strasbourg in France, recently blocked Ms Patel's decision to deport asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda. Professor Rothwell says an appeal there could take months, if not years. ""That would really put a stay on Assange's extradition,"" he said. ""So we really need to see how that process could play out before the European Court of Human Rights, but it could in itself take a further number of years.""

41,Multi-billion-dollar cost blowout in metro tunnels under Sydney Harbour,politics,"  NSW budget 2022 reveals cost blowout in metro tunnels under Sydney Harbour of around $6b NSW's major transport infrastructure projects are facing significant cost hikes, with the price tag for the Sydney Metro City and South West blowing out by about $6 billion. The increase was revealed in the state budget papers, which were made public on Tuesday. The project was estimated to cost between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion. To date, the government has already spent almost $13 billion on the metro link that will connect Chatswood under the Sydney Harbour through to new stations in the CBD and south-west to Bankstown. Budget papers show the government expects the project to cost a further $5.1 billion over the coming four years. It's expected to be completed in 2024 — 10 years after construction first began. The first stage of Parramatta's light rail has also seen a cost blowout of $475 million. Transport for NSW has been contacted for comment. A Sydney Metro spokesperson said the additional costs reflected market conditions outside of the government's control, including the COVID-19 pandemic. ""The revised cost of the project includes $1.7 billion of costs that can be attributed to COVID — which caused significant disruption to critical workforce, construction production, supply chain and program,"" the spokesperson said. There's plenty of health spending and some big reforms for first home buyers — this is how NSW Treasurer Matt Kean's first budget will affect you. Other Sydney projects have stalled as the government shifted its priorities this budget, with just $1 million committed in the 2022-23 financial year to planning the Beaches Link. That decision followed an Infrastructure NSW report, recommending the shelving of some ""mega projects"" in favour of smaller ones because of labour shortages and ongoing COVID-19 impacts. $602.4 million in funding has been locked in for stage two of the Parramatta Light Rail, which will allow for detailed planning as well as the construction of a new bridge over the Parramatta River at Melrose Park on the proposed route. Opposition transport spokesperson Jo Haylen said money wasted on blowouts meant fewer funds for projects ""desperately needed in rapidly growing areas of Western Sydney"". ""In real terms, this $6 billion blowout means $6 billion out of the infrastructure pipeline for good,"" she said. ""It means that growing communities will have to wait longer before they get new transport services like rapid bus, Parramatta Light Rail stage two, and the airport metro. ""It's no wonder that the government hasn't announced any new transport projects west of Parramatta. They have blown the budget on existing projects.""

42,Council calls on government to sack Fairbrother as flashing councillor refuses to go,politics,"  Council calls on Tasmanian government to sack councillor Darren Fairbrother over flashing conviction A council in Tasmania's north-west has called on the state government to intervene and sack a convicted councillor who was found guilty of sexual offences, because they are powerless to do so. Waratah-Wynyard Councillor Darren Fairbrother has refused to resign after he was found guilty and fined $800 for flashing his penis three times at a crown prosecutor and her son on a beach in January last year. Deputy Mayor Mary Duniam introduced the motion calling on the government to intervene at a meeting last night, which also urged for a review of the Local Government Act. ""Councillor Fairbrother's activities, for which he has been found guilty and sentenced, have brought the community of Boat Harbour into disrepute, the council and councillors into disrepute, and the whole municipality of Waratah-Wynyard into disrepute,"" she said. ""I believe the Minister has the responsibility to the people of Tasmania and has the power to remove Councillor Fairbrother from his role as an elected representative of this council. ""It would also be fair to expect that the state government review and amend the Local Government Act 1993 and local government code of conduct, as a matter of urgency."" The council also successfully passed a vote of no confidence in Mr Fairbrother, but the motion was largely symbolic and cannot compel him to resign. Both motions were passed unanimously. The ABC has reached out to Mr Fairbrother for comment but he has not responded. Councillor Kevin Hyland, who moved the motion of no confidence, said he knew it was a symbolic gesture, but he felt it was important to have the vote on the record. ""Councillor Fairbrother has treated council and the staff with nothing short of blatant, arrogant, contempt,"" Mr Hyland said. ""There's not much we can do from here, but it is on the council record now, forever and a day."" Before either motion was debated, Mr Fairbrother faced a lengthy stream of questions and statements from members of the local community. Cody Hutchison began the discussions by asking a question of the room. ""Can all of those people who support registered sex offenders being leaders in the community please raise your hand … anyone?"" Mr Hutchison said. ""Some would say that's a very underhanded or value-laden question, that's true. But it's a harsh reality, the Waratah Wynyard council community now has a councillor who is a registered sex offender."" Wynyard resident Corey Speers also questioned Mr Fairbrother's decision to remain on council. ""In consideration of this, the number of code of conduct complaints against you, and the motion of no confidence in you to be discussed later tonight, I hope you are able to reconsider your position and resign in the best interests of the community,"" he said. Resident Maureen Corbett questioned the message that was sent by allowing Mr Fairbrother to remain on the council. ""The people who voted for Councillor Fairbrother did not vote for such a display of morally repugnant behaviour,"" Ms Corbett said. ""Allowing him to stay on council sends the wrong message, particularly to young men in our community."" Mr Fairbrother opted to take those questions on notice. During Mr Fairbrother's trial, his defence lawyer, Paul Sullivan, told a Burnie court that his client was ""reviewing his position"" on council as a result of the court finding. Mr Fairbrother told the council his review was completed on or about June 5. ""As a result of the review, I have written to the Premier expressing concern and highlighting what appears as a miscarriage of justice within the decision of Magistrate Anderson with a request for affirmative action,"" he said. The Waratah-Wynyard Council has confirmed Mr Fairbrother's review was not an official council review, but his own personal process. In a statement, a Tasmanian government spokesperson said Local Government Minister Nic Street said ""does not have the authority under the Local Government Act 1993 to remove a councillor"". ""A council can pass a motion of no confidence in a councillor and the motion would be a statement of position of the council,"" it said. ""Multiple code of conduct complaints have been lodged under the Local Government Act 1993 against Councillor Fairbrother. A range of sanctions are available to the code of conduct panel if the complaint is upheld, including a period of suspension for up to three months. ""The office of councillor is automatically vacated if its occupant is sentenced for committing an indictable offence. As a summary offence, being sentenced for prohibited behaviour does not result in the office being automatically vacated."" The spokesperson said Mr Street had ""sought advice on options to ensure that the eligibility for the office of councillor is well aligned with community expectations"". ""Appropriate amendments to the Local Government Act 1993 will be considered in the medium term and will not impact on Councillor Fairbrother's current term as councillor. The government has announced that it will be seeking to amend the code of conduct later this year."" Another government minister, Roger Jaensch, was asked about the situation at a press conference in Burnie. ""There is a review of the code of conduct underway at the moment as is there a review of local government in its totality,"" he said. ""I think Councillor Fairbrother should listen to his community — they put him there, they have expectations of him, they spoke last night very, very clearly about how they feel. ""If he doesn't apply his judgement, I'm sure the community will when it comes to the elections in October.""

43,"Shortlist for top US job scrapped before John Barilaro landed role, emails show",politics,"  Emails show applicants for John Barilaro's new US trade commissioner job were shortlisted before it was readvertised The NSW government shortlisted candidates for the job of US trade commissioner in May last year before readvertising the role and handing it to former deputy premier John Barilaro. On Friday it was announced Mr Barilaro, who resigned from parliament in October last year, would be the state's trade commissioner for the US, based in New York. Mr Barilaro had announced the creation of five NSW senior trade and investment commissioners (STIC) in November 2020, as the then trade minister. A parliamentary inquiry is set to look into the decision to appoint him to the US role. Tomorrow, the NSW upper house will debate a motion by Labor MLC Penny Sharpe to defer Mr Barilaro's commencement in the role until the inquiry is completed and reports back. NSW Opposition Leader Chris Minns said he hoped Mr Barilaro would front that inquiry. ""We'll be asking questions, senior bureaucrats, hopefully, Mr Barilaro himself because we need to understand why this decision was made and how this decision was made,"" he said. ""This is how they treat public money, it's as if it's for their own personal political motives and not for the interest of the people of NSW."" In a statement, an Investment NSW spokesperson said Mr Barilaro's appointment ""followed a lengthy and competitive global search process"", adding that ""at the conclusion of the initial recruitment process, there were no suitable candidates for the role"". ""Candidates were shortlisted and assessed on a range of measures including suitability for the role, qualifications, skills and experience,"" the statement said. ""As with other recent STIC recruitment, this appointment was not required to go to cabinet for approval."" But documents obtained by NSW Labor state that the appointments were supposed to be put to cabinet. They also show the shortlist for the Americas role was sent to senior bureaucrats in May 2021, but while recruitment for other roles progressed, the New York job was readvertised at the end of the year. NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet says former deputy premier John Barilaro was given the job of trade commissioner after an independent process, as Labor doubles down on its criticism of a ""$400,000-a-year job for a friend"". According to the documents the salary for the various roles range from $450,000 to $600,000. The advertising of three STIC roles, including the Americas position, cost $8,200, when they were first advertised in the Australian Financial Review in April 2021. Applications at that time were due to close on April 26 last year, and the recruitment firm NGS Global sent through their shortlist for the Americas role on May 17. The shortlist was discussed in an email the next day, from secretary of treasury Michael Pratt to several colleagues including Investment NSW CEO Amy Brown. ""Firstly re Americas would rate (redacted) and (redacted) as highest on the panel,"" Mr Pratt wrote. ""Both have international exposure (redacted) particularly relevant with his in-depth NY and markets exposure."" Mr Pratt then went on to detail two more candidates who he rated less highly. Another email from the HR department stated they aimed to have the New York role recruited by August. A further email, about the recruitment of the Tokyo STIC, detailed that all roles ""have a structured approval protocol process prior to employment"". ""The preferred candidate meets with the Treasurer, Deputy Premier and Premier,"" HR Business Partner Evelina Polura wrote. ""If endorsed by all three, a Cabinet appointment form is prepared and added as a Cabinet agenda item. ""Once endorsed by Cabinet, a contract can be offered to the candidate for negotiation."" The email, dated April 6, 2021, explained the preferred candidate for the Tokyo position had met with and been endorsed by the treasurer and deputy premier — at the time Mr Barilaro — and was due to meet with the premier. The appointment of the North Asia STIC was announced by Mr Barilaro in July, and the UK role in October. Investment Minister Stuart Ayres announced the South-east Asia and Middle East STICS on December 16, but another ad for the Americas role was run in the Australian Financial Review on the next day, with applications due a month later.

44,Who are the winners and losers in this year's Queensland budget?,politics,"  Queensland budget 2022: Winners and losers Treasurer Cameron Dick has labelled this year's Queensland budget ""the best one yet"", with a major focus on health spending. Here's a breakdown of key expenditure commitments and what that means for you. The government has allocated $23.6 billion to the state health system for 2022-23, representing a 5.6 per cent increase on the previous year's health spend. There is also a longer-term plan to expand hospital services. This includes a commitment to hire 9,475 new frontline hospital staff over the current term of government (by October 2024). These will include nurses, doctors and paramedics. There is $1.1 billion allocated to the Queensland Ambulance Service, 11 per cent more than in last year's budget. Over the next six years, $9.785 billion will be spent on creating an extra 2,509 beds in expansion programs at new and existing hospitals to address the growth in demand from the state's rising population. Three new hospitals will be built at Coomera, Toowoomba and Bundaberg, as well as a new Queensland Cancer Centre in Brisbane. Here's where the extra hospital beds will go: Another 289 hospital beds previously announced will be delivered by late 2024 under an accelerated infrastructure delivery program. In what the Treasurer has dubbed the ""biggest investment in mental health ever"", $1.64 billion will be spent over five years to improve mental health and wellbeing, and combat substance abuse and suicide. Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said this would fund community care and crisis support, and more mental health workers. ""Also, the Queensland Ambulance Service will commission an additional four Mental Health Co-responder services in the Darling Downs, Mackay, Wide Bay and Sunshine Coast areas,"" Ms D'Ath said. With the price of coal surging in the past 12 months, Treasurer Cameron Dick says it is fair that Queenslanders take a greater share of that pie. Queensland royalties and land rents increased by $5.794 billion in 2021-22. The state government is introducing tiered royalty levels from July 1, when a 10-year royalty freeze comes to an end. This will work the same as the tax system, meaning coal exporters pay a higher percentage of royalty the higher prices rise. ""With coal recently trading at over $500 per tonne, our current rate structure is clearly no longer fit for purpose,"" Mr Dick said. The current 15 per cent royalty rate will rise to: This will be applied progressively, like tax, with higher percentages only applying to the portion of the price in each of these tiers. ""For example, if coal prices are $302 per tonne, a very high price by usual standards, the 40 per cent tier will only apply to the $2 portion,"" the Treasurer said. Queenslanders will automatically receive a $175 cost-of-living rebate on their next power bill. This comes at a cost of $385 million. But the price of electricity is expected to rise over the medium-to-longer term, meaning subsequent power bills will likely be higher for many Queenslanders. This adds to cost-of-living pressures as surging inflation pushes up the cost of rent, food and petrol. This year's budget commits ""up to $66.4 million"" over four years to support initiatives for tourism recovery and growth. The state government previously provided more than $1 billion to support tourism and hospitality during the pandemic. This year's budget papers quote data from Tourism Research Australia, indicating domestic tourism in Queensland had recovered to pre-pandemic levels. But international visitor numbers are still a long way from returning to normal. After years of hits from the COVID-19 pandemic, this spending commitment is far from what many tourism operators had hoped would be a further helping hand from the government. More than 12,000 small-to-medium-sized Queensland businesses with payrolls up to $10.4 million will receive a cut to payroll tax. ""This will provide benefits of up to $26,000 per year for over 12,000 small-and-medium-sized businesses,"" the Treasurer said. Businesses with an annual payroll of more than $10 million will pay a levy of 2.5 cents for every $10 of taxable wages they pay above $10 million. Very large businesses, with payrolls of more than $100 million, such as supermarkets, will pay 5 cents for every $10 of taxable wages they pay above $100 million. Revenue from this levy will fund what the Treasurer calls the state's ""biggest ever"" investment in mental health (see above). Treasury estimates this will impact the top 1 per cent, or fewer than 6,000 Queensland businesses, including 850 with payrolls of more than $100 million. There is no substantial increase to last year's budget commitment to deliver 7,400 new properties for social housing by 2025. Earlier this month, the Department of Housing confirmed only 326 new social homes had been built this financial year, a significant slowdown in public house construction due to ongoing labour and supply shortages in the building industry. These problems have no quick fix and will put great pressure on the Queensland Housing and Homelessness Action Plan to deliver in the next three years. This budget commits $200 million to fund water and sewer infrastructure delivery so more residential building lots can be unlocked. Last year's budget predicted a budget deficit for 2021-22. This has been revised up to a $1.9 billion net surplus, largely thanks to a surge in revenue from coal and oil royalties, as well as an unexpected windfall in transfer duties as a result of the property boom. Overall, state revenue is up by just over $10 billion, or 15.9 per cent, on the 2020-21 financial year. But the good times are not expected to continue, with coal prices expected to fall back toward their long-term average and housing activity predicted to ""normalise"". Put simply, that means revenue is only expected to rise by 1.6 per cent in the next financial year and then decline by 3.2 per cent in 2023-24. Royalties and land rents are actually expected to decline by 14.3 per cent in 2022-23. Interestingly, much of the revenue growth is expected to come from a rise in GST revenue due to national economic growth and Queensland receiving an increased share of the GST pool. The Treasurer says Queensland's net debt is expected to reach $39.2 billion by 2025-26 — about half the figure that was projected two years ago. He puts this down to the rising net worth of government-owned corporations. The government has committed $19.6 billion to education in the 2022-23 financial year. Investment in the Building Future Schools program rises to $3 billion and includes $390 million to build five new schools: There is $742 million to expand and upgrade existing school infrastructure and $20 million to upgrade school playgrounds and tuckshops. A 15 per cent tax on all bets placed by punters (introduced in 2018) is being increased with an additional 5 per cent Racing Levy. This is paid by the gambling companies themselves, not punters. The Racing Levy is expected to raise about $50 million in revenue a year. Additionally, both of these taxes will, for the first time, be applied to bonus bets. This brings Queensland into line with betting taxes in all other Australian jurisdictions other than Tasmania. The tax on bonus bets is expected to bring in another $30 million a year. All of this $80 million in new revenue from gambling will be spent on the Queensland racing industry.

45,New regional hospitals among the beneficiaries of huge health injection in Queensland budget,politics,"  Queensland budget handed down by Treasurer Cameron Dick, health the big winner with coal royalties increasing Record coal prices will see mining companies face a hike to royalty rates, as the Queensland government touts major spending for the health system in the state budget. Handing down his third budget today, Treasurer Cameron Dick also revealed big businesses would be hit with a mental health levy on payroll tax, while funding has been allocated to build new, previously announced, hospitals in Bundaberg, Toowoomba and Coomera. ""Each year, the health budget grows,"" Mr Dick said. ""But this year, the increase is much more than just the usual."" A surplus will also be delivered at the end of this month, thanks to the temporary surge in coal and oil prices and a booming housing market. The unexpected net operating surplus – $1.9 billion for 2021/22 – is a big turnaround from the deficit forecast six months ago in December's mid-year budget update. Mr Dick announced the state would be the first of the four governments that went into deficit amid the COVID pandemic – the federal government, NSW, Victoria and Queensland – to deliver a surplus. However, as ""factors unwind"", the surplus is projected to slip to a $1 billion deficit the following two years, before returning to a modest $137 million surplus in 2024-25 and $183 million in 2025-26. Net debt – the measure of what the government owes, minus its financial assets – is forecast to double over the next four years, from $19.7 billion in 2022-23 to $39.2 billion by 2025-26. But that figure is still $11 billon lower than what the 2020-21 budget had forecast for 2023-24, with the budget papers calling it a ""substantially improved net-debt position"". With a 10-year freeze on coal royalty rates expiring at the end of the month, Mr Dick said it was time for new arrangements to be introduced, amid record prices. ""We know the foreign shareholders of coal companies won't like these changes. But they can rest easy. We are not increasing the rates that apply at the existing tiers,"" he said. As of July, three new progressive royalty tiers will be introduced: These changes are forecast to deliver ""an additional $1.2 billion in royalties over the forward estimates"", Mr Dick said. ""All of that $1.2 billion, and more, will be going into regional Queensland,"" he said. There will also be a mental health levy – a move that is predicted to generate $425 million each year by 2026 — to ""provide a sustainable and ongoing source of funding to assist Queenslanders in need"". From January, large businesses with national payrolls of more than $10 million will need to pay a levy of 2.5 cents for every $10 of taxable wages they pay above $10 million from January 2023. Businesses with national payrolls of more than $100 million – like major supermarkets – will pay an additional levy of five cents for every $10 of taxable wages they pay above $100 million. Find out where the Queensland government is spending money in the budget and what that will mean for you. ""Treasury modelling indicates this levy will only apply to around 1 per cent of all Queensland businesses,"" Mr Dick said. It has also been previously announced the point-of-consumption gambling tax for betting companies will rise from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. Mr Dick said the government was also cutting payroll tax for small and medium-sized businesses with payrolls between $1.3 million and $10.4 million – estimated to be about 12,000 businesses. ""This means a business with a $6.5 million of taxable wages will see over $26,000 extra each year in its bank account,"" he said. Opposition treasury spokesman David Janetzki has accused the Treasurer of breaking an election promise not to increase or introduce any new taxes during the term. ""The Treasurer made it abundantly clear that there would be no new or increased taxes, there were no semantics, there were no fine details, it was a bald-faced promise,"" Mr Janetzki said. ""Today he has broken that promise."" Under questioning earlier, Mr Dick said ""the people of our state knew what I was saying when I said it — we were very clear, we were very up front"". Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk added: ""The people of Queensland would expect us as a responsible government to take some of these profits to put them back into services across the state"". The budget includes $23.6 billion for health – a 5.6 per cent increase on the previous budget’s health spend. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory.

The state government plans to deliver 2,200 additional overnight beds at 15 health facilities by 2028, including new hospitals at Toowoomba, Coomera, Bundaberg, as well as a Queensland cancer centre. It also said there will be 289 additional beds via an ""accelerated infrastructure delivery program"" involving existing hospitals and facilities. ""Today our government commits $9.8 billion [over six years] for a funding program to expand the capacity of Queensland's health system, the biggest hospital building program in the history of Queensland,"" Mr Dick said.

46,'You will catch COVID again': Authorities warn SA case numbers could rise after new subvariant detected,politics,"  South Australia has recorded 11 COVID-related deaths with the Premier warning case numbers could rise after a new subvariant was detected in the state. Premier Peter Malinauskas confirmed the BA.5 subvariant has been identified in the state after being found in New South Wales and Victoria. ""Case numbers may go up between the next six to eight weeks pending how the new BA.5 variant rolls through South Australia,"" he said. ""The information presented to us this morning indicated that in New South Wales, the BA.5 variant numbers have gone up dramatically."" Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said complacency could be a killer. ""The pandemic has not just disappeared, it's still very active,"" she said. Ms Spurrier said it was ""difficult to estimate"" the severity of BA.5, but authorities expect it to be no worse than previous strains. ""We are expecting some immunity from previous infection and vaccination,"" she said. New modelling shows COVID numbers are expected to increase next week and peak about July 12 with an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 cases. SA Health would monitor the situation and would release further modelling. A woman in her 40s is among the 11 new deaths, and 2,270 new cases have been reported today. The deaths occurred between February 26 and Sunday but were only announced by SA Health today. The state's Emergency Management Council met this morning to discuss easing quarantine requirements for COVID-positive people, but no further changes were made to restrictions. Vaccine mandate requirements for allied health workers were also considered but remain unchanged. The latest restriction to ease was the requirement to wear masks at Adelaide Airport. Masks are still required on board aircraft. With a surge in influenza cases on top of COVID, the Health Minister Chris Picton has re-launched the ""emergencies campaign"" in a bid to free up more beds. Mr Picton says non-urgent elective surgery will be reduced and 28 private hospital beds will be accessible to public patients. ""The health system is under extreme pressure at the moment,"" he said. ""The truth is we simply don't have enough hospital beds open, so we're looking at private and peri-urban health beds to free up capacity in the system."" He said now was not the time for people to be complacent. ""Just because you've had COVID, don't feel like you're invincible, you will catch COVID again, particularly with new strains.""

47,Blow for $1.7 billion Perth City Deal as Murdoch University axes plan for CBD campus,politics,"  Murdoch University axes plan for Perth CBD campus and pulls out of City Deal project Murdoch University has scrapped its plan for a multi-million-dollar inner-city vertical campus that had been a central plank of the highly touted Perth City Deal. The Murdoch project, which was estimated to cost $250 million and set to inject more than 10,000 students to the CBD, has been abandoned due to the financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, the university said. ""While the CBD campus had merit, the impact of COVID on the University's finances required us to review our priorities and it was necessary to advise the government at the earliest opportunity that the University would be unable to progress the CBD campus,"" a Murdoch spokesperson said. Murdoch said it would instead focus on the construction of a new building at its South Street campus in Perth's southern suburbs. Speaking at budget estimates on Monday, WA's Education Minister Sue Ellery said the state government was disappointed Murdoch had pulled out of the Perth City Deal. ""The proposal was predicated on an increase in international students. Given the impact of COVID-19, Murdoch has reconsidered its proposal,"" she said. ""That is disappointing to the government."" Premier Mark McGowan said the state government had invested $41 million in programs that would help bring international students back to universities. ""The two years of closed international borders was a Commonwealth government decision which I supported,"" he told ABC Perth. He said Murdoch University did not ask the state government for extra money. ""They couldn't make it work,"" he said. ""Murdoch University's made that decision but just remember we've got Edith Cowan's WAAPA (Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts) coming into the city."" Edith Cowan University (ECU) is planning an $853 million new inner-city campus as part of the Perth City Deal, with the campus expected to attract more than 10,000 students and staff when it opens in 2025. That project received a $98 million government funding boost earlier this year. The Perth City Deal is a jointly funded $1.7 billion project between the state, federal and local governments, aimed at bringing jobs, tourists, students and vibrancy to the city. As part of the deal, redevelopments of the Concert Hall, Cultural Centre and WACA Ground are scheduled to be completed over the next few years. Alongside redevelopments and new infrastructure projects, three WA universities were planned to set up inner-city campuses, bringing tens of thousands of students and staff to CBD. On opposite sides of St George's Terrace in the heart of Perth's business precinct, two cafes tell the story of how Perth's CBD is recovering from COVID. The WA government had originally committed $50 million towards campuses for Murdoch and Curtin and $150 million towards ECU's significantly larger proposal. But since then, cost blowouts on the ECU campus have led to extra funds being committed by both state and federal governments. Ms Ellery told parliament the money the government initially committed to Murdoch would now go towards the ECU campus. ""Edith Cowan University's inner-city campus was facing significant cost escalation pressures,"" she said. ""The state government worked with the previous commonwealth government to address those issues."" Opposition leader Mia Davies said the government should not shirk responsibility for what it had done, and the impact of the state's border rules. ""This government has made an art form of alienating not only our interstate potential workers, clients, visitors, but also international markets,"" she said. ""We see the Premier about to jet off overseas, leaving a $5.7 billion surplus and West Australians struggling to make ends meet to try and repair some of that damage. ""They absolutely let the city and the state down by not trying to maintain those relationships and hold onto that deal.""

48,NSW budget deficit more than triples to $11.3 billion,politics,"  NSW budget deficit more than triples to $11.3 billion The state's forecasted budget deficit has more than tripled, as the NSW government seeks to embark on major economic reforms while grappling with COVID-19 and disaster spending. Dominic Perrottet's government has handed down its first budget, as he and Treasurer Matt Kean look to make their mark on both the economy and voters nine months ahead of an election. The deficit has blown out to $11.3 billion, far exceeding the $3.6 billion deficit forecasted in the 2021-22 half-yearly review. Treasurer Matt Kean described the budget as a ""once in a generation reform budget for the people of NSW"". ""It invests in helping them reach their hopes and dreams for tomorrow, "" he said. ""We're betting on our kids, because we know investing in our kids and giving them a great education is what sets them up for a great life. ""[These are] investments that will deliver for families today that will also build a brighter, stronger prosperous tomorrow."" There's plenty of health spending and some big reforms for first home buyers — this is how NSW Treasurer Matt Kean's first budget will affect you. While the government seeks to reform home ownership and women's economic participation, it insists the blowout is largely driven by the hangover costs of COVID-19, health spending and the response to the floods. ""Since the half-year review, we've seen once-in-a-generation floods, "" Mr Kean said. ""We know that we're moving to a different stage of the pandemic and our health system is under enormous pressure ... we've also seen the impact of inflation on the state's financial position. ""We forecast that inflation will decrease in the future, but we need to support families now."" A modest return to budget surplus of $601 million in the 2024-25 financial year is forecast, driven by large increases in revenue from GST, mineral royalties, and other taxes. Net debt will balloon to $114.8 billion in the 2025-26 financial year, about 14 per cent of gross state product. While many of the key budget measures have been announced, the government revealed a $150 voucher for every primary and secondary student attending school in 2023. The $193 million budget item would help parents pay for shoes, bags, textbooks, stationery and school uniforms. It's part of $2.2 billion of additional spending to tackle the cost of living pressures, including $520 million in toll relief over the next two years. A key feature of the budget is spending to improve the participation rate of women in the workforce, with $775 million over the next four years for the creation of a fund to increase the supply of affordable childcare. In a bid to improve housing affordability, $2.8 billion is being spent on a shared equity trial and a scheme to allow some first home buyers to opt for an annual property tax instead. Over the next four years, $112.7 billion will be spent on infrastructure, including works to enable Parramatta Light Rail stage two by building the Wentworth Point Bridge and upgrades to the Wyong rail line to enable faster rail between Sydney, Newcastle, and the Central Coast. About $470 million of funding from the state's $5 billion WestInvest program will be spent to modernise nine schools in Western Sydney. Health will receive $4.5 billion in additional spending. For regional NSW, the Regional Growth Fund is being expanded by $1.3 billion. Programs designed in partnership with First Nations communities will receive money from a $716 million fund. NSW Opposition Leader Chris Minns today labelled the budget a ""spending spree"" that future generations will have to pay off. Mr Minns said the amount of debt would be an ongoing burden. ""Mr Kean spent $1 billion for every minute that he spoke at the lectern today,"" Mr Minns said. ""A huge amount of money in gross debt has been racked up by the New South Wales government ... that will we have to be paid off by future generations of taxpayers.""

49,Winners and losers in this years' NSW budget,politics,"  NSW budget 2022: Here are the winners and losers NSW Treasurer Matt Kean has handed down his first budget. These are some of the biggest changes that could affect you. The budget includes big reforms for people looking to enter NSW's pricey property market. From January 16, 2023, many first home buyers will be able to elect to pay an annual land tax instead of stamp duty. The choice will be made available to first-time buyers purchasing a home up to the value of $1.5 million. If buyers decide to opt out of paying stamp duty, they will pay $400 plus 0.3 per cent of the land value per year. Meanwhile, a $780 million shared-equity scheme is set to help up to 3,000 frontline workers, single parents, and singles aged over 50 buy their first home. It would see the state contribute 40 per cent of equity for a new home, and 30 per cent for an existing home. The scheme is similar to the policy Labor leader Anthony Albanese took to last month's federal election. Premier Dominic Perrottet said NSW's plan would be trialled for two years. People will need to earn a maximum of $90,000 individually or have a combined income of $120,000 per year to be eligible. They will have to contribute a 2 per cent deposit under the scheme on homes worth up to $950,000 in metropolitan areas and $600,000 in regional areas. Home building is also getting a cash injection with nearly $500 million in funding to ""supercharge"" the approval of new housing. The planning project includes $300 million to co-fund shovel-ready infrastructure projects, $89 million to accelerate housing approvals, and $69.8 million to expedite rezoning. Palliative care services in some parts of NSW will be given a multi-million-dollar boost. The government will commit $743 million over five years to increase the number of beds and improve access to treatment and hire 600 new palliative health staffers. More than $90 million will be set aside to build new dedicated palliative care units at Westmead and Nepean hospitals. Mr Perrottet said the boost was the most important commitment in this year's budget. ""Whoever you are, wherever you are in our great state as you come to the end of your life you will have the care and support that you need and that is the sign of a true and just society,"" Mr Perrottet said. The government has locked in a $775 million commitment over the next four years to drive down childcare costs and increase the number of places. Under the plan, the state government will give subsidies to private childcare providers, to ensure some spots will be set at certain prices. Treasurer Matt Kean claims the changes will mean a middle-income Sydney family with one child in full-time child care in a state government-subsidised centre is expected to save up to $3,900 a year, while the saving in regional areas is predicted to be up to $7,800 a year. The paid parental leave scheme will also be overhauled to scrap the distinction between ""primary"" and ""secondary"" carers, in a bid to help women return to the workforce earlier. Instead, every mother and father in the public sector will be entitled to at least 14 weeks of paid parental leave. For mothers, there will be a grant to help them renter the workforce. The grants will give women up to $5,000, from a $32 million budget pool for clothes, training and technology. Meanwhile, young children in NSW will have an extra year of education under a new plan. Beginning in 2030, the plan will affect four- and five-year-olds and fall a year before what is known as kindergarten. The state government has committed to spending $5.8 billion over the next 10 years to make the blueprint a reality, and some of the money was set aside in the budget. Frontline health workers will get a one-off $3,000 ""thank-you"" payment for their work during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bonus is part of a $4.5 billion funding package for the health sector which also includes plans to hire an extra 10,000 staff (1,048 doctors, 3,517 nurses, and up to 200 midwives). The public-sector wage cap has also been lifted to 3 per cent this year, with a further 0.5 per cent increase next year, taking it to 3.5 per cent. Several unions in the sector have criticised the 3 per cent rise as a cut in real terms, as it is lower than inflation. There's also $883 million set aside over the next four years to attract and retain health workers in the bush, and more than $400 million to fast-track elective surgeries delayed due to COVID-19. Community-led Indigenous initiatives will receive funding as part of a $401 million investment to help ""close the gap"" in life expectancy between First Nations people and the national average. The NSW Coalition of Aboriginal Peak Organisations will lead the program. When challenged on the Coalition's failures in the years they have been in office, Mr Perrottet said there were always things governments could do better. ""You've always got to be looking at new ways and innovative policy solutions. I think that's what has come through here,"" he said. ""I'm sick of us not getting ahead in this space."" Money will also go to agencies within the Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations to promote groups that safeguard Indigenous language and culture, with grants of up to $250,000. The $401 million investment will come from a $716 million pool of funds for Indigenous housing, culture, language and community services. It's hoped the other funds will be used to help make 4,400 homes in First Nations communities climate resistant, and build new family centres, as well as record and preserve Indigenous languages. A total of $119 million will be injected into the research and development of ribonucleic acid (RNA) technology over the next 10 years. Advances in this field were crucial to creating the messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines, including those produced by Pfizer and Moderna. The investment is expected to increase NSW's capability to combat the next pandemic, as well as cancer and genetic diseases. Science Minister Alister Henskens said the collaboration would be made between the government and 14 NSW and ACT universities. ""The value of RNA technology has been proven throughout the pandemic through the use of mRNA vaccines, but we know that vaccines are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to RNA,"" he said. ""By bringing together our world-leading universities and industry leaders, we can deliver innovative solutions to some of the most important and complex challenges facing the world."" Almost half a million motorists will be eligible for quarterly rebates on their toll bills as the government tries to address the rising cost of living in NSW. The $520 million budget commitment over the next two years will apply to drivers who spend at least $375 on tolls a year. Drivers can get up to $750 cash back, a move that is set to benefit Western Sydney drivers who are hardest hit by tolls. The rebate program which replaces the existing half-price registration scheme will take effect from July 1. Mr Kean said the cost was a ""small price to pay"" to ensure motorists get more cash back. Despite rising construction costs, there's more than $600 million over the next four years in the budget to build stage two of the Parramatta Light Rail. Member for Parramatta Geoff Lee said the investment would support the growing population along the Parramatta River. ""This will connect people from the Parramatta CBD to Sydney Olympic Park via the growing Camellia, Rydalmere, Ermington, Melrose Park and Wentworth Point,"" Mr Lee said. Meanwhile, $60 million has been put aside to connect Parramatta to Circular Quay via a 91km pathway. A further $2.8 billion in transport infrastructure spending affecting Western Sydney is included in the budget. That encompasses $243.1 million to help ease congestion on Prospect Highway while $1.2 billion will be spent over the next four years to upgrade the M12 to the under-construction Western Sydney International Airport. The airport and its surrounds is the target of significant investment, about $163 million for buildings, remediation of the site and research facilities in the precinct. Hospitals in Rouse Hill and Liverpool will be given a share of $480 million for upgrades. There will be $9.5 million to fix the paths in parks across the western suburbs, and $15 million to build a special fence around the Georges River Koala Reserve. Power is becoming more expensive and the new financial year, which starts next month, will see prices rise. The default market offer (DMO) — the highest price a retailer can charge a customer for power — is going up between 8.5 and 14.1 per cent in NSW. While a complex series of national and international factors are impacting Australia's electricity sector, there is no immediate relief in the NSW budget for customers. Mr Kean also announced an investment of $1.2 billion for renewable energy transmission. Plans for a tunnel that would have connected the northern beaches to the Warringah Freeway and the rest of Sydney are on ice. The project would have connected the peninsular to an upgraded Warringah Freeway and, ultimately, WestConnex via a new road tunnel under Sydney Harbour. But rising construction costs meant Infrastructure NSW suggested shelving most of the state's mega-projects, and the Beaches Link was a casualty. The project was expected to cost $6.3 billion over four years of construction and was slated for completion in 2028. Women have been prioritised in the budget. The biggest spend by far — more than $10 billion — has been on improving affordability and accessibility of child care, and an overhaul of the preschool system, with the aim of making it more financially viable for women to get back in the workforce. Details of these policies can be found in the working parents section of this story. Then there has been $100 million offered for domestic violence support services and anti-street harassment initiatives, on top of funding commitments for IVF and menopause hubs. Public schools in the state will be given $1.6 billion for upgrades and new buildings. The education infrastructure funding will help specific schools in Albury, Concord, Lennox Head and Rouse Hill, among others. For parents, there will be a pool of $193 million for school supplies. Each child who attends a primary of secondary school will be eligible for a $150 subsidy. The only requirement is that children must be NSW residents, enrolled in school next year and listed on a Medicare card. The plan will come into effect on January 1 and run until June next year. Parents will also be able to send children to a pre-Kindergarten year of schooling. The $5.8 billion plan will be rolled out over 10 years to have students in pre-K by 2030. For those travelling to university there will be $98 million given for a regional apprentice and university student travel card, worth $250. The government has put $95 million aside to help make a fast rail link from Sydney to Newcastle a reality. Mr Perrottet previously committed $500 million to the plan in collaboration with the Commonwealth Government, making a total $1 billion available. ""Once this becomes a reality we will be seeing travel times between Sydney and Newcastle [reduced] from two and a half hours down to one hour, Sydney to Gosford in 25 minutes, then Sydney to Wollongong in 45 minutes,"" Mr Perrottet said. The $95 million will be used to upgrade existing infrastructure. Mr Perrottet said the works were an essential step in delivering his government's six cities vision, by improving accessibility between the state's major centres. ""You can't build great cities without building significant transport infrastructure, and ... this billion dollars from the state and federal government will lay that foundation and set up further investments as we move forward,"" he said. Commuters will also benefit environmentally with zero-emission buses hitting the road, which should reduce the noises, improve air quality and make for a smoother ride. The budget has outlined $219 million for the new hi-tech fleet over the next seven years. Around 200 zero-emission buses are expected to be in service on roads by mid-2023. While home buyers have plenty of measures to celebrate in this year's budget, there's less support for renters. The NSW Council of Social Services (NCOSS) said more could be done to help those in social housing and people that require affordable renting schemes. ""More households are doing it tough because of cost-of-living pressures and communities need more support, specifically around affordable housing,"" NCOSS CEO Joanna Quilty said. ""The affordable housing crisis was prevalent before the pandemic, COVID-19 has worsened it and it has also been exacerbated by an unholy trinity of flood, fire and drought."" Ms Quilty has called for an increase funding for the social services sector, above the one-off $50 million social sector support fund created at the height of the COVID-19 lockdowns. The government has committed $300 million to upgrade 15,800 social homes, but NCOSS said with 50,000 people on waitlists to enter social housing, the upgrades fall well short of what's needed.

50,live: NSW now: Police lay hundreds of charges in crackdown on knife crime,politics,"  Sydney news: NSW Police target increasing knife crime among young people Here's what you need to know this morning. Police have seized more than 110 knives, 21 firearms and charged 232 people as part of a statewide crackdown on knife-related crime. Operation Foil II took place from June 14 to June 18 to reduce the number of young people carrying knives in public, and prevent violent incidents that cause significant harm. The statewide operation involved highly-visible police patrols in high-risk locations, as well as Youth Command Officers visiting high schools to warn teens about the risks of carrying weapons. It follows an increase in the number of young people becoming both perpetrators and victims of knife-related offences in the past five years. Commissioner Karen Webb said the force was reminding young people about the impacts of having a dangerous weapon. ""Our intelligence shows that some young people are increasingly carrying sharp instruments for self-defence, but they don't fully understand the potentially fatal consequences that this can have,"" she said. ""When someone has a dangerous weapon in their possession, there is a much greater likelihood of a small-scale incident escalating into a fatal one."" One person has died in a fierce house fire that erupted this morning in the Blue Mountains. Superintendent Adam Newberry, from Fire and Rescue NSW, said crews were called to Regent Street, Katoomba about 5am after reports of a large blaze. Firefighters were told a person residing in the home was unaccounted-for but crews were unable to enter the property due to intense flames. It took an hour-and-a-half to control the fire, before a body was discovered on the second floor. Four trucks and 16 firefighters attended the scene this morning. Police and fire investigators are still establishing the cause of the blaze. NSW's five major integrity agencies, including the Independent Commission Against Corruption, are set to receive $440 million in extra funding in today's state budget. A government official said the money had been allocated after requests for more support. Other agencies to see increased funding in the next financial year are the NSW Electoral Commission, the Ombudsman, the Audit Office and the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission. The non-government sector is calling for the state government to index grants given to charities and other community groups that rely on funding to pay wages. From July 1, the national minimum wage will increase by $40 a week, which amounts to an increase of 5.2 per cent. NSW Council of Social Service chief executive Joanna Quilty said that, while the decision was most welcome, most sector organisations relied on grants from the state government to pay their workers. She said the money should be allocated in today's Budget so that there is certainty. ""It's a guessing game. We are never quite sure how much will flow through and it's absolutely vital that, this time around, it's adequate so services are able to meet that 5.2 per cent minimum wage increase,"" Ms Quilty said. A deadline extension has been granted for Western Sydney organisations applying for millions in government funding to create or improve local infrastructure. Applications for the WestInvest grants program has been extended until 5pm on July 25, 2022, with successful projects to be awarded in December 2022. So far, 15 councils and more than 1,000 organisations who submitted a registration of interest are eligible to apply for funding. Treasurer Matt Kean said some applicants had asked for more time to complete their applications for the ""once-in-a-generation opportunity"". Western Sydney Minister Stuart Ayres welcomed the extension. ""Allowing applicants more time will result in better applications and ensure that we are funding truly transformational projects for communities in Western Sydney,"" Mr Ayres said. A renewed White Bay Power Station could be the Harbour City's answer to London's Tate Modern — the UK's national arts collection — says NSW Cities Minister Rob Stokes. The 105-year-old site, located in Sydney's bays precinct, would be the centrepiece for a state government plan to redevelop the precinct. Treasurer Matt Kean says $49 million has been allocated to fund remediation work for the power station in today's state budget. ""This will allow government to restore and transform this important piece of NSW history on Sydney's harbour foreshore, removing lead and asbestos and making the building safe for future use,"" he said. Mr Stokes said remediation would take about two years. Place Management NSW has been tasked with examining feedback from a draft master plan exhibition and determining a process for the future use of the power station. ""The White Bay Power Station could be Sydney's answer to London's Tate Modern, only we have a much nicer harbour,"" Mr Stokes said. ""The restoration of this former [coal-fired] power station will power Sydney's most-anticipated urban renewal project in generations and spark enormous investment."" Partly cloudy.

51,"'The proof is in the pudding': Buy now, pay later companies hit by perfect storm as laws loom, interest rates and bad debts",politics,"  Buy now, pay later companies on the brink as bad debts and interest rates rise Buy now, pay later products such as Afterpay and Zip have become a popular payment method, but the sector is facing a perfect storm of rising interest rates, bad debts, a crowded marketplace and looming regulation. For businesses such as Daniel McCarthy's butcher shop in regional Victoria, offering customers the option to use a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service has resulted in sales growth. ""It has been pivotal for our online business,"" Mr McCarthy said. The payment method is used for about 60 per cent of online sales at his business, and customers are also using it at the shop. His customers who use it also spend more — an average of $140, compared to $30 using other payment types in store. ""People can buy a bulk pack and not actually shell out their money for it,"" he said. ""They can put it on a payment plan, and it just works with their budgets."" Buy now, pay later companies effectively buy a customer's debt in exchange for a merchant fee. The customer makes repayments to the BNPL company in instalments and the service is interest-free. Fees apply if repayments are missed and some companies also charge other account fees. However, while BNPL has been great for many retailers, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, some say the glory days are over for the sector. Start-ups — including Afterpay and Zip — once dominated the scene, but traditional banks such as CBA, Suncorp and NAB, along with Apple, are muscling in. ""You've seen a land grab where these businesses are spending a lot of money on sales and marketing to acquire new customers,"" UBS analyst Tom Beadle said. ""Those customers aren't necessarily good customers. ""In fact, you could almost argue that they self-select poor-quality customers. So what these businesses need to do is sort of focus on keeping those good customers that repay and obviously weeding out those [who] don't."" Zip Co's bad debt and expected losses quadrupled to $148.3 million in the six months to December, 2021, compared to the corresponding period for the previous year, according to the company's latest half-year results. Afterpay's expected credit loss was up 50 per cent, to $151.112 million, in the six months to December 31, according to the company's latest update to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Beadle said bad debts were rising because of pressure on household budgets. ""And with those bad debts rising, it then creates a circular effect because the buy, now pay later companies then tighten their lending standards,"" he said. ""So that then slows top-line growth further."" Bad debts as a percentage of Afterpay's outstanding consumer loans sit at 13.9 per cent, according to analysis by payments consultant Grant Halverson covering the 2021 calendar year. Zip's percentage sits at 9.7 per cent, followed by non-ASX-listed major players Klarna's (8.5 per cent) and Affirm's (6.5 per cent). In comparison, the Commonwealth Bank's arrears at 90 days for credit cards for the same period were 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent for personal loans, according to the data. Mr Halverson expects CBA's write-off rate at 180 days to be about half that. Australia's corporate watchdog says one in five consumers using buy now, pay later are missing payments. Inflation and rising interest rates are also hitting the sector hard in other ways, prompting mass job lay-offs in the industry. Market analyst Roger Montgomery has been a long-time critic of the sector and maintains it is a bad investment. ""As interest rates rise, in response to rising inflation, then of course what happens is your costs go up,"" Mr Montgomery said. ""So, the margin that you make on your book of loans declines and, at the same time, consumers spend less, so your revenue line is actually coming down. ""I call them profitless prosperity stocks."" Buy now, pay later stocks have tumbled in response to the many problems the sector is facing. On the Australian Stock Exchange, Afterpay is down 50 per cent from $176 to $84.33 since it merged with US pay giant Square at the start of the year. Afterpay's Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar have taken the group from zero to $39 billion in just six years. ""In my view, I think Afterpay would be lucky to be trading at $20 today if it were a standalone business,"" Mr Beadle said. Latitude and Humm's merger was abandoned as the companies' stocks sunk, down 40 per cent and 45 per cent respectively from a year ago. Zip Co's stocks plummeted 93 per cent, down from $8.21 to 53 cents in a year. It is planning to buy Sezzle, which has tumbled 96 per cent, from $8.24 to 30 cents. Despite Zip Co's share price falling off a cliff, Zip Co's chief operating officer, Peter Gray, is optimistic. ""Reports of our demise are greatly exaggerated,"" Mr Gray told ABC News. ""In March, we did take proactive steps to reduce our global-cost footprint. And we'll see the benefits of those in the [2023 financial year] as we accelerate our path to profitability."" Mr Montgomery said the end of cheap money meant some BNPL players would not survive. ""Some of these businesses will disappear and we'll never see them again,"" he said. ""That's a fact in this environment. There'll be no more funding for them."" The BNPL sector has so far managed to avoid regulation because its providers do not technically charge interest and there is a loophole in the National Credit Code. Some BNPL companies have signed up to a voluntary code of practice, which consumer advocates argue does not contain enough protections. Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones said that was about to change. ""[I'm] not interested in having an argument about whether or not this is credit. It clearly is,"" he said. ""Irrespective of how it's structured, it's credit."" Details of how BNPL products would be regulated would be worked out after consulting with the industry and consumer advocates, he said. Mr Jones said it could start with legislating the industry's code of practice and a strategic review to find out what the gaps were. 'We will ensure that by now, pay later is regulated as a form of credit,"" Mr Jones said. ""That doesn't mean that every single term of the national consumer credit legislation applies in exactly the same way. It won't. But it will be brought within the rubric of the National Consumer Credit Act."" He has pledged to get the legislation before parliament within 12 months. ""I don't want us having this conversation next year,"" Mr Jones said. Companies can just self-regulate, according to a Senate inquiry into fintech. The looming regulation of BNPL globally is another knock to the sector. Mr Gray said Zip remained supportive of fit-for-purpose regulation. ""The minister has suggested that the first steps would be legislation of the industry code, and it would sit as a component of the national credit act, rather than be subject to all the components of the act,"" Mr Gray said. ""We do believe that our services are credit [but] they don't need the same sort of regulation as might govern a mortgage. ""And, of course, we've seen that regulation of the banking sector does not necessarily deliver better outcomes. It's more about the product construct and the intent of the providers."" Consumer advocates — such as chief executive of the Financial Rights Legal Centre Karen Cox — said there was no reason for BNPL products not to be subject to the same rules as other forms of credit. ""The proof is in the pudding,"" Ms Cox said. ""There are so many people who are coming to us who have gotten in over their heads, and they've often gotten in very, very quickly."" ""So, whatever checks they are doing, it is not the same as doing proper, responsible lending checks as required under the credit law."" Michael Fredericks is the managing director and founder of FuPay, which offers a budgeting service along with BNPL and cash-advance products. He said the voluntary code did not provide enough consumer protections and he supported BNPL being regulated under the National Credit Code as it stands. Mr Fredericks said regulation would also allow BNPL players to extend repayment time frames that were shorter and, therefore, exempt them from credit laws. ""Some people struggle to make repayments within that time frame,"" he said. ""It's only really appropriate for a small amount of money, that [is] under the $200 mark. ""We think the balance is to have greater flexibility beyond that, which means you've got to be regulated but not to have open-ended credit … staying away from that debt trap or, we think, the bad credit model of credit cards."" Mr Fredericks said FuPay does not publish the percentage of bad debt from its sales because it was not a listed company. ""It's in the single digits, and it is declining,"" he said.

52,"'I thought I did the right thing': When Ashley awoke from a coma, she had to give up her children",politics,"  Child protection failed to act after alleged abuser found living in caravan on same property with kids, mother says In March 2020, Ashley* got a call from her mother saying she had something ""very terrible"" to tell her. Warning: This article contains content that some readers may find distressing. That conversation derailed her life. It all started about 12 years earlier, when Ashley went into a coma. Upon waking up, she was unable to walk and talk properly — and unable to support her children. Ashley agreed for her children to stay with her mother. ""I basically signed them over because child protection came in and said, 'If you don't, we're going to have to put them into foster care',"" she said. ""I thought I was doing the right thing with child protection and signing my kids over. It turns out I didn't do the right thing."" Ashley's health is not her only struggle. Her personal life has been marked by trauma. She suffered through domestic violence at the hands of her children's father in the early 2000s. She took the kids and left, but continued to struggle with her mental health, eventually attempting to take her own life. That is when her family first became known to the Tasmanian child safety authorities. When on top of her mental health issues she was eventually also diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, Ashley said she even found it easier to have her children living with her mother. For years, the arrangement seemed to work. Ashley got to regularly spend time with her children, who lived nearby. More than 700 people from around the country have come forward with concerns about Australia's failing child protection system. These are their shocking claims. Until one late evening, her mother called to make a disturbing admission — she had observed the oldest daughter perform a sexual act on her younger brother. ""When asked where she learned that behaviour, [she] replied 'pop',"" Ashley said. ""He raped her when she was eight. It was ongoing through the course of 10 years."" Ashley said her mother pleaded with her not to tell anyone. ""She had not informed the children's school, child safety or any of the children's doctors. I informed these organisations about what had happened,"" Ashley said. She said Tasmania Police took her daughter's statement, but because her daughter did not want to give evidence before the court, the matter was not pursued further. Ashley said because her mother had ""kicked"" her husband out, Tasmania's Department of Communities found there was no need for intervention. Months later, Ashley saw his car pull up her mother's driveway. ""I rang child protection again, and rang the police again, and then the children also confirmed that he's living in a caravan at the back of the house,"" she said. ""Child protection went out and did another assessment and said again, 'he's not at the house, there's no risk'."" If you have been in the system, cared for someone who has, or work in child protection, we want to hear about your experience. In an affidavit supplied to the police, Ashley wrote: ""I do not consider that [my mother] took steps to protect the children's' best interests and in fact took active steps to conceal this abuse. [He] remains living on the property. ""The children have all experienced mental health issues and behavioural issues and I do not believe these issues are being well managed."" Through court, Ashley has regained the parental rights of several of her children and will fight for the return of another once she is able to pay for legal representation. Former kids in state care and child protection workers say the cracks in Australia’s child safety system have become craters, as children are forced to stay with sexual predators and subjected to broken bones. She said a child safety officer from the Department of Communities had admitted to her that they had ""failed those children"". ""The kids, they need justice, and they need someone to really take a look at the child protection area and make some changes,"" Ashley said. The Department of Communities did not respond to questions relating to Ashley's case, but said in a statement it had processes in place to ""ensure that people who are approved to care for children are safe people"". ""This includes the mandatory requirement for all carers, household members and frequent visitors to the home to have a current working with vulnerable people registration,"" the department said. ""The department has processes in place to respond to allegations relating to the safety of children in out-of-home care. These responses include working alongside Tasmania Police in relation to allegations of child abuse."" The ABC yesterday revealed child protection departments across the country have for years failed children and families. More than 700 people across the country came forward as part of the investigation. More than 200 of them were current and former workers with intimate knowledge about how the system operates. Federal Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said he was concerned about the findings. ""I am deeply concerned by the horrific cases uncovered around the country of abuse of children in care,"" he said. Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth said she would join the Attorney-General and National Children's Commissioner Ann Hollonds in a meeting to ""ensure all children in care are safe and protected"". Ms Hollonds said the system was ""broken"" and ""desperately needs reform"". ""Really, this system, many, many people would argue that it's broken and really needs urgent attention,"" she said. ""We need to have national leadership for child wellbeing in order for children to be a national policy priority."" *Name has been changed for legal reasons. 1800 Respect, National counselling helpline: 1800 737 732 Bravehearts, counselling and support for survivors of child sexual abuse: 1800 272 831 Child Wise, counselling provider: 1800 991 099 Lifeline, 24-hour crisis support and suicide prevention: 13 11 14 Care Leavers Australia Network: 1800 008 774 PartnerSPEAK, peer support for non-offending partners: (03) 9018 7872 Find support services in your state or territory.

53,analysis: The West must not forget the 20th century's hard-learned lessons of war,politics,"  A large-scale, brutal conflict of the kind that many assumed lay in the past but no longer in the future has been witnessed by governments, military organisations and the public at large in the 116 days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is important to learn from this because it is possible that other massed attrition-style wars may occur in our near future. This is something that democracies have dealt with before yet we have, unfortunately, forgotten many of the hard-learned lessons of the 20th century. Perhaps one of the most important lessons to have been forgotten is that a vital part of any national deterrent is the capacity to design and produce the artefacts of war – weapons, ammunition and trained humans – in large quantities. In the wake of the Cold War, and the draw down on military spending, military forces were downsized (reducing demand), and militaries engaged in operations that only had short periods of high intensity combat. As a consequence, most military organisations lost the institutional memory of industrial scale activities. In an essay this week, former US Army officer Alex Vershinin explored the issue of ammunition shortages, particularly for artillery, in the Russo-Ukraine War. His findings make sobering reading. This isn't just because of the huge increase in artillery ammunition that will be needed for the Ukrainians to sustain their defence against Russia. It is because this is also an issue that applies to many other aspects of contemporary military institutions beyond ammunition production. There are three key aspects requiring attention to ensure countries like Australia, the United States and others are able to sustain their militaries in wars that may last more than several days. One area is equipment. As seen in Ukraine, war is expensive in consuming equipment. In war, tanks, trucks, artillery, weapons and even personal protective equipment are destroyed by the enemy, in accidents or it just wears out. This can occur in large quantities — and it has in Ukraine. Even if the Ukrainian updates on Russian losses overestimate the destruction of Russian equipment by 100 per cent, that is still 700 tanks and more than 1000 other armoured vehicles destroyed in four months. Contrast this with the US tank production which currently sits at about 130 per year. Despite the barbarity of the Russians and the suffering of the Ukrainian people, the war has been a tragic opportunity for governments and military institutions to learn crucial lessons. The most heartbreaking of all is that theories about the decline of war are obsolete. Therefore, an important component of strategies that prepare military forces for 21st century conflict must be the scaling up national capacity to build large numbers of complex modern weapon systems. Tanks and trucks, artillery and helicopters are expensive and are currently produced in limited numbers. The problem is magnified for ships and aircraft which are produced at a limited number of shipyards and factories. Because of the huge cost and time in building these systems, we will see the greater use of smaller, cheaper autonomous systems. Necessity will drive this in even the most conservative and risk adverse military cultures. But they cannot fully replace tanks, ships and aircraft. We will still need to produce these as well. A second area requiring attention to build more sustainable forces is infrastructure. This is an often-overlooked element of building military capability. Militaries need infrastructure such as bases (where they live and store equipment), jetties and ports, airfields and fuel farms, logistics bases, transport hubs, and training areas. Currently, most western military forces have scaled their infrastructure for their ""force in being"". Bases are sized and supported for a known number of occupants, with minimal expansion capacity. Consequently, any expansion to larger military forces for a large-scale future threat must consider expanded infrastructure. Finally, Western military institutions must review their personnel policies. The central capability of any good military institution is its people. This includes recruiting (or conscription), training, education, experience, leadership, personnel policies, pay and conditions. Unfortunately, wars are expensive in people. Since the end of the Cold War, most military institutions have moved to smaller all-volunteer forces. These smaller forces are trained and educated to a very high level, regardless of their speciality. However, the exquisite training and education systems we have developed in the last three decades are unlikely to scale up if we need to undertake a significant expansion in the size of military forces. The throughput of current training institutions is designed to fill the force in being, not a much larger institution. And systems such as Australia's would not cope with the need to replace hundreds of casualties each day. Additionally, the length of many military courses, which is suitable for peace time, will be too long for expanded organisations. A shift to industrial scale warfare requires a different approach to training and education. One that has a massively increased throughput capacity, and one that focuses just on combat needs. A key trend in 21st century conflict is that ""mass is back"". As I wrote in my book War Transformed, this ""involves large-scale conventional forces, the massed use of autonomous systems, and the wide-scale use of the tools of influence, including sophisticated algorithms."" We are seeing this play out daily in Ukraine. As Vershinin describes, there is much we can learn from the war in Ukraine. But to demonstrate we have learned about war on the industrial scale, Western military institutions will also have to act. They will need to convince their civilian masters of the need to invest in the capacity to build military forces and employ them at industrial scale. Mick Ryan is a strategist and recently retired Australian Army major general. He served in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan, and as a strategist on the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff.

54,Imran Khan is rallying support for a return to the Pakistani prime ministership,politics,"  Imran Khan wants rule of law and an Islamic welfare state in Pakistan Pakistan's ousted prime minister, Imran Khan says the people of Pakistan believe even a poor democracy would be better than a military government. He spoke with ABC's India Now! Host Marc Fennell as he continues to rally grassroots support to demand new elections. Protests have continued in Pakistan among supporters of the deposed prime minister, as the country also faces the serious challenges of rising inflation as well as soaring fuel and food prices. Mr Khan was ousted as prime minister on April 10 following a no-confidence vote. He's since alleged this was part of a conspiracy, pushed by the United States administration because it was unhappy with his foreign policy decisions. Yet there were claims that he'd lost crucial military support. Since then, he's campaigned publicly to be returned to the Prime Minister's Office in Pakistan. ""I think there's consensus in the country that even a poor democratic government is better than a military government,"" Mr Khan told India Now! ""Because, when the military intervention takes place, we go back to square one."" ""So that's why our democracy has not flourished as yet, our democratic institutions haven't got stronger, because we go back to square one when the military takes over."" Elected in July, 2018, Mr Khan promised to fight corruption and fix the economy. He maintains his government was balancing rising prices and economic sentiment. However, as the cost of living in Pakistan rose, the opposition parties blamed him and the no-confidence motion followed. His successors claim that the economic woes faced by Pakistan are his legacy. He insisted the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and commodity prices worldwide were being managed, but the regime change sent the markets into meltdown. No prime minister has completed a full term of office in Pakistan. Mr Khan says his departure was different because it didn't occur under the shroud of corruption. He argues that Pakistan has been ruled by the military for most of its history, its importance was enhanced by the threat posed by India, and two families — the Bhutto and Sharif families. ""These two families have been ruling Pakistan for 30 years — now, the parties that were fighting have joined hands and are in government."" Mr Khan was replaced in April by Shehbaz Sharif, the younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was convicted in 2018 of having owned assets beyond his income. ""My government was replaced by a government where 60 per cent of the cabinet is on bail,"" Mr Khan says. ""Rather than having a roadmap to fix the economy, all they're doing is trying to get rid of the corruption cases of billions of rupees."" Mr Khan claims he has evidence that the United States demanded change. He alleges that, on March 7, 2022, US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, Donald Lu, sent a message to him through Pakistan's ambassador to the US, Asad Majeed Khan: ""If I'm removed, then all will be forgiven."" ""Now there is this American official, threatening our ambassador,"" Mr Khan says. He's asked for an inquiry into his allegations that the US has participated in regime change. ""There is no truth to these allegations,"" a US State Department spokesman said in April after he first made the claim. Mr Khan does not want any foreign interference in Pakistan. ""I don't want any support from foreign governments to get into power,"" Mr Khan says. ""Let the people of Pakistan decide whoever they think is best to rule or govern the country."" When asked this question by the India Now! host, Mr Khan replied: ""Because, Marc, this is insulting for a country of 220 million people that an elected prime minister is removed by this conspiracy."" Mr Khan argued his policies on Afghanistan, Russian and China had upset Washington — he was in Moscow the day Putin's troops crossed the border. He says he was there to negotiate wheat and oil supplies and, while the timing was bad, he didn't know what was about to occur. He's also been dubbed ""Taliban Khan"" for his perceived support for the Taliban. He insists the Taliban are a religious fundamentalist group, not terrorists. ""You know, somehow, we were made to be sort of friendly with Taliban, or sympathetic with them,"" Mr Khan explains. ""People like us are sympathetic with the people of Afghanistan and, right now, you have Taliban as a reality. ""The world should work with them, because there is no other reality in Afghanistan now."" On an episode of India Now!, that country's High Commissioner to Australia, Manpreet Vohra, said relations between India and Pakistan were strained because of Pakistan's support for terror organisations in the region. Mr Khan rejects this and says Kashmir is the sticking point in the relationship — that is, he says, the denial of the Indian government for the Kashmiri people to determine their own future. ""India blames every incident that takes place in Kashmir on Pakistan,"" he explains. ""The answer is not blaming Pakistan. The answer is to give the people of Kashmir the right to decide their own future."" Imran Khan maintains the rule of law and an Islamic welfare state are the future of Pakistan he'd like to see. ""When I first went to England as a teenager, the two things that inspired me were the rule of law, and a welfare state,"" he says. ""When I studied my own history, the first welfare state in the history of mankind was made by The Prophet Muhammad … this is what I want.""

55,NSW Premier goes ahead with stamp duty reform as first home buyers allowed to opt out,politics,"  NSW Premier goes ahead with stamp duty reform as first home buyers allowed to opt out NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet is embarking on his long-touted stamp duty reform, by offering some first home buyers the choice of making the up-front payment or opting into an annual property tax. The choice will be made available to first-time buyers purchasing a home up to the value of $1.5 million and will be announced during today's state budget. If buyers decide to opt out of paying stamp duty, they will pay $400 plus 0.3 per cent of the land value per year. Mr Perrottet has argued that stamp duty was an impediment for young people to getting into the market. ""We want to lower the barriers to owning a home for first home buyers seeking a place of their own,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""Lifting home ownership is part of this government's efforts and ambition to help families who are feeling the squeeze."" If a buyer decides to pay the annual property tax, that property is not locked into the scheme when it is sold. As interest rates rise, Sydney house prices are dropping and experts say it is a ""bellwether"" for what is about to happen across the rest of the country. The state government has allocated $728 million in today's state budget over the next four years, as part of its housing affordability package, to cover the shortfall of revenue. ""It will mean more NSW residents will get into their first home at an earlier age and achieve the great Australian dream of home ownership,"" NSW Treasurer Matt Kean said. The stamp duty announcement falls short of the reform Mr Perrottet has been pushing since he was treasurer. He wanted 80 per cent of homes across the state to have the option of paying an annual land tax, and buyers would be eligible regardless of whether they were purchasing their first home. But the Premier has previously conceded such large-scale reform couldn't be achieved without the help of the Commonwealth because of the loss of government revenue which is estimated to be about $2.5 billion per year. Mr Perrottet has blamed the past Coalition government for failing to support the reform, while the new Labor government has flagged a willingness to tackle housing affordability. NSW Labor has stated its opposition to the move from stamp duty to a land tax. ""Dominic Perrottet has no mandate to charge families an annual land tax on their family home that will last forever,"" Shadow Treasurer Daniel Mookhey said yesterday. The state government plans to introduce legislation later this year, so that the new first home buyer scheme can start from January 16, 2023. The current stamp duty exemption for properties purchased by first home buyers that are less than $650,000 will remain in place. The stamp duty for first home buyers purchasing properties between $650,000 and $800,000 will continue to be reduced. The government says 55,000 people a year should be able to benefit from its first home buyers schemes.

56,Assange's brother urges Albanese to publicly condemn US extradition,politics,"  Julian Assange's brother urges Anthony Albanese to publicly condemn US extradition Friends and family of Julian Assange are urging Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to publicly call for the WikiLeaks co-founder's extradition to the United States on espionage charges to be stopped. British Home Secretary Priti Patel gave the green light at the weekend for Mr Assange to be sent to America, where he faces 18 charges related to his role in publishing classified cables and sensitive military material from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. 7.30 has been told the federal government has raised the Australian citizen's plight behind the scenes with our close allies, and senior ministers have said publicly they won't conduct diplomacy via ""megaphone"". But some of Mr Assange's closest allies fear quiet, behind-the-scenes representations to the US and UK might not be enough. They claim there is a serious chance Mr Assange could be on a plane within weeks and are urging the PM to now make a public statement, clearly expressing Australia's displeasure. ""There will be some diplomacy behind the scenes, but publicly just make the position clear,"" Gabriel Shipton, Mr Assange's brother, urged Mr Albanese. ""Be clear what the Australian people are asking you to do, which is to bring Julian home. ""It puts them in a position where they have to say no to a strategic ally. I don't really see the Biden Administration turning around and saying no to one of its most strategic allies at this time."" Last year, Mr Albanese said he failed to see what purpose was being served by the ongoing incarceration of Mr Assange. ""There's been a heavy price paid,"" the then-opposition leader said. ""Now, I don't agree with a whole range of Julian Assange's views but there needs to be a point at which you say that enough is enough,"" he added. On Monday, Mr Albanese declared he stood by his previous comments but did not repeat them. ""I'll make this point as well. There are some people who think that if you put things in capital letters on Twitter and put an exclamation mark that somehow makes it more important. It doesn't,"" he said. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie has long advocated for the release of the WikiLeaks co-founder and believes support for him has grown substantially in the federal parliament. He said the PM could rely on significant, cross-party support, if he does make a public statement. ""We've run out of time for polite backchannels and diplomatic manoeuvres. What we need now is the strongest possible action by the Australian government,"" Mr Wilkie said. ""I'm in no doubt if Anthony Albanese was to make a strong comment... it would make a difference. ""Now more than ever the Australian government has to stop mincing its words, hiding behind every excuse and take action."" Mr Assange's lawyers plan to appeal the UK Home Secretary's extradition decision within the next two weeks. Mr Assange's lawyers have always maintained he is a journalist, or publisher, who is being persecuted by America for embarrassing it by exposing military wrongdoing. But the US Justice Department accuses him of being involved in illegal hacking and helping Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst, get the classified information. There are a variety of views with the federal Labor Party about Mr Assange's plight and what should be done. Backbencher Julian Hill labelled the extradition ""appalling"". ""[Chelsea] Manning, who leaked classified material exposing US war crimes, has been pardoned, yet Assange who published it (a journalistic activity) is facing an effective death sentence,"" he wrote in a tweet. However, Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles is among a group of MPs who seem less interested in intervening. In a statement, a spokeswoman said ""this is a matter for the United Kingdom"", adding that Mr Assange could expect consular assistance like other Australians facing legal proceedings abroad. Some Labor MPs dislike Mr Assange because he published unredacted documents. The US has long said that put some of its secret sources at risk. Other MPs don't like that he fled to the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault allegations, an investigation that was discontinued several years ago. Some share similar views to Democrat politicians in the United States. They suspect he damaged Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign when he published emails from the Democratic Party and her campaign chairman ahead of the 2016 election, which was ultimately won by Donald Trump. ""This case is not about the 2016 publications,"" Jennifer Robinson, one of Mr Assange's lawyers, explained. ""It is not in any way part of this case, so whatever your political views are... it is not the reason for which Julian faces his whole life in a US prison."" There has been a persistent campaign by Mr Assange's supporters to lobby politicians about his case. A few MPs told 7.30 they have received a large number of phone calls since the federal election. But in recent months, the Wikileaks cofounder has also received the backing of high-profile Australians outside politics. ""I might not agree with Assange and everything that he and Wikileaks have done in the past but I don't think he is a spy,"" said Kylie Moore-Gilbert, an academic and author who was detained in Iran, falsely accused of espionage. She said being imprisoned with no clear end date is akin to torture and takes an enormous mental toll. ""If you're just being kept in such conditions with no hope of a reprieve and no end in sight, no light at the end of the tunnel, that's part of the torture,"" she said. ""You despair, you give up, perhaps you self-harm, perhaps you want to end it all and, you know, kill yourself. ""Reports about Assange suggest he is in that place right now. It is very, very disturbing to me."" Watch this story on 7.30 on ABC iview.

57,Perth to get southern hemisphere's largest surf park — complete with 'beast mode',politics,"  Perth to get southern hemisphere's largest surf park after lease agreement signed The largest surf park in the southern hemisphere with 150-metre-long waves and the potential for ""beast mode"" surf will be built in Perth with special government assistance to guide it through the regulatory process. Planning Minister Rita Saffioti was adamant that even though the wave park — on state government land next to Kwinana Freeway in Cockburn — had been given ""state significant project"" status, there would still be rigorous environmental and other assessments. The state government and project proponent Aventuur have signed a 21-year lease agreement for the project, with the option to extend it for another 20 years. Ms Saffioti and Aventuur said the park would provide consistent and quality waves for the almost 300,000 wave-starved surfers who contend with often ""awful"" surf in the metropolitan area, and also be a significant drawcard for interstate and international visitors. Aventuur confirmed the price had blown out by $20 million to $100 million, to be funded by private equity, because of higher construction costs. It also confirmed the timeline for it to open to the public with surfable waves had been pushed back by six months to early 2025. The company was announced as the developer and operator in September last year after a competitive tender, with UrbnSurf, which built the Melbourne wave pool, also in competition for the Perth site. UrbnSurf had initially planned to build a $30 million surf pool on parkland at the riverside suburb of Alfred Cove, south of Perth's CBD. But that met with intense opposition from parts of the local community, and in March 2019 the WA Government rejected a request to hand over Crown land for the project. A little over a year later, the founder of UrbnSurf Andrew Ross left the company and joined Aventuur, which has also now won the rights to the ""Wavegarden"" technology which powers the Melbourne wave pool. Mr Ross, the chairman of Aventuur,  today described signing of the lease agreement for the surf park as a ""major milestone"" for Aventuur's project. ""Surfing's deeply ingrained in the Perth culture,"" he said. ""But to be a Perth surfer is actually a very challenging career choice. ""We often have pretty awful waves, conditions of lull, we have very busy line-ups when the waves are good. We also have obviously marine hazards which float up and down the coast from time to time. ""So the Perth surf park will be a a game changer in that respect allowing perfect waves for everyone from absolute beginners, all the way through to professional surfers."" Mr Ross presented Ms Saffioti with a custom-made, locally-shaped twin fin surfboard, which she promised to one day ride. Ms Saffioti said that state significant project status meant government agencies would work with Aventuur to support and ""guide"" it through the regulatory approvals. But she stressed no environmental or other corners would be cut and it would be a ""rigorous"" process."" ""This agreement for lease now allows the company to seek and receive developmental approval, it will also help them in respect to their financing and that lease will come into play once that surf park is actually built,"" Ms Saffioti said. The wave park will also have food outlets, a beach club and an entertainment hub. There will be a choice in wave size and intensity from small beginner surf to hollow, barrelling two-metre advanced waves, with ""beast mode"" the most challenging and dangerous level. The waves are created by 56 pistons, equal to a wave park in South Korea, which push out water into either side of a pier in a fan shape for rides up to 150 metres and 18 seconds long. The Melbourne wave park has 46 pistons and will be 30-40 metres shorter. Mr Ross said in ""beast mode"" the last 15-20 pistons push out water all at once, creating a powerful wedge of water with a big, deep barrel. He compared it to an infamous, and much, much larger wave off WA's south coast called ""The Right"", pointing out he had split his lip surfing in ""beast mode"". But at the same time, Mr Ross assured the wave pool would be safe and, unlike surfing a remote surf spot, there was medical help at hand. He explained the wave pool used the same amount of water as for three holes at a golf course per year, which would need to be topped up for evaporation, especially in summer. Prices for a one-hour session would likely range from $50 to $120, for the beast mode. Aventuur hopes to be granted developmental approval in the next couple of months, with the first waves pumping through by the end of 2024 and open to the general public in early 2025. It estimates the wave park will attract 300,000 visitors annually and contribute $250 million to the state economy over the life of the project.

58,Labor candidate Fatima Payman claims sixth WA Senate seat,politics,"  Fatima Payman claims sixth WA Senate seat for Labor as Michaelia Cash reinstated Fatima Payman will become the first Muslim woman who wears a hijab to sit in Australia’s Parliament. She claimed WA’s sixth Senate seat, which changed hands to Labor, as the election of the state’s six upper house positions that were up for grabs was finalised on Monday. Michaelia Cash and Dean Smith both retained their positions for the Liberals, as well as Greens Senator Dorinda Cox. Labor senators Sue Lines and Glenn Sterle were also returned, with Ms Payman taking the sixth spot. Liberal Ben Small, who was appointed to replace Mathias Cormann when he retired from federal politics, lost his bid to return to the Senate. The results mean there will be an equal number of Labor and Liberal Senators from WA, with five each, as well as two from the Greens. Just over a third of West Australians put Labor as their first preference in the Senate – a swing of 6.92 per cent. That is less than the roughly 10 per cent swing towards Labor seen across the state in the lower house. But there was a much greater swing away from the Liberals, with the party losing 9.24 per cent of first preferences to sit on 31.67 per cent. They were followed by the Greens on 14.26 per cent, up 2.45 per cent, and One Nation on 3.49 per cent, down 2.39 per cent. Speaking to the media on Monday afternoon, Ms Payman said she was ""honoured and privileged"" to be elected to her new role. ""Before I'm an Afghan or a Muslim I'm an Australian Labor Senator, representing all Australians regardless of their faith, background, cultural identity or sexual orientation, age or ability,"" she said. ""I'll be representing all, including our First Nations people as well."" At 27, she is the third youngest Senator in history. Ms Payman said her priorities included getting more people from diverse backgrounds involved in politics, improving early childhood education, and climate change. But she also hoped her election would help normalise the idea of wearing a hijab. ""Not only because Islamaphobia has been rife in the media, but I want young girls who do decide to wear the hijab to actually do it with pride, do it knowing that they've got all the right to be wearing it,"" she said. Ms Payman came to Australia as an eight-year-old, having fled Afghanistan with her family. She has previously paid tribute to her father, who died in 2018 after a battle with leukemia. ""My story goes back to 1999, when my father jumped on a boat, travelled the Indian Ocean to find a better life for his three children and his wife,"" she told ABC Radio Perth at the time.

59,Robodebt-linked DFAT boss set to lose job in bureaucratic shake-up,politics,"  Bureaucratic shake-up likely to see Jan Adams replace Kathryn Campbell as Foreign Affairs and Trade boss Bureaucrats in Canberra are expecting a shake-up of top jobs, with the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) expected to be replaced due to her role in the robodebt scandal. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is expected to appoint several new secretaries to run key government departments in the coming days. Australia's ambassador to Japan, Jan Adams, is the leading candidate to become the nation's top diplomat as the next secretary of DFAT. The head of the Defence Department, Greg Moriarty, had been tipped to take on the role, but it is understood Defence Minister Richard Marles would prefer him to stay in his current role. The current secretary of DFAT, Kathryn Campbell, has only been in the job for a year, having been appointed by the former Coalition government in July 2021. But Labor was unimpressed with her appointment at the time, given she oversaw the rollout of the controversial robodebt program as the secretary of the Department of Social Services. Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong has previously indicated she would prefer DFAT to be led by someone with a diplomatic background. A shift to lead a smaller department has been mooted as an alternative role for Ms Campbell. Prior to being stationed in Tokyo, Ms Adams served as Australia's ambassador to China and she has an extensive background in trade and international environmental policy. She recently accompanied Senator Wong at a meeting of the Quad in Japan, just days after the Albanese government was elected to power. The pair worked closely together when Labor was last in power. Senator Wong was the climate change minister and Ms Adam was Australia's ambassador for climate change as the then-Rudd government pushed for a more ambitious approach to global emissions reductions at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009. Mr Albanese is also expected to announce new heads of the Department of Finance and the Department of Health, with the incumbents, Rosemary Huxtable and Brendan Murphy, retiring. Recruitment for someone to lead the newly formed super department covering climate change, energy, the environment and water has also been underway. The new appointments are expected to be confirmed in a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Mr Albanese has already appointed Glyn Davis, the former vice-chancellor of University of Melbourne, to head the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

60,'It feels good': Remote football team plays first game in two years with COVID travel restrictions lifted at last,politics,"  On a red dirt field with only sparse patches of green, the Bidyadanga Emus have pulled on their footy boots at the team's home ground for the first time in two seasons. Access restrictions into remote Aboriginal communities, imposed at the start of the pandemic to limit the spread of COVID-19, were lifted last week. The easing of the travel ban means sport and cultural activities can return to normal in communities because visitors can now enter for non-essential reasons — and one of those is football. At a smoking ceremony marking the start of play, elder Angelina Nanudie was excited to celebrate the return of football to Karajarri country at Bidyadanga, around a two-hour drive south of Broome. ""I'm welcoming the Cable Beach mob to play in my country,"" she said. ""What we're doing is getting the scent of the grass so that people can have that smell and be safe. ""This is our first home game after the COVID … it feels good."" In the Kimberley — a region where Australian rules football is often likened to religion — the ability to host home games again has breathed life back into communities that have been largely closed off to the world. Women's coach Michael Martin said the return of home games brought the whole community together after a long period of uncertainty. ""Football is always number one on the calendar,"" he said. ""It's just given people a chance to forget about all that [COVID-19] and come down and support their team and have fun. ""It's also an opportunity for men and women now to represent their communities."" The restrictions, which were imposed by the state government, had required visitors to secure police approvals to enter more than 200 communities between the Goldfields and the Kimberley. While state-level restrictions have eased, individual communities can still choose to apply their own restrictions about who can enter and why. Mick Albert from the Cable Beach Greenbacks said his side was happy to make the last-minute trip from Broome, as teams in the West Kimberley Football League reverted to pre-pandemic fixtures. ""We had to scramble now the community has opened up during the week,"" he said. ""We were still unsure if we were coming down to play. ""We had to check who had cars and who had spots available and do RAT tests as well."" Community nurse Latham Rogers took it upon himself to pick up elders from around the community and bring them to the oval to ensure they didn't miss the big match. It's something he's done for eight years, but he says Saturday's game held particular significance. ""We're making sure we are looking after the oldies in the community, bringing them down and letting them be part of the atmosphere, watching the young people play sport,"" he says. ""Often the oldies wouldn't have the opportunity to come down to watch the games and would stay at home."" Mr Rogers prepared plates of fresh healthy food and served tea and coffee to elders throughout the game. ""Whether it's a barbecue, sandwiches, fresh fruit, baking, we provide all of that here,"" he said. ""That's just part of our goodwill to the community. ""It's also an opportunity to talk to our older community about making sure their vaccinations are up to date, whether they've had COVID, so it's a bit of a health talk as well."" Elder Joseph Munroe, who once played for the Bidyadanga men's side, enjoyed a sandwich as he watched the game from a fold-out chair under the shade of a tree. ""It [the team] is … the heart and soul for years, always will be, always was,"" he said. ""It's a nice feeling watching them play … really proud."" Mr Munroe was pleased to be back cheering from the sidelines on home soil after so many away games he couldn't attend during the pandemic. ""It was really hard for us not to travel to Broome, staying here in Bidyi, I was waiting until this COVID-19 went away to watch them play here on their home ground and in Broome,"" he said.

61,"'I am deeply concerned': Attorney-General, minister react to 'horrific' findings of ABC's child protection investigation",politics,"  Attorney-General, minister 'deeply concerned' by 'horrific' findings of ABC's child protection investigation Federal Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus and Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth say they are ""extremely concerned"" by the findings of a nationwide ABC investigation that revealed children were being raped and neglected in government care. Mr Dreyfus and Ms Rishworth said they had contacted the National Children's Commissioner to see what action could be taken to protect children in care. More than 700 people came forward as part of the investigation into child protection, revealing some children were at risk of more harm in care than before. More than 200 of those were current and former child protection workers with intimate knowledge about how the system operates. Some alleged departmental misconduct and manipulation of statistics about children in care. National Children's Commissioner Anne Hollonds has also reacted to the investigation, saying the system was ""really struggling"" with its purpose to protect children and ""desperately needs reform"". ""Really, this system, many, many people would argue that it’s broken and really needs urgent attention,"" she said. ""It's shocking how commonly one hears these stories. ""These are the most vulnerable children in this country and they've been removed from their families for their own safety and then unfortunately we find that they have been abused or harmed in various ways within the system that was meant to be protecting them. ""And, again, this is a sign that this system desperately needs reform."" More than 700 people from around the country have come forward with concerns about Australia's failing child protection system. These are their shocking claims. She has called for national leadership on the issue. ""We need to have national leadership for child wellbeing in order for children to be a national policy priority,"" Ms Hollonds said. ""When it comes to specific child protection departments and systems, there needs to be very clear accountabilities that they have for ensuring the wellbeing of the children that are in their care."" Mr Dreyfus said he had heard the commissioner's concerns. ""I am deeply concerned by the horrific cases uncovered around the country of abuse of children in care,"" he said. ""I have contacted the National Children’s Commissioner and will be talking with her about her concerns and what action we can all take to protect children in care."" Ms Rishworth said families deserved to have access to ""well-integrated"" services. ""The matters raised about the abuse of children in care are extremely concerning,"" she said. ""I will join the Attorney-General and National Children's Commissioner in a meeting to ensure all children in care are safe and protected."" The Assistant Minister for Indigenous Affairs, senator Malarndirri McCarthy, said she ""sadly"" had not been surprised by the revelations. ""I think that's the biggest disappointment here, that this isn't new,"" she said. ""There are families across this country who have known this for a very long time. There is more that has to be done."" She said in her new role she would investigate what could be done to protect Indigenous children. In a statement, peak Indigenous body SNAICC said it was clear the system did not protect children, and instead ""it causes further harm"". ""Governments know what the solutions are to keep children safe. But there seems to be no real will to implement them,"" it said. Tasmania's Women and Disability Services Minister Jo Palmer said the stories were heartbreaking. ""All of us felt our stomachs just sink, when we hear some of the stories that have come out of that [ABC] investigation,"" she said. ""They're uncomfortable stories they break our hearts and we know that more work has to be done in this space. ""We have failed children. Our premier has come out and said that we know that that has happened in the past, and now we've got to move forward and make sure where we did fail in the past we won't fail in the future. If you have been in the system, cared for someone who has, or work in child protection, we want to hear about your experience. ""This has to be a whole-of-community effort to find these solutions, all levels of government, all parts of our community."" New South Wales Minister for Women's Safety, Natalie Ward, said it was ""dreadful to hear these stories"". ""My heart goes out to those families,"" she said. ""We will always address these issues absolutely head-on and I welcome a very thorough investigation into those allegations. ""It is important that the police do their job and that those victim-survivors are well supported in their journey."" Asked what his newly-elected government was planning to do, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his ministers had been sworn in less than two weeks ago. ""We will deal with the range of issues we're confronting,"" he said. ""One of the things that we find, frankly, is that we inherit a trillion dollars in debt, we inherit crises in a range of areas because of neglect — in some cases wilful neglect, in other cases just incompetence."" Ms Hollonds was a child protection worker in the 1980s. She said while efforts had been made since then to try to address the needs of Indigenous children and families, the progress had been too slow. ""It's quite shocking to me to find, 40 years later, that relatively little has changed,"" she said. ""[The child protection] system is really overwhelmed because the other systems are desperately in need of reform, and by this I mean the early intervention systems. ""Struggling families, families in poverty, kids living with disadvantage — I hear from them directly that they're unable to get the help they need when they need it, and things just escalate and become worse."" Ms Hollonds said her office had gone through child welfare reports published over the past 10 years and found many of the 2,500 recommendations made over the decade kept recurring, pointing to the lack of implementation. ""What was remarkable about those recommendations is how often they are repeated across different reports, which really underscores the strength of the findings,"" she said. ""We've got this weight of evidence that's sitting there, the problem is it's not being implemented. ""We need to investigate what are the barriers to implementing the evidence."" 1800 Respect, National counselling helpline: 1800 737 732 Bravehearts, counselling and support for survivors of child sexual abuse: 1800 272 831 Child Wise, counselling provider: 1800 991 099 Lifeline, 24-hour crisis support and suicide prevention: 13 11 14 Care Leavers Australia Network: 1800 008 774 PartnerSPEAK, peer support for non-offending partners: (03) 9018 7872 Find support services in your state or territory.

62,'It's failing the community of South Australia': Union calls for policing model overhaul,politics,"  Police staffing shortages reach boiling point as union calls for recruitment system review South Australia's police union is calling for an overhaul of the state's policing model, amid growing concerns about a lack of staff to respond to crime. Police Association of South Australia president Mark Carroll said there is not enough staff for the district policing model to work effectively. ""For more than 12 months now we have been telling commissioner Grant Stevens that his district policing model is failing,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""It's failing front line officers and investigators and it's failing the community of South Australia."" Mr Carroll said the model breaks officers into two groups, with one group responsible for responding to calls for assistance and the other larger group tasked with tracking down offenders, targeting crime spots and trying to reduce crime. ""It's very labour intensive ... we just don't have enough people on the ground to do that and we never have had,"" he said. He said officers are ""burnt out"" and want the teams to be combined. ""They are all uniform officers they should not be split up,"" Mr Carroll said. ""This is what members of the ground with decades of experience are telling us."" Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said the district policing model had not been properly tested yet as its second stage was implemented four days before the emergency declaration for COVID-19 came into action in March 2020. The declaration resulted in hundreds of police officers being deployed from their regular roles to COVID-related duties. Commissioner Stevens said it was not an appropriate time for the model to be quashed. ""I will be the first one to put my hand up if we believe the model doesn't work once it's been properly tested,"" he said. ""For it to be properly assessed and for anyone to suggest that it's failed first requires for it to be properly implemented and to do that we need people. ""We are getting to the point where we don't have police officers on COVID roles anymore but we are still impacted by COVID. ""We are struggling like every other police force in Australia to recruit sufficient people to keep up with attrition."" The union has also called for the state's police recruiting system to be reviewed. Mr Carroll said SA Police needed to recruit 90 officers, with another 120 regularly off-duty due to COVID. ""We find it a staggering indictment on SAPOL's recruiting systems that in a state of a million and a half people, we can't get 90 people to fill the recruit courses,"" he said. Commissioner Stevens said SA Police was doing what it could to try and recruit more people to fill positions. ""That's just a harsh reality that we are all dealing with,"" he said. ""We are struggling to maintain numbers and we are looking at the reasons for that."" Delegates from the union are planning to meet on Wednesday to further discuss the matter. Shadow Police Minister Tim Whetstone said the police shortages coincided with an ""enormous jump"" in crime, with more than 5,100 extra crimes committed during April. ""We are seeing crime rates jump in South Australia, but Labor isn't boosting SAPOL's resources to match that concerning trend,"" he said. Mr Whetstone said the government had cut $23.6 million from the budget to retain more than 168 protective security officers (PSOs) past next year. ""We see a double whammy with less security officers, less police officers, and now [with the lost] … opportunity with three cancelled cadet intakes, we are going to see a critical shortage of police on our streets,"" he said. But Police Minister Joe Szakacs said the PSO recruitment was a temporary boost provided during the pandemic. ""What this government is undertaking is a much more forward-looking body of work regarding police resourcing,"" he said. ""A premier's task force is being convened. This is an election commitment we are delivering that will be hearing from police and experts regarding resourcing — not just for this term of government, but for the next two, three and four years. ""The protective service officers is an option that we are looking at."" ""We will have recommendations out of the premier's task force well and truly before those contracts are up.""

63,'Perrottet's captain's pick': Barilaro's US job at centre of parliamentary inquiry,politics,"  NSW upper house inquiry to probe John Barilaro's appointment as trade commissioner to US The appointment of former NSW deputy premier John Barilaro as the state's trade commissioner to the US will be investigated by a parliamentary inquiry. His new job as trade commissioner was announced on Friday and is among six trade posts around the world tasked with spruiking the state's investment opportunities and local businesses. Premier Dominic Perrottet said Mr Barilaro's appointment was the result of a ""rigorous talent search"" by a global recruitment firm. Mr Barilaro, who resigned late last year just days after former premier Gladys Berejiklian, played a role in setting up the international trade initiative Global NSW. Opposition Leader Chris Minns said an upper house inquiry would now look into the decision, which he has described as a ""$400,000-a-year job for a friend"". ""This represents everything that's wrong with the NSW Liberals and Nationals after 11 years in government,"" he said on Twitter. ""This is Dominic Perrottet's captain's pick and he will be held accountable."" Penny Sharpe, Labor's leader in the upper house, said the inquiry would leave no stone unturned. ""This stinks to high heaven,"" Ms Sharpe said. ""It just doesn't make any sense that the Premier would decide that John Barilaro is the best person in the whole of NSW to go to New York and represent us on our behalf."" Treasurer Matt Kean today defended the decision-making process regarding the appointment. ""John Barilaro was a trade minister and he appears qualified to be a trade commissioner,"" he said. ""I've been informed that this has gone through the proper process and that's how decisions should be taken."" In accepting his appointment, Mr Barilaro — who recently settled his defamation case against Google — said he would continue to build on what had already been achieved. ""I'm looking forward to supporting NSW companies to export and expand to the United States,"" he said. ""Including the many fintech, cyber security, space, health and food and beverage companies.

64,"Queensland government's social housing plan 'a drop in the ocean' to help 50,000 needing a home",politics,"  Queensland's social housing register list the 'size of Gympie's population' as government recycles investment announcement A Queensland government announcement that up to 1,200 new social and affordable homes will be built, will not see any additional homes beyond what has previously been announced. Treasurer Cameron Dick today revealed the homes would be delivered under a partnership struck between the Brisbane Housing Company (BHC) and the Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC). The first seven projects will see almost 600 homes built, with construction set to begin between 2023 and 2025. ""This commercial partnership is a model which has not been seen before in Queensland,"" Mr Dick said in a statement, a day out from handing down the state budget. The deal falls under the government's $1 billion housing investment fund, which was announced as part of last year's budget, and does not involve new additional homes — instead it forms part of the government's existing pledge to build 7,400 new social and affordable homes over the next 4 years. The $1 billion fund was established for its returns to contribute about $160 million in extra funding over the forward estimates to increase supply. ""When applications opened for the $1 billion Housing Investment Fund, we told the market we were seeking proposals which identified new solutions to deliver housing for vulnerable Queenslanders,"" Mr Dick said. ""It will see BHC leverage QIC's strong track record of securing and managing institutional investment to deliver new social and affordable housing."" Opposition Leader David Crisafulli has accused the government of not doing enough to address the housing crisis. ""You can't see our rental vacancy rates and 50,000 Queenslanders on the [social housing] waiting list and not be alarmed,"" he said. ""And for the Treasurer to re-announce something from 12 months ago … that's not looking for a housing solution, it's looking for a political one."" Last month the government announced the first two projects from the investment fund, located at Chermside and Redcliffe. QCOSS CEO Aimee McVeigh told ABC Radio Brisbane that since the $2.9 billion investment was made by the state government last year, it has actually halved the number of houses delivered compared to the year before, and this announcement was a ""drop in the ocean"" to what was needed. ""So yes, this model is fantastic. Yes, we see the need to see more money into the housing investment funds. There is potential for more projects, but this is not a new initiative,"" she said. ""We have 50,000 people — a population around the size of Gympie — on our social housing register, and people are waiting for up to, almost four years for a house. ""Our social housing register has blown out by 80 per cent over the last four years, so 1,200 new homes ... it's a drop in the ocean."" She said there needed to be about 5,000 houses built per year over the next decade to really deal with the crisis. ""Obviously the state government can't fund that alone. It is fantastic that we have a Prime Minister who grew up in public housing, he's living proof of what happens when you put the roof over the head of a child,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, if he was living in Queensland right now as a kid, he'd be more likely to be living in a tent or a hotel room. ""We need our prime minister to use his lived experience and turn that into political will, work with our state government so that both levels of government are not only making significant investment, but that we have accelerated construction."" It ""remains to be seen"" whether the Premier's social housing plan is achievable, Master Builders Queensland CEO Paul Bidwell said, given the limited availability of tradespeople and the cost of materials right now. ""It's a shot in the arm for the commercial sector, so there will be a lot of builders who are keen to get hold of this work,"" he said. ""The question will be what the cost is, and that's something that will need to be worked out between the housing company and the builders, with input from the state government."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Executive director of Q Shelter Fiona Caniglia said the state government really needed to organise a housing roundtable or summit to bring all the stakeholders together to collaborate on a solution. ""We're calling on the government to work with our sector, to really identify a target,"" she said. ""We need a target for all housing, to meet population demand. And then within that, we need a target that meets the true demand for social and affordable homes. And we don't have that. ""We really think that there's encouraging signs that our government, local government, and mayors are coming out to try and see more homes come out of the short-term rental market and into the long-term rental market. ""There's also examples of the private sector coming forward to talk about build to rent models at scale, which would be really positive. It's why we think the state government has a critical role in bringing together those different stakeholders to to achieve progress on many fronts.""

65,Pole in middle of bikeway 'brings a whole new meaning to a shared pathway',politics,"  Stobie pole installed in middle of Bolivar bikeway creates dangerous obstacle for cyclists A power pole has been installed in the middle of a bike path in Adelaide's northern suburbs, sparking safety concerns from cyclists and bemusement from others. SA Power Networks, which put the stobie pole in, says it will fix the path to go around the obstacle this week but only after publicity over the weekend criticising its placement. A cyclist who regularly uses the path along the Little Para River at Bolivar says the pole has been there for three months. Cyclists have to divert either onto gravel or down a riverbank to go around it. ""It's on a sweeping corner with zero lighting,"" cyclist Tom Colls said. ""With longer dark hours in the winter, it can pose a risk to early morning and later cycling commuters that don't have expensive high-lumens forward lighting. ""On top of that, the loose gravel used to traverse around it can be mushy and slippery under wet conditions."" Mr Colls told Salisbury Deputy Mayor Chad Buchanan about the issue on Friday. Mr Buchanan had a look at it over the weekend and posted about it on Facebook on Sunday alongside the message ""You had one job"". ""It certainly brings a whole new meaning to a shared pathway,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide today. ""It was certainly something that I wouldn't have thought we'd see pop up in the middle of a shared path, but I have been told that SAPN (SA Power Networks) … will be realigning the shared path, which has been somewhat reassuring, but in the meantime it is dangerous and there needs to be some adequate signage and particularly some lighting around it at night-time because it is dangerous for cyclists and that is something I've asked our staff to follow up over the weekend."" According to a development application approved by former planning minister Vickie Chapman a year ago, the power lines are being built to connect to a new gas and diesel power station at the nearby Bolivar Wastewater Treatment Plant. A condition of the approval was that all infrastructure damaged during the development be reinstated at SA Power Networks' cost. The work included removing seven regulated trees. SA Power Networks corporate affairs manager Paul Roberts said the pole had to be in the middle of the path because one side was a wetland and moving it the other direction would have necessitated trimming a tree, which the company did not want to do. A second pole is next to the path — rather than in the middle of it — but has a fence around it that also blocks the bikeway. Mr Roberts was unsure when the pole had been installed but said its location was chosen in consultation with the City of Salisbury council. ""The intention was originally to reinstate the path when we removed the second old pole in early July,"" he said. ""What we'll do instead is we will now this week get a subcontractor to reinstate the path to the right of where the pole is located and we'll then have to do some further reinstatement after we remove the other pole, which I think will happen some time in early July. ""So, look, there's really sensible reasons why it's there and we have an intention and a plan with the council to put the bikeway back but just to the right of the existing bikeway."" He said stobie poles had to be installed using large trucks, so it may not have been suitable to move the bike path first. ""We'll use this instance, as we always do, as a really excellent opportunity to do a post-project review just to see what we could have done better and, if there are things we could do better, we'll integrate that into our future thinking for these types of works,"" he said.

66,"ASX falls after biggest weekly loss since 2020 on interest rate, energy stocks offset gains in banks",politics,"  ASX falls after biggest weekly loss since 2020 on interest rate, energy stocks offset gains in banks Australian shares have struggled for momentum on Monday after falling to their worst week in more than two years as energy and mining stocks countered gains in banks. The ASX 200 closed down 41 points, or 0.6 per cent to 6,433. At the same time, the Australian dollar was up at 69.67 US cents. The benchmark sank 1.8 per cent on Friday in its sixth straight session of falls. Mining stocks fell about 5.1 per cent after benchmark iron ore prices extended losses on Friday as Chinese steel mills opted to reduce output amid weak profits and deteriorating demand prospects. Sector heavyweights BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue skidded between 5.1 per cent and 8.6 per cent, with Fortescue touching its lowest level since March 17. Energy stocks fell 5.2 per cent to be the biggest laggards on the main index, after oil prices dropped on Friday on worries that interest rate hikes by major central banks could cut energy demand. Sector heavyweights Woodside Energy and Santos skidded 4.9 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. Financials rose 0.6 per cent after a nine-session losing streak, with the ""Big Four"" banks trading in positive territory. The Commonwealth Bank, the country's biggest lender, led gains with a 0.3 per cent rise, while Westpac was flat. Among individual stocks, Infomedia jumped 7.4 per cent and was headed for its best day since May 16 after receiving a $638.8 million buyout proposal from US-based software company Solera Holdings LLC. Among the top movers were Pointsbet (+18.6pc), Harvey Norman (+4.5pc) and Home Consortium (+5.6pc). Meanwhile, Lake Resources (-13.7pc), Bega Cheese (-8.1pc), De Grey Mining (-10.2pc) and Beach Energy (-8.3pc) were among the worst performers. Brent crude oil was up, trading at $US113.51 a barrel, by 4:38pm AEST. World stocks on Friday closed out their steepest weekly slide since the pandemic meltdown of March 2020, as investors worried that tighter monetary policy by inflation-fighting central banks could damage economic growth. The US Federal Reserve's biggest rate hike since 1994, the first such Swiss move in 15 years, a fifth rise in British rates since December and a move by the European Central Bank to bolster the indebted south all took turns roiling markets. The Bank of Japan was the only outlier in a week where money prices rose around the world, sticking on Friday with its strategy of pinning 10-year yields near zero. The Australian share market will need to fall at least a further 5 per cent from the current 15 per cent to be classed as a ""bear"" market. David Taylor breaks down what happens next. After sharp early losses, world stocks steadied somewhat to end Friday's session down by just 0.12 per cent. The weekly slide of 5.8 per cent was the steepest since the week of March 20, 2020. Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.13 per cent, the S&P 500 added 0.22 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.43 per cent. For the week, the S&P 500 dropped 5.8 per cent, also its biggest fall since the third week of 2020. ""Inflation, the war and lockdowns in China have derailed the global recovery,"" economists at Bank of America said in a note to clients, adding they see a 40 per cent chance of a recession in the United States next year as the Fed keeps raising rates. ""We look for GDP growth to slow to almost zero, inflation to settle at around 3 per cent and the Fed to hike rates above 4 per cent."" The Fed on Friday said its commitment to fight inflation is ""unconditional"". Fears that its rate hikes could trigger a recession supported Treasury prices and slowed the rise in yields, which fall when prices rise. Ten-year Treasury yields retreated to 3.22944 per cent after hitting an 11-year high of 3.498 per cent on Tuesday. Southern European bond yields dropped sharply after reports of more detail from ECB President Christine Lagarde on the central bank's plans. ""The more aggressive line by central banks adds to headwinds for both economic growth and equities,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""The risks of a recession are rising, while achieving a soft landing for the US economy appears increasingly challenging."" The ASX slumps after yesterday's rally on Wall Street vanishes in a sea of red, with investors taking flight as both the UK and Switzerland raise official interest rates. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell to a five-week low, dragged by selling in Australia. Japan's Nikkei fell 1.8 per cent and headed for a weekly drop of almost 7 per cent. Bonds and currencies were jittery after a rollercoaster week. The yen tanked after the Bank of Japan stuck to its ultra-accommodative policy stance. The yen fell 2.2 per cent by late Friday, bolstering the US dollar, which rose 0.73 per cent against a basket of major currencies. Sterling fell 1 per cent in New York as investors focused on the gap between US and UK rates. The Bank of England is opting for a more moderate approach than the Fed. ""If a central bank does not move aggressively, yields and risk price in more in the way of rate hikes down the road,"" said NatWest Markets' strategist John Briggs. ""Markets may just be continuously adjusting to an outlook for higher global policy rates … as global central bank policy momentum is all one way.""

67,Draft plan would see coal and gas power stations paid to offer stable supply,politics,"  New 'capacity mechanism' could pay coal and gas generators for reliable electricity supply A draft plan for a new ""capacity mechanism"", aimed at ensuring stability in the national electricity grid, could see coal and gas generators paid for reliable power supply. The federal government's Energy Security Board (ESB) has been tasked with designing the new mechanism, which would pay generators through an auction process for the capacity they can provide. Currently, generators in the national electricity market — which serves the east coast and South Australia — are only paid for the electricity they produce. The new system would also pay for generators to be available when needed. The ESB said introducing such a tool by mid-2025 was going to be vital to ensuring much more capacity enters the grid in coming decades, and a smooth transition to net zero emissions by 2050. There have been calls for the new mechanism to exclude existing generators, particularly coal and gas. But the board argued it was important that the mechanism could access a mix of technologies, and discourage the early exit of existing generators before new generators — like more renewables — were ready to take their place. The Albanese government is blaming the energy crisis engulfing eastern Australia on the Coalition’s failure to put in place policy to ensure adequate and timely investment in renewables. That’s correct, but it’s not the whole story. States and territories would still be given the final say on which generators were eligible for the payments in their jurisdiction. The Victorian government had previously insisted states be given the right to determine which technologies were supported, arguing incentives should only be directed toward zero-emissions technology. Victorian Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said the ESB's plan provided the flexibility they wanted to see. ""We have always been clear that a capacity market operating in Victoria would make payments to zero-emissions technologies and not fossil fuels,"" Ms D'Ambrosio said. The board's draft plan said the mechanism could actually see net zero emissions in energy achieved earlier than anticipated. ""Designed well, the capacity mechanism will enable a swifter, less risky and more orderly transition to a net zero emissions energy system,"" it said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposal appeared sensible. ""It's an insurance scheme into the energy system,"" he said. ""And that seems to me to be a bit of common sense."" The board warned there was going to be significant demand for more power to enter the national grid in the coming decades, meaning stability and certainty will be vital to encouraging new investment. It warned that many coal generators were reaching the end of their useful lives, while electricity demand was expected to more than double over the next 30 or so years. Forecasting ahead to 2050, it said the grid would require the equivalent of 50 new Snowy Hydro schemes to enter the market. It also addressed concerns the cost of paying generators to provide capacity would be passed onto consumers, and force up power prices. The ESB said that outcome could be avoided. ""From a customer point of view, the risks of a disorderly transition would be reduced, including avoiding elevated high prices due to scarcity and the disruption and costs of load shedding,"" it said. ""The ESB is aware of concerns that a capacity mechanism could cause customers to pay more for the same level of service. ""This is clearly not the intent, and it will be avoided through careful design."" The current draft is now open for public comment, and a detailed plan will be put to energy ministers at the end of the year. Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the board's proposal was a positive step forward. ""The Energy Security Board's release of this consultation paper is welcome,"" Mr Bowen said. ""It follows agreement by all energy ministers earlier this month that the ESB should undertake this next step in energy market reform. ""While there is still a ways to go, it will allow market participants and experts to express their views, and puts us back on track in reforming an energy market that has undergone rapid change, but was neglected by the Commonwealth in recent years."" Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the ESB's proposal struck the right balance between preparing for more renewables to enter the system and protecting reliability. ""We will develop a capacity mechanism which works for the task at hand,"" he said. ""Which is to ensure reliability as we undertake this massive transformation in our energy grid, to being much more renewably focused. ""To being focused on achieving our climate ambitions, but also achieving so in a way which does in no sense undermine reliability for Australians."" But Greens leader Adam Bandt said any scheme that served to keep coal and gas-fired generators running longer could not be supported. ""Paying them to stay in the system longer is only going to prolong the problems, and also prolong the transition to renewables,"" Mr Bandt said. ""The idea of paying coal and gas to stay in the system isn't just going to make the climate crisis worse, it's going to reward the big corporations who have been holding us to ransom.""

68,live: NSW Now: Police make pre-emptive strike on protest group,politics,"  Sydney news: Police raid on Blockade Australia group leads to arrests, alleged assault Here's what you need to know this morning. A New York-style ""High Line"" would be built at Circular Quay under a planned transformation of the Cahill Expressway by the NSW government. New public green space and ferry wharves are also included in the government's vision, which will receive a $216 million investment in the 2022-23 Budget. The funding will enable further design work including planning approvals, an environmental impact statement and community consultation to help get shovel-ready. Premier Dominic Perrottet said the project would create up to 1,000 jobs during construction and one of the world's most iconic walks and viewing platforms. ""The scar of the Cahill Expressway splits our amazing city from its best asset and while we cannot get rid of it right now, I'm delighted we can enhance it in the meantime and create one of the world's truly great walks,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""This investment is a critical step in reinvigorating Circular Quay, which will ultimately see millions of tourism dollars flowing back into local businesses as we build our way forward to a brighter economic future for NSW."" The fate of Circular Quay has been the subject of contention between the government and City of Sydney Council, with Lord Mayor Clover Moore advocating for Cahill Expressway and above-ground train station to be demolished. Infrastructure, Cities and Active Transport Minister Rob Stokes said the community would be consulted throughout the process. ""For too long Circular Quay has not lived up to its potential, but this plan will see Sydney have the front door it deserves and better reflect the spectacular city we live in,"" Mr Stokes said. Also in tomorrow's budget will be $500 million to help speed up the planning process, with the aim of increasing the state's supply of affordable housing. It is in addition to a $780 million allocation that will see the state government contribute an equity share of up to 40 per cent for the purchase of a property for some people. The money for the planning process includes: NSW public hospitals will get more than $400 million to fast-track elective surgeries delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The funding, to be included in tomorrow's budget will be used to employ an extra 267 full-time staff, and open extra hospital theatre lists on evenings and weekends. NSW Treasurer Matt Kean says the additional staff will include doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. Extra shifts will also be offered to existing staff. Police conducted a large raid yesterday morning on a property in the Colo Valley, where a group of about 40 people from Blockade Australia were gathered. The group has been behind several protests, including stopping freight in and out of Port Botany earlier this year. Police said they were acting pre-emptively ahead of another protest planned later this month. Several arrests were made after a police car was allegedly damaged and officers attacked, authorities said. Acting Assistant Commissioner Paul Dunstan said officers were ""pushed, shoved and jostled"" as they walked back to their car, saying they feared for their lives. This morning, police said seven men had been charged with offences including affray, assaulting or hindering police and destroying or damaging property. They have all been refused bail to front Penrith Local Court. However, the actions of police have been criticised by activist groups as an overreach. Anastasia Radievska from Legal Observers NSW said while she can't comment on allegations of violence by protesters, it's not known exactly what triggered the raid. ""We haven't been given any details about whether what the protesters were doing was illegal, whether there was any preparation for actual illegal activity,"" she said. Also of concern for Ms Radievska was the presence of about ""100 officers for 30 or 40 individuals"" in what she says was an overuse of police resources ""for non-violent offenders"". The NSW government has committed $9 million to buy 16 bushfire tankers as it completes its response to the deadly fire season of 2019-2020. It's the final instalment of an $80 million package designed to modernise Fire and Rescue NSW's fleet and resources, as recommended by a the government's Bushfire Inquiry. The new tankers will enable crews to access difficult terrain during fires and other emergencies, offering greater protection to firefighters. Emergency Services and Resilience and Minister for Flood Recovery Steph Cooke said one of the inquiry's key recommendations was to replace FRNSW's 22-year-old fleet of bushfire tankers. The government had already funded an additional 18 new tankers before today's budget announcement. ""The additional funding for 16 more tankers means FRNSW will be armed with an entirely new fleet of modern, advanced and environmentally-friendly fire trucks to better respond to whatever bush fire threats emerge,"" Ms Cooke said. Other FRNSW projects funded include: There are calls for the state government to do more in the short term to keep doctors in country towns while NSW waits for medical staff to be recruited. Narromine Shire Council Mayor Craig Davies, says the nearby town of Trangie's only doctor will have to leave after 22 years due to cuts to his payments as a Visiting Medical Officer. A Western Area Local Health District spokesperson said the doctor's contract ends this month and discussions are continuing. Rural and Remote Medical Services chief executive officer Mark Burdack said small towns can't afford to lose their GPs while waiting for the thousands of new staff. ""Look at a rural health JobKeeper package that addresses some of the shortfalls experienced in rural towns,"" Mr Burdack says. ""Twenty-nine GP practices have gone into administration across Victoria and New South Wales in rural areas."" A recent parliamentary inquiry heard damning evidence from over 700 people and organisations worried about rural health services. A man is due in court today charged with allegedly setting another man on fire in the Illawarra region at the weekend. About 4:20pm on Saturday, emergency services found a man with serious burns at a property on Fountaindale Road at Saddleback Mountain, west of Kiama. Police officers located a vehicle engulfed in flames and a 51-year-old man nearby with serious burns to his head, chest and face. The man was treated at the scene by NSW Ambulance paramedics before being flown to Royal North Shore Hospital, where he remains in a critical condition. About 9:30am yesterday, a 42-year-old man was arrested at Saddleback Mountain. He was charged with throw/lay explosive other substance with intent to burn/maim/disable/do grievous bodily harm, and cause grievous bodily harm to person with intent. The man was refused bail and will appear at Wollongong Local Court today. Family members of missing persons across NSW are being encouraged to provide a DNA sample to a police database established to crack cold cases. The program aims to assist detectives with ongoing investigations into historic missing persons by collecting familial DNA samples from their relatives. In 2021, more than 100 biological relatives of missing people visited pop-up collection centres at Coffs Harbour, Port Macquarie, Nowra and Merimbula to provide DNA samples. Those samples were compared against profiles of all unidentified bodies and human remains on hand in NSW. Missing Persons Registry Commander, Detective Inspector Glen Browne, said the program had been impacted by the pandemic but it would restart with renewed vigour. ""The success of the program relies on collecting as many familial DNA samples as possible so they can be matched against DNA profiles obtained from unidentified bodies and human remains,"" he said. The program will visit Bourke today, Broken Hill on Wednesday and Dubbo on Friday. Shower or two.

69,"After months of long COVID, Caroline felt her brain fog and fatigue was 'old news' to those around her",politics,"  Melbourne teacher Caroline Hewson's household was hit by COVID-19 in January, when Victoria saw a massive spike in Omicron infections. While her sons and husband recovered reasonably well, Ms Hewson did not. ""It ended up that I missed an awful lot of work and of life full stop,"" she said. Debilitating fatigue, breathlessness and a brain fog descended and remained for months, causing major disruption for the usually active 42-year-old. ""I would walk up the stairs at our house, and I would have to sit down, I couldn't even make it into a bedroom ... I'd have to sit at the top step and recover,"" she recalled. ""And I'd just be breathing feeling like I'm drowning and then I'd need a half-hour lie down from the exertion."" In her job as a primary school teacher specialising in literacy intervention, Ms Hewson's voice is critical. But during months of long COVID, her voice lost all its power, and she was struggling to parent, let alone work. While she was supported by her workplace to get better, she felt ""terribly guilty"" about the students she wasn't able to support. She also burnt through nearly all of her sick leave. Doctors were supportive, but they too were learning about the condition and couldn't offer much more advice than rest and plenty of fluids. As someone used to running not only her life but those of her young children, Ms Hewson found the extended illness difficult to accept, despite the support of those around her. ""It did feel like as time went on, it just became old news,"" she said. ""What do I keep saying? 'Yeah I feel like crap' ... I started lying and saying 'yeah feeling OK' and pushing through work ... because I was so sick of being sick and just sick of it all."" Ms Hewson reckons she's clear from long COVID now. But it was a slow journey. ""It was almost like I was going up 1 per cent every day or two, in terms of feeling better,"" she said. ""It wasn't like I woke up one day, I have heard some people say you just wake up one day and you go 'ah, I'm better'. ""It wasn't like that. It was so incredibly gradual."" Even now, she still feels like a ""human guinea pig"", unsure if her illness will have lasting effects on her brain or body. While we know Ms Hewson's experience is far from isolated, there are no official figures being calculated on how many Australians are experiencing long COVID at any given point in time. Several states and territories have set up long COVID clinics and can report the patients being treated there, but many people with long COVID are being treated by GPs and recovering in the community. As the temperatures drop, COVID-19 cases continue to climb. But what should you expect while your immune system fights off the virus? It's a figure health economist Martin Hensher tried to figure out earlier this year. The University of Tasmania researcher was part of a team that drew on a range of data to produce an estimate of the number of Australians with long COVID in the aftermath of the first Omicron wave. Accounting for the significant number of unknowns, it suggested it was likely tens of thousands — and in worst-case scenarios more than 300,000 — Australians would grapple with long COVID symptoms for at least three months this year. Professor Hensher said while he hadn't had a chance to revise those calculations to factor in the subsequent waves of infections, ""in very crude terms ... I'd expect our estimates to double"". ""So I'd be saying, I would have thought currently and in recent months, many tens of thousands of Australians definitely will have had long COVID,"" he said. ""And you know, possibly in a worst case, maybe half a million people might have long COVID for three months. ""Then those numbers will steadily come down over time but ... I think we're still probably looking at likely tens of thousands of people who might still be sick with long COVID a year after their initial infection."" While numbers aren't being tallied, doctor Nirvana Luckraj is in some position to gauge the interest among Australians for information on long COVID. She's the chief medical officer at the government-funded healthdirect service, which provides free medical advice online and over the phone. ""There's been a huge increase in the number of people seeking trusted information about long COVID since March this year,"" Dr Luckraj said. ""We're seeing around 100,000 people a week, visiting our long COVID and recovery information on our website."" She said around 10 to 20 per cent of those who had had COVID may experience a post-COVID condition of some kind. Recent research out of the United Kingdom suggests Omicron poses a slightly lower risk of long COVID than Delta, but the researchers noted the high volume of Omicron cases meant there were more long COVID cases overall due to the Omicron waves. The most common symptoms are fatigue, coughing, shortness of breath, memory difficulties, confusion, joint or muscle pain, anxiety or low mood, and insomnia and poor sleep. ""Studies have identified that patients who are at higher risk of post-COVID-19 conditions are those that have experienced a more severe illness, including one requiring intensive care,"" Dr Luckraj said. ""And those who have other existing chronic illnesses such as respiratory disease, diabetes, hypertension, also, those who are of older age, and females seem to be more likely to get long COVID or a post-COVID condition as well."" It's now thought anywhere between two and 40 per cent of those who catch COVID-19 are ending up with long-COVID. Doctors are urging those at greater risk to discuss with a GP if they are eligible for new anti-viral drugs and set up an access plan so they can get them within five days if they become infected. Dr Luckraj said GPs were becoming better equipped to support people like Ms Hewson, but the simple advice to rest remained key. ""The advice really is to pace yourself, not to push yourself to exhaustion, to break up your daily activities into smaller, more manageable tasks,"" she said. ""If you're doing your gardening, food shopping, laundry ... spread it over the week, so that you get rest in between and ask family members or friends to help you. ""And prioritise tasks: only do essential tasks and activities, with family support, if required."" In addition to the pain and hardship borne by those with long COVID, overseas examples suggest the condition will also disrupt the economy. Professor Hensher pointed to recent comments from the governor of the Bank of England, who last month told UK politicians an increase in long-term sickness was putting the brakes on the economy's recovery from the pandemic. ""And they felt that the single biggest factor driving that was increasing numbers of people with long-term sickness ... they believe the most likely explanation for that was long COVID,"" he said. ""So they're actually saying it's long COVID directly driving labour shortages across the United Kingdom."" Professor Hensher said coming to grips with the policy implications of long COVID was one of the reasons it should be more closely studied. He is urging authorities to undertake the kind of surveys that have enabled the UK to keep closer tabs on long COVID prevalence. ""We really do need to have real-time surveillance of what is going on with long COVID, but also with disability and long-term illness in the labour market,"" he said. ""I think as a society, we're just going to see continuing disruption, mainly through absences from work and from school."" By the end of this year, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare aims to have a national dataset that brings together the different COVID-19 case data. That includes data around deaths, hospitals, aged care and immunisation and will help further research on the medium and long-term health effects of COVID-19. But Professor Hensher said a simpler household survey was needed now. ""The GPs clearly are getting more concerned about the level of work that is presenting in general practice on this,"" he said. ""We really do need to listen to that ... what sort of support do people need through the healthcare system?""

70,"Melbourne council spends $142,000 on legal fees dealing with complaints about councillor behavior",politics,"  Concerns about local council behaviour and training aired in Victorian report A report has found ""poor behaviour"" in Victoria's local councils is stopping councillors and council staff from doing their jobs properly. The state government report into culture in local government received 142 submissions, including from mayors, council staff and councillors. ""It is clear there is poor and unacceptable behaviour occurring in the local government sector,"" the report found. Some of the themes raised in the council report have already been spilling out in local council meetings. At Hume City Council — in Melbourne's north — the council recently revealed that, in less than two years, it had spent $142,898 of ratepayers' money in legal fees dealing with complaints about councillor behaviour. The council tallied the cost of 22 applications for internal arbitration between November 2020 and May 2022, mostly made by councillor Trevor Dance. Only two of the applications led to adverse findings. The council noted the total amount did not include ongoing matters, including Mr Dance's appeal against a serious misconduct finding, and a complaint with the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission. At a meeting this month, councillor Jack Medcraft told the Hume Council the figure represented ""a waste extreme"". ""We're looking at $142,000 of ratepayers' money gone which, has basically gone down the gurgler, for what?"" he told the meeting. Councillor Joseph Haweil said he had been the subject of complaints that had not been upheld. ""Going through that complaints process can be quite traumatic and stressful,"" he said. ""You do lose sleep at times."" He urged his colleagues to work together to avoid disputes leading to increasing legal bills. The ABC has contacted Mr Dance for comment. The state government commissioned the review into culture in local government in May 2021. Among the top issues, 55 per cent of respondents were concerned about the level of training for councillors, 37 per cent raised issues with social media and 23 per cent raised issues with how poor behaviour was managed. In March, the ABC revealed a former Moonee Valley mayor who had misled a community grants program was still sitting on the council. In April, the state government appointed a municipal monitor to three local councils, to address issues with governance and culture. The Local Government Minister, Shaun Leane, said problems with councils were not across the board. ""Councils are doing fantastic work every day, and there's 50,000 workers who do a great job every day,"" he said. ""But it is quite a sad thing that so much time gets spent on one or two individuals, and the way they are behaving."" He said the government would support councils and the local government sector to act on the report. The report found that women, people from diverse backgrounds and those with disabilities were often not ""inspired"" to stand for election. ""When they do, they may face harassment, lack of formal support and retribution for calling out poor behaviour,"" the report found. ""There is a view that the local government sector is male-dominated, with a lack of flexible work arrangements for those with caregiving responsibilities."" In 2020, 272 women were elected in Victoria's local government elections — the most in Australian history, at 43.8 per cent of councillors. Councillor Sarah Race loves representing her community at the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council, but said more needed to be done to attract and retain women in leadership. The council has had 29 mayors, and only six have been women. Six have been called David. ""People are quite shocked at that, and it shows the issue with female leadership at the political level,"" Ms Race said. She said many people in the community did not understand the role of councillors. ""It can be a 30-50 hour week, depending on what is going on. It is not necessarily family friendly and it does not pay well at all,"" she said. The report noted there was concern about the level of council allowances. ""We have also heard through the submissions that the Councillor allowance is not reflecting the level of competency, responsibility and the amount of work required for the role,"" the report found. In March 2022, the base allowance for a councillor was set between $24,080 and $53,957 per year, depending on the council. The base yearly allowance for a mayor ranges from $74,706 to $238,634. Victorian Local Governance Association (VLGA) chief executive Kathryn Arndt said more needed to be done to educate the public about the role of councils. ""These are multi-million dollar service delivery businesses that employ thousands of staff and manage significant budgets,"" she said. She said it was important to acknowledge councils operated in ""politicised environments"". ""The VLGA welcomes the review into the culture of local government in Victoria — similar reviews are taking place in Tasmania — and other states are reporting increasing numbers of reports of poor behaviour in local government, most often in the council chamber,"" she said. She said the VLGA would like to see better mandatory training for candidates, and more support for councillors.

71,analysis: Why superannuation losses will be worse than we think,politics,"  Why superannuation losses are likely to be worse than we think after horror year on global markets Even before last week's market conflagration, the scene was looking ugly. While it may have come as a shock to many, superannuation balances — which ballooned last year through the worst recession in more than a century — had already dipped into the red by late last month just as the financial year was drawing to a close. After last week's gravity pull from rising interest rates, the rout on global stock markets has turned that bleak prospect into a painful reality. Best now to mentally prepare for a significant decline in your retirement savings when that June 30 statement hits the inbox. Even those who have erred on the side of caution — with a more-conservative superannuation option — are likely to see significant declines. The only ones who will be spared are those with the foresight — or good luck — to switch to cash at the beginning of the year. Until last week, it somehow had appeared that global monetary authorities had managed to engineer a major downturn on financial markets — without the usual accompaniment of panic and despair. No more. A mood of despondency has settled over financial markets and — unlike previous downturns — there appears to be little room to hide. Everything of late has been falling. That's made life extremely difficult for investors, home-spun and professional alike. And it's likely to continue. After more than 30 years of declining interest rates and minimal inflation, the world seems poised to enter a new era — or maybe re-enter an old one — of sluggish growth, escalating costs and more expensive capital. It's a world that many investors have never before experienced. Australia has been an outlier on the global stage this year. While Wall Street has been grinding lower since January, higher commodity prices — courtesy of Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine — have kept financial markets news off the front pages here. Until now. After Australians collectively took a bath in the wash-up from the global financial crisis, our big superannuation funds reviewed their investment strategies. Most figured out they had way too much invested in Australian shares, that their portfolios were too closely tied to the local stock market. So, they actively diversified into offshore shares, property, infrastructure, bonds and other alternative assets in a bid to reduce the volatility of your fund's performance. The idea was that, if the bottom falls out of one asset class, it should be offset by others that perform well. Even after that realignment, however, a normal balanced fund would have about 20 per cent of your savings invested in the local market. Luckily, that bias was working well until April because our stock market was shrugging off the global woes. Most other assets, however, were doing rather badly and, unusually, all at once. The sudden re-emergence of inflation — and the drastic rate hikes from central bankers to tame it — temporarily junked the theory around diversification. And, now, local stocks have joined the plunge. International shares, which make up about 30 per cent of most superannuation portfolios, have been on the slide since Christmas. If you've been stunned by the sudden drop in our market last week — which has helped shave 15 per cent from April's peak — consider this. Wall Street is down 23 per cent since January. The technology-heavy Nasdaq, which has driven the stellar performance on Wall Street for more than a decade, is off 32 per cent. As for cryptocurrency, well, don't even go there. At last glance, the entire market was in chaos, with overall losses now more than 70 per cent from the peak. This may come as a shock, but the driving force behind all investments is not the stock market. It is bond markets. Essentially, bonds are IOUs. Both governments and corporations issue them when they raise debt, usually with the promise of a set interest or coupon rate for a given period of time, say 10 years. Once issued, they are traded on open markets that dwarf stock markets. Vast trillions of dollars are invested in them, and the sheer weight of that money makes them the foundation, the bedrock that dictates performance in everything, from interest rates to property, stocks and currencies. In fact, Bill Clinton's advisor, James Carville — the man who famously coined the phrase ""It's the economy, stupid"" — is just as famous for this line: ""I used to think that, if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the President or the Pope. But now I want to be the bond market because you can intimidate everybody."" The past year has been truly intimidating. It has been the worst year on record for US government bonds, with losses of 12 per cent. To put that into context, the second-worst year was 1984, when they shed 2.9 per cent. Because governments rarely default, bonds are considered to be risk-free. That's why they attract so much money and so much attention. For the past 40 years, as interest rates have declined, they have delivered huge gains. Being risk-free, however, doesn't mean you can't lose money on them as many big professional funds managers suddenly have discovered. There's an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices. If punters think rates will fall, they bid up bond prices. And that's been the one-way bet for more than 40 years. Suddenly, however, everything has been thrown into reverse. So, what does this have to do with you? You've got US bonds in your superannuation fund portfolio. In any balanced fund, about 10 per cent of your savings are in what's known as fixed-interest investments. Because they are — or at least were —considered to be relatively safe, there are fewer of them in higher-risk options such as growth funds. But, if you have opted for safer alternatives such as a stable or conservative option, around a quarter of your investment is sitting in bonds … which have been shaken and stirred. Ask five different economists and you'll get 10 different answers. On the one hand … However, it is difficult to see any quick market recovery any time soon. The surge in stock prices that rapidly followed the crash in February 2020 came about because central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, not only slashed interest rates to zero, they also printed money like there was no tomorrow. Global financial markets have taken a hit lately, and super has been caught up in the turmoil. Should you be worried? They'd been doing it for a decade — ever since the GFC wreaked havoc — and it hadn't even looked like firing-up inflation. So, during the pandemic, central banks — including our very own RBA — jumped in on the action. In the past few years, each time the Fed tried to withdraw some of that printed cash, stocks tanked and the Fed nervously retreated. Now, with inflation on the march, it has no option. It is going to start aggressively pulling that cash back out to take the heat out of the economy. And, since the pandemic pump, it now has an eye-watering $US9 trillion ($13 trillion) to retrieve. That, effectively, will amplify the impact of rate hikes. Instead of buying up US government bonds — as it was doing during the GFC and pandemic — it will be selling them, mopping up cash and pushing interest rates higher. Mounting deficits, a mountain of debt, an overstimulated economy and ill-disciplined spending all await incoming prime minister Anthony Albanese, writes Ian Verrender. That will also cause bond prices to continue tanking, which will continue to weigh on all asset markets and on your superannuation fund. Until last week — when the US Fed rammed through a triple rate hike in one go — it seemed as if the retreat on financial and property markets would be relatively orderly. However, with another triple hike expected next month — followed by doubles in September and November and singles in December, January and March — orderly isn't the adjective that readily springs to mind. The only thing that might cause the Fed to back off and chill out a little is the prospect of recession, which is not really a comforting scenario.

72,"'It will kill them': Silicosis cases rising in Australia with more industries impacted, experts call for updated silica standards",politics,"  Workers diagnosed with silicosis after being exposed to silica dust are calling for urgent action Workers diagnosed with silicosis and leading industry experts are pushing for the new Labor government to ""urgently"" introduce tougher national regulations amid fears hundreds of cases are going undetected across a wide range of industries. Working underground for 33 years, gold miner Tony Kotlin had no idea the job he loved would cost him his health. After an accident at a mine in 2014, a standard X-ray of his injuries revealed something suspicious in his lungs. Doctors told him it could be cancer, but the official diagnosis came two years later. Mr Kotlin was found to have the incurable and often fatal lung disease silicosis — a result of three decades inhaling deadly crystalline silica dust on the job. ""Day-to-day is hard,"" Mr Kotlin said. ""I'd rather have lung cancer than this  — with lung cancer, you've got a good chance of recovery. ""With silicosis, it's there and it's not going away … there's nothing I can do about it."" Lung Foundation Australia says the lung cancer five-year survivorship rate is 20 per cent. Mr Kotlin, who lives in a rural town south-west of Brisbane, is still coming to terms with the diagnosis, which he says affects all aspects of his life. ""I'm tired all the time, I find it hard to consistently do day-to-day chores, I have a fair bit of difficulty in walking long distances, carrying things if they're heavy,"" Mr Kotlin said. ""I'm on a breathing machine at night now, which I absolutely hate. ""[I have] depression, anxiety … I'm very uncomfortable around people, I don't go to the supermarket, I don't walk down the street. ""I feel guilty that I'm not full-time supporting my family — it's extremely hard."" Mr Kotlin said he believed not enough was being done to protect workers exposed to dangerous levels of silica dust. ""I think silicosis will be worse than asbestos,"" Mr Kotlin said. ""I honestly think if attitudes don't change, it's going to get a lot, lot worse than what it is now."" The number of known silicosis cases in Australia is rapidly climbing. There has been a strong national focus on the engineered stone workforce, with at least 500 Australian stonemasons diagnosed, but there are fears many more cases remain undetected. Leading dust diseases clinician Graeme Edwards said the true number was likely higher, with symptoms often taking years to develop. ""A significant proportion of those workers who have already been exposed have not yet developed disease but will do so in the future. ""Those numbers [also] don't count those who will develop the disease from other exposures such as miners, quarry workers, or others in the crafts, building and construction industries,"" Dr Edwards said. Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) assistant secretory Liam O'Brien said there were likely hundreds of workers in those industries who have silicosis but do not know it, as health screenings are not available. ""What we've seen over the last decade is an explosion of cases in Australia and what's really worrying is it's much broader than engineered stone – we're seeing cases in quarries, construction, tunnelling,"" Mr O'Brien said. ""Workers in office spaces around quarries are [even] being diagnosed. 'We know workers are falling through the cracks … we don't have screening programs in many of those industries so there are many that will have symptoms but have not yet gone and got screened. ""We've got little understanding as to how widespread it is so we really fear that actually we're seeing just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this disease."" Dust diseases lawyer Jonathan Walsh, who represents Mr Kotlin in a claim for damages, has acted for dozens of other underground miners with silicosis over the past year. He said there was a ""significant under-reporting"" of the disease, particularly in the metalliferous mining sector, covering both surface and underground mining. ""There are probably hundreds of workers underground today who have silica disease — they don't know it but they should know it,"" Mr Walsh said. ""We are not seeing the rates of diagnosis out of this industry being reported by governments or in the general industry. ""There is a massive problem, particularly when you compare it to stonemasonry silicosis and the attention that that issue rightfully deserves, we're not seeing the same spotlight being shone on the metalliferous mining industry. ""With the [new] Labor government, there is an opportunity to refocus much-needed attention on this issue."" Mr Walsh said tougher national workplace regulations were ""absolutely required,"" with early detection crucial. ""It starts with setting a better federal framework via SafeWork Australia to reduce the maximum allowable dust exposure limit … ensuring they have better PPE and ensuring there is mandated engineering controls in the workplace,"" Mr Walsh said. ""Employers and governments need to make sure [all affected] industries are screened to ensure workers with this disease know they have it … so they can make informed decisions and choices about what they're going to do with their life going forward — right now, that is not happening."" ""Then it's up to the state and territory governments to enact laws in their local jurisdictions to ensure that workers are getting less exposed and better protected in the workplace and that the governments are regulating and ensuring employers are doing the right thing."" Dr Edwards said the Albanese government must ""urgently"" revisit the findings of the National Dust Disease Taskforce, established in 2019, to develop a national approach to managing occupational dust diseases. It handed down its final report last year and made seven recommendations, including more widespread health screenings, implementation of a national dust disease registry and better psychological and financial support for workers and their families. Former federal health minister Greg Hunt said the Coalition government had accepted the recommendations, but Dr Edwards said the Commonwealth and other jurisdictions have been too slow to act. ""Right now, we are still seeing workers being exposed inappropriately to respirable crystalline silica dust, and it will kill them,"" Dr Edwards said. ""By the time they're diagnosed at the moment, they're lining up for lung transplants … or have already died. ""We need the urgency of a new government to re-look at, accept and fund appropriately the recommendations of the taskforce. ""At both federal and state levels, [they are] not doing enough, not acting fast enough … we know more about monkeypox than we do about silicosis."" ""We need to detect as early as possible so we can intervene,"" he said. Mr O'Brien said the disease was ""entirely preventable"" through safe workplace practices and a stronger national regulatory framework is needed to ensure employers identify hazardous dust levels and take steps to reduce exposure.

Minister for Workplace Relations, Tony Burke, did not respond directly to the ABC's questions about whether the government would revisit the taskforce findings. In a statement, Mr Burke told the ABC that the government ""holds issues of workplace safety very close to its heart"". ""In opposition, I met with people who had contracted silicosis at work — the current standards had clearly failed them,"" Mr Burke said. ""I'll have more to say later, but this is an issue I'll be pursuing with my state counterparts.""

73,The state moved Isabella from paedophile to paedophile. She says 'nobody was paying attention',politics,"  Sexual assaults, racism and suicide attempts — life at the hands of Australia's child protection system Every year, Australia's child safety departments remove thousands of children from their parents on the grounds they are not safe at home and need urgent protection. In doing so, the government becomes their guardian, taking responsibility for their lives. But the state can be an uncaring parent, in whose hands children can live with dozens of strangers a year, be raped by those sent to protect them, and stay ""warehoused"" in group homes that are seen as training grounds for prison. As part of a major ABC investigation, more than 700 people from around the country have come forward with concerns about Australia's failing child protection system. WARNING: This story contains details that may cause distress to some readers. By the time a child ends up in state care, they have likely already experienced some form of abuse. Often for a prolonged period, because it can take years for departments to act. Far from being safe, some of these children are then preyed upon by the very people the government has vetted to look after them. ""These men were supposed to be my fathers"" Isabella was about two years old when she was placed with foster carer Alfred Peter Carr and his wife. She had always been intimidated by his temper, but as years passed something more sinister in Carr's nature had reared its head. ""Peter was really into child pornography, and he loved to use me as his main source,"" she said. ""That's just what I grew up thinking kids do. ""Him being my father at the time — because that's what he was to me at the time, he was dad — I just felt like I didn't have much choice but just listen and do as I was told and be quiet about it."" Carr would conceal the paedophilic acts from his wife. By the time Isabella was about eight, the abuse and secrecy had become too much and she self-harmed. Soon after, the placement broke down and the department sent Isabella to live with another carer. But rather than save her from the abuse, it escalated. The man would regularly rape Isabella — in the shower, at his gym. If you have been in the system, cared for someone who has, or work in child protection, we want to hear about your experience. He had told her to keep quiet, but Isabella said she alerted the department to other types of abuse in the home. Eventually, the investigation was abandoned, she said. ""They did nothing ... I have [self-harm] scars all over my body because nobody was paying attention,"" she said. When she was in year 10 at school, she moved again — to a female carer's house. The woman was the first grown-up Isabella had ever trusted, and with her unwavering support, she went to the police. Last year, Carr was given a three-year-and-six-month sentence for rape, indecent treatment of a child and possession of child exploitation material. He only served eight months of it, with the remainder suspended. The other man's case is still before the court, so we cannot identify him. The year Carr was convicted, Isabella turned 18 and the government ceased being her guardian. She believes it is she who has been dealt a life sentence, suffering daily from post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression from the sexual abuse she endured under Queensland's Department of Children, Youth Justice and Multicultural Affairs. ""It was her word against mine"" In the five years Amie was in government care, she moved 46 times, staying with foster carers and in residential care homes or — when all arrangements fell through — in a motel room with a departmental youth worker. During one of these motel stays in the early 2000s, a government worker took 15-year-old Amie shopping in the Garden City Westfield, spending about $300 on her. ""She encouraged me to pick things out and try things on. I remember feeling anxious because I thought she was expecting me to buy these things,"" Amie recalled. Back at the Sunnybank Star Motel in Brisbane's south, the youth worker insisted Amie again model the new clothes for her. When Amie said she had a headache, the worker suggested a massage might help. ""I laid down on the bed and I just had my bra and undies on, and she was massaging between my legs and was touching my breasts,"" she said. ""I didn't do anything, I didn't say anything, I just laid there. ""I was sexually abused when I was younger by a neighbour, so I always had this fear of men, but I never thought I needed to be concerned about women."" In a redress application lodged last year, Amie wrote: ""I remember that I self-harmed the following night because I was so conflicted and overwhelmed. I felt angry at the department that they would put me back in a situation where this could happen."" A woman, who at the time worked for Queensland's Children's Commissioner, told the ABC she remembered Amie telling her about the alleged abuse. Amie said on the night she self-harmed she also confided in her case worker, who later informed Amie the alleged abuser had denied the incident, and the department said the worker ""needed more training around boundaries"". Fifteen years since leaving state care, Amie is unable to move on. ""Last year, I spent six weeks in hospital after two suicide attempts,"" she said. ""I can go long periods of time in which I'm stable and I'm achieving my goals and stuff. And then, all of a sudden, the past really catches up to me."" Indigenous children are 10 times more likely to be removed from their families. Departmental policy dictates that they are then placed with Indigenous carers to maintain contact with their culture, but that doesn't always happen. Instead, Aboriginal children can languish in care hours from their land while some workers dismiss signs of sexual abuse in First Nations children as ""cultural"" behaviour. ""They basically told me it was cultural what the girl explained, because they saw sex all the time"" Ms Beveridge quit her role with South Australia's Department for Child Protection six months ago. During her tenure, she had worked in the state's residential care homes — group-home-like settings, where children end up as a last resort, after their foster or kinship placements lapse. She recalls an incident a few years ago that involved three young Aboriginal siblings: a girl aged about six and her two brothers aged about eight and 12. ""The girl had sexualised behaviour. She would deliberately take her underwear off and would do it in front of her brothers,"" she said. When Ms Beveridge reported it, she said a senior worker explained the disturbing act away as ""cultural"" behaviour. ""'That's what Aboriginals do, that's their culture'. That's what I was told,"" she said. ""I actually was dumbfounded. I could not speak. I couldn't believe I was hearing that. ""I said to him, 'I'm sorry, you cannot put that on a culture … it's certainly not Indigenous culture'. ""[Then], another worker, not me, actually witnessed the 12-year-old having sex with the sister. And suddenly it was a big hoo-ha. ""They removed him from the house and put him by himself and that was it. Nothing done for him, except we're moving him away to stop the problem."" ""I remain deeply concerned about the way child sexual abuse is being handled"" Until recently, James ran a school in remote Western Australia. The majority of his students were Indigenous. We've withheld his name because he still works in the system. Schools are often the safest environments for children to disclose abuse, away from the perpetrator. ""Children were telling us, believing that we would try to stop it,"" he said. ""We took those stories, and we wrote them into the mandatory reports."" Do you know more? Please contact us via abc_newsroom@protonmail.com James estimates staff at the school had made reports about two-thirds of the students. But his follow-up calls with the Department of Communities and police seemed to lead nowhere. ""I was sending those children back home, knowing full well that I'd done whatever I could do, but knowing full well that there was going to be further abuse in the home,"" he said. James also remembers attending a conference in Western Australia, where a government-employed worker spoke about counselling two young children who were abused at home. ""[They] first of all tried to write off the sexual abuse as cultural, and secondly, the fix to it was the little girl was going to get an implant to stop her from getting pregnant,"" he said. ""That's the level that the system's broken at, where that's acceptable. ""I believe the only way to repair the system is to have a royal commission."" ""It's not for the state to pick new parents for a child simply because they are poor, disadvantaged, might have a disability"" Ms de Fina has been practising law since 1995. She has led Legal Aid NSW child protection law division and worked for the royal commission into child sexual abuse. When representing families fighting for their parental rights, she found it was the clients from diverse cultural backgrounds who were targeted for intervention. ""Sometimes, I think, the child protection workers — who were for the most part young white women — would want to pick a better family for the child, rather than accepting that perhaps the child's family of origin was the best that it could be,"" she said. ""If you're going to take the child away from their family because of issues with the family, then at the very least the state should be providing a better system for them, better care. I don't think that's always the case."" She said early intervention was a missed opportunity. ""A lot of the families that we were dealing with, if you gave them a lot of support, a lot of help, they could have taken care of their kids, but it was easier for the state to remove the child than to provide the resources necessary for that family,"" she said. Workers who challenge how a child's case is handled can find themselves ""performance managed"" out of the departments. The ABC heard from more than 200 current and former workers, many of whom say they are unable to keep children safe in departments where management is more concerned with cutting corners and manipulating statistics to manage public opinion than protecting children. They want the system dismantled, starting at the top. ""There's an awful lot of covering up"" Ms Bell, who left Tasmania's Department of Communities in 2018, described the culture in the office as ""toxic"", where staff displayed ""an ongoing and chronic dislike"" of Indigenous families — who were ""treated and talked about as though they were less than human"" — and where workers engaged in an ""illegal"" practice. She said to save time, departmental workers often presented court with documents that had been copy-pasted from another child's file, bearing little, if any, relevance to the child in question. ""I've seen that happen that an affidavit was used from another child and just changed the birth date, and maybe the gender if that was needed, and changed very little of the facts,"" she said. ""It is illegal because the affidavit that the case worker is required to write to hand to the magistrate is something that he uses in his decision-making about a child's life. ""And if it's not original, and a case worker's original work, then it's not a correct document. It contains false information, misleading information. The magistrate doesn't know that."" She said the department workers also engaged in a practice known as ""sleeping cases"" — opening investigations so they'd disappear from the ""unallocated"" cases list, which is released to the public. ""[It's done] so it looks better when there's a parliamentary inquiry or something,"" she said. ""They're open but nobody is doing any work on them. ""Unless something really serious happened, a child death or something — and then there would be a big flurry of activity — I would say for years they just stayed open, but nothing was done."" ""I've been around for over a decade and barely recognise the current process"" Fred still works for Tasmania's Department of Communities as a case worker, so we cannot reveal his identity. Because of his seniority he's given more complex cases, but he barely has time to delve into the intricacies of them. ""You're rushing from case to case, rather than spending the time, building relationships, seeking solutions,"" he said. In his time, he's seen the department deliver numerous reviews and reports into child safety — usually after public outrage. ""All [reviews] came out with all sorts of grand ideas and the government then go ahead and fund this, or partially fund this, and we all have to get retrained,"" he said. ""The department does things because this is a way of managing public opinion."" On the ground, he says, things rarely improve. ""They don't improve, they just change. It's like shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic,"" he said. ""We need a real clean-out, starting from the top"" Ms Ingram left the New South Wales Department of Communities in 2018, having worked as a case worker, manager and policy adviser to then Labor minister Reba Meagher. She's still in contact with current workers, who call her for advice. ""I've decided to speak out because I'm concerned that things are getting worse,"" she said. ""It's not about the best interests of children anymore. It's all about being able to have an annual report that shows we've opened this many cases, we reacted to this many things. But it doesn't show outcomes. ""You can play with the system, so it looks like work is being done, when actually nothing's being done to protect children and help families."" She said there should be an external review into the department's practices. ""Matters go before the court with little understanding of the legislation and the opportunities that they've got to help families, rather than just remove children,"" she said. ""We hand over to NGOs [non-government organisations] with things that probably should be more fully addressed by the department itself. We've got the legislative responsibility to do that. ""Perhaps a royal commission would be the best answer … [but] it's got to have some teeth and it's got to have proper questions asked. It shouldn't be about the department being able to convene the show."" The outcomes for children who have spent their formative years in government care can be disastrous. Workers say suicide attempts are not uncommon among young people in residential care. And neither is ending up in the juvenile justice system and later, prison. ""Out of the 30 kids I grew up with, 25 are already deceased"" Bindi was about nine when she first entered the system. Like many former wards of the state, her own children, who identify as Aboriginal, have also been in care. We're legally not allowed to reveal Bindi's real name because that would identify her children. Now 30, Bindi says her life has been ""absolutely destroyed"" by the abuse she endured in care. When she was about 10, she was sexually abused by one of her foster fathers. In a residential care home years later, she says a worker made her perform a sexual act in the shower. ""I tried to report it a number of times. I just got told I was delusional and stupid,"" she said. Like many wards of the state, Bindi was in and out of juvenile detention. And just four months after she turned 18 and Victoria's Department of Families, Fairness and Housing closed her case, she became homeless. She says many of her peers from the residential care home are no longer here. ""Out of 30 kids I grew up with, 25 are already deceased. The rest of them are over in jail or on drugs,"" she said. ""Pretty poor statistics coming out of a department that's meant to protect children."" ""They have terrible outcomes and then they go into the prison system"" Mr McFarlane has worked in juvenile justice and, until 2012, in child protection. Of the two institutions, he said juvenile justice had a more ""therapeutic"" approach. Some of the families he worked with had been in state care for five generations. ""The department had been the parent for four generations prior, and often we would still pathologise the family and say that's the family issue. And I'm like, well, we've been the parent,"" he said. ""If we're taking fifth generations of children into care, it's intrinsically failed."" He believes Western Australia's Department of Communities contributes to the cycle of disadvantage. ""Mental health, offending stats, drug abuse — all of those issues are massively over-represented in kids who've been through the care system,"" he said. ""It should be dismantled and completely reconsidered from the ground up. Generations of children continue to be lost, stolen, broken."" ""I see kids who've been placed in residential care, who are too young, they're too innocent, and they're being … corrupted"" Far from protecting children, Kayla says Western Australia's Department of Communities puts children in harm's way. She still works there, so we cannot reveal her identity. Primary school-aged children, who should be nurtured by caring grown-ups, are dropped in group homes with much older children exhibiting at-risk behaviour. ""We have got rapists and kids who are breaking the law and smoking drugs — methamphetamine — they're lighting fires in the bush,"" she said. She remembers leaving a child under the age of 10 in one of these homes. ""This sweet little person, just absolute sweetheart, I felt like I was just throwing them into the den of wolves and walking away,"" she said. ""The thing that upsets me the most is when they got to the [residential] group home, they got their pyjamas out and wanted to put a movie on and have a shower and get ready in front of the TV — like they would have at home with all their younger siblings. And to the other kids at the group home that's laughable, that's ridiculous."" The child was ""constantly"" beaten and bullied by the older children. ""Within six months, they were talking about wanting to kill themselves,"" she said. She said the excuse that departments lacked time, money and staff was not good enough for the children who were driven to suicide in their care. ""Who's going to find those resources, who's going to find these workers? Let's have a look at that,"" she said. These were some of the more than 700 people intimately involved in the system, who contacted the ABC with concerns children are barely surviving, let alone thriving, under government care. They say a national intervention — by way of a royal commission or an external review — is required to expose the level of ineptitude in the departments and recommend how each family can be given the support it needs to overcome challenges. Lisa Wellington from Aboriginal women's health and welfare organisation Waminda said the child protection system had been failing Indigenous families since it had been set up. ""In order for change to happen, the department needs to engage with the Indigenous community and listen to the families and walk alongside them,"" she said. ""The government's done this in the first place, removed our children, they are responsible for making this happen."" Ian Gilfeather, who has trained child protection workers, said more funding would go a long way. ""The problems with the system are many — basically it's underfunded, it's under-resourced,"" Mr Gilfeather, who until 2020 was contracted by the NSW Department of Communities and Justice, said. ""A lot of those children who are reported, never get to see a case worker."" The ABC put the claims made in this story to the relevant state and territory departments. While they could not comment on individual cases, they insisted the safety of children was their top priority, and allegations of criminal nature were referred to the police. ""If an investigation is opened into the actions of a foster or kinship carer, we take immediate action to ensure the safety of any children in their care,"" a spokesperson for the Department of Children, Youth Justice and Multicultural Affairs in Queensland said. ""A range of safeguards are in place to ensure children in care are safe and thriving and that includes regular visits from child safety officers."" The department said recent reforms meant staff were working ""more intensely than ever before"" with families. The departments maintained racism was not tolerated, with the Tasmanian Department of Communities adding that departmental workers received training to ensure they were ""culturally competent"", and South Australia's Department for Child Protection saying staff had a responsibility to call out racism. The departments said significant steps had been taken to ensure Indigenous children were found culturally appropriate placements. The Western Australian government last year passed the Children and Community Services Amendment Act, with amendments that support Aboriginal children's right to stay connected with their culture. The state last year reported a 0.8 per cent drop in Aboriginal children in care, and 2.8 per cent decrease overall for children in care. Victoria's Department of Families, Fairness and Housing said it had the highest rate of Aboriginal children placed in kinship care nationally, and also the lowest rate of children in out-of-home care across the nation; while the NT's Families, Housing and Communities department said it had, for the first time in 40 years, recorded a ""significant"" reduction in the number of children in care, most of them Aboriginal. The departments said they openly reported data about children in care. Tasmania's Department of Communities said court documents did relate to the specific children, but some information ""may be replicated"" if there was a sibling group with the same family background. It said workers continued to triage lower priority cases while supporting families. The NSW Department of Communities and Justice (DCJ) said unallocated reports were triaged and ""dealt with appropriately"". ""DCJ has clear oversight and reporting measures to ensure work with families is purposeful and timely,"" a spokesperson said. The departments said steps had been taken to better support children in residential care homes. South Australia's Department for Child Protection said only one in 10 children in care stayed in group homes. The Australian Capital Territory, South Australian and West Australian governments said they were relying on new therapeutic care models, with the WA government last year committing $39 million over the next four years for these homes. Last year, Victoria became the first jurisdiction to offer support to all young people leaving care, until they turn 21. The governments also pointed to funding and staff boosts. As part of its Roadmap to Reform, the Victorian government over the last four years has allocated $2.8 billion to child protection services. The New South Wales government has committed $2.5 billion to support child welfare, and the Northern Territory government is partnering with the federal government to give $17 million to Aboriginal family support services. The South Australian government will review child safety laws in October, and the Tasmanian government is preparing to introduce a new crime of ""failing to protect a child or young person"". *Names have been changed. 1800 Respect, National counselling helpline: 1800 737 732 Bravehearts, counselling and support for survivors of child sexual abuse: 1800 272 831 Child Wise, counselling provider: 1800 991 099 Lifeline, 24-hour crisis support and suicide prevention: 13 11 14 Care Leavers Australia Network: 1800 008 774 PartnerSPEAK, peer support for non-offending partners: (03) 9018 7872 Find support services in your state or territory.

74,"analysis: Five words set NSW on the path to spend billions on women's inequality, but is the government too late?",politics,"  How five words set NSW on the path to spend billions on women's inequality, but is the government too late? When prominent businesswoman Sam Mostyn walked to the podium at the National Press Club in Canberra last year, few who followed NSW politics could have anticipated the impact it would have on policy in this state. She declared ""we need wholesale immediate change"" to increase female workforce participation and ensure respect for women overall. The date was November 24 and the freshly minted Treasurer Matt Kean was watching her speech on television from his office in Sydney and afterwards decided to call her. It set off a chain of events, that led to about $12 billion being committed in funding in the lead-up to Tuesday's budget directly targeting female inequality. The funding addresses three areas: economic opportunities, safety and health. The biggest spend by far— more than $10 billion — has been on improving affordability and accessibility of child care, and an overhaul of the preschool system, with the aim of making it more financially viable for women to get back in the workforce. The government wanted to ensure its plans did not go unnoticed, with the week leading up to the budget almost exclusively devoted to women's announcements. Days out from the budget, the billions committed to social issues is the Premier learning from the federal poll, expert says. There were three days of major childcare commitments as well as initiatives to get more women working in construction, and changes to parental leave for the public sector, entitling fathers to 14 weeks. Then there has been $100 million offered for domestic violence support services and anti-street harassment initiatives, both designed to address the safety aspect of the women's package. And there had already been health commitments around funding for IVF and menopause hubs. Many of these funding commitments are in direct response to findings from the government's Women Economic Opportunities Review, which was set up in February and chaired by Ms Mostyn. Last year, Mr Kean had been looking for a way for the state government to combat the growing wave of anger among female voters sweeping the nation and after watching Ms Mostyn's National Press Club address thought she could have the answers. He was one of the few government MPs who attended the women's March4Justice protest in Sydney in 2021, and unlike many of his Liberal colleagues in Canberra and NSW, decided it was a ""politically defining moment"". So, after speaking to Ms Mostyn eight months later, he set up the women's review with her as the head, insisted the findings would be the centrepiece of his budget and established a women's panel within the Treasury department to make it happen. And Premier Dominic Perrottet has been on board. Their determination to deliver the women-focused budget only deepened after the results of the federal election. Mr Kean's first budget as Treasurer is as much strategic as it is practical, it's sending a signal to women voters that they've been heard, finally. And voters might be forgiven for being sceptical about the pre-election epiphany of a government that's been in power for 11 years, almost five of which under the leadership of a female premier. In the 2019 state election, Gladys Berejiklian's appeal to women in the 30 to 50 age bracket was crucial to her success, and her connection to that voter group endured through her time in the top job. But without a woman at the helm, the government was left exposed to having low female representation within the Liberal Party as well as a lack of policies directed to women. There's also a personal side to the change of direction. Both the Treasurer and Premier are living the working family, juggle with young children. And Mr Kean concedes it's opened his eyes to the challenges facing many families. But while the Treasurer and Premier are positioning themselves as modern men based on their family home, not much is changing within the house on Macquarie Street. In February's by-election, the Liberals ran Tim James to replace Ms Berejiklian, the Premier appointed seven women to his 26-minister cabinet — just one more than under Ms Berejiklian's leadership. And in the past 13 months, when two Liberal positions became available in the Upper House, men were picked to replace the vacating male MLCs. Change obviously takes time and while the Coalition has been in power for more than a decade in NSW, it appears to be listening to women now. The question is: have female voters stopped listening to the Coalition nine months out from a state election?

75,"Police still keen on using facial recognition technology, despite Adelaide City Council's request not to",politics,"  SA Police could use Adelaide city facial recognition technology, despite being asked not to South Australia Police has indicated it will use the facial recognition capability of new security cameras being installed in Adelaide, despite being asked not to by the Adelaide City Council. The council is about to begin a federally-funded, $3 million upgrade of the city's ageing cameras, installing new, 360-degree units that will allow the use of facial and number-plate recognition software, matching faces to databases provided by the government or private companies. Currently, the existing network is monitored by SA Police, which already uses some facial recognition tools in certain investigations. Last year, the council — noting concerns about the lack of legal safeguards for facial recognition — voted to ask police to provide a formal undertaking to delay its use of that feature with the new cameras until new laws are passed. ""We are comfortable funding the CCTV camera upgrades,"" Deputy Mayor Arman Abrahimzadeh said. ""We know that these upgrades are necessary for public safety and we've sought an assurance from SA Police to assure us that that facial recognition component won't be turned on until such time that legislation is in place."" However, SA Police are yet to agree and, in a statement, told the ABC the technology would be useful. ""Facial recognition technology can significantly speed up investigations by automating the viewing of large volumes of vision, a painstaking task for investigators. ""There is no legislative restriction on the use of facial recognition technology in South Australia for investigations. ""Should a facial recognition capability be available, investigators will consider the seriousness of the matter and evidentiary value when determining if it is appropriate to use the technology."" The existing cameras are frequently used to investigate and solve crimes. However, facial recognition is a relatively new capability with little current regulation. Australia does not have dedicated laws governing the use of facial recognition technology and last year the Human Rights Commission recommended the federal government enforce a moratorium on its use in ""high-risk settings"", such as law enforcement, until stronger safeguards are in place. Facial recognition is widely used to identify and monitor citizens in China. In Australia, some major retailers have been using the technology without most of us knowing. ""It seems to have had no public consultation, no public discussion and certainly no parliamentary discussion on how it will be implemented, used and utilised,"" SA Greens MLC Tammy Franks said. ""We know that, for some demographics, more than four out of five identifications are incorrect. ""If you had fingerprints wrong, more than four out of five times, the police wouldn't be using it. ""So, if the police are going to use facial recognition technology, we need some safeguards in there around our privacy but also whether it works."" Premier Peter Malinauskas said the state government had asked the Attorney-General's Department to conduct a review of current laws. ""I think every South Australian has confidence that when SAPOL are using facial recognition technology, it's all about keeping the community safe … [but,] wherever that occurs, we've got to make sure we've got the appropriate framework in place that people's individual liberties and privacy isn't compromised,"" Mr Malinauskas said. The council is due to vote at the end of the month on whether to begin the camera upgrades. A public meeting on the issue will be held on June 27 at the Adelaide Town Hall, with the council due to vote on whether to approve the first tranche of funding for the new cameras the following evening.

76,"Giving up insurance, choosing meat-free meals and skipping breakfast: What Australians are doing to survive the cost-of-living crisis",politics,"  Giving up insurance, choosing meat-free meals and skipping breakfast: What Australians are doing to survive the cost-of-living crisis Living on a houseboat comes with a few perks. Unlike his mates on the mainland, Arthur White isn't dealing with skyrocketing rental prices or anxiously anticipating interest rate hikes. There are some downsides too, though, like having to source your own electricity to boil a cup of tea. And life at sea hasn't been enough to shield the retired pensioner from the cost of living crisis engulfing Australia. Electricity supply issues hit a tipping point on the east coast last week, driven by the soaring cost of wholesale energy and high winter demand. There are now warnings the cost of household energy bills will balloon within weeks. But far away in the Gove Penisula, in the northeast corner of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, Arthur has already figured out a solution to his very own energy crisis. ""I generate my own electricity using solar panels during the day, and a small generator in the evening — in the past, that used about eight litres of petrol a night,"" he says, ""so you can imagine why my costs have gone through the roof"". When Russia's war in Ukraine triggered a global oil supply crunch, the 73-year-old found he was paying about $2.70 for a litre of petrol just to keep the lights on. Australians across the country have felt similar pain at the bowser, as fuel prices exceeded $2 a litre in capital cities last month. The spike meant Arthur was no longer able to afford the same groceries he usually could on his weekly pension of just over $500. With everything from mortgage rates to grocery prices and energy bills going up, more Australians are under financial pressure. We want to hear how it's impacting you. An answer to his problem came in the form of a $275 wind generator, which has reduced his fuel costs by about 60 per cent or $189 a fortnight. ""The good thing is at this time of year we get a fair bit of wind,"" he laughs. ""If I hadn't bought that, as the weather warms up again, I would have been at a point where I wouldn't be able to afford the food I need to sustain life."" Arthur's experience, while undoubtedly unique, is not an isolated one. Across cities, the regions, and even the sea, Australians from a variety of income levels are suddenly having to find new ways to keep costs down. While for some this looks like investing in renewable energy or starting a vegetable garden, for others it has meant going without basic necessities. ""I can imagine how bad it is for pensioners like myself living on shore, who pay rents, rates, electricity, and water,"" Arthur says. ""The way it's going now, I consider myself lucky."" Over the past few months, an unwelcome bounty of financial stresses have begun to stack on top of one another. During the pandemic, we got our first taste as thousands of workers suddenly found themselves out of a job. As Australia ushered in the new year, things were looking up with the end of lockdowns and the reopening of international borders. But that soon brought its own challenges; with migrants back in the country and rental vacancy rates at record lows, it didn't take long for rental prices to creep up. Soon came the pain at the bowser. With the war in Ukraine in full swing, petrol prices soared, adding further pressure to already cash-strapped families. Then, this month, the Reserve Bank increased interest rates by half a percentage point and warned that further rises were likely, leaving borrowers biting their nails. Philip Lowe has warned Australians they need to be prepared for substantial interest rate rises over the rest of this year, conceding he is not sure how high they might go. And now we have lettuces selling for more than $10 a head in some supermarkets, an inflation rate of 5.1 per cent that is only set to grow, and energy supply issues that could see household bills skyrocket. It's a lot to keep track of, and according to Edwina MacDonald, the acting chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Services (ACOSS), the result is nothing short of a ""crisis point"". ""We've got these converging crises — cost of living, increasing energy costs, a double whammy of COVID and flu season, and we're going into a really cold winter,"" she says. ""We know people are already struggling to just afford the basics, and with increasing inflation, it's only going to get worse."" In response, the Fair Work Commission last week announced a 5.2 per cent increase to the national minimum wage, bringing it slightly above inflation. In practice, this means an extra $40 a week for those on the lowest wages. But with the Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe warning that inflation could hit 7 per cent by Christmas, many say it's only the tip of the iceberg of what's needed. ""What that decision is doing is addressing inflation and making sure people aren't falling behind,"" MacDonald says, ""but we certainly need to do more to improve the lives of people on low and modest incomes"". When looking at the load of financial pressures Australians are under, the obvious next question is what can households do to make it out the other side? The answer is different for everyone, given these pressures are not felt evenly across the community. ""People on low, fixed incomes often have much less ability to adapt to these cost of living increases in ways that don't cause them poverty,"" says Professor Roger Wilkins, an expert on socioeconomic disadvantage at the University of Melbourne. Long searches, skyrocketing prices and diminishing quality. Sydney's housing market is cutthroat, and desperate renters are paying the price. It's this group that have found themselves having to choose between paying their electricity bill and buying medication or buying petrol and being able to afford their rent. ""These are just unacceptable choices in a fundamentally wealthy country like Australia,"" MacDonald says. ""No one should be having to make a choice between really basic needs like that."" But when it comes to households with more room in the budget, there's a wide range of ways people typically respond to increased financial pressure. The first, Professor Wilkins says, is dipping into savings. But savings are ultimately finite, and for many the next step is reducing discretionary spending, whether that's giving up trips to the cinema or putting off buying that new washing machine that you kind of need, but not really. There's growing evidence, however, that people often treat items as discretionary that ""really shouldn't be"", Professor Wilkins says, such as opting to reduce insurance coverage or ditch it completely. ""And that then makes them much more exposed to risk, say you crash your car, then you can't afford to fix it, and that means you can't get to work,"" he says. ""Everything is interlinked, so everything is on the table of how people respond to it."" The above list of cost-cutting measures is all too familiar to John O’Driscoll, a father of two teenage boys from Melbourne's outer suburbs. After almost a year of unemployment due to a pandemic-induced redundancy in 2020 and with a new mortgage to pay for, he's found he and his wife's full-time incomes are no longer enough to keep up with their lifestyle. One of the first expenses to go was health insurance, a difficult decision for the 52-year-old. ""We're at the age when you want insurance, so it wasn't something you take lightly,"" he says. Since then, trips to the cinema, streaming subscriptions, and takeaway have all been stripped from the budget. In the kitchen, tofu has started popping up more regularly in place of meat, snacks in the pantry are scarce, and discount boxes of ""ugly"" vegetables are a staple. ""Where before I would go to the coffee shop a couple of times a week, we don't do that anymore — we just don't go out,"" he says. ""You keep getting rid of little bits and pieces."" John explains that his situation is not so bad compared to many others doing it tough — for now, he can still afford his fixed-term mortgage payments, his children's private schooling, and to put food on the table. But still, he says, it's like running just to stand still. ""At one stage, my pay seemed to be alright, we lived comfortably — but over the years, it just seemed like my wages didn't go up as the prices of things were constantly going up,"" he says. ""I've never felt the worry I feel now."" It's a similar story for Deanna, another new homeowner in Melbourne's outer suburbs, who did not wish to use her surname. The 29-year-old works full-time in a ""pretty stable job"" and her partner owns a small electrician business. But after breaking their budget to purchase a home a year ago, they're anxiously anticipating further interest rate rises. Industry groups are warning that consumers already battling surging costs are set to face more pain as the price of everything from food and flights to the weekend drive soars. ""We're stretched to our limit in terms of mortgage repayments,"" she says. ""And everything I am hearing and feeling with the cost of living and potentially interest rates going up in the future, I, like many other people, am trying to make cuts now."" On top of the usual tricks to reduce the cost of grocery shopping — buying from affordable farmers' markets and eating mostly plant-based meals — Deanna has quit her psychology sessions and cancelled her gym membership as a first step to getting ahead on their mortgage. ""On a good week when there were no extra expenses, then it was fine,"" she says. ""But when things come up, like my dog needs surgery, I need to cut back those expenses."" Like John, Deanna stresses that she's aware of her privileged position — that she does have expenses that can be eliminated without compromising basic needs — but says the added financial pressure is constantly front of mind. ""Looking at it from mortgage repayments, I think 'well what's going to happen if I'm on maternity leave, or trying to manage on one income', all those logistics that I've never had to think about before,"" she says. ""I don't think we're in a position right now where we're acutely financially stressed, but it's the anticipation of what's to come."" The reality of the situation is far different for millions of Australians who were living below the poverty line long before the cost of living crisis hit headlines. More than three million Australians are believed to be living below the relative poverty line, set at $457 per week for a single adult (equivalent to 50 per cent of the Australian median household income), according to a 2020 report by ACOSS and the University of New South Wales. The majority of these people rely on government welfare for their income. The current Job Seeker rate for unemployed Australians currently sits at $321 a week — below half the median income and the Henderson poverty line of $493 for a single person as of the December quarter. At OzHarvest food bank in Waterloo, in Sydney's inner suburbs, people in the line — many of them reliant on government support — are quick to list the ways it's become harder to survive in recent months. Max, who did not wish to use his surname, says he's been on Job Seeker since he was stood down from his job as a caterer at Sydney Airport during the pandemic. With two young children to support, who are with him in line, he's been relying on the food bank to save money for other expenses. ""Everything is getting more expensive,"" he says. ""Electricity bills, water, internet — my kids are going to school and need an internet connection, I can't say 'oh no, sorry, I don't have money to pay the monthly internet bill'."" He believes this is the ""hardest time in Australia for everyone"", describing conversations he's had with people at supermarkets, despairing at the cost of cucumbers. It's a perspective shared by Tim, a pensioner who describes OzHarvest as ""a life saver"". ""You go to Coles and Woolies, and broccoli is $7 — you've got to wait for weeks until it comes down to a reasonable price and then you might be able to buy it,"" the 71-year-old says. ""Each week, I go to Aldi, Woolies, and Coles to see what's the cheapest, and I've got a walking stick."" For Anna, a psychology student at the market for the first time, the cost of surviving is sometimes eating just one meal a day while she looks for casual work. With no end in sight for the current crisis, Professor Wilkins reiterates the serious consequences for people living on the poverty line. ""What it means is increased hardship, amongst a group that already face a lot of hardship, and when you get increased hardship you get increased stress, mental distress, family conflict, poorer health, and more suffering,"" he says. ""What it translates to is the lived experience of Australians, in some cases, being intolerable … People say money doesn't make you happy, but it's sure hard to be happy without money.""

77,People in regional NSW travelling for medical treatment to get financial boost,politics,"  More than $140 million in NSW budget for regions to help with travel for medical care The state government is set to almost double the rebates for people in regional areas who need to travel for medical treatment. It has allocated an extra $149 million in Tuesday's budget for the Isolated Patients Travel and Accommodation Scheme (IPTAAS). The changes mean the rebate will increase from 22 cents to 40 cents per kilometre for patients who drive in their car more than 100 kilometres for treatment. The subsidy for a one- to seven-day stay away from home will be boosted from the current $43-$60 to a $75 flat rate. And rising to a $120 flat rate when patients spend more than seven nights away. The government said it means a person travelling for cancer treatment over a 12-month period will go from getting $2,931 back to $5,365 on average. ""What this announcement does is put families and people at the centre of this program to make sure they can get the access to services that they need,"" Minister for Regional Health Bronnie Taylor said. The shortcomings of the scheme were raised in the parliamentary inquiry into rural and regional health services. Earlier this year, it recommended the scheme should be reviewed as a ""matter of priority"". Ms Taylor said the increase in funding directly relates to the findings. ""This has been a long-standing issue,"" she said. The charity Can Assist, which provides assistance to cancer patients, welcomed the announcement. ""At Can Assist we deliver $2 million worth of assistance every year, about half of that is in travel and accommodation costs,"" the charity's Majella Gallagher said. ""So clearly IPTAAS hasn't been enough to help people."" Ms Gallagher said the extra funding will also allow charities to redirect their money to other support services. ""It'll mean we will be able to help more people across different requests — whether that be utilities, food, out-of-pocket pharmaceuticals,"" she said. ""We will be in a better position to deliver all that extra help, which is what we should be doing, and not doing the government's job."" Last year, 26,000 people in NSW accessed the rebate scheme, but the government wants to increase those numbers to more than 45,000 by expanding the criteria. The government has also included specialised treatments such as high-care dental services and foot treatments for diabetics in the scheme and for patients undergoing clinical trials. People living in Broken Hill, Inverell and Tamworth have used IPTAAS the most in the past. Jon and Dani Anderson from Cootamundra know too well the financial cost of lifesaving treatment away from home. Eighteen months ago, Jon was diagnosed with brain cancer and has spent long stints in Sydney for surgery and treatment. ""Nobody is sitting around with big fat bank accounts to cover everything,"" Mr Anderson said. Wife Dani said they thought they would have to sell their house. ""We were sitting there all of a sudden thinking we've got a $30,000 treatment bill,"" she said. But they received financial support from Can Assist and IPTAAS. ""Can Assist and the government funding is as much a lifesaver as the treatment is,"" she said. ""Personally it was really everything,"" Mr Anderson said. ""It enabled us to afford treatment we wouldn't be able to afford otherwise.""

78,'Small price for unity': Dominic Perrottet backs $25 million costing for Aboriginal flag plan,politics,"  Dominic Perrottet says $25 million cost to fly Aboriginal flag on Sydney Harbour Bridge a 'small price to pay' for unity NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet says the estimated $25 million to permanently install the Aboriginal flag on the Sydney Harbour Bridge is a ""small price to pay"" for unity. Mr Perrottet said he is not sure why the project costs so much, but backed it as an ""important decision"" for state. The state government announced that costings to fly the flag year-round on the Sydney landmark will be included in Tuesday's budget. Funds have been allocated to install a 20-metre-high third flagpole at the bridge's summit, with the aim of being completed by late this year. At a press conference, Mr Perrottet was asked how the government arrived at its $25 million price tag. ""I don't know. But it does, apparently,"" he said. ""I'm even surprised it takes this long. I mean I made the announcement a while ago and the first brief that came back was that it takes two years to do. ""I'll go to Bunnings myself and climb up there and put the pole up. ""But apparently it does, apparently that's the costing, and I think that it's an important decision that we've made. ""I think it brings unity to our country and I think it's a small price to pay for that unification."" Former premier Gladys Berejiklian had resisted calls for the flag to be permanently flown during her tenure. The plan was formally announced by the government in February, and came after a petition led by Indigenous artist Cheree Toka which gained 177,000 signatures. The Aboriginal flag will fly alongside the Australian flag and the NSW flag atop the iconic structure. It had previously only flown for 19 days per year.

79,Community gardens offer free produce — and a chance to learn new skills — as rising costs bite,politics,"  Community gardens offer free produce — and a chance to learn new skills — as rising costs bite At a time when an iceberg lettuce can cost as much as $12, a trip to the supermarket can easily stretch many household budgets to the limit. Community gardens could be the answer many Australians have been searching for. They have been sprouting up across a wide range of local communities for decades. Although the exact number of community gardens is unknown, there are hundreds registered across Australia, so chances are there is one in your neighbourhood. While some are fenced off and may require membership, others are open anytime, to anyone. Husband and wife Josh and Tallara Palmer helped set up the Gum Tree Community Garden project at Littlehampton in the Adelaide Hills. They say there was never any question about making it free and accessible to the whole community. ""It's open to anyone — it's a safe space for everyone to kind of come and mingle and join together — and it was really about bringing the community together and connecting people in a day and age when we're not as connected,"" Mr Palmer said. ""When I drive past, I see people in here chatting and gardening together and that's what it's really all about."" The garden, like many others, also offers a Grow Free! cart system where locals can drop off excess produce for their neighbours. Stuart and Valerie Gilmore are regular volunteers at the garden and help maintain it all year round. ""It's giving back to people. It's wonderful in this particular community to be able to sort of come together,"" Mr Gilmore said. ""It's so lovely when you think about all the people around here can come in, they can get something free."" Mr Gilmore said it was a chance to connect with neighbours and to help each other out. ""Things are tough and the young families out there. Some of the mums [who] have popped in with their children have expressed that … during COVID, some of them lost work or their work hours were reduced, so the fact they could come in and get something free and take that with them was obviously going to help out at home,"" he said. Greg Martin is among a group of residents who helped set up the Walyu Yarta Community Garden in Adelaide's southern parklands more than a decade ago. ""We got together and lobbied council — that took a long time because this was the first community garden in the parklands,"" he said. ""Over the years, they've come to really think this is an asset in the parklands, which I think it is, and [the council] have been very supportive."" Mr Martin has helped keep the garden running since its inception and says he has learned a few tricks along the way. ""I didn't know anything about gardening, but you come down here and you meet people who have gardened for 40, 50 years and are a wealth of information so you learn a lot just by being with them,"" he said. He says residents in nearby city apartment buildings have also come to value the social aspect it brings. ""This is a marvellous opportunity for people who might feel a little bit isolated in the city that they can come down and meet their neighbours,"" Mr Martin said. Although some people may feel shy about taking produce for free, those who run the gardens say they should not be reluctant. ""People use the garden the way they want to use it,"" Mr Martin said. ""It's a really lovely thing and it's great for us, too, because — although we might be giving — we're also receiving because people feel so pleased being a part of it,"" Mr Gilmore said.

80,New South Wales government announces $780 million shared-equity housing scheme,politics,"  New South Wales government announces $780 million shared-equity scheme to address housing affordability Frontline workers, single parents and older single people will be eligible for a shared-equity scheme to assist in buying a home under a NSW government plan. The state government has committed $780.4 million to the program, which closely resembles a policy brought to the federal election by the Albanese government. It would see the state government contribute up to 40 per cent of equity for a new home, or 30 per cent for an existing property. Teachers, nurses, police officers, single parents and single people aged 50 years and over would be eligible for the shared-equity scheme. Premier Dominic Perrottet said NSW's scheme would run as a two-year trial and work ""hand-in-glove"" with the federal government's program. ""We want to make sure that people right across New South Wales have that opportunity because we know home ownership is crucial to growing wealth,"" he said. Mr Perrottet said it would be part of a ""suite of measures"" that would also include a push to boost housing supply. Initially, the government will help in the purchase of 3,000 homes per year, but Mr Perrottet said that could be expanded if the program was successful. The Premier expected his government's plan would ""double"" the number of homes available to the eligible cohort. People will need to earn a maximum of $90,000 individually or have a combined income of $120,000 per year to be eligible. They will have to contribute a 2 per cent deposit under the scheme on homes worth up to $950,000 in metropolitan areas and $600,000 in regional areas. Metropolitan areas include Sydney and regional centres the Central Coast, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, the Mid North Coast and the Illawarra. Treasurer Matt Kean said about 60 per cent of properties in the state's housing market fell within that price range. Mr Kean said older singles, particularly women, were ""too often falling through the cracks"" when it came to housing and the government's plan would help get them ""back on their feet"". ""It's a huge area of growing social need,"" he said. More housing affordability measures are expected to be announced this week as the state government prepares to hand down its budget on Tuesday. Mr Perrottet has flagged his desire to scrap stamp duty fees, which he has described as ""the worst tax any government can have"". He has said, however, he needs federal government support do so. NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet says his party wants to scrap stamp duty for property purchasers but cannot act without the support of the federal government. The Premier said his government's shared-equity scheme leveraged off its commonwealth counterpart, a plan which was admonished by the former Morrison government. Asked if his federal Liberals colleagues would change their tune, Mr Perrottet said: ""They'll see the light"". ""I think it makes sense,"" he said. ""It's very easy, when governments or oppositions float reform ideas, for people to come out and knock it and say it wont work. ""I will always encourage federal governments, state governments to look at new ways of thinking, new ways of doing things, to provide great social outcomes."" Mr Perrottet said last week's national cabinet meeting was the ""most collaborative"" that he had been to.

81,'Not the life I planned': Suzanne goes to bed early because she can't afford to have her heating on,politics,"  Rising electricity prices, cost-of-living pressures pushing Tasmanians to the limit For Tasmanian pensioner Suzanne Cass, making ends meet is so difficult that she rations her food and limits leaving her home. In Tasmania, the average residential power bill will increase by $220 from July 1 The Tasmanian Council of Social Services says the increase comes at the worst time for people already struggling to make ends meet However, the government has announced a winter assistance package to help concession card holders cover some of the increase ""We now only go out when we absolutely have to because of petrol prices and, if we have to go out, we make sure we do more than one thing,"" she said. ""We don't put heating on until four or five o'clock, so the house is quite cold all day, and you go to bed early because you just can't afford the heating."" Her scrimping and saving, made harder by the rising cost of living, is set to go to another level when a 11.88 per cent rise in electricity prices takes effect next month. That rise will see the average annual residential bill rise by about $220, while the average business will pay $176 more. ""It's just one hit after another. It means you can do less,"" Ms Cass said. ""I'm anxious, depressed, worried. It's not the life that I planned … I just never expected at this time in my life that I'd be living like this. ""I used to buy salmon every so often and now I don't do that. ""There's no special treats any more because you just can't do that. Everything you buy, you have to be really careful with and you have to ration it."" Tasmanian Council of Social Services chief executive Adrienne Picone said the increase could not come at a worse time for many Tasmanians. ""We're in the midst of a very severe Tasmanian winter and, added to that, we've got skyrocketing costs — of food, of housing, of petrol — that are really pushing households' budgets to their limit,"" she said. ""We know that, in Tasmania, we have some of the lowest wages in the country and, when we couple that with the rising cost of living, it really means that people are pushed to their limits and really struggling to make ends meet."" The state government has announced a winter assistance package to help people cover the increase. That package will include a $180 discount for eligible electricity concession account holders, $61 of which was already budgeted for. The energy saver loan scheme has also been boosted, offering residential customers, landlords and small businesses an interest-free loan of up to $10,000 to invest in energy-efficient products to lower their electricity bill. However, Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) chief executive Michael Bailey said the government should announce extra support to help businesses afford the pay rise. ""We recognise that care needs to be taken in intervening in the energy market, to ensure that we can protect consumers as well as providing confidence to investors,"" he said. ""The TCCI is calling on the government to consider carefully targeted assistance to businesses most exposed to price shocks, such as those looking to re-contract at this difficult time.""

82,LNP comfortably retains Queensland seat of Callide in by-election,politics,"  LNP comfortably retains Queensland seat of Callide in by-election The LNP has comfortably retained the Queensland seat of Callide in a by-election held yesterday. The ABC's chief election analyst Antony Green declared the LNP's Bryson Head the winner of the seat, which spans an area from central Queensland to the Western Downs. As of Sunday morning, Mr Head had claimed 49.89 per cent of the vote, well ahead of Labor's Bronwyn Dendle in second, with 19.56 per cent. Callide was previously held by LNP's Colin Boyce, who resigned after becoming the new federal member for Flynn in May. Queensland LNP leader David Crisafulli said Mr Head would add new depth to state parliament. ""He'll be the youngest member of the parliament,"" Mr Crisafulli said. ""But his background is something that I think people will find refreshing— from a farm, works in the mining industry. ""And he ran a campaign based on the issues that matter … better health care, better law and order and fixing roads … and people really responded to that."" Mr Head, 26, is a self-declared ""farm boy"" and has worked as a geologist in Australia and Canada. He said the region needed better access to healthcare and better roads. ""A lot of people from central Queensland have to sit in an ambulance and head to Rockhampton because minor surgeries can't get done here,"" he said in the lead-up to the by-election. ""In the southern end, in Chinchilla, they get sent to Toowoomba. ""I'll be very much advocating to see our health system fixed."" Mr Head said primary industry was also his ""bread and butter"".

83,"What energy crisis? WA forges ahead with renewables transition, as others struggle to keep lights on",politics,"  WA forges ahead with renewables transition as other states face energy crisis It's been a big week in the world of power — although for different reasons depending on which side of Australia you're on. As much of the country struggles to keep the lights on, WA has taken a significant step in its renewables transition, announcing the end of state-run, coal-fired power plants by 2030. It's expected to have a big impact on household bills in the future, but why is it happening now, and what does it all mean? Here's a rundown of this week's local energy news. The WA government had previously committed to retiring parts of its largest coal-fired plant, the Muja power station. Western Australia will do away with coal power by 2029, leaving the state's electricity hub without its major industry. But this week, we found out what happens next — as it announced plans to close both of the coal-fired plants run by state-owned power provider Synergy by 2030. By phasing out coal-fired power, Synergy estimates its carbon emissions would reduce by 80 per cent by 2030. On top of marking a significant turning point for the nearby coal mining town of Collie, it's a big shift for the state's energy network. To make up for the capacity being lost, the government will spend $3.8 billion over 10 years to add more renewable capacity to the grid. WA's power grid is changing, leaving less room for coal to fit into the mix. Last year alone, about 300 megawatts of rooftop solar power was added to the grid – almost as much as the smaller of the two state-run plants. It means during the day there's little or no need for the coal-fired plants to run, but that causes issues because coal plants aren't designed to be turned on and off. It takes 18 hours for a plant to go from being switched off to fully operational. The government isn't giving a straight answer, but says sticking with coal-fired power would ultimately be more expensive. Premier Mark McGowan said if the coal plants continued to operate, bills would rise by about $1,200 a year by 2030. Instead, he committed to keeping power prices capped in line with inflation until at least 2025. At the same time, the government is also hoping these changes can make Synergy more self-sufficient and less reliant on government grants. Over the next four years, the government is planning to give Synergy $783.3 million in ""financial viability"" subsidies. Effectively, that's money that recognises Synergy doesn't always act like an ordinary business, because there are times when it has to do things for reasons other than financial gain. But it's hoped that by increasing the mix of renewable energy, Synergy's costs will be lower. Some of the capacity will be replaced by renewables already being added to the grid – including rooftop solar. But there still needs to be an ability to provide power when the sun isn't shining, or when there's extra demand. That's why the new projects outlined in this announcement include 800MW of wind capacity and 2,000MWh of storage – including fast-start lithium-ion batteries. In welcome news for the town of Collie, the government is also looking into other technologies, including pumped hydro. When renewable energy is available, it uses that power to pump water up a hill, ""storing"" the energy. Then, when the power is needed, it's allowed to fall back down the hill, through a turbine, which adds power into the grid. But the government isn't locking itself into just these schemes, with Synergy given some latitude in how it invests the $3.8 billion it's receiving. The government is holding out on hydrogen for a little bit longer. ""In the future we would expect hydrogen to be able to replace natural gas, but that's currently not financially viable,"" Energy Minister Bill Johnston said this week. Over the last year, about 31 per cent of the power in the South-West Interconnected System, which covers most of the state's population, was provided by gas, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator. New gas-fired power stations have been ruled out beyond 2030, and the government says it's not likely there would be a need to build any before then. ""But we'll be very cautious in our approach as we move towards 2030, and if we need to take action we will,"" Mr Johnston said. Part of WA's hydrogen future will be centred around the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, north-east of Port Hedland. The government this week announced BP would take a 40.5 per cent stake in the hub, which is planning to generate both wind and solar power, as well as producing green hydrogen. The Premier made clear he was confident this plan would secure WA's energy supply into the future, and the state would avoid the issues being experienced elsewhere. Part of the reason for those issues has been the nature of the electricity market in the east, which is vastly different to WA's state-owned system. Skyrocketing gas prices have also contributed, but WA largely doesn't have to worry about that because of its domestic reservation policy. That policy means 15 per cent of gas reserves within the state's jurisdiction are quarantined for the local market. It's good news, both for now and into the future, with WA planning to rely on gas for more of its base-load power, given it can be fired up in as little as 16 minutes. ""When you have a reservation policy with gas, you can turn gas power stations on immediately,"" Mr McGowan said this week. ""When you have pumped hydro and batteries, the technology now is so good that you can provide base-load power using those mechanisms combined."" A group of academics from all five of WA's universities this week accused the state government of being too close to the gas industry and said closing the coal plants was only part of the solution. ""Their emissions are less than the four alumina refineries that we have in the state and far less than the LNG production facilities that we have in this state,"" Curtin law school academic Hugh Finn said. On the other side of the coin, energy policy specialist Katharine McKenzie said the plan was exciting because it allowed for much more detailed planning than had previously been possible. She said it also made economic sense, given how expensive coal plants were becoming. ""But you also see that that large amount of rooftop solar that's come in, there's a real opportunity to make the most of that and aggregate it so that it acts almost like a power station itself,"" she said. That's the aim of Synergy's Project Symphony, which is trying to work out how the utility can leverage solar panels and batteries to work together more efficiently. Trends within industry are also accelerating the shift away from coal as businesses try to decarbonise, creating even more opportunities, according to Ms McKenzie. ""They're very much looking at replacing their current use of fossil fuel generation with renewable energy, but they're also looking at where they're directly using fossil fuel in their processes, how they can replace that with direct renewable energy as well,"" she said. ""And so coming out of that you have this enormous amount of demand for renewable energy coming in, and that needs to be filled."" It means the private sector is also likely to start coming to the table, now that the government's plan is public. ""So the WA government have said that they will commit $3.8 billion to developing new renewable projects, and potentially pumped hydro,"" Ms McKenzie said. ""There's obviously a role for the private sector as well.""

84,"'I am never going to Ipswich Hospital again': Mayors, patient say hospital inadequate for booming region",politics,"  Mayors call for urgent funding in face of 'dire' shortages at Ipswich Hospital Three mayors have sounded the alarm over what they describe as a capacity crisis at Ipswich Hospital. More than half of the hospital's elective surgery waiting list has been sent to private hospitals since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and one third of residents are leaving the region for care. Ipswich Hospital also called 29 internal emergencies in the 12 months to April — 12 of those due to bed capacity issues. The West Moreton mayors of the Ipswich, Lockyer Valley and Somerset regions are pleading for urgent funding for the health service days out from the Queensland budget, voicing concerns the hospital is too small for the rapidly growing population it services. The West Moreton Health Service encompasses Ipswich, the Lockyer Valley and Somerset Regions west of Brisbane and has the fastest-growing population in the state and is tipped to almost double to 588,000 within 15 years. Needs of residents are also greater than average, with health service data revealing nearly two thirds of residents occupy the bottom two fifths of socio-economic disadvantage, 38 per cent are obese and nearly half of deaths are premature. Queensland Health said in March Ipswich Emergency admitted 7.4 per cent more of the most serious cases —  Category 1 and 2 patients — than in the same period last year. The suburban centre has one of the worst performing emergency departments in the state, seeing just 54 per cent of 17,674 patients within the clinically recommended time in the March quarter. But Mayor Teresa Harding, who is a member of the Liberal National Party, said capacity issues at Ipswich were inadequate before 2020, when COVID arrived. ""Our health needs were well behind before the pandemic, now we're in dire need,"" she said. ""It's very concerning for us that the people here are not getting the treatment. ""They pay their taxes, they work hard, they should be getting that health care and that treatment right here, where it's close to their homes and their families."" If you have any further any information about this story, email Jemima Burt. While it appears Ipswich Hospital is getting through its waitlist, thousands of elective surgery patients have been treated at private hospitals. Since February 2020, approximately 5,300 patients were ticked off Ipswich Hospital's elective surgery waiting list. But more than 3,000 of those were sent to other private hospitals through Queensland Health's Surgery Connect program. Currently there are about 1,800 people waiting for elective surgery at Ipswich Hospital, but another 9,600 are waiting to get on that list. In the three months to March, just 268 patients received elective surgery, and just half of category 2 and 3 surgery patients were treated within clinically recommended times. During that period, Queensland put elective surgery on hold again to deal with the Omicron wave. Graham Lehmann, mayor of the Somerset Region, is worried about how the region will fare in a decade given the service is unable to cope with existing demand. ""My biggest worry is people not being able to get health care,"" he said. ""There's people sitting out there on waiting lists now that have been pushed back and pushed back and pushed back. ""Some of those people have passed away before they've even got to have their operation, that shouldn't be happening."" Currently there are about 1,800 people waiting for elective surgery at Ipswich Hospital, but another 9,600 are waiting to get on that list. About one third of West Moreton residents are leaving the region for care, people like Andrew Stanstuick, who lives just 12 kilometres from Ipswich Hospital but said he will be paying for an Uber to Brisbane next time he becomes unwell. The Redbank Plains resident in his 50s suffers from chronic back pain, related to a prolapsed spinal disc injury. In February his GP advised he call an ambulance when a disc shifted in his back, leaving him unable to walk or toilet. Hours later he was picked up and taken to Ipswich Hospital, where he said he was left ramped in a corridor for approximately an hour. ""They took me off the ambulance took me through reception out back and then took me into a corridor where there were probably eight other people waiting on trolleys,"" Mr Stanstuick said. ""After about an hour or so I was taken into one of the rooms in emergency basically the curtains around you … the doctor came and saw me and disappeared … she came back and said, 'Well, we've got no beds for you, so we'll have to send you home.""' Mr Stanstuick said he then walked to a police station around 2am and an officer drove him home. ""I will pay for an Uber. I'll pay for a cab. I will get a lift with a neighbour or something. I am never ever going to Ipswich Hospital again, I don't care what it's for,"" he said. Queensland Health would not comment on Mr Stanstuick's situation. While there are a range of factors at play, the mayors said the prevailing issue is that Ipswich Hospital needs to be expanded. The health service has a plan to expand and has completed a $2.4 million business case for the construction, but the multi-million-dollar expansion is yet to be funded. ""The greatest need here is that we need the Master Plan — that has been approved by the Department of Health to be funded,"" Ms Harding said. The mayors say funding needs to be targeted at the areas of greatest need. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory.

Last year the Queensland Government spent $177 million to expand public beds at a private hospital in Springfield, a rapidly growing suburban area, but Lockyer Valley Mayor Tanya Milligan said that funding could have been better directed. In a week's time, the Queensland government will hand down its budget — and it has promised a record spend on health. In a statement, outgoing West Moreton Health chief executive Dr Kerrie Freeman said that more than $146 million had been spent on master-planned infrastructure for the service since 2019. That included a state-of-the-art medical imaging facility, a new 26-bed ward at Ipswich Hospital, an oncology day unit and Allied Health outpatient services and the construction of a 64-bed Acute Mental Health Unit.

85,"Gemma turned to NSW scheme to raise flood-prone homes, five years on she's still waiting",politics,"  NSW government scheme to raise flood-prone homes puts lives at risk, Murwillumbah flood survivors say When Gemma Martin's Murwillumbah home was inundated with waist-deep water in 2017, she turned to the New South Wales government to help pay for it to be lifted out of danger. Five years on, having survived yet another life-threatening flood, she is still waiting for news. ""It's not a matter of not enough money, it's a matter of not prioritising human lives over other ventures,"" she said. Ms Martin is interested in having her home lifted on stilts through the state government's voluntary house-raising scheme. Under the program, the state funds two-thirds of the costs of a house to be raised above the maximum flood level. There is also an option for residents to sell eligible homes to the government in order to move to higher ground. This year, around $2 million was committed to these schemes for the entire state under the Department of Planning and Environment's Floodplain Management Program. Ms Martin has been quoted $45,000 to raise and restump her home. She said $2 million is inadequate. ""It's pitiful considering the cost of raising and the cost of purchasing homes,"" she said. While the schemes exist, residents say the lack of available money makes it totally inaccessible. And Ms Martin says she can't live through another flood. ""I just can't do this again … and I don't want to sell my house to another family who's going to have to go through this. We desperately need help."" Leesa Hallahan, who lives on the same South Murwillumbah street, is also waiting to find out if she will be helped to raise her home, or if the government is open to purchasing it. She said the delay is putting lives at risk. ""Not just from the floods, but from people not being able to make it mentally or emotionally or financially,"" she said. ""We're living with the constant fear of losing everything again, or even potentially our lives, [or] your neighbours."" Months after deadly floods inundated large parts of NSW, people in South Lismore are in the midst of a daunting clean-up. Eligible local councils are responsible for applying to the state government for the funding. The Department of Planning and Environment has confirmed Tweed Shire Council has received $2.8 million through the program since 2017 — most of which has been spent on purchasing or raising properties. Mayor Chris Cherry said the amount is nowhere near enough. ""We think we need a one-off contribution of around $300 million to try to get people out of the floodplain, and then ongoing, around a $100 million mark,"" Ms Cherry said. She admitted it was not good enough for residents like Gemma to be left waiting for funding news for up to five years. ""We, as government, have let them down and we need to allocate serious resources to it now, because this is a way we can actually really help people to recover,"" she said. Ms Cherry said an immediate investment was needed to secure the safety of people living in the Northern Rivers. ""These are people's lives and we can keep giving them money to help buy their things again, or we can actually step in and change our thinking and help them get out of the situation because they can't get out of it on their own — and they need state government help,"" she said. ""State government is very, very prepared to come in … and help people buy things back, help them reassemble their homes, but if it's just going to keep happening again and again … let's be smart about it. ""Let's pay what is quite a big investment now, but it's an investment in our future and then our community's future."" In a statement, a spokesperson for NSW Department of Planning and Environment said since the 2012-2013 financial year, councils have purchased 52 homes through the program. ""Councils can seek funding for additional properties to be raised or purchased at any time,"" they said. The government is also waiting for the flood inquiry to announce its findings at the end of July, with announcements expected to follow.

This week, consumer group CHOICE revealed retail giants Kmart, Bunnings and The Good Guys have been using facial recognition technology to capture the biometric data of consumers in some of their stores. Bunnings told CHOICE it was used to ""identify persons of interest who have previously been involved in incidents of concern in our stores"". Kmart and The Good Guys did not respond to the ABC's requests for comment. As part of its investigation, CHOICE asked more than 1,000 people what they thought about this technology – 65 per cent said it was concerning and some described it as ""creepy and invasive"". You may agree, but it's worth considering how this kind of surveillance stacks up with the decisions we make every day to give our personal data and images away willingly. Sharing selfies on social media platforms, using a streaming service or loyalty card all divulge more personal information than the facial recognition technology CHOICE was probing. Although Meta, the global behemoth that owns Facebook and Instagram, stopped using the tech last year, that doesn’t mean your pictures aren't still harvested by companies who build searchable databases of faces. That might be news to many people, and it may even prompt some to delete their accounts. Most won't. ""The algorithms will interpret these photos and use those results to better identify the individual captured in the surveillance image,"" said Dennis B Desmond, an expert in cyberintelligence at the University of the Sunshine Coast. And it doesn't matter if they are high- or low-quality images. ""Bad or blurry images are also useful in training the algorithm, since surveillance imagery is not always full face, front-facing, or clear and non-pixelated,"" he said. Dr Desmond said many people don't understand what they can obtain in exchange for giving up a certain level of privacy. In Osaka, Japan facial-recognition tech is used at some train stations to let people pass through turnstiles without having to get out their travel card. Retailers rely on it to reduce shoplifting. They can be notified if someone who has stolen from the store before enters it again. Law enforcement agencies across Australia use it to disrupt serious and violent crime, as well as identity theft. Dr Desmond said if people heard more about these tangible benefits, they might have a different attitude. ""People see a lot about the collection, but they rarely hear about the use of this data for interdiction or prevention,"" he said. But our feelings towards this technology, which was first conceived in the 1960s in the US, likely won't change until there's more transparency. Online, people can somewhat restrict what data is stored by changing their cookie preferences. But, short of wearing a disguise, we can't opt in or out of facial recognition when it's used in settings like retail. In fact, there's no right to personal privacy in Australia, and no dedicated laws about how data obtained through facial recognition can be used, unless you live in the ACT. Sarah Moulds, a senior law lecturer at the University of South Australia, doesn't believe facial recognition is inherently bad, but said three crucial elements need clearing up: consent, quality and third-party use. If people haven’t consented to surveillance, if they can’t trust the vision is high quality and if they don’t know who the data is being shared with, they have a right to be concerned, Dr Moulds said. High-quality imaging is of particular importance to reduce racial biases, as the technology is most accurate at identifying white men. Because of this, Australia's Human Rights Commission has warned against using facial-recognition images in ""high-risk circumstances"". “We should not be relying on this technology when it comes to things like proving the innocence of someone or determining someone's refugee status or something like that,” Dr Moulds said. For a lot of people, it won’t really matter if their face is scanned in certain settings. Things become more complicated if that biometric information is combined with other data, like their financial or health records. Experts say from that combination, someone could infer things like how much you earn, what your educational level is and what you get up to on the weekend. It could also help companies make decisions on whether to give you credit, insurance, a job. The list goes on. “It becomes kind of like the Minority Report … people worry companies are going to make decisions on my health care based on the fact that I'm buying chocolate every week,"" Dr Desmond said. But the reality is, this kind of data is already available through our online activities, which have been harvested and sold for years. Notwithstanding that, Dr Desmond said lawmakers need to take a more proactive approach to regulating facial recognition. ""I think there absolutely needs to be more government regulation and control over the technologies that are employed in the commercial sector when they involve the privacy and the rights of individuals,"" he said. Dr Moulds said tougher laws are also imperative if vulnerable people — such as those without formal identification documents — are to be protected from the potential misuse of artificial intelligence. And, ultimately, there will always be people who just want to enjoy the freedom to be forgotten when they walk out of a supermarket. ""[Because] as we have seen, neither the government nor the private sector have very good records of keeping our data safe from loss misuse,"" Dr Desmond said.

87,NSW Premier defends Barilaro's appointment as US trade envoy amid claims of 'jobs for mates',politics,"  NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet defends John Barilaro's appointment as US trade envoy amid claims of 'jobs for mates' The appointment of former deputy premier John Barilaro as NSW trade commissioner to the US has been defended by the Premier amid criticism it is another case of ""jobs for mates"". Mr Barilaro's new role was announced on Friday and came after a ""rigorous global talent search"" by recruitment firm NGS Global, according to a statement by the state government. His posting is among six trade posts around the world tasked with spruiking the state's investment opportunities and local businesses— at a cost of about $55 million according to NSW Labor. Leader Chris Minns was quick to criticise the decision, branding it a ""$400,000-a-year job for a friend"". Earlier on Saturday, Premier Dominic Perrottet said the former Nationals leader was the best person for the job. ""It doesn't come as any surprise to me that the independent process that occurred, that he was by far the most outstanding candidate,"" he said. ""And recommended by that panel to the government and I'm sure he will do a brilliant job."" Mr Barilaro, who resigned late last year just days after former premier Gladys Berejiklian, played a role in setting up international trade initiative Global NSW. It was this experience and his skill set that Mr Perrottet said would make him a strong advocate for the state — at a time when it needed to be more ""aggressive"". ""When I went to London in my former role as treasurer … we weren't at the back of the room. We weren't even in the room when it came to driving investment into our state,"" he said. ""The deputy premier in his former role was instrumental in setting that up and our direction going forward."" Mr Minns found the announcement ""perplexing"" from a government committed to change and proclaiming it was not stale after 11 years in power. ""The same old Liberal Party and the National Party jobs for the boys, jobs for the mates, looking after their own before the interests of the people of New South Wales,"" he said. ""We're genuinely expected to believe that a global search took place, effectively bringing in people from around the world to determine who's best to represent the interests of this state and the answer all along was John Barilaro?"" He also said a government seeking another term in office needed to do better given the current climate of inflation, staff shortages and concerns over wages. ""Teachers or nurses are leaving the profession in droves because they've been told repeatedly by the Premier of New South Wales that there isn't enough money to … make life a little easier on the frontline of our public services.,"" Mr Minns said. ""And yet there's more than enough money to make sure that jobs are available for friends of Mr Perrottet."" In accepting his appointment, Mr Barilaro — who recently settled his defamation case against Google — said he would continue to build on what had already been achieved. ""I'm looking forward to supporting NSW companies to export and expand to the United States,"" he said. ""Including the many fintech, cyber security, space, health and food and beverage companies. ""We are already helping to succeed in the US through the Going Global Export Program."" Former national chief executive of the Australia-China Business Council Helen Sawczak was also appointed to the role of Senior Trade and Investment Commissioner to Greater China. It is expected Mr Barilaro and Ms Sawczak will relocate to commence their new jobs in the coming months.

88,'You should feel safe': NSW government promises major women's package in budget,politics,"  NSW budget to include $100 million investment in women's safety measures The NSW government has announced a $100 million investment to women's safety in public places, at home and in the workplace as part of next week's budget. The multi-faceted package is the latest in a series of budget announcements that focus on social issues across the state. It also follows calls from domestic violence service providers for more support in the upcoming state budget. Here's what's been promised. To ensure women's safety in public spaces after dark, the government will spend $30 million over two years to provide more street lighting and CCTV in public parks, as well as foot traffic upgrades. The program will initially focus on Parramatta park and The Rocks precinct in Sydney before expanding across the city and into regional areas, with more locations to be announced in coming months. It will also include an anti-street harassment campaign to shift community attitudes. ""We are making sure we are listening to women and girls and providing safer cities,"" Minister for Women’s Safety and the Prevention of Domestic and Sexual Violence Natalie Ward said. Treasurer Matt Kean said too many women were scared walking around Sydney at night. ""I have heard too many stories of women taking the long way home to avoid dark streets, or calling a friend while walking in case something goes wrong,"" he said. ""When women are walking home from work they shouldn’t have to fear what's lurking in the shadows."" To counter sexual harassment at work, $4.8 million will be spent on a new taskforce administered by Safe Work NSW to make sure employers are taking initiatives to eradicate harassment of employees. The taskforce will have a particular focus on training and guidance in certain industries that are male-dominated. ""Safe work will be focusing on those high-risk workplaces,"" Minister for Fair Trading Eleni Petinos said. ""We know sexual harassment is a problem in our workplaces … one-in-four women reported sexual harassment in the last five years."" The program will aim to hold more employers accountable if they don't comply with their responsibilities to keep female employees safe. Ms Petinos said it would deliver on the 2019 Respect at Work Report by Australia's Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Kate Jenkins, which found harassment at work was both prevalent and pervasive. The government has also allocated $69 million for a project called Safer Pathways that will provide more integrated support systems for domestic violence victim-survivors. ""We are continuing to make our justice fairer, less traumatic, quicker and less expensive for all participants, especially victim-survivors of D and sexual violence,"" Attorney-General Mark Speakman said. The investment will deliver more case management services to victim-survivors and enhance the database used by police to refer people onto support services. Audio-visual link facilities in approximately 50 NSW courts and tribunals will also be expanded to allow victim-survivors to give evidence remotely, thus minimising trauma. Court-appointed officers will also be trained to cross-examine survivors, after laws made last year that prevent self-represented defendants examining domestic violence complainants. Days out from the state budget, billions of dollars have already being committed to social issues, in what an expert says is Premier Dominic Perrottet learning from the federal poll. ""It's an absolute travesty that one-in-six people across our great country suffer from sexual harassment or violence from a current or former partner,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""We have made big inroads over a period of time but it’s still a blight on our state and nation. As a government and a people, we need to do better."" Sexual violence survivor and anti-violence advocate Amanda Morgan, who is the founder of Make a Seat Australia, said these changes were not only necessary, but long overdue. ""I feel this injection of money is so important … it's going to change lives,"" she said. ""Having an integration like this will mean we do have education, support and communication between different services.""

89,"Julian Assange will fight his extradition to the US, and Australia has precedent to help",politics,"  Britain's government has approved the extradition of Julian Assange. What now? The British government has approved the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to the United States after he fought for years to remain in the United Kingdom. For more than 10 years, the US has been trying to put the 50-year-old Australian on trial over the publication of classified documents. WikiLeaks said it would challenge the order, but what comes next and what avenues can they take? In 2010, WikiLeaks released more than 91,000 documents, most of which were secret US military reports about the war in Afghanistan. That same year, the publication released some 400,000 classified US military files chronicling the Iraq war from 2004 to 2009. It’s the largest leak of its kind in US military history. US authorities want the WikiLeaks founder on espionage charges but his supporters say he was exposing war crimes and abuses of power. The British government orders the extradition of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to the United States, but WikiLeaks says it will appeal against the ruling. Mr Assange had been granted political asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and lived there from 2012 to 2019. In 2019, the US Justice department formally asked Britain to extradite Mr Assange to face charges in the United States. Since April 2019, Mr Assange has been in the Belmarsh maximum-security prison while his case went through the British legal system. Hearings into his extradition began in February, 2020, but were delayed until September because of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early last year, the judge in the case concluded that it would be “oppressive” to extradite him to the US because of his frail mental health, saying there was a real risk that he would take his own life. However, that decision was overturned on an appeal after the United States gave a package of assurances, including a pledge Mr Assange could be transferred to Australia to serve any sentence. Following that court decision, Britain’s interior minister, Home Secretary Priti Patel, signed an order overnight authorising Mr Assange’s extradition. The Home Office said in a statement that the government had to approve his move to the US because “the UK courts have not found that it would be oppressive, unjust or an abuse of process to extradite Mr Assange”. Mr Assange's lawyers now have 14 days to lodge an appeal. Nick Vamos, the former head of extradition at Britain's Crown Prosecution Service, said verdicts were regularly overturned by the High Court. Mr Assange would be able to claim, again, that the extradition request was politically motivated and use new evidence, such as his allegations that the CIA had plotted to assassinate him. “We’re not at the end of the road here,"" his wife, Stella Assange, said. “We’re going to fight this.” Mr Assange's lawyers said they would mount a new legal challenge, and legal experts say the case could take months or even years more to conclude. ""We will appeal this all the way, if necessary, to the European Court of Human Rights,” Mr Assange's attorney, Jennifer Robinson, said. Ms Robinson asked US President Joe Biden to drop the charges brought against Mr Assange during Donald Trump's presidency, arguing they posed a “grave threat” to free speech. Barrister Greg Barns said court cases take time. ""It's been two or three years since the first extradition hearing, I think 2020 the first extradition hearing, to now,"" he said. ""If the court ends up going to the European Court of human rights, which it could do, it will take a number of years."" ""This is an Australian whose mental and physical health continues to decline."" Australian independent MP Andrew Wilkie has called for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to pick up the phone now and demand an end to what he's described as ""madness"". Filmed over two years across the UK, Europe and the US, this two-part documentary follows 76-year-old retired builder John Shipton's tireless campaign to save his son, Julian Assange. “In some ways, it's not surprising, because the UK government has generally taken a hands-off approach to the Assange case,” Mr Wilkie said. “We've been saying this is a political matter, and has been from the start. “We're urging and hoping that now is the time for Australia to get involved with its key allies in London and Washington and bring this matter to an end.” Mr Wilkie’s demands for the Prime Minister to talk to his UK and US counterparts has the backing of a number of crossbench MPs including Monique Ryan, Allegra Spender and Zali Stegall. Mr Assange's family have vowed to fight the decision using every possible legal avenue. Mr Barns said the federal government needed to intervene. ""There are a couple of important things to remember about the case,"" he said. ""The first is whilst it's been in the courts, it's no longer in the courts, it's a political decision. ""The second point is Australia can use its relationship with Washington to bring an Australian back to safety. ""We saw it with David Hicks almost 20 years [ago] now, who found himself in Guantanamo Bay. ""The Howard government at the time brought him back to Australia. This is not unprecedented. It is important that Australia is able to use the great relationship it has with Washington to ensure the safety of Australians.""

90,"The risk of corruption has 'intensified' in Queensland, CCC report warns",politics,"  Corruption watchdog releases report on lobbying of the Queensland government A report by Queensland's Crime and Corruption Commission suggests the risk of corruption had ""intensified"" inside the state government, amid a surge in lobbying. It found a small number of key groups and individuals appeared to have a ""disproportionate amount of access"" to the government and could be using those relationships to ""influence government decision."" ""In some instances, the individuals or groups afforded access have long-standing and close political or personal connections with the decision-makers or government they are seeking to influence,"" the report, published on Friday, said. ""Further, in some circumstances these individuals have been engaged by a political party or government agency while still involved in influencing practices, such as lobbying."" Meanwhile, the report, Influencing Practices in Queensland, also found there had been ""a substantial increase"" in lobbying activities in the state. ""The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated economic recovery efforts, appear to have contributed to the recent surge in lobbying activities in Queensland,"" the report said. The man appointed by Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to examine government culture and accountability raises new integrity concerns in an interim report just released. The report also revealed that 14 per cent of public service employees had seen or suspected there to be pressure by the private sector on department employees. While 11 per cent had seen or suspected there to be pressure from the private sector on elected officials. The report also stated how, in recent investigations, it found individuals or groups to have groomed or developed relationships with key people to exert influence over government decisions. In an audit in 2021, the CCC identified 103 discrepancies between the records held by public authorities and contacts listed on the Lobbyist Contact Register in Queensland. ""While there may be no overt quid pro quo, a person who has ingratiated themselves to a decision-maker over a long period of time may benefit from that person's favourable view of them,"" it said. It also acknowledged that a relationship between lobbyist and elected official was not necessarily an indicator or cause of corruption. However, it was noted that it could cause a conflict of interest and increase the risk or perception ""of favouritism or undue influence"". The CCC aims to examine the extent to which contact between lobbyists and government and opposition representatives are has been accurately recorded by public authorities. ""The audit will involve examining the records of a sample of public authorities, including state government departments and local councils, as well as members of parliament and ministerial offices,"" the report said. It said the audit would allow it to proactively assess and identify any activity or associations that might put the public interest at risk. The CCC suggested in the report that it could conduct a public hearing if one were warranted. The CCC said the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games carried ""a heightened risk of improper influence"". ""In Queensland, the government has already commenced planning and recruitment for the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games,"" the report said. ""As high-profile projects and developments are announced, there will be increasing demand for positions and contracts."" Opposition Leader David Crisafulli said the Games were not about ""special favours, for special mates."" ""We want to make sure that the delivery of infrastructure is done on time and on budget, that the best contractor gets the job the most worthy, not those with the most influence,"" he said. He said overall the report was a ""deeply troubling development"" in the Queensland integrity crisis. ""It shows a culture that is rotting through the state government, a culture where lobbyists have unfettered control, unfettered access, and where it is all about the inner workings of the political process, not how we can serve Queenslanders,"" Mr Crisafulli said, ""There is no doubt that the level of influence from Labor lobbyists in Queensland is at frightening levels. ""Unless we have a full-blown royal commission into the way that government runs in Queensland, we will continue to see the murky relationship.""

91,"New SA rental price statistics show just how much, and where it's costing more",politics,"  New rental price statistics show 20 per cent increase in SA, with Murray Bridge a hotspot Private rental prices have shot up 20 per cent in the past two years in South Australia, according to new figures from the SA Housing Authority. Rents have particularly increased in towns south of Adelaide and in Murray Bridge, according to the data gathered from bonds submitted with Consumer and Business Services. While not as high, rental increases are more consistent in the Adelaide metropolitan area, with rent in every postcode increasing over the past two years. Across the state, the average house rental has increased from $350 to $420 for leases starting in January–March 2022 compared with two years earlier. The number of houses available has dropped from 10,245 per quarter to 7,760. Among the highest increases have been in towns south of Adelaide, such as Willunga, Myponga, Sellicks Beach and Clarendon, where rents have gone up by between 40 and 67 per cent, depending on the location. Julie Parsons, a property manager based in McLaren Vale, said the increase was due to high demand for properties to buy — including from interstate people able to work from home — and low supply. She said the area offered a country lifestyle while not being far from Adelaide or Victor Harbor. ""A lot of landlords have been selling so tenants have had to vacate,"" she said. Single mother of four Kirsty Rich was one of those tenants. She had to leave her home of six years in Aldinga Beach and was homeless for three months last year — couch-surfing and using motels — before finding a place about 45 kilometres away. ""It can happen to anybody now. Everybody who rents is uneasy,"" she said She spent all her time looking for a new rental and had to move her children to a new school. ""It was so awful,"" she said. She has bought land near where she is living now — thanks to help with the deposit from her parents and from an ABC Radio Adelaide listener — but faces eviction from her home again, with the new landlord looking to sell. It could take up to 12 months to move into her new home from her rental, due to delays in council approvals and getting work started. ""It's taken me 12 months to find my ground again and I'm looking at the prospect of six to 12 months not knowing where [I'm] going to be,"" Ms Rich said. While the largest rent increases were in the small towns of Stansbury, Quorn and Andamooka, the highest increase for a major town was in Murray Bridge — at almost 70 per cent. It now costs $450 a week on average to rent a house in the town 75 kilometres south-east of Adelaide, compared with $265 in January–March 2020. Murray Bridge Mayor Brenton Lewis said it was a matter of ""supply and demand"" with the town's economy thriving after setbacks such as the Thomas Foods abattoir fire in 2018. He said the town's population of 23,000 was growing and would one day overtake Whyalla and Mount Gambier. ""There's not enough rentable accommodation across a range of types of accommodation,"" he said. ""It's a good thing and a bad thing … People are starting to realise it's a very liveable place. ""It's not that far from the city and we have a lot of employment — a lot of it is in the food processing industry but not all of it."" He is hopeful with new developments around the corner and building supply issues easing, the situation can be eased within 12 months. Shane Maddocks, the chief executive of ac.care — the homelessness gateway service in Murray Bridge — said rents were simply becoming unaffordable for people on benefits or low incomes. With everything from mortgage rates to grocery prices and energy bills going up, more Australians are under financial pressure. We want to hear how it's impacting you. ""So we're seeing more people in housing stress than ever before and we're seeing increasing support needs for food and other services,"" he said. According to the SA Housing Authority, there were only 15 vacant public housing properties in the town in 2021, out of 630 owned by the state government, while another 10 were untenantable. With private rentals going up, Mr Maddocks said fewer people could now afford to leave public housing, so no vacancies were opening. ""But we've also got people fully employed often on reasonable incomes who can't find rental properties,"" he said. Apart from some rural areas, only Gawler and Angle Vale had rental decreases, due to a large number of houses coming on to the market in the commuter towns north of Adelaide. Rents for units shrunk 7 per cent in the Adelaide CBD, with fewer international students looking for apartments. The most expensive postcode to rent in South Australia is 5065, which includes the suburbs of Dulwich, Glenside, Linden Park, Toorak Gardens and Tusmore, immediately south-east of the Adelaide CBD, at $700 per week.

92,analysis: Another energy crisis suggests little was learned from SA's infamous state-wide blackout,politics,"  South Australia has already had an energy crisis like this, but it seems there are still lessons to be learned A suspended electricity spot market, rolling blackouts because of supply shortages, a ""botched transition"" to renewable energy – these terms were all used to describe the state's energy crisis of 2016/17, long before the troubles of today. But has anyone learned from SA's hard lessons in those difficult months for the state's energy sector? The situations have many parallels. As Australia sizzled in the heatwaves of the 2017 summer, the country's energy market was in crisis. In SA, demand exceeded supply and 90,000 homes and businesses in Adelaide were cut off from power. New South Wales faced a similar situation two days later. Months earlier, SA had gone through its infamous 2016 blackout, a cascading failure of infrastructure and systems that sent shock waves through the electricity sector. Now, energy companies are again considering cutting customers off from electricity, not because they can't generate enough, but because there isn't enough to buy. Both crises are very similar, said Danny Price, the managing director of Frontier Economics, who was hired to advise the SA government after the blackout. ""We saw the same thing in South Australia and we're seeing it again now six years later,"" he told the ABC. Mr Price blames the Australian Energy Market Operator, AEMO, for the problems. ""This is a systems operator failure,"" Mr Price said. The agency's job is to manage the National Energy Market and ensure there is enough supply of electricity and gas. It can influence or control what energy companies do, what they pay for gas, and what they are paid for electricity. In 2016 and 2017, AEMO was criticised for failing to ask electricity generators to ""spin up"" reserve power ahead of the one-in-50-year storm that triggered the statewide blackout. Although the question of who was to blame for the multiple failures that led to SA's ""Black System"" remains contentious. Generators who were paid to provide ""black start"" capacity in the event of a system failure were not able to do so when everything went dark. After power was restored, AEMO then suspended the electricity spot market in SA for two weeks. Today, with ageing coal generators failing and the price of gas skyrocketing, Mr Price said AEMO had not reassured electricity companies they would make enough money if they bought more gas to generate extra power. ""This is another failure by AEMO… to convey how people should respond to administrative pricing versus directions,"" he said in reference to the AEMO decision to suspend the national electricity spot market. Electricity generators had been withdrawing capacity from the market after AEMO imposed price caps, for fear they could not cover their costs, forcing the operator to direct them to supply electricity and triggering compensation arrangements. ""The real evil out of this is because it then generates this belief in politicians and regulators that the generators are doing something wrong, so the public has been turned against the generators and it's not their fault,"" Mr Price said. ""They're just responding to the incentives and directions they've been given."" In 2017, Mr Price helped the then-Labor state government lease and install emergency power stations to ensure the state wasn't left short again. But those generators were never used and were later privatised by the subsequent Liberal government. Mr Price said states should consider doing the same thing again to ensure there is adequate generation capacity as coal power stations age. ""They should take their own actions,"" he said. ""I would encourage every state to think about exiting the national electricity market arrangements, just get out of it. They don't need to be in it. ""It's not necessary to stay in the national electricity market to keep the lights on this, it is just a completely broken heap of rubbish. ""States need to take back control themselves because nothing nationally is going to happen which is going to be in their interest."" AEMO said the current problems are due to planned and unplanned outages at power stations, an early start to winter, low output from wind and solar farms and planned outages in transmission infrastructure. It declined to comment on Mr Price's criticisms and referred questions about its management of the energy sector to its statement on the suspension of the National Electricity Market. ""We are confident (these) actions will deliver the best outcomes for Australian consumers, and as we return to normal conditions, the market based system will once again deliver value to homes and businesses,"" that statement said. But Mr Price said the reliance on ageing coal power stations to cover peak demand periods in winter and summer while the grid transitions to renewables was going to make things worse in the future. ""If anyone thinks this is going to go away, it's not, because every day that these generators are run and run harder because of the requirement to do so to meet demand, they get more and more worn out,"" he said. ""They don't get fresher over time. They get more worn out over time. So this problem only gets worse."" The director of the energy program at the Grattan Institute, Tony Wood, said AEMO was not to blame for the problems. ""I think there was just enormous frustration on both sides with the situation, I think the market had failed, the market wasn't responding to the way markets work and therefore you had to admit, the market had failed and implement what they've done and when they fix the physical system, normal service will be returned."" He also urged states not to consider leaving the National Electricity Market (NEM). ""I think all the states benefit,"" he said. ""Now, whether or not there are things about the NEM that are not by any means perfect, and all the work to sort out the capacity mechanism and the way interstate generation gets built, and so on, is a work in progress that hasn't been done as quickly as should have been."" ""(But) South Australia at times benefits by sending electricity to the other states, because generators get paid for that. ""When you've got more than we need, and you benefit by getting electricity from the other side. And all the states benefit from that.""

93,Cheyenne is days away from being homeless with her two young children,politics,"  Queensland families on brink of homelessness as calls grow for action to address housing crisis Single mum Cheyenne Stephensen is days away from being homeless with her two young children. The 25-year-old's rental in Brisbane's outer-western suburb of One Mile at Ipswich is being sold, so she has to move out by next month. Despite having a good rental history, she's been applying for dozens of properties and can't find a new place within budget on her single-parent Centrelink income. ""I had a selling agent tell me the owners wanted to sell and I literally cried because we're in the middle of a rental crisis, I can't work and I have two little kids,"" she said. ""Because I get a certain amount of money I can't use more than 30 per cent for rent, so that puts me between $290 to $300 per week for a rental. ""I've applied for places that are like $240 for a little two-bedroom unit but I still get knocked back. ""Basically they're inundated with multiple people applying. ""People are offering six months in advance and for people who are desperate to get into a home so they're not homeless, we can't actually do that."" Ms Stephensen has an acquired brain injury and can't work or drive while she recovers. She's now planning to move into her dad's two-bedroom apartment where she'll sleep on a mattress on the floor with her young kids while the property hunt continues. The mum of two's story isn't unique as Queensland grapples with low private and public rental stock, unaffordable house prices and soaring costs of living. Real Estate Institute of Queensland CEO Antonia Mercorella said the rental market in Queensland was the tightest on record and there was a perfect storm causing the housing issues. ""We've never seen anything like this,"" she said. ""We are seeing across all corners of the state vacancy rates are below 1 per cent in many cases. ""In addition to that, the sales market has been performing in such a strong way, which is great news for vendors but very difficult for purchasers, so it's very challenging conditions at the moment. ""And what we're also seeing as a result of COVID is housing supplies are going up and builders are very scarce at the moment, so it is somewhat of a perfect storm."" New figures from the Department of Communities, Housing and Digital Economy reveal the state government has built only 326 new social homes this financial year as of June 12. That's just over half of what was built in the previous financial year, with 631 constructions completed in 2020/21. And it's the smallest number of homes built in the past five financial years, with 576 social homes built in 2019/20, 612 built in 2018/19 and 576 built in 2017/8. The data shows a total of 2,721 new social homes have been completed by the state since 2017. On Friday, in response to questions from the ABC, a spokesperson from the housing department said as of 16 June the state had delivered 391 new social homes this financial year, with up to 438 forecast to be delivered by the end of June. ""The department also exceeded the 2020-21 completion target by 184, resulting from a number of new homes that were delivered earlier than originally planned that would otherwise have been completed in early 2021-22,"" the spokesperson said. ""We continue to aim to complete homes as quickly as possible to make these available for Queenslanders in need however the department, like the broader market, is experiencing project delays due to the exceptionally difficult market conditions driven by material and labour supply shortages."" Ahead of the state budget being handed down on Tuesday, there have been calls from councils, community service and industry bodies for an increase in social housing funding. Queensland Council of Social Service CEO Aimee McVeigh said state funding had failed to keep pace with the housing crisis, and accelerated construction of social housing was needed. ""Queensland is currently in the midst of a housing crisis,"" she said. ""We have more than 50,000 people on our social housing register. That has grown by almost 80 per cent in the last four years. ""In the last 20 years, Queensland's population has grown by about 48 per cent and the Queensland government is saying we're expecting an additional 1.4 million people into the state in the next decade. ""When you consider those things together it is clear that the type of investment that was made by the state last year needs to be reflected in each state budget. ""We need to be building at least 5,000 houses per year for the next decade funded by both the federal and state government."" Last year's state budget outlined a $1.9 billion spend over four years to increase the supply of social housing and upgrade the existing portfolio. A $1 billion Housing Investment Fund was also set up, with its returns to contribute about $160 million in extra funding over the forward estimates to increase supply. At the time, Treasurer Cameron Dick said the money would allow the government to accelerate commitments and build 6,365 new homes over four years. He said between 2017 and 2025, there would be a total of 8,845 homes built. Shadow Housing Minister Tim Mander said social housing was a state responsibility and there needed to be a larger state spend on new and affordable housing. ""There were grand announcements made last year but the result is that there's been less than a 1 per cent increase in social housing over that period of time,"" he said. ""In the meantime, we've had more than 50,000 on the social housing wait list, they aren't keeping up with the demand. ""Queenslanders that are sleeping in parks, and couch surfing don't want empty promises, they want houses built and this government isn't doing that.""

94,"Billions on social issues in NSW budget a bid to win over disaffected Coalition voters, expert says",politics,"  Billions in NSW budget for Premier's social agenda a bid to appeal to disaffected Coalition voters, expert says Billions of dollars have already been announced ahead of Tuesday's NSW budget, with childcare, women and health the biggest benefactors so far. The early childhood sector is set to receive more than $12 billion, including $5.8 billion over 10 years to introduce universal pre-kindergarten for all children across the state by 2030. Professor Andy Marks from the Centre for Western Sydney said the initiatives were part of an effort to sell the Premier Dominic Perrottet's social agenda ahead of the state election next March. ""The Premier will be looking at the recent federal poll. He'll be looking to appeal to the groups that felt disaffected by the Coalition nationally,"" he said. ""Treasurer Matt Kean has said this is a budget for women. It is very focused on social agenda issues, big spending on health, palliative care, free preschool, all of those measures that you normally wouldn't associate with a Liberal National Coalition. ""They're really focusing on moving away from hard infrastructure. So, putting down the hard hats and the high-vis vests and going more for something that reveals the Premier's social agenda."" A $4.5 billion spend in health over four years is for the hiring of 10,000 new staff, including 1,048 doctors and 3,517 nurses. There's also $743 million over five years to improve palliative care, including employing an extra 600 nurses, allied health professionals, doctors and support staff. However, the NSW opposition and the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association have questioned how all those people will be found. ""They can't meet [those targets], because there's not enough nurses in the system today to meet the demand. There's not enough teachers in our classrooms today to meet the demand,"" Opposition Leader Chris Minns said. Nurses in NSW's south-east say throwing money at health workers will not improve working conditions as they continue to push for more staff per shift. The NSW Nurses and Midwives Association says the challenges go beyond recruitment and are also to do with retention. ""There's thousands of nurses out there … who hold a qualification, who are not working in the system today because the workloads are not tenable,"" the union's Michael Whaites said. Mr Perrottet this week acknowledged the shortages of staff in a variety of sectors, saying skilled migration would be key to filling those jobs. ""Naturally, over time, now that our borders are open, people will be coming back into Australia,"" he said. On Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the current visa backlog was being addressed, with extra staff pulled from other duties to help clear it. Professor Marks said skilled migration would be one way to fill those gaps, but longer-term reforms would also be needed. ""I think reforms to accelerate skilled migration are inevitable. They're very much needed, particularly in the health and allied health workforce,"" he said. ""But there are other triggers that we can pull and other structural reforms we can make, domestically, and we should have been making for a long time. ""Anything that frees up the participation of women in the workforce is a very immediate way to accelerate the uptake of key positions in health, in particular."" While most of the major announcements so far are long-term reforms, the Treasurer argued that there's still enough in the budget to ease the short-term cost-of-living pain. ""We know many families are doing it tough. We're seeing household bills increasing,"" Mr Kean said. ""We've announced a 40 per cent discount on tolls. We've announced cost-of-living relief on energy bills. ""We've announced a number of initiatives to ease cost of living for families already but we also need to focus on the future."" Professor Marks said it would be a challenge to get the balance right between reform and urgent, hip-pocket measures. ""There's a slow burn with really serious reform. It takes time: reforms to stamp duty, reforms to the federation around health. Those things really are long-term goals,"" he said. ""What we're seeing now, though, in the economy, is real urgency around cost of living, so people will expect him to act. ""He has to learn through this budget process and ahead of the election, how to manage both sets of expectations.""

95,"Ongoing aged care restrictions have caused heartache for larger families, and they won't be axed any time soon",politics,"  Brian Ridge visits his wife, Denise Brown, who lives with Alzheimer's disease, in her Perth aged care home almost every day. As they sit together, she has a cup of tea and a scone, and he asks her if she loves him. She says she does, and he replies, ""I love you too"". The couple have been able to maintain their bond throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions on visitors to residential aged care facilities and hospitals, designed to protect the most vulnerable people. ""I usually take her for a drive, we go down the coast,"" Mr Ridge said. ""She loves to look at the water, especially if the sun's sparkling on it. It's really good."" Limits on visitors to aged care homes, hospitals and disability support accommodation are some of the last remaining COVID-19 restrictions. More than 30 per cent of COVID-related deaths across the country have occurred in residential aged care facilities, according to federal Department of Health data. Under the current West Australian health directions, authorised by the state's Chief Health Officer Andrew Robertson, only two people can visit a resident in an aged care home each day, to limit any spread of COVID-19. Mr Ridge and his wife's sister are usually the only ones who visit her, and he believed the current settings were right. ""I don't think you can have open slather when we've got things like COVID,"" he said. ""It's just too dangerous. And these people are really susceptible."" In hospitals, patients are allowed up to two visitors during visiting hours, as well as any ""approved visitors"", such as parents and carers. But not everyone has had the same experience with visitor rules as Mr Ridge, especially people with larger families. ""It's very distressing for families when they are not able to see their loved one as often as they would like to,"" Council on the Ageing WA chief executive Christine Allen said. ""It's particularly traumatising if there is dementia involved. ""While the family understand why they can't see their loved one, the person living with dementia might not understand that and it can be quite traumatic with people living with dementia when they are removed from contact with their loved ones."" The visitation rules can also become difficult for families and friends to deal with when the person is in hospital or in care and is experiencing trauma or nearing the end of their life. Perth woman Deb Letica's mother-in-law Maria, who had dementia, died in an aged care home just over two weeks ago. In the first six weeks of 2022, more than 700 people died of COVID-19 in aged care across Australia. The families of those lost early in the pandemic fear nothing has been learnt from the loss of their loved ones. She and her husband were called and told to come quickly. When they arrived, they had to wait for their rapid antigen test results, a standard COVID-19 procedure to enter an aged care facility. Her mother-in-law died minutes before they were allowed in, without any family around her. ""I was disappointed,"" Ms Letica said. ""I wasn't angry because it's not the staff's fault. Dementia takes away their dignity and we couldn't even give her her last wish."" Health Consumers' Council of Western Australia executive director Suzanna Robertson said situations like these were extremely distressing for families. She said ""care and compassion and connectedness"" were very important at this time, and those left behind needed to be given an opportunity to be involved. It was also important for cultural needs to be addressed, including for Indigenous families, in a sensitive manner. Visitor restrictions are starting to ease as the pandemic continues. Confirmed cases so far: 871,777 Active cases: 28,603 Cases in hospital: 260 Deaths: 370 WA population aged 16+ triple-dosed: 82.5 per cent Latest information from the WA Health Department The latest directions for aged care homes stated more than two visitors can be allowed to enter the facility ""for the purposes of providing urgent or end of life care or support to a resident"". The centre has to keep a record of the extra visitors and notify the Chief Health Officer as soon as they can. Juniper chief executive Chris Hall overseas 26 aged care homes across the state, including the one where Denise Brown lives. Juniper was the first aged care provider to have a COVID-19 case in one of its centres, at the Cygnet Residential Aged Care home in the Perth suburb of Bentley. Mr Hall has seen what he calls a gradual ""normalising"" of visiting arrangements as COVID-19 becomes a part of everyday life. He said there had been a lessening of restrictions over time as aged care providers had learnt more about COVID-19 and how to respond to it. ""There's quite a bit of flexibility now around the new directions and around the industry code that will enable us to increase that number if we need to for urgent situations or end of life arrangements."" But the restrictions are not expected to fall away anytime soon. ""Until we can guarantee that our vulnerable people are safe in the community, and we know that at the moment they're not, I don't see that restrictions will be removed until that happens, and that could be a long way off,"" Ms Allen said.

96,analysis: Albanese is quickly realising Keating wasn't joking — you should never get between a premier and a bucket of money,politics,"  Anthony Albanese is fast realising Paul Keating wasn't joking when he warned that you should ""never get between a premier and a bucket of money"". He's also quickly realising state parochialism trumps party loyalty. ""I will not settle for this Commonwealth government proceeding with Scott Morrison's cutbacks,"" Victorian Premier Dan Andrews warned ahead of yesterday's national cabinet meeting — Albanese's first as prime minister. The meeting took place as the bulk of the nation faced ongoing uncertainty about whether it will be able to turn the heating on at night. The energy grid is failing and requiring extraordinary intervention to keep the lights in the most populous cities. But the premiers and chief ministers had other thoughts on their mind when they travelled to Canberra to meet the new prime minister. Their hospitals are being overwhelmed with COVID patients. Hospital beds are full and the public system is buckling under the pressure. Whether Liberal or Labor, the leaders arrived united in wanting a pandemic-funding agreement to continue. That health is on their minds is also a reminder that there is no easy fix to the energy crisis that's engulfing everywhere except Western Australia. Getting a health cheque from the feds is much easier to resolve. The pandemic might have changed health funding, forcing the Commonwealth to contribute more to the states, but it also changed how premiers and chief ministers behave. They've been emboldened and rewarded by voters for putting their state's interests above the nation. The creation of national cabinet, a Scott Morrison invention to overhaul the former Council of Australian Governments, put the premiers on the same platform as the prime minister and they haven't looked back since. The Albanese government is blaming the energy crisis engulfing eastern Australia on the Coalition’s failure to put in place policy to ensure adequate and timely investment in renewables. That’s correct, but it’s not the whole story. National cabinet was born as Australia was facing an uncertain future. The Victorian and News South Wales premiers used it to force the nation into shutdown in those dark days of March 2020. It formed the basis for new-found agreement between the states and the Commonwealth and did what COAG so often struggled to do — achieve something. Albanese has made no secret of his dislike of national cabinet. It wasn't that long ago Labor was demanding a seat for the Opposition Leader in national cabinet. Peter Dutton need not wait by the phone, though — those calls seem to have died now Labor is in power. Albanese thinks local governments should have a seat at the table. He also thinks national cabinet has lost COAG's ability to streamline regulations, prevent duplication and establish nationally-consistent rules. It's no surprise Albanese rates these aspects of COAG. A career-politician, he's made a virtue out of following proper processes. Others argue COAG was where good ideas went to die, a bureaucratic quagmire of policy documents that achieve little more than gathering dust. The 2.0 version, national cabinet, all but sidelines the boffins and puts the leaders at a table. It essentially forces them to thrash out the issues facing the nation. But the empowered pandemic premiers — all Labor leaders who have sat at national cabinet since its inception — showed no signs of wanting to back Albanese's push for an overhaul. ""National cabinet worked well. It got us through a one-in-100 year event ... so national cabinet was always about getting things done,"" Andrews said ahead of the meeting. ""In terms of what I wanted ahead of the election, I wanted a new person chairing national cabinet and that is what we've got,"" he said. In the end, the premiers got their way in the meeting. National cabinet survives and will meet at least four times a year. Albanese got one concession, with the nation's Bob Jellys getting an invite once a year to advocate for local government. The new prime minister often talks about his desire for federation reform. It's not sexy, but Albanese argues it can drive productivity. On paper, now is his best chance at delivering on the changes he wants. Freshly elected and with political capital to burn, he benefits from having Labor counterparts in every jurisdiction except Tasmania and NSW. And with only a couple of elections on the horizon, the political landscape looks like to stay Labor-dominated for some time. But as recent days have shown, being from the same side of politics only goes some way to getting what you want out of the states. Victoria and NSW, despite being of different political stripes, regularly show how well they work together — most recently announcing a joint overhaul of preschool education. Their leaders' time in power leaves Albanese the chairman of national cabinet but one of the most inexperienced at navigating it. If this week is anything to go by, he's going to have to find a way to get WA, Victoria and NSW on board if he wants to achieve national reforms. Those states wanted their health money and they got it — at least until the end of the year. Albanese says the Commonwealth can't afford to keep paying it and will resist calls to make the funding arrangement permanent. Keating might do well to send Albanese a flak jacket. If he holds that line, he's going to find himself standing perilously between premiers and a bucket of money.

97,"When Ita Buttrose met the new communications minister, she got a blast from the past",politics,"  Andrew Olle lecture: Without stronger press freedoms and protections for public-interest journalism, democracy is at risk This is an edited version of the 25th annual Andrew Olle Media Lecture delivered by ABC Chair Ita Buttrose, in Sydney, on Friday, June 17. Over the years, I've seen a lot of changes in journalism and the media more broadly. But, no matter how great the changes, fundamental things still apply. Good journalists always will be society's fact-seekers and truth-tellers. The job takes courage. We are reminded of this today as journalists risk their lives to report on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It always takes determination. It is never about lecturing the public on what they should think. Good journalism is about reporting, just the facts — not opinion. It is about listening to community concerns and fashioning them into powerful stories that inform and illuminate; stories that are backed by evidence and take a fair and impartial point of view. Whatever the ownership structure of the organisations they work for, journalists must be prepared to defend the integrity of their output, and the reputation of their profession. ABC Chair Ita Buttrose delivers the 2022 lecture, at a time of great transition in media and as the ABC prepares to celebrate its 90th birthday. We must stand up for ourselves and for our colleagues when they are wrongfully attacked. Equally, we must always be honest with ourselves. It's important that we step back, from time to time, to examine our own conscience. I pose these questions tonight: Are we of the media as critical of ourselves as we should be? Are we aiming for excellence in our profession and our industry? Can we be proud of the standards we set and what we produce? Which brings me to the great Andrew Olle, who died, too young, in 1995, aged 48, at the height of his journalistic powers. In 1992, Janet Hawley wrote a moving profile on Andrew for the Sydney Morning Herald's Good Weekend. In that profile, Olle revealed for the first time his difficult youth. As a lonely teen, in the care of a physically and emotionally absent father, he got into trouble. Jenny Brockie saw the humanity and social conscience that threaded through his work. ""He wasn't driven by ideology"", she said. ""He knew life was far too complicated for that … Andrew pulled himself through a tough childhood but understood how easily he, too, could have been trapped by poverty, race or rotten luck. ""And, so, he'd tell the stories of Aborigines, the mentally ill, the poor and the powerless. Stories, at that time, with no assured place on the mainstream media's agenda."" There are lessons in Andrew Olle's life and work for all journalists who wish to retain their potency and have maximum impact over the course of their careers. I also want to pay tribute to another exemplar of the great journalist: Caroline Jones. When she joined This Day Tonight, Caroline Jones was a transforming figure in the male-dominated world of the ABC newsroom. With her fine mind, her discreet but commanding presence, her poise and grace, she was a singular and inspiring figure to all who knew her, and a symbol of integrity to the Australian audiences who loved her. She was a champion of women in the media, and a beloved mentor to regional and rural women journalists who face particular obstacles in their careers. I know a bit about career obstacles. There was always a reason for someone to say: ""No."" I was either too young or, when I was appointed chair of the ABC, too old. I was single, I was married, I was a mother, it would be bad for my image … there was always a reason why I shouldn't do something I had my heart set on doing. Another important part to my career is my involvement in the non-profit sector. Many people thought I had made a serious career mistake when I agreed, in 1981, to take on the role of chair of the National Advisory Committee on AIDS and to become the public face of Australia's national HIV/AIDS education campaign. It meant I had to speak, very openly, to Australians about sex and, in particular, their sex lives. It was not something I ever expected to do, but this was genuinely a case of life or death. Over the past 15 years my advocacy work with Alzheimer's Australia has occupied much of my time. We changed our name to Dementia Australia in 2017 to include everyone with dementia. In Australia, there are almost half a million people living with dementia. It is the single greatest cause of disability. It has taken too long for the dementia crisis — with all its implications for people living with dementia and their families — to feature prominently in public discussion. Which brings us back to the profession of journalism. Last month, Reporters Without Borders declared that press freedom in Australia is ""fragile"". It demoted Australia from an already modest position of 25 on the global index of press freedom down to 39. Australia is proudly a member of the G20 group of leading countries but we rank nearly 40th on press freedom. This simply isn't good enough. When the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and 60 Minutes were asked to hand over a draft of an upcoming newspaper investigation and TV program to an Australian court before it went to air, I know all of us shuddered. Reporters Without Borders describes press freedom in Australia as ""fragile"", citing a high concentration of media ownership and growing political threats. What a precedent this would set, one that would give any powerful person in the country the opportunity to use our courts not to advance justice, but to prevent important pieces of public interest journalism from being aired. Australians will only rely upon the mainstream media as an essential part of our civic and democratic life if they can trust we are able to expose the spin and lies and misinformation, and deliver the facts and truth. All the facts. All the truth. With ""fragile"" press freedom, democracy is at risk. Without a free press, democracy dies. Last week, the court of appeal overturned the order that the Herald, Age and 60 Minutes hand over their draft stories into their upcoming investigation and the program has now gone to air and also been published. Just as well they moved quickly — lawyers for the cosmetic surgeon who brought the case against the Herald, the Age and 60 Minutes had flagged their intention to fight the appeal decision. The Supreme Court's decision in the first place was extraordinary and difficult to comprehend. Public interest journalism must be protected and any attempt to muzzle media freedom rejected vehemently. All journalists should be concerned about this case which also threatened the public's right to know. As Reporters Without Borders reminds us, two giant firms dominate the media landscape in Australia, making it one of the most concentrated media markets in the world. Social media is hugely influential. While false information for political purposes is nothing new, today too many people take Facebook or Twitter as gospel. The social media business model favours fracturing people's attention, cultivating division and encouraging extremism for clicks and kicks. One of the consequences of the social media revolution is an onslaught of online abuse directed at journalists. Women and diverse journalists are most likely to suffer. The ABC has worked with Australia's e-Safety Commissioner to introduce best practice guidelines to help protect journalists and newsrooms. Meanwhile, the Media Entertainment & Arts Alliance responded to the latest Reporters Without Borders survey by calling on the Australian government to ensure that press freedom is respected, honoured and protected in this country. Freedom of information processes should not be stalled or undermined, court cases should not be secret, and no one should be allowed to avoid answering legitimate questions. Clear positive opportunities to enhance press freedom must include reforms to protect whistleblowers, a commitment to ensure that national security is not used as an excuse to avoid disclosing uncomfortable truths, and reforms to defamation laws to protect journalists going about their vital work. And, of course, one of the most important ways to protect press freedom is proper funding and certainty of funding for the ABC. When David Anderson and I met with communications minister Michelle Rowland last week in Canberra, she reminded me of our first meeting when she was in year 11 and I was editor-in-chief of the Sun Herald. She was sitting in a corridor when I emerged from my office and asked why she had been left to sit there. Someone explained she was a work experience student. According to the minister I then said, ""Well, she isn't working"". She soon was, however, and recalled going out on assignments with senior journalists, and one in particular that she greatly enjoyed, to interview Julie Anthony. At the time, the minister wanted to be a journalist. However, that didn't happen — she had a change of mind (she assured me her work experience at the Sun Herald was a very happy one, so it wasn't that). There's no doubt you've had a successful career in law and politics, minister, but consider this: Instead of asking questions like a journalist, as a politician you have to answer them. Read about our pioneering journalists, cinematographers and broadcasters and how the ABC has changed over 90 years. Everyone who cares about democracy in this country should recognise the role that ABC journalism plays in promoting it. Our investigative work through programs such as Four Corners, and our public information services through pandemics, floods and fires. The essential role we play in rural and regional communities. This is all vital work and likely to become even more important. Great journalism is not some add-on to a strong economy and democratic society. It is an essential part of it. Journalists must not only adhere to the highest standards as a profession, but be prepared to stand up and defend them, too. Every now and then journalism allows us to make a difference. It's a good feeling, something to be proud of … cherished and protected.

98,"Pauline Hanson returned to Senate in Queensland, Amanda Stoker out ",politics,"  One Nation's Pauline Hanson wins Queensland Senate seat, Amanda Stoker out Pauline Hanson has retained her Senate seat for another term, with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) officially declaring she finished fifth in Queensland's upper house race. Labor's Anthony Chisholm was expected to finish fifth, but was leapfrogged by Hanson, putting him in the sixth and final spot. It means Liberal National Party Senator Amanda Stoker has lost her seat. The 68-year-old Senator Hanson has been elected for a second six-year term, after entering the Senate as a One Nation Candidate in 2016. Senator Stoker exits after being placed in the Senate by the LNP in 2018 when George Brandis resigned. Ms Hanson, who has previously represented the lower house seat of Oxley, west of Brisbane, garnered 191,156 first-preference votes. As a party, One Nation polled just over half the amount required for a quota in Queensland. With Senator Stoker losing her seat, Queensland's traditional Senate split of three right and three left senators has been restored. Senator Stoker, a former barrister and solicitor, first joined the Senate in 2018, where she became a vocal supporter of her government's Religious Discrimination Bill. The mother-of-three served tenures as assistant minister for women, industrial relations and to the attorney-general while in office. While the AEC officially declared the Queensland winners on Friday, the ABC's election calculator had already called five of the six spots. In a statement Pauline Hanson thanked supporters. ""I thank Queenslanders for entrusting me to continue to represent them in Canberra and I thank all those Australians who supported our party and lifted our national vote,"" she said. ""I congratulate Mr Albanese on Labor's win. I've said in the past he probably wouldn't make a good Prime Minister, however I sincerely hope he proves me wrong. ""Australians need representation which puts them and their country first more than ever,"" she said. ""The costs of living are skyrocketing. We have an energy crisis created by the major parties that One Nation has been warning about for many years. ""We're in the middle of a housing crisis. We have significant security challenges. ""We have a new government seemingly all too ready and willing to sacrifice the Australian economy and countless Australian jobs on the altar of climate change."" Labor's Murray Watt and Anthony Chisholm have been re-elected, along with the LNP's James McGrath and Matt Canavan. The Greens' Penny Allman-Payne also won a seat. There are six Senate seats up for grabs in each state at every federal election The AEC's official declaration of the result on Friday confirms the United Australia Party's Clive Palmer failed to win a seat. Despite Senator Hanson's win, the ABC's chief election analyst Antony Green told ABC Radio Brisbane this election was a ""step backwards"" for One Nation. ""One Nation did not poll as well as I thought they would – only got 7 per cent, I thought they would do better,"" he said. Although Senator Hanson claimed One Nation ""lifted our national vote"", Mr Green said it had ""not been as successful as it was in the last election"". ""While One Nation's vote increased in the House [of Representatives], they did stand three times as many candidates, which is why their vote went up in the seats they contested,"" he said. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Mr Green said preferences from parties who were not elected helped Senator Hanson get across the line and pull her up into the fifth spot. ""For her to finish in that position, she's done very well on preferences,"" he said. ""Under the current Senate electoral system at the last two elections, Pauline Hanson will attract more preferences from excluded parties than anybody else on the ballot paper."" Mr Green said Labor's Senator Chisholm and the Greens' incoming Senator, Penny Allman-Payne also relied on preferences to win their seats. The LNP's two successful candidates and Labor's Senator Watt were returned to the upper house on full quotas, which means they reached 14.3 per cent of the vote.

99,SA council switches bin collection to avoid food scraps going to landfill,politics,"  City of Holdfast Bay flips roadside collection service for red and green bins An Adelaide council will switch its rubbish bin collection program, in a bid to encourage less waste going to landfill. The Holdfast Bay Council, which encompasses the beachside suburbs of Glenelg, Brighton, Somerton Park and Seacliff, will start rolling out the change next month. Red bins, for household rubbish, will be collected fortnightly while green bins, for food scraps and garden clippings, will be collected weekly. Mayor Amanda Wilson said the change comes after an 18-month trial. “We know that many of our residents are greatly concerned by climate change and this is this one of the easiest and most effective ways of reducing emissions,” she said. While many of the comments on social media were supportive of the change, some questioned how families with young children in nappies would handle the switch. But council said households can opt to return to the old system, and also request a larger red bin if needed. While the green bin will be emptied weekly, the yellow-lidded recycling bins will continue to be emptied fortnightly. On their website, the council said local households already put 80 per cent of recycling in the correct bin, but only 30 per cent of food scraps were going into the green bin. ""Therefore a move to weekly FOGO [food organics garden organics] will have the biggest environmental benefit and create more jobs,"" it said.

100,"'It's not a cloak, it's not a magic wand': Prosecutors reject parliamentary privilege claim in Fraser Ellis case",politics,"  Prosecutors reject claims parliamentary privilege makes MP Fraser Ellis immune from prosecution South Australian MP Fraser Ellis can't ""wave magic wand"" of parliamentary privilege to avoid prosecution over allegedly dishonest travel allowance claims, prosecutors have told the Adelaide Magistrates Court. Mr Ellis was charged with 23 counts of deception last February over his alleged misuse of the Country Members Accommodation Allowance, following an Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (ICAC) investigation. The member for Narungga is accused of making 78 fraudulent claims for the allowance, totalling more than $18,000 —between May 13, 2018, and June 12, 2020. Mr Ellis strongly denies the allegations. His lawyers have asked the court to find that he is immune from being prosecuted because the travel claims were subject to the ""absolute protection of parliamentary privilege"" after being tabled in parliament during a heated debate in 2020. His lawyer, Tom Duggan, told the court the parliamentary privilege claim was embedded in the Bill of Rights, which dated back to 17th Century England. It was borne during a turbulent time in history under King Charles I, whose authoritarian rule led to the breakdown of the monarchy's relationship with Parliament and provoked a civil war, leading to his execution by beheading. ""In these difficult times between the monarch and the House of Commons, out came the bill of rights,"" Mr Duggan told the court. ""It's those concepts of freedom of speech and freedom of debate that ultimately led to the Bill of Rights coming into effect. So it's those lofty principles on which we seek to rely today."" Mr Duggan said once the document was tabled in parliament it became ""unavailable for proof"" and couldn't be relied on by the prosecution in the case. ""This document has been tabled, not only was it tabled, it formed the basis of the notice of motion … it became the business of parliament because of the scrutiny which Mr Malinauskas wanted to apply in relation to the forms, that got bipartisan support,"" he said. Prosecutor Ryan Williams said tendering the documents in court would not undermine the operations of parliament. ""In my submission parliamentary privilege shouldn't dazzle the court, it's not a cloak, it's not a magic wand,"" Mr Williams said. ""What my learned friend (Mr Ellis's lawyer) seeks to do ... is to wave the wand of parliamentary privilege or attempt to throw out the cloak so that parliamentary privilege protects all of these thousands of claim forms which were tabled in parliament so that they could not be admissible in any proceedings. ""In my submission that is to, with respect, misunderstand the scope of parliamentary privilege, its purposes and the consequences."" Parliamentary privilege gives politicians the right to say basically anything they want — with a catch. Mr Williams said the prosecution case was simply that Mr Ellis did not stay in Adelaide on the dates he claimed the allowances. ""Mr Ellis's forms were not the subject of debate, questioning or any determination in the course of [parliamentary] proceedings,"" he said. The lawyers also debated what parallels could be drawn from a UK case involving three former MPs committed for trial on charges of false accounting while serving as members of parliament In that case, the court ruled that MPs' expenses claims did not attract parliamentary privilege.

101,Anthony Albanese to consider Volodymyr Zelenskyy's invitation to visit Kyiv,politics,"  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he will take advice on whether to accept an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to visit Kyiv. Ukraine's ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroschnychenk, confirmed Mr Zelenskyy had extended a formal invitation for Mr Albanese to visit his country. Leaders from France, Germany, Italy and Romania met with Mr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Thursday local time, where he said Russia's invasion of his country amounted to aggression against all of Europe. Mr Albanese said security issues around any visit needed to be considered. ""I will take appropriate advice and obviously there are security issues as well in terms of such a visit,"" Mr Albanese said after holding his first national cabinet meeting. ""I appreciate the spirit in which it has been offered."" Mr Albanese is due to visit Europe for a NATO summit later this month. Images from Maxar Technologies show two Russian-flagged ships being loaded with grain in the Russian-controlled Crimean port of Sevastopol before being spotted in Syria several days later. ""One of the reasons why Australia has been invited to NATO is that Australia is the largest non-NATO contributor to give support to Ukraine in its defence of its national  sovereignty against Russia's illegal, immoral invasion, and we will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine,"" he said. It came as South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas said he was ""grateful"" to be the ""first premier blacklisted by [Russian President] Vladimir Putin"" after he was added to a sanctions list overnight. ""I am very grateful for the fact that Vladimir Putin has paid attention to the leading role that South Australia is paying for standing up for the democratic values that we collectively as a country hold dear,"" Mr Malinauskas said. ""My government has sought to do a number of things to send a very clear message that the people of South Australia stand firmly with Ukraine, as does every state and territory, and I am just grateful for the fact that Vladimir Putin took notice.""

102,NSW minister granted emergency powers to 'keep the lights on' amid energy crisis,politics,"  NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean granted temporary emergency powers to force coal to electricity generators NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean says emergency powers to control the state's coal supplies are a precautionary measure to ""keep the lights on and the system going"". Mr Kean said he asked the NSW Governor, Margaret Beazley, to grant him the temporary powers on Thursday night, following advice from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). The special powers give the Energy Minister the authority to declare the supply and distribution of coal as an essential service. It means Mr Kean now has the authority to order coal producers to increase supply or facilitate the delivery of coal to electricity generators. The powers will be in force for a period of 30 days unless revoked sooner. ""We want to make sure that we've got everything in our toolkit to keep the system running,"" Mr Kean said today. ""We're just taking a proactive step that will support us if there's issues with fuel security, if there's issues with logistics in getting fuel to the site of the generators."" Australia's eastern states are facing an ongoing threat of power shortages and blackouts due to a prolonged energy crisis. It forced the market operator AEMO to seize control of the national energy market this week to direct generators to ramp up energy supplies. AEMO said energy reserves had improved but it warned the energy sector still faced significant challenges such as fuel costs and sourcing issues. Mr Kean said NSW currently had enough coal but agreed fuel security was a concern. ""Right now fuel security is fine,"" he said. ""But we're just putting those powers aside and on standby if we need them. ""We're just giving ourselves all the levers we need to give the community certainty that we're doing everything we can to keep the system going."" Australia's energy crisis has been driven, in part, by rising wholesale gas prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That triggered a surge in the wholesale price of electricity and forced AEMO to instigate a price cap. The $300 a megawatt price cap meant it cost more for generators to supply electricity than they could sell it for. The European Union has agreed to impose a ban on Russian coal imports which will take effect from August 10. Mr Kean said the Russian sanctions would put pressure on the wholesale price of coal but said he did not anticipate it would create a coal shortage in NSW. ""The war in Ukraine is having an impact on commodity prices as Europe stops sourcing its gas and coal from Russia,"" he said. ""Obviously that's changing the spot price for coal here in NSW, as it is right across the country. ""What we're doing is making sure we're continuing to deliver coal for NSW."" Mr Kean said a number of NSW coal producers only supply fuel to the domestic market. NSW Opposition Leader Chris Minns said he was ""really concerned"" by some of the decisions made by Mr Kean and Premier Dominic Perrottet in the ""energy space"". ""If you think about it, there's one minister responsible for the energy crisis that we have in NSW and the cost of living crisis that families are facing and that's Mr Kean,"" Mr Minns said. ""He's been the Energy Minister for a long time, he's been the Treasurer for the last year and I think under his tenure, things have gotten worse."" Mr Minns said the decision of the previous Liberal governments to sell off government assets, in particular, electricity companies had led to a ""ridiculous situation"". ""Obviously, privatisation hasn't worked in the electricity markets, it hasn't worked in relation to toll roads, it hasn't worked in relation to ports,"" he said.

103,"South Australians concerned over failure to vote notices, but commission says not to worry",politics,"  Electoral Commission of SA sends up to 80,000 letters regarding apparent failure to vote in state election Up to 80,000 South Australians have been sent letters about failing to vote in the state election — but the Electoral Commission says recipients should not be concerned. South Australians in several suburbs including West Croydon and Modbury have been alarmed after receiving letters from the Electoral Commission of SA (ECSA) regarding their apparent failure to vote in the March election, even though they say they had. However, ECSA's James Trebilcock said recipients of the letter should not be alarmed. Mr Trebilcock told ABC Radio Adelaide that the letters were ""part of the normal electoral process"". ""All we've done is gone back through our system and looking at the records on the electoral roll and some people have slipped through the cracks potentially,"" he said. Mr Trebilcock stressed that ""every vote that was cast"" by South Australians was counted, even those that received the letter. Mr Trebilock said the letters could be generated from mistakes in people's names being checked off the electoral roll when they entered the polling booth. ""Some of these things just come down to human error in terms of people when they're being marked off with the QR code system and things like that,"" he said. ""So it's not actually accusing people of not voting, it's just asking for an explanation."" The March election was South Australia's first since the pandemic but despite the challenges COVID brought to voting, Mr Trebilcock said the number of apparent failure to vote notices was in the normal range. ""It's in line with what we've had with previous elections,"" he said. Mr Trebilcock said recipients of the letter who did vote should fill in the form attached with the time and location they cast their ballot. ""We'll match that against our records and the matter will be done,"" he said. People who did not vote will need to provide a ""fair and reasonably excuse"" as to why. Those that do not respond to the notice, or who did not vote and do not have a reasonable explanation, will receive a $102 penalty.

104,PM extends COVID-era health funding in first meeting of new national cabinet,politics,"  Extra health funding handed to the states during the height of the COVID pandemic will continue until the end of the year, with new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese bowing to demands from the states for the money. Going into the first national cabinet meeting since Mr Albanese's election, state and territory leaders were united on continuing the special funding. The Prime Minister had talked down the prospect of continuing a 50:50 split in hospital funding between the states and the Commonwealth, which was due to expire in September. The three months of extra funding for COVID-related expenses will cost the Commonwealth an additional $760 million. Mr Albanese said national cabinet's agreement was not just about funding, but also reforming the health network to get people out of emergency departments who didn't need to be there. ""Our hospital system at the moment has people [in emergency departments] who should be being looked after by their local GP,"" Mr Albanese said. ""The lack of nurses and health professionals in the aged care system means that many people who should be either being looked after at home or looked after as aged care residents end up in the hospital system as well, putting further pressure on the system. NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said it had been a ""refreshingly"" collaborative meeting. ""This is something we have been discussing at national cabinet for some time, so to have the first meeting today and for this matter to be resolved in some degree to be extended to December, I think is incredibly welcome and supported by every state premier and chief minister,"" he said. ""This is something that has been in the too hard basket for too long."" Mr Albanese said the extended funding was recognition that the pandemic was not over. ""Clearly the decision that we made today to extend the funding is a recognition that there are currently around about 3,000 people in hospital as a result of COVID,"" he said. ""It is still having an impact."" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said he was grateful ""politics was put aside"" for the funding agreement, and national cabinet had ""put patients first"".

105,Uncle's pain still raw four years after 'astounding' conditions led to tragedy. They haven't changed either,politics,"  Grieving Kalgoorlie families plead for new mental health unit in wake of tragic deaths Jordan Williams was 20 years old and an inpatient at the mental health unit in the Kalgoorlie Health Campus when he died. Four years later, his uncle's eyes well up as he runs his hand along his nephew's headstone and remembers his infectious smile. ""He got into mischief like every other kid,"" Ben Williams said. ""You could tell him off and he'd come back smiling and five minutes later."" The coroner investigating Jordan's death heard conditions in the mental health unit were so poor that visiting staff vowed to never return. ""If there was a proper facility here, Jordan wouldn't be dead now,"" his uncle said. Jordan, who lost both his parents in the two preceding years, was experiencing an acute psychotic episode. Coroner Michael Jenkin said it was ""astounding"" he was allowed out of his room and was able to escape having already absconded once earlier in the day. In his findings, Mr Jenkin called for the West Australian government to deliver a completely new, adequately staffed mental health unit in the Goldfields as soon as possible. Despite a $5.7-billion surplus, the government did not commit any money to the proposal in its May budget. WA Health Minister Amber Jade Sanderson declined to speak to the ABC about the matter. A spokesperson said the recommendations were being considered. Ben, a boilermaker, said he was worried more families in the Goldfields would lose loved ones before action was taken. ""Put your hand in your wallet and dig out some money for this facility, because we need it,"" he said. ""It makes you very angry that there's people here who need it just as much as a person in the city."" The resources-rich Goldfields region has one of the highest suicide rates in the country. ""In the Goldfields here, we bust our arse and we work,"" Ben said. ""We create a lot of money for this country and yet we have the least of everything."" Sharon Duffy also struggled to get help for her son, Bryce Duffy, in Kalgoorlie. ""He was suicidal and we needed help at the hospital, which was really hard, because there's no child mental health beds at the hospital,"" she said. ""So we just went home and had to deal with it ourselves in the family."" Bryce, who had a history of trying to get help, died at the start of last year at the age of 19. ""It feels powerless,"" Ms Duffy said. ""I feel for other families who are going through the same thing, and we're still losing young people in the Goldfields."" There are six inpatient mental health beds for the entire Goldfields area, which is more than three times the size of Victoria and has a population of almost 60,000. There are no beds for patients younger than 18. Just months after losing Bryce, Ms Duffy joined a ministerial mental health task force via local MLA Ali Kent to advocate for more beds for suicidal youth. ""It would mean a lot to me just knowing that not as many, or no families, hopefully, would have to go through what my family has, and lose someone that they love,"" Ms Duffy said. Amy Astill has lived in Kalgoorlie all her life. The 20-year-old councillor, one of the youngest in WA's history, said she could no longer count on her hands and toes the number of friends she had lost to suicide. ""Young people here are screaming and asking for help,"" Ms Astill said. ""The evidence shows that the help that we're asking for is justified and I think that's when we see more issues arise, when young people ask for help and they're ignored."" Opposition spokesperson for Health Libby Mettam said Mark McGowan's government had dragged its heels on the issue. ""It is plainly clear that the Kalgoorlie community deserves a dedicated facility,"" she said. She called on the Health Minister to commit to funding a new unit and said reports of suicidal youth being sent home were ""deeply concerning"". ""The fact that the McGowan government is ignoring the pleas from the WA Coroner to fast-track a dedicated facility in a region which has experienced some of the country's highest suicide rates absolutely beggars belief."" The WA Country Health Service offered its condolences to the Williams family, but Mr Jenkin noted in his report that words meant little by themselves. ""Those condolences will ring hollow unless urgent action is taken to address the current state of mental health facilities at the Kalgoorlie Health Campus,"" he said.

106,'There was a bit of gaming': Prime Minister says gas generators took advantage of energy crisis,politics,"  Prime Minister says gas generators were 'gaming' the energy crisis and threatening supply The Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has accused gas generators of ""gaming"" the system, taking advantage of the energy crisis and forcing an unprecedented intervention by the market operator. Some generators withdrew from the market this week, after soaring power prices were capped, and were then compensated by the market operator when directed to pump power into the network. The Australian Energy Market Operator announced it was taking over the energy market on Wednesday, after it said the market was failing to operate. Mr Albanese said there's a disincentive built into the power market for generators to operate properly. ""There was a bit of gaming going on of the system, which is why AEMO used its tools at its disposal to intervene, so we do have these short-term issues,"" he said. The new Prime Minister has already flagged he will seek to rewrite the rules on how the energy market operates to prevent a situation in the future where gas generators would hold back on supply as they wait for the compensation trigger. After a mere two weeks to assess the state of the National Electricity Market, Chris Bowen has found it crumbling in his hands, writes Melissa Clarke. For now, he supported a continued intervention by AEMO, and said the energy situation would remain difficult. ""It is just dishonest if I stood here and said that I could create a new power grid in a day. You simply can't do that,"" he said. ""What we needed to do was to have a short-term measure in place, but also to make sure that we get that [renewables] investment, so that in the future we don't have these problems."" The peak body representing energy generators, the Australian Energy Council, said Mr Albanese's claim was wrong. Its chief executive Sarah McNamara said the difficulties had emerged from the cap imposed on prices. ""When the cap was applied generators and large-scale batteries were faced with difficult decisions on how to operate,"" she said. ""Some withdrew their capacity from the normal dispatch process but remained available to be directed back into the market by AEMO."" She said while the cap was in place, limited stocks were being dispatched in such a way that they would have quickly exhausted if generators and batteries had not been removed from normal dispatching. West Australian Premier Mark McGowan said the east coast should follow his state's lead to introduce laws that would force companies to keep some of their supply onshore for domestic use. WA introduced a mechanism in 2006 that required future gas projects to keep at least 15 per cent of what they produced for local use. He said if similar laws were in place on the east coast, it could have averted the crisis. ""The gas is actually the property of the people of the state, whichever state that is, and there should always be enough for the state and the country,"" Mr McGowan said. ""It just seems to me to be very strange that there's no gas for local people and yet we export boatload after boatload of gas overseas."" He urged the Prime Minister to use the crisis to introduce an east coast mechanism, and to make it apply retrospectively. ""There's never a good time, but in light of what's going on in the eastern states, certainly I would have thought the best time to put something in place is now, when there is a crisis as we speak,"" he said. ""Obviously putting it in place retrospectively is difficult, but when you have got a crisis … that's what I encourage federal government to do."" Industry Minister Ed Husic warned gas producers that all options were on the table, including a national gas reservation policy. ""I am absolutely agitated,"" he said. ""I've got a great deal of sympathy with the view in the broader public that these are Australian resources that should be available for use by Australian households. If we are shipping out of some of our ports seven times the level of supply that is used by Australia in one year, this is not an issue that we don't have the gas.""

107,SA's anti-corruption watchdog reveals 'political sensitivities' partly to blame for reluctance to report government contractor,politics,"  SA's anti-corruption watchdog reveals 'political sensitivities' partly to blame for reluctance to report government contractor South Australia's anti-corruption watchdog has revealed ""political sensitivities"" were partly to blame for public servants failing to report potentially criminal behaviour to the Office of Public Integrity. Independent Commissioner Against Corruption Ann Vanstone has released a report detailing multiple cases of government contractors behaving dishonestly, conduct she found was ""enabled"" by poor contract management practices in government departments. The investigation took place in April 2021, before the state parliament voted to narrow the scope of the anti-corruption watchdog. The ICAC investigation found ""serious deficiencies"" in the way the Department for Innovation and Skills handled a training program subsidy scheme, after a registered training operator defrauded the department ""hundreds of thousands of dollars over several years."" The report states this was achieved by falsely reporting that students had achieved full competency for courses before those courses were completed, in order to trigger a subsidy payment. ""This conduct by the organisation was obscured from the Department's view because of a complex system of reporting codes, coupled with unwieldy administrative arrangements poorly designed to verify the truth of facts underpinning subsidy claims,"" the report said. Among the main findings of the investigation was a reluctance among senior officers to report issues to the Office of Public Integrity. The report suggests that may have been partly due to perceived political pressure, through an ""awareness"" that employment and training was a key policy agenda of the then-Liberal government. ""The investigation revealed that staff were contending with challenging matters of integrity and corruption, and questioning how best to address and expose them,"" it said. ""Indications were that awareness of these political sensitivities could have affected the will within management to address the situation with the organisation subject to the investigation."" The report notes that attempts were made to manage the situation internally, with a consultancy firm engaged to confirm the financial shortfall. The distribution of training grants accounted for 85 per cent of the department's expenses in 2020-21. While the commissioner's investigation did not end in criminal charges being laid, it did establish that manipulation of subsidies had occurred for many years, undetected by the department. ""The investigation was unable to establish conclusively the person at the organisation who authorised or was responsible for the subsidy manipulation,"" the report read. ""No criminal proceedings against anyone at the organisation were therefore pursued."" Ms Vanstone pointed out other significant investigations she had undertaken had ended without criminal charges for similar reasons. That included an inquiry into a care provider that allegedly invoiced an agency for one-on-one care it never provided, which was only discovered when a client went missing from a government facility. Another investigation involved an aged care provider alleged to have created fake carers to dishonestly report it was meeting minimum care requirements. Ms Vanstone said future investigations of that nature might not be possible, taking aim at changes to the state's ICAC legislation that sailed through parliament last year. ""In our 'reformed' integrity landscape where common dishonesty charges are no longer classed as corruption, it is likely that reporting of this sort of conduct in the future will be further restrained,"" she said. ""This creates an imperative for public authorities to take steps to ensure they have adequate controls in place to prevent dishonest conduct on the part of contractors.""

""Well, it's a bit unfair, you know they [the Russian] are bullies — I just fell in love with their [the Ukrainians] spirit, I guess,"" he tells a Ukrainian television reporter. ""They need a hand, so I threw my job in, I had a really good job, I just jumped on the plane and came."" The Tasmanian father describes how he was briefly detained after flying into Germany, but eventually made his way to Ukraine after travelling via the United Kingdom. In the interview recorded just days before his death, he says he wants to see the Russian military ""eradicated"" from Ukraine because of its war crimes. ""Killing innocent people y'know, attacking villages, they're not targeting military operations they're just attacking villages as you can see — so we need to eradicate them from this place."" The UK says it will do whatever it takes to secure the release of two British prisoners sentenced to death in a breakaway state in eastern Ukraine. During the brief segment, Mr O'Neill is dressed in the uniform of Ukraine's Foreign Legion and seated next to another international volunteer who is also holding a firearm. The Australian government has repeatedly warned Australians against joining the war against Russia, after Ukraine's President established a foreign legion in February. Government sources have told the ABC that as many as 200 Australian citizens and Ukrainian dual nationals are believed to have travelled to Europe to join the war effort, although no official figure has been released. Earlier this month, a video emerged of another Australian describing his decision to serve with Ukraine's Foreign Legion on the frontline.

109,'It's like giving a child a loaded gun': Deaths prompt world-first button battery standards,politics,"  Button battery safety standards come into effect next week, nine years after first child death Andrea Shoesmith has been campaigning for action to prevent children swallowing button batteries since her daughter died nine years ago, and next week she will finally see change. In 2013 Ms Shoesmith's four-year-old daughter Summer Steer swallowed a button battery and began feeling unwell. The Sunshine Coast mother did not see her ingest it, and after multiple misdiagnoses at the GP and hospital, Summer became the first person in Australia to die from a button battery incident. ""I just don't think people understand how dangerous [button batteries] are … it's like giving a child a loaded gun,"" Ms Shoesmith said. ""They're small, they're shiny, kids look at them like they're lollies, and unless you see them swallow it, it's too late."" Recognition of the danger posed by the batteries has come in the form of changed safety standards that come into effect on June 22. Under the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) new standards it will be mandatory for all consumer goods that contain button batteries to have secure compartments that limit a child's ability to access them. Suppliers of the button batteries themselves must use packaging that is similarly ""child resistant"", and all button-battery products must have safety warnings. These standards will be enforced through mandatory compliance testing, and breaches will be penalised under Australian consumer law, which could result in a fine of up to $10 million. It was found that Summer had ingested a ""flat"" battery, which may not be able to power an item but can still emit enough charge to create a chemical reaction in her body. Ms Shoesmith said police had checked all the items in her house but the source of the button battery that killed Summer was never identified, and she wondered whether her daughter had picked up the battery at a playground or in a car park. ""They're bloody everywhere,"" she said. ""The new standards are a start, but I still think we need to look into the safe disposal of button batteries … even if they're spent, there's still a risk."" Melbourne mother Allison Rees, whose one-year-old daughter Isabella also died after swallowing a used button battery, campaigned for safer measures alongside Ms Shoesmith in Canberra in 2019. ""I'm pleased and I'm actually grateful that we've been listened to,"" Ms Rees said. ""However, in time, I would like them to go a little bit further."" Ms Shoesmith and Ms Rees said they want to see the implementation of safe disposal bins for button batteries, as well as regulations around their placement in retail stores. ""Batteries are lining the counters at shopping centres and supermarkets, next to lollies and food, and it sends the wrong message from a young age,"" Ms Rees said. ""They need to be kept up high and out of reach of children, behind doors or cupboards, so that it conditions us to think of them as dangerous."" Symptoms that indicate a child might have swallowed a button battery include choking, drooling, chest pains, nose bleeds, blood-stained saliva, unexplained vomiting and stomach pains. If you suspect a child has swallowed a button battery, immediately call an ambulance on triple-0 or go to the nearest hospital emergency department. ACCC deputy chair Delia Rickard said it is a ""world first"" for button battery safety standards to be applied to ""every type"" of consumer good, including products imported from overseas. ""It's so that we can ensure that it is almost impossible, hopefully, for kids to get their hands on these batteries,"" she said. ""We've been doing a huge amount of education of suppliers, and we've already had 30 suppliers voluntarily recall their [unsafe] products."" Items that are exempt from the safety standards include hearing aids, IT equipment with button batteries soldered in place, and consumer goods that were supplied before the requirements became mandatory. Button batteries can be found in many common household items such as toys, watches, remote controls, and digital thermometers. Ms Rickard said the ACCC recognises used or spent batteries are ""a serious hazard"", but consumer laws cannot regulate how people use or dispose of a product. She advises consumers to safely dispose of the batteries by sticky taping them on both sides. The Battery Stewardship Council (BSC) estimates there are currently 67 million button batteries in Australian households. Battery Stewardship Council CEO Libby Chaplin said it is supporting the ACCC's safety regulations by campaigning to enhance public awareness about the risks associated with button batteries, and developing safe drop-off points across Australia. ""Batteries can be hazardous, toxic, corrosive and flammable, therefore they should not be disposed of via current kerbside recycling or rubbish systems,"" she said. The BSC launched a government-backed recycling scheme in February 2022, with more than 2,300 safe drop-off points for batteries nationwide, including at retailers such as Aldi, Woolworths, Coles, Bunnings, and Officeworks. Ms Rickard said the ACCC has been working with suppliers since December, 2020 to help them prepare for the new standards. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. The owner of the Crackerjack Toy Shop in Brisbane's north, Jo Wallace, said she had removed five products off her shelves ahead of the safety standards coming into effect. ""It's up to the retailers to ensure that that the products apply to the current safety standards,"" she said. ""If we can source the same product without button batteries, then we do."" More than 100 items with button batteries have also been recalled from large retailers like Kmart, Target and Big W.

110,Q+A panellists back Labor's grand plan on rewiring the energy grid but warn 'it won't be easy',politics,"  Q+A panellists back Labor's grand plan on rewiring the energy grid but warn 'it won't be easy' It will be a bumpy and challenging road but Q+A panellists have backed Labor's ambitious, grand plan to rewire the nation's energy grid. As Australia continues to wade through a national crisis that has seen the wholesale electricity spot market suspended, Energy Minister Chris Bowen on Thursday said the government will stick to its guns and look to radically upgrade transmission in Australia by connecting significantly more renewable power to the grid. ""We need to build 10,000km more of transmission lines, we need to increase our storage by nine times and that's a massive challenge … and we need to get on with it,"" Mr Bowen said. But the task will not be an easy one and the nation is entering one of the most challenging points of the transition to cleaner energy, according to members of the panel, hosted by Virginia Trioli. Australian Energy Council CEO Sarah McNamara said connecting the huge amounts of clean energy sources coming online will be difficult. ""[We need] to support renewables coming online and acknowledge that we have a lot more distributed energy resources as well now, people in their homes, when you have solar on your roof you're essentially becoming a generator into our grid as well, that's a huge challenge and that's a big reform of this complex machine that is our grid,"" she said. Scientist Saul Griffith said the nation is way behind where it should be when it comes to modernising the grid. ""We're trying to take a system that was designed for a few dozens of generators where we're going to have 10-plus millions, we're going to have 30 million batteries on wheels,"" he said. The Grattan Institute's Tony Wood said the re-wiring plan will be one of the most challenging in the nation's history and currently, Australia does not have the materials or labour to get it done. ""This will be one of Australia's great rebuilding projects, this is bigger than building Snowy hydro after the war, getting the labour, mobilising the materials — any simple numbers will tell you this is an enormous challenge,"" he added. The panellists hoped the current energy crisis would create political will to see a massive shift in how Australia's energy market works. Dr Griffith said the government should look towards investing more in households to ensure they're part of the shift. ""I think about Australia's 10 million households as national infrastructure … we need to finance Australia's households with the same preferential financing that we give to infrastructure in Australia and you should think about our cars and our homes in the same way as we think of Snowy 2.0."" Another consensus on the panel was reached when the discussion turned to the current grid, and the fact it is simply not working. ""In short, no,"" said Mr Bowen when asked if the system was functioning. Sarah McNamara said the system had served Australia well but had met its ultimate challenge and a ""perfect storm"" of events which meant it could not cope. The often-controversial topic of taxing generators was raised by newly elected independent Zoe Daniel, who proposed energy producers should be taxed as the price of gas skyrockets. Demand for Australian gas spiked as war broke out in Ukraine, as Russia is one of the world's largest producers of gas. Ms Daniel suggested the generators could be taxed the difference on what the companies were making before the conflict. ""Consider how much money that might mean and consider what that might mean to put solar on rooftops and create this electrification that we're talking about,"" she said. Dr Griffith agreed, stating: ""We have to make today's problem solve the next few decades."" He added that Norway had used taxes from gas export profits to help subsidise a transition to electric vehicles. But Ms McNamara, who represents the generators and energy retailers, said such a task would be tricky. ""It's very difficult for governments to retrospectively apply taxes and controls on resources that are already being exported overseas on long-term contracts,"" she said. The panel agreed that reducing emissions was the ultimate goal, but there was a long way to go before it could become a reality. Watch the full episode on ABC iview or via the Q+A Facebook page.

111,"State leaders confident extra health funding will be extended, as new national cabinet meets",politics,"  National cabinet meets for first time since Anthony Albanese became PM, with health, worker shortages and cost of living on agenda State and territory leaders have expressed confidence the federal government will extend health funding boosted during the pandemic in the first meeting of national cabinet since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's election win. Australia's biggest health crisis saw the creation of national cabinet and more than two years on, health remains front and centre. As he arrived this morning, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said he was hopeful the support would continue. ""We had a very productive discussion last night at the Lodge about extending funding and I'd hope that we'll be able to reach that agreement today,"" he said. ""Now is not the time to do less. We in fact need to step up and do more."" The state and territory leaders want health funding consistency and an improvement in primary care to reduce the number of people in hospitals. During the height of the pandemic, the Morrison government increased Commonwealth funding to public hospitals to a 50:50 split but that is due to expire in September and all the state and territory leaders want that extended. Mr Andrews warned the new government not to proceed with ""Scott Morrison's cutbacks"". ""All we want is some time, we want to buy some time to do some really important work whether that's three months, six months, whatever it might be we can't proceed in September to cut health funding at a national level, that just doesn't make any sense,"" he said. Tasmanian Premier Jeremy Rockliff said he also expected an extension of the national partnership agreement, and said there was a ""very real need for reform"" in the health system. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said premiers and chief ministers were on a unity ticket on the issue. ""There are a lot of pressures on our hospital system,"" she said. ""We're absolutely united that health has to be front and centre of today's discussions."" States are ramping up the pressure on the major parties to pledge billions extra in public hospital funding to ensure patients across the country get the care they need. Victoria, along with a number of other states and territories, has also raised concerns about the number of Australians that are using the emergency department as a first resort for care. South Australia's Premier Peter Malinauskas said some hospitals are overcrowded because primary care has not been managed properly and the problem is across multiple states. ""This challenge isn't just about the money … what we also have to confront as a nation is what are we doing to manage demand,"" he said. ""There are a lot of people in hospital emergency departments that quite frankly don't need to be there, they are coming from the aged care system … or they are not getting access to the GP. ""If someone is in a hospital because they couldn't get access to a GP, we have a problem with health care service delivery that is out of the control of the states."" A spokesman for Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said yesterday they have hundreds of older people and people with a disability that should be receiving care outside the hospital system. ""These people are not sick, they have no one to care for them, that is creating problems down the line,"" the spokesman said. While health is a priority for the states and territories, the leaders are very aware they will not walk away with a ""magic solution"" at the end of today's meeting. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese yesterday talked down the prospect of committing to additional funding. ""We inherited a trillion dollars of debt with not much to show for it,"" he said. ""That is the context in which we will consider discussions going forward, we are not in a position to do everything we would like to do immediately."" Mr Albanese pointed to the government's promise to fund new GP clinics that aim to take the pressure off hospital emergency departments in an attempt to boost primary health care support. The Prime Minister has indicated that today's meeting will cover a range of issues, including ways to reduce cost-of-living pressures. Local businesses are struggling with skill shortages and red tape. ""I want productivity to be front and centre of that agenda and I will be discussing that … as well as no doubt we will have a discussion about energy as well,"" he said. There have been nearly daily meetings of energy ministers who have talked through the east coast power crisis, and it's expected that today's meeting between state and territory leaders will focus on issues other than power. One of those is migration and skills shortages: New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria have signalled their intentions to discuss workforce problems. Businesses have repeatedly raised concerns about the difficulties in finding qualified staff and some have called for changes to make it easier to hire skilled workers from overseas. The Northern Territory, on the other hand, wants to discuss projects in energy, critical minerals and manufacturing, as well as workforce needs. While there are unlikely to be any major announcements on the health, energy or jobs front, the group is expected to try and determine how national cabinet will work in the months and years ahead. Experts say the state's brown coal reserves could provide a ""safety net"", but ageing power plants and instability from the interconnected national energy market may still pose a threat. Mr Albanese has said he wants to make changes to how the group operates. ""I will work those things through cooperatively … I want to see how we can involve local government, I will discuss that with them … and I will discuss the way that we progress into the future,"" he said. State and territory leaders have previously agreed that national cabinet worked reasonably well during the pandemic because the group was focused on a single crisis. However, a spokesman for the Queensland Premier said there were now ""several"" crises, such as health, skills shortages and energy, and he said the leaders will look at how they can best be managed. ""[For example] who should be on this body, how often will it meet,"" he said. Mr Malinauskas said he was ""open-minded"" to how national cabinet worked into the future and who should be included. ""There is a role if not an urgent need for seamless, collaborative engagement from the state and the commonwealth regardless of political persuasions,"" he said.

112,How NSW and Victoria's extra year of education for young children will work,politics,"  How NSW and Victoria's extra year of education for young children will work Plans to create an extra year of class for young children in NSW and Victoria are backed by decades of research, experts say, but details around structure and staffing will be key to its success. Having children as young as four starting school in NSW and Victoria is “really important for their development"", according to Monash University's early childhood expert Marilyn Fleer. While the program has been dubbed a ""universal pre-Kindergarten year of education"", it will look more like a structured day-care program than a primary school classroom. The ""play-based"" learning model that the program will follow is a more free-form, child-led approach than mainstream teaching. Children will spend time painting, dancing, and playing games of imagination with their friends rather than learning spelling, maths and reading like they would in a structured classroom setting. Professor Fleer said the play-based learning approach was backed by decades of research. ""In the early years, what's developing is children's capacity to imagine, and that imagination is really really important for their development later on,"" she said. ""Children develop that imagination through their play, but they're also learning about how to be a good play partner and how to enter a social situation."" The program is being developed by the NSW and Victorian governments, in a show of cross-border cooperation. The NSW government has labelled the plan as ""the greatest transformation of early education in a generation"", spruiking the financial benefits of the program for families and working mothers. For NSW families, it will begin from 2030 and fall a year before what is known as kindergarten. Victoria plans to start from 2025, with a year of new schooling before what is known as prep. Children would attend five days a week and it would be free of charge. But Deakin University early childhood education expert Andrea Nolan said the devil would be in the detail in determining how effective the scheme really was. While the play-based learning approach will follow the National Early Years Framework, neither state government has released any specific details about the teaching plan. ""What is the definition of 'play-based' programs? This differs across the educational sectors, and there is a danger of 'schoolification' rather than learning through play in its own right,"" Professor Nolan said. NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet and his Victorian counterpart Daniel Andrews want to introduce a pre-kindergarten year for four- and five-year-olds within a decade. ""Who will staff this initiative? The early childhood workforce is already in crisis with not enough early childhood teachers trained to meet current demands."" Retention of staff is an ongoing issue in the childcare sector. Early childhood educators represent some of the lowest-paid workers in Australia. Professor Fleer said the NSW and Victorian governments must increase the uptake of tertiary qualifications in early childhood education along with workers' pay to reap the benefits of play-based learning. ""The research has shown that what's highly significant in making the impact is somebody teaching who has been to a university and who has studied early childhood education,"" Professor Fleer said. ""Qualified staff who are doing this important work, which we know makes a big difference to children's lives, must be paid the same as other [mainstream] teachers."" The NSW and Victorian governments will have overseas programs to look to as they iron out the finer details of the plan. A similar early education program in Ontario, Canada, saw 95 per cent of eligible children attending. Other countries start their children's school journey much later while achieving more impressive educational outcomes than Australia. In Finland and Singapore — two of the best performing countries in the world scholastically — children don't start primary school until they turn seven. But Professor Fleer said these countries also boasted exemplary early childhood institutions. ""It's not just that they start school at seven, they're actually starting their early childhood education experiences as infants and toddlers,"" she said. ""The countries that do well do well educationally — it's not the school starting age, it's the quality of the program that they're experiencing."" For Australia to follow suit, Professor Fleer said the NSW and Victorian governments must listen to the decades of research on early childhood outcomes from across the globe. ""Let's make sure that it's truly play-based, and let's make sure that there is a qualified teacher,"" she said. ""Those things are absolutely core to what we should be taking forward.""

113,Tasmanian government spent $700k on COVID-19 hotel — only for it to never be used,politics,"  The Tasmanian government has been accused of wasting more than $700,000 of taxpayer money upgrading a motel owned by a Liberal Party member, before abandoning plans to use it as a COVID-19 management site. The revelations have led to calls for the money spent on refurbishing Burnie's Wellers Inn to be recouped. Answers tabled in State Parliament showed $717,246 was spent on refurbishing and renting the hotel to be used as a COVID case management facility, only for it to be deemed unsuitable due to storm damage. Those costs included $356,000 to rent the facility for three months, just over $60,000 to install Wi-Fi and CCTV, $20,000 for miscellaneous repairs and $278,000 for on-site security and fencing. Shadow Health Minister Anita Dow questioned the spending in State Parliament on Thursday. ""This obscene waste of taxpayer money to upgrade the hotel of a member of the Liberal Party stinks,"" she said. Opposition Leader Rebecca White said the state government needed to try to recoup taxpayer money spent. ""Nobody should get a free upgrade for doing nothing,"" she said. ""Tasmanians should be appalled that $700,000 has been spent to upgrade a hotel to house patients with COVID when not one single patient was kept there."" Ms White said the government needed to explain how Wellers Inn was selected as a case management hotel and why an expression-of-interest process was not held. Deputy Premier Michael Ferguson said the facility was selected by the Health Department and he was not aware of who owned it. ""Clearly if it is a Liberal Party member that owns that hotel, well, that would then be a question for the Health Department,"" he said. He said the government was still investigating ""options to capture as much value"" as possible from its contract with Wellers Inn Wellers Inn co-owner Nigel Morgan told The Advocate newspaper in February that he told the Health Department he was a Liberal Party member and chairperson of its Braddon Electorate Committee when it contacted him asking to use his motel as a COVID management facility. ""I was up-front with them and said I hold this position, and they came back and said that's fine,"" Mr Morgan told the newspaper. Wellers Inn was contacted for comment. Three case management facilities, in Devonport, Launceston and Hobart, managed 469 symptomatic COVID-positive patients in the six months after the state's borders reopened to COVID hotspots.

114,Manufacturer forced to turn off lights after energy market 'failure',politics,"  South Australian manufacturer InterCast and Forge forced to turn off lights and stand down staff after energy market 'failure' A South Australian manufacturing business reliant on wholesale electricity has labelled the national electricity market a ""failure,"" after standing down 170 employees due to unaffordable operating costs. InterCast and Forge managing director Brett Lawrence said he was forced to shut down operations at his iron foundry in Adelaide's northern suburbs on Wednesday, following the Australian Energy Market Operator's (AEMO) decision to suspend the spot market. Mr Lawrence said soaring wholesale electricity prices had been a ""nightmare"" for the iron foundry, which accounts for about 1 per cent of South Australia's total electricity consumption per day when fully operational. The company does not have a retail contract for electricity, so is reliant on the wholesale spot price, which can vary every five minutes. It manages to keep its operations profitable by monitoring the spot market, in order to know when it's a cost-effective time to run machinery. ""We put in some software controls where we enter a price. When the price peaks above that we automatically turn off our furnaces and other equipment,"" Mr Lawrence said. He said AEMO's suspension of that market makes it impossible to run his business. ""The nature of the announcement from AEMO is that we don't know what the cost of [wholesale] electricity will be,"" Mr Lawrence said. ""We're assuming the worst, and the worst is $15,100 compared to a normal rate of around $55 to $60 per megawatt hour. ""At $15,000, we would go out of business within a couple of days. Mr Lawrence said the foundry's annual power bill usually varied between $5 million and $7 million, but expected this year's cost would be almost double that. ""This year, we're forecasting an electricity bill of more than $10 million,"" he said. ""For a business like ours, we cannot expect that customers will continue buying at that increase. ""We will survive this but we may not break even."" Already this month, the company has been unable to operate due to skyrocketing electricity prices, with 90 staff members agreeing to work on a Sunday when demand was lower. Mr Lawrence said he would await AEMO's daily review of the suspension before advising staff on how to proceed. ""At this stage, we have asked our employees to wait until about midday tomorrow before we advise them whether they come in on Sunday, or if we revert to a Monday roster,"" he said. Mr Lawrence has blamed the chaos gripping Australia's energy market on a ""failure in leadership"". ""The key reason that AEMO can't have a market is because the generators aren't able or willing to supply the market at a certain price,"" he said. ""This is a fundamental breakdown of a system that was arguably already flawed, and hopefully this crisis sees that a change is made for the better,"" he said. He did not blame any particular government but said that ""inaction"" at a state and federal level over the past two decades had resulted in a system beholden to the whims of electricity generators. SA Premier Peter Malinauskas blamed ""policy malaise"" over the course of the federal Coalition's nine-year reign. ""We are witnessing mass market failure when it comes to the national energy market,"" he said. ""I think that's a reflection of years of neglect and a lack of thoughtful policy at a federal level. Hopefully, we see an end of policy malaise."" Mr Malinauskas argued South Australia was in a stronger position than the eastern states due to its higher uptake of renewable energy and said he would use Friday's national cabinet meeting to spruik his government’s hydrogen agenda. ""I got elected on a platform of thinking about the long term… that's where we believe hydrogen plays an essential role in the national energy market, and there are a number of issues I'll be discussing with [federal energy] minister Chris Bowen in that respect.""

116,"Julian Assange will fight his extradition to the US, and Australia has precedent to help",politics,"  Britain's government has approved the extradition of Julian Assange. What now? The British government has approved the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to the United States after he fought for years to remain in the United Kingdom. For more than 10 years, the US has been trying to put the 50-year-old Australian on trial over the publication of classified documents. WikiLeaks said it would challenge the order, but what comes next and what avenues can they take? In 2010, WikiLeaks released more than 91,000 documents, most of which were secret US military reports about the war in Afghanistan. That same year, the publication released some 400,000 classified US military files chronicling the Iraq war from 2004 to 2009. It’s the largest leak of its kind in US military history. US authorities want the WikiLeaks founder on espionage charges but his supporters say he was exposing war crimes and abuses of power. The British government orders the extradition of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to the United States, but WikiLeaks says it will appeal against the ruling. Mr Assange had been granted political asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and lived there from 2012 to 2019. In 2019, the US Justice department formally asked Britain to extradite Mr Assange to face charges in the United States. Since April 2019, Mr Assange has been in the Belmarsh maximum-security prison while his case went through the British legal system. Hearings into his extradition began in February, 2020, but were delayed until September because of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early last year, the judge in the case concluded that it would be “oppressive” to extradite him to the US because of his frail mental health, saying there was a real risk that he would take his own life. However, that decision was overturned on an appeal after the United States gave a package of assurances, including a pledge Mr Assange could be transferred to Australia to serve any sentence. Following that court decision, Britain’s interior minister, Home Secretary Priti Patel, signed an order overnight authorising Mr Assange’s extradition. The Home Office said in a statement that the government had to approve his move to the US because “the UK courts have not found that it would be oppressive, unjust or an abuse of process to extradite Mr Assange”. Mr Assange's lawyers now have 14 days to lodge an appeal. Nick Vamos, the former head of extradition at Britain's Crown Prosecution Service, said verdicts were regularly overturned by the High Court. Mr Assange would be able to claim, again, that the extradition request was politically motivated and use new evidence, such as his allegations that the CIA had plotted to assassinate him. “We’re not at the end of the road here,"" his wife, Stella Assange, said. “We’re going to fight this.” Mr Assange's lawyers said they would mount a new legal challenge, and legal experts say the case could take months or even years more to conclude. ""We will appeal this all the way, if necessary, to the European Court of Human Rights,” Mr Assange's attorney, Jennifer Robinson, said. Ms Robinson asked US President Joe Biden to drop the charges brought against Mr Assange during Donald Trump's presidency, arguing they posed a “grave threat” to free speech. Barrister Greg Barns said court cases take time. ""It's been two or three years since the first extradition hearing, I think 2020 the first extradition hearing, to now,"" he said. ""If the court ends up going to the European Court of human rights, which it could do, it will take a number of years."" ""This is an Australian whose mental and physical health continues to decline."" Australian independent MP Andrew Wilkie has called for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to pick up the phone now and demand an end to what he's described as ""madness"". Filmed over two years across the UK, Europe and the US, this two-part documentary follows 76-year-old retired builder John Shipton's tireless campaign to save his son, Julian Assange. “In some ways, it's not surprising, because the UK government has generally taken a hands-off approach to the Assange case,” Mr Wilkie said. “We've been saying this is a political matter, and has been from the start. “We're urging and hoping that now is the time for Australia to get involved with its key allies in London and Washington and bring this matter to an end.” Mr Wilkie’s demands for the Prime Minister to talk to his UK and US counterparts has the backing of a number of crossbench MPs including Monique Ryan, Allegra Spender and Zali Stegall. Mr Assange's family have vowed to fight the decision using every possible legal avenue. Mr Barns said the federal government needed to intervene. ""There are a couple of important things to remember about the case,"" he said. ""The first is whilst it's been in the courts, it's no longer in the courts, it's a political decision. ""The second point is Australia can use its relationship with Washington to bring an Australian back to safety. ""We saw it with David Hicks almost 20 years [ago] now, who found himself in Guantanamo Bay. ""The Howard government at the time brought him back to Australia. This is not unprecedented. It is important that Australia is able to use the great relationship it has with Washington to ensure the safety of Australians.""

117,A new points-based system is replacing Jobactive. How will it affect thousands of job seekers?,politics,"  What is Centrelink's new employment services program, Workforce Australia? How will it affect jobseekers? From July 4, Jobactive — the Australian government's main employment services program — will be replaced by a new service called Workforce Australia Employment Services Provider. If you've been on Jobactive while receiving the JobSeeker Payment, you'll soon be moved to the new program. Workforce Australia has begun contacting participants about how they'll be impacted and what they need to do. Some jobseekers told the ABC they were worried about what the major overhaul to the system would mean for them. Here's how the change will affect your job search. The Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE) describes it as a new ""front door"" service, aimed at helping people keep a job, change jobs or create their own job. It's made up of two streams: an online portal called Workforce Australia Online, and a face-to-face service. Here's what the differences are: Workforce Australia Online If you are a jobseeker, you will be placed in an online employment service and will have access to: You will have access to financial support to help with pre-employment and the resources and skills to find and keep a job, such as police checks and completion of micro-credentials. Digital jobseekers will also be supported by the Digital Services Contact Centre (DSCC), which they can contact to request information and technical assistance. Face-to-face service If you require more tailored support to get job-ready and look for work, a Workforce Australia Employment Service Provider will provide tailored case management services to help you find and keep work. Providers will support you through: There are new changes to the way jobseekers will have to complete mutual obligations. A new Points Based Activation System (PBAS) has been introduced, which will replace the current system where jobseekers are required to submit 20 job applications a month. Through the PBAS, jobseekers will need to accumulate 100 points a month in order to continue receiving payments. You earn points by doing the following tasks: Here are the points values for some tasks: Task Points earned on completion Job application 5 points Online learning modules 5 points (maximum of 5 points per month) Attending a job interview 20 points The Australian government's job search website offers a complete breakdown of the points values for tasks. Points targets may be reduced based on ""personal circumstances"" and extra points can be carried over into the next month, according to the DESE website. If you're self-managing online, you can report points via your Workforce Australia Online home page, the Workforce Australia mobile app, or by contacting the DSCC. If you have a provider, you can report points by contacting your provider or via your Workforce Australia Online home page or the mobile app. You will also receive prompts on your home page reminding you to report your points. If you don't meet your points target or complete your minimum job search each month, you could receive a payment suspension and a demerit. The government's job search website advises that you should tell your provider straight away if you think you won't meet your points target. And if you're self-managing online, you can contact the DSCC to inform them about your situation. The aim of jobactive was to help people on Centrelink payments apply for jobs or undertake further training. However, it was criticised as ""punitive"" by welfare groups. In 2019, a Senate committee found it was ""not fit for purpose"", prompting the recent changes to come into effect next month. According to the DESE, Workforce Australia was informed by extensive collaboration with over 140 stakeholders, national and internal research and intensive user-centred design with job seekers and employers.

118,Who will be the next speaker? What do they actually do?,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes What is a house speaker? What do they do? Are they allowed to vote? The cardboard polling booths have been dismantled, the winning candidates have been declared and now the new cabinet ministers have been sworn in. You could be forgiven for thinking the election is all wrapped up in a neat little package, but there's still the little matter of the house speaker. It's still unclear who will be sitting in the speaker's chair when parliament resumes next month. Officially, the speaker's main job is ensuring meetings of the House of Representatives are conducted in accordance with the constitution and the standing orders of the house. Crucially, the speaker must ensure parliamentary sessions are carried out in an orderly fashion. In reality, this involves a lot of rousing on MPs for yelling out during parliamentary debates. This includes a lot of requests like ""will the members on my left … "" and ""will the members on my right …"" followed by various less-colloquial synonyms for ""stop carrying on like pork chops"". Think of the speaker as a referee for parliamentary debates. They have to make sure all sides are following the rules and everyone is treated fairly. They are often asked to make a call on whether particular remarks made during a speech are relevant or offensive. More dramatically, the speaker has the power to eject unruly members from the chamber and, in more serious breaches of order, can put forward a motion to suspend a member — but that's usually only for 24 hours. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has unveiled his new cabinet, with election losses and cabinet shake-ups seeing some new faces enter the fold. Here's who got what position. The speaker is also the spokesperson for the house, so all official communications to and from the house are signed by and addressed to them. They also have quite a ceremonial role. Parliamentary proceedings don't kick off until the speaker or one of their deputies is in the chamber and the mace — a golden, ornate club that symbolises both the authority of the house and the speaker — is placed at the central table by the serjeant-at-arms. The mace, which weighs 7.8 kilograms and is made of gold-gilded silver, is kept in a glass cabinet in the speaker's office when it's not being used. No. They're expected to be impartial, but they remain a member of their party and can choose to attend party meetings. ""As a rule, Speakers have been sufficiently detached from government activity to ensure what can be justly claimed to be a high degree of impartiality in the Chair,"" the Parliament of Australia website says. ""Members are entitled to expect that, even though the Speaker belongs to and is nominated to the position by a political party, their functions will be carried out impartially. ""At the same time, a Speaker is entitled to expect support from all members regardless of their party."" Yes, but only in the event of a tie. Yep. The speaker gets an additional salary on top of what they get paid as a member of parliament. That's an extra $158,440 on top of the base salary of $211,250, according to salaries set out in a document called the Remuneration Tribunal Determination 2021. So all up, the speaker will be taking home a total of $369,690. It's unclear at this stage. Before Labor won its 77th seat, it was considering nominating an independent for the role so it could maintain its majority in the house, with Andrew Wilkie and Rebekha Sharkie touted as likely options. But after picking up an extra seat, Labor is set to choose a speaker from within its own ranks. Milton Dick is one of the Labor names being bandied about as a potential candidate, as is former second deputy speaker Rob Mitchell. But so far there haven't really been any strong indications about who could be picked. Whoever does take on the speaker position will need to be someone with lots of parliamentary experience who hasn't been appointed as a minister.

119,The government has a secret weapon when it comes to gas prices — but will it pull the 'trigger'?,politics,"  Gas prices are high and temperatures are low, meaning businesses and households alike are facing big power bills this winter. The rising cost of gas and coal on the international market is a significant cause, despite Australia being a major global exporter of both commodities. The federal government does have the power to directly intervene in the gas market to boost local supplies, often referred to as its ""gas trigger"". But though there is pressure from gas users to provide some price relief, the new federal government has many factors to weigh up first. As Europe weans off Russian gas and coal following its invasion of Ukraine, international demand for the commodities has risen dramatically. Coal and gas prices here are driven by the global market, so any supplies needed outside of existing contracts are subject to volatile international spot prices. And reliability problems with some local coal-fired power stations are pushing up demand for gas too, as gas-fired power plants are needed to step up and fill the gaps. Australia may be one of the world's largest exporters of gas, but that doesn't necessarily guarantee affordable supply domestically. To fund the development of gas fields, resources companies need to lock in long-term supply contracts at their outset. That means some countries are now getting gas from Australia at significantly lower prices than can be bought here, thanks to their contracts. In Western Australia, 15 per cent of liquefied natural gas (LNG) available for export must be reserved for domestic use, which has been successful in keeping gas prices low. But there is no such policy in the rest of the country, meaning eastern Australia has to import extra gas supplies — and is exposed to international price shocks as a result. There is an emergency provision called the ""Australian Domestic Gas Reservation Mechanism"" which, if used, would act in a similar way to WA's gas reservation policy. The mechanism was introduced by then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2017, giving the Australian government the option to intervene, or to use the threat of intervention, to see more gas kept for domestic use. Treasurer Jim Chalmers, only in the job for a little over a week, is already fielding questions about whether he will use the gas trigger to curb prices. But he has been at pains to avoid saying anything that might hint at such a move. ""We've had general conversations with resource companies, but not about that specifically,"" he said. ""Really, I just don't want to pre-empt conversations with other ministers and with other interested parties, including the regulators."" The mechanism can only be used in limited circumstances, and it is not clear the current price spikes would be enough to invoke it. The Resources Minister, the newly-appointed Madeleine King, would need to determine that there will be a market shortfall of gas next year, not just high prices. Australia is on the ""precipice"" of a UK-style crisis that could send power retailers broke and fuel a surge of energy poverty, expert says. Even then, the earliest date export controls could be imposed is January next year, which would do nothing to help with the immediate issue of price peaks for businesses and households. Of course, the government could rewrite the terms of the mechanism to get around those problems. But there are other reasons to be cautious about pulling the trigger. If supply contracts are disrupted, it could affect Australia's reputation as a reliable trading partner, which could have long-term ramifications for the resources sector. And cutting critical energy supplies to allies we are supporting to push back against Russia might not be a wise diplomatic move, either. The gas industry, represented by the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association (APPEA), has rejected the link between the rising prices domestically and the export market. APPEA acting chief executive Damian Dwyer said international price volatility and electricity generation issues are behind the price rises, and points out most domestic gas users have not been immediately affected. ""Around 85 per cent to 90 per cent of the gas market is covered by long-term contracts, known as gas supply agreements (GSAs), which were offered for this year — and locked in by many customers — at price levels of around $6/gigajoule to $9/GJ,"" Mr Dwyer said in a statement. ""The remainder is covered by smaller, volatile spot price markets which for much of this year have been around 70 per cent lower than those paid internationally, remembering that some of the headline-grabbing figures of recent days were future forecasts before prices were capped, not real prices being paid."" Despite labelling the energy price rises as ""apocalyptic"", the Australian Industry Group acknowledges using the gas reservation mechanism would be a ""last-resort option"". Representing some industrial gas users, chief executive Innes Willox wants to see a swift and targeted short-term response to help vulnerable users. ""The states hold many relevant levers, as do the energy market authorities, energy suppliers and energy users,"" he said. ""The first task for the Commonwealth is to bring us all together.""
