0,Keeping warm in winter while saving power: Can you pick fact from fiction?,house-and-home,"  Quiz: Can you pick fact from fiction when it comes to keeping warm in winter while still saving power? We've been urged to keep an eye on our electricity usage, which can be tricky during the chilly winter months. However, Energy Minister Chris Bowen says Australians don't need to sacrifice their heating in response to energy supply issues. Rather, he says, people can simply reduce their energy consumption by disconnecting things they're not using or that don't need to be turned on. See if you can tell fact from fiction with the following energy-saving information.

1,"Giving up insurance, choosing meat-free meals and skipping breakfast: What Australians are doing to survive the cost-of-living crisis",house-and-home,"  Giving up insurance, choosing meat-free meals and skipping breakfast: What Australians are doing to survive the cost-of-living crisis Living on a houseboat comes with a few perks. Unlike his mates on the mainland, Arthur White isn't dealing with skyrocketing rental prices or anxiously anticipating interest rate hikes. There are some downsides too, though, like having to source your own electricity to boil a cup of tea. And life at sea hasn't been enough to shield the retired pensioner from the cost of living crisis engulfing Australia. Electricity supply issues hit a tipping point on the east coast last week, driven by the soaring cost of wholesale energy and high winter demand. There are now warnings the cost of household energy bills will balloon within weeks. But far away in the Gove Penisula, in the northeast corner of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, Arthur has already figured out a solution to his very own energy crisis. ""I generate my own electricity using solar panels during the day, and a small generator in the evening — in the past, that used about eight litres of petrol a night,"" he says, ""so you can imagine why my costs have gone through the roof"". When Russia's war in Ukraine triggered a global oil supply crunch, the 73-year-old found he was paying about $2.70 for a litre of petrol just to keep the lights on. Australians across the country have felt similar pain at the bowser, as fuel prices exceeded $2 a litre in capital cities last month. The spike meant Arthur was no longer able to afford the same groceries he usually could on his weekly pension of just over $500. With everything from mortgage rates to grocery prices and energy bills going up, more Australians are under financial pressure. We want to hear how it's impacting you. An answer to his problem came in the form of a $275 wind generator, which has reduced his fuel costs by about 60 per cent or $189 a fortnight. ""The good thing is at this time of year we get a fair bit of wind,"" he laughs. ""If I hadn't bought that, as the weather warms up again, I would have been at a point where I wouldn't be able to afford the food I need to sustain life."" Arthur's experience, while undoubtedly unique, is not an isolated one. Across cities, the regions, and even the sea, Australians from a variety of income levels are suddenly having to find new ways to keep costs down. While for some this looks like investing in renewable energy or starting a vegetable garden, for others it has meant going without basic necessities. ""I can imagine how bad it is for pensioners like myself living on shore, who pay rents, rates, electricity, and water,"" Arthur says. ""The way it's going now, I consider myself lucky."" Over the past few months, an unwelcome bounty of financial stresses have begun to stack on top of one another. During the pandemic, we got our first taste as thousands of workers suddenly found themselves out of a job. As Australia ushered in the new year, things were looking up with the end of lockdowns and the reopening of international borders. But that soon brought its own challenges; with migrants back in the country and rental vacancy rates at record lows, it didn't take long for rental prices to creep up. Soon came the pain at the bowser. With the war in Ukraine in full swing, petrol prices soared, adding further pressure to already cash-strapped families. Then, this month, the Reserve Bank increased interest rates by half a percentage point and warned that further rises were likely, leaving borrowers biting their nails. Philip Lowe has warned Australians they need to be prepared for substantial interest rate rises over the rest of this year, conceding he is not sure how high they might go. And now we have lettuces selling for more than $10 a head in some supermarkets, an inflation rate of 5.1 per cent that is only set to grow, and energy supply issues that could see household bills skyrocket. It's a lot to keep track of, and according to Edwina MacDonald, the acting chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Services (ACOSS), the result is nothing short of a ""crisis point"". ""We've got these converging crises — cost of living, increasing energy costs, a double whammy of COVID and flu season, and we're going into a really cold winter,"" she says. ""We know people are already struggling to just afford the basics, and with increasing inflation, it's only going to get worse."" In response, the Fair Work Commission last week announced a 5.2 per cent increase to the national minimum wage, bringing it slightly above inflation. In practice, this means an extra $40 a week for those on the lowest wages. But with the Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe warning that inflation could hit 7 per cent by Christmas, many say it's only the tip of the iceberg of what's needed. ""What that decision is doing is addressing inflation and making sure people aren't falling behind,"" MacDonald says, ""but we certainly need to do more to improve the lives of people on low and modest incomes"". When looking at the load of financial pressures Australians are under, the obvious next question is what can households do to make it out the other side? The answer is different for everyone, given these pressures are not felt evenly across the community. ""People on low, fixed incomes often have much less ability to adapt to these cost of living increases in ways that don't cause them poverty,"" says Professor Roger Wilkins, an expert on socioeconomic disadvantage at the University of Melbourne. Long searches, skyrocketing prices and diminishing quality. Sydney's housing market is cutthroat, and desperate renters are paying the price. It's this group that have found themselves having to choose between paying their electricity bill and buying medication or buying petrol and being able to afford their rent. ""These are just unacceptable choices in a fundamentally wealthy country like Australia,"" MacDonald says. ""No one should be having to make a choice between really basic needs like that."" But when it comes to households with more room in the budget, there's a wide range of ways people typically respond to increased financial pressure. The first, Professor Wilkins says, is dipping into savings. But savings are ultimately finite, and for many the next step is reducing discretionary spending, whether that's giving up trips to the cinema or putting off buying that new washing machine that you kind of need, but not really. There's growing evidence, however, that people often treat items as discretionary that ""really shouldn't be"", Professor Wilkins says, such as opting to reduce insurance coverage or ditch it completely. ""And that then makes them much more exposed to risk, say you crash your car, then you can't afford to fix it, and that means you can't get to work,"" he says. ""Everything is interlinked, so everything is on the table of how people respond to it."" The above list of cost-cutting measures is all too familiar to John O’Driscoll, a father of two teenage boys from Melbourne's outer suburbs. After almost a year of unemployment due to a pandemic-induced redundancy in 2020 and with a new mortgage to pay for, he's found he and his wife's full-time incomes are no longer enough to keep up with their lifestyle. One of the first expenses to go was health insurance, a difficult decision for the 52-year-old. ""We're at the age when you want insurance, so it wasn't something you take lightly,"" he says. Since then, trips to the cinema, streaming subscriptions, and takeaway have all been stripped from the budget. In the kitchen, tofu has started popping up more regularly in place of meat, snacks in the pantry are scarce, and discount boxes of ""ugly"" vegetables are a staple. ""Where before I would go to the coffee shop a couple of times a week, we don't do that anymore — we just don't go out,"" he says. ""You keep getting rid of little bits and pieces."" John explains that his situation is not so bad compared to many others doing it tough — for now, he can still afford his fixed-term mortgage payments, his children's private schooling, and to put food on the table. But still, he says, it's like running just to stand still. ""At one stage, my pay seemed to be alright, we lived comfortably — but over the years, it just seemed like my wages didn't go up as the prices of things were constantly going up,"" he says. ""I've never felt the worry I feel now."" It's a similar story for Deanna, another new homeowner in Melbourne's outer suburbs, who did not wish to use her surname. The 29-year-old works full-time in a ""pretty stable job"" and her partner owns a small electrician business. But after breaking their budget to purchase a home a year ago, they're anxiously anticipating further interest rate rises. Industry groups are warning that consumers already battling surging costs are set to face more pain as the price of everything from food and flights to the weekend drive soars. ""We're stretched to our limit in terms of mortgage repayments,"" she says. ""And everything I am hearing and feeling with the cost of living and potentially interest rates going up in the future, I, like many other people, am trying to make cuts now."" On top of the usual tricks to reduce the cost of grocery shopping — buying from affordable farmers' markets and eating mostly plant-based meals — Deanna has quit her psychology sessions and cancelled her gym membership as a first step to getting ahead on their mortgage. ""On a good week when there were no extra expenses, then it was fine,"" she says. ""But when things come up, like my dog needs surgery, I need to cut back those expenses."" Like John, Deanna stresses that she's aware of her privileged position — that she does have expenses that can be eliminated without compromising basic needs — but says the added financial pressure is constantly front of mind. ""Looking at it from mortgage repayments, I think 'well what's going to happen if I'm on maternity leave, or trying to manage on one income', all those logistics that I've never had to think about before,"" she says. ""I don't think we're in a position right now where we're acutely financially stressed, but it's the anticipation of what's to come."" The reality of the situation is far different for millions of Australians who were living below the poverty line long before the cost of living crisis hit headlines. More than three million Australians are believed to be living below the relative poverty line, set at $457 per week for a single adult (equivalent to 50 per cent of the Australian median household income), according to a 2020 report by ACOSS and the University of New South Wales. The majority of these people rely on government welfare for their income. The current Job Seeker rate for unemployed Australians currently sits at $321 a week — below half the median income and the Henderson poverty line of $493 for a single person as of the December quarter. At OzHarvest food bank in Waterloo, in Sydney's inner suburbs, people in the line — many of them reliant on government support — are quick to list the ways it's become harder to survive in recent months. Max, who did not wish to use his surname, says he's been on Job Seeker since he was stood down from his job as a caterer at Sydney Airport during the pandemic. With two young children to support, who are with him in line, he's been relying on the food bank to save money for other expenses. ""Everything is getting more expensive,"" he says. ""Electricity bills, water, internet — my kids are going to school and need an internet connection, I can't say 'oh no, sorry, I don't have money to pay the monthly internet bill'."" He believes this is the ""hardest time in Australia for everyone"", describing conversations he's had with people at supermarkets, despairing at the cost of cucumbers. It's a perspective shared by Tim, a pensioner who describes OzHarvest as ""a life saver"". ""You go to Coles and Woolies, and broccoli is $7 — you've got to wait for weeks until it comes down to a reasonable price and then you might be able to buy it,"" the 71-year-old says. ""Each week, I go to Aldi, Woolies, and Coles to see what's the cheapest, and I've got a walking stick."" For Anna, a psychology student at the market for the first time, the cost of surviving is sometimes eating just one meal a day while she looks for casual work. With no end in sight for the current crisis, Professor Wilkins reiterates the serious consequences for people living on the poverty line. ""What it means is increased hardship, amongst a group that already face a lot of hardship, and when you get increased hardship you get increased stress, mental distress, family conflict, poorer health, and more suffering,"" he says. ""What it translates to is the lived experience of Australians, in some cases, being intolerable … People say money doesn't make you happy, but it's sure hard to be happy without money.""

2,"After losing their home to fire, this family is restoring an old homestead trucked in from 100 kilometres away",house-and-home,"  Fire-affected family brings 'grand old lady' back to life by restoring old homestead It was a day the Cooper family will never forget. Driving home during 2018 to their property in Tanamera, north-west of Longreach, they found their 60-year-old homestead burnt to the ground. The outback Queensland family had lost everything except what they had on them when they left the house that day, and had to completely rebuild from the ground up. But it was not a typical rebuild. Rather than build a new home, or buy a kit home, Sally and her husband Wally decided to move a homestead more than a century old from another property north of Winton, more than 100 kilometres away. ""We went and had a look,"" Sally said. ""When we first drove up, my husband said, 'Now Sally don't fall in love with this house'. ""But we drove up the back and just went, 'Oh my goodness' … and we did fall in love with it. ""The house was in amazing condition for its age … it just had the most beautiful high ceilings, and it was so solid."" After beginning their search in 2019, and living in dongas (temporary, transportable accommodation) in the meantime, it was not until April 2020 that the main structure of the house, minus the verandahs and the roof, was loaded onto a truck and moved to Tanamera. ""I've never seen such a process in my life,"" Sally said. ""They just pick this thing up, put it on a truck, and here it is."" During the process of moving and restoring the home, Sally found the original plans of the home, which was built in the late 1800s. She discovered the house's first location was at Charters Towers before it was moved to Aldingham Station, north of Winton. Sally said the home had come to ""her final resting place"" at Tanamera. ""We've kept some of the nails and things that came out,"" she said. ""They were all hand forged … I just couldn't get over how amazing it was."" It was a love of old homes that made them want to restore the ""grand old lady"", honouring its history while also making a home suitable for a modern family on the land. ""It's nice to recycle things and these beautiful old homes are so solid,"" Sally said. ""You can't build that kind of character. ""We wanted to keep the integrity of the house [and] we didn't want to chance anything. ""[But] we did want to modernise it and future-proof it, I suppose. ""It's just a really easy house to live in … it's just got that beautiful feel to it."" Having lived through almost a decade of drought on the cattle and goat station, the importance of a home is not lost on Sally. While it was not the main focus, or the priority, on a station, it was an important part of life on the land. ""There was such a beautiful garden around the house,"" Sally said. ""It does make such a difference ""Sometimes some of the things you're doing out in the paddock are horrible. ""It's nice to come back [to this]."" Looking at photos of the house when they first saw it, Sally said she could not quite believe how much it had transformed. ""But I'm pretty proud of us both. We put in a big effort,"" she said. ""Building a house is no small undertaking and I can tell you, I don't want to do it again, for a long time."" The house was still a work in progress, but Sally said they were happy to take their time to make it right.

3,"In the Hobbit House, 86 types of wallpaper tell almost two centuries of stories",house-and-home,"  Hobbit House in Oatlands tells 160 years of stories through layers of historical wallpaper A convict-built cottage in Tasmania's Southern Midlands is slowly revealing 160 years of secrets through its many layers of historical wallpaper. The Hobbit House, as it is affectionately known by its owners, is an 1860s timber cottage built in Oatlands by convict James McDermott. McDermott was transported to Van Diemen's Land in 1850 for stealing a cow but was later pardoned and worked as a farm labourer in the Oatlands area. He and his wife Mary Ann and three sons lived at the cottage for 60 years between them. Wallpaper historian Alan Townsend said the cottage got its name due to its saggy walls. ""There are so many layers of wallpaper in this tiny little house that the ceilings sag in towards you so you feel like you're underground,"" Mr Townsend told Helen Shield on ABC Radio Hobart. He said the cottage was a time capsule and had layer after layer of wallpaper added — 86 different types altogether. ""Not only do you have about 160 years of people wallpapering it every two or three years, it's never been touched."" One room alone has 30 layers of wallpaper. ""Nearly 200 years later, they've gifted us this lovely archive of what colonial taste was like in the 1860s."" Smoke from the cottage's open fires would darken the wallpaper, which led to the occupants adding more over the top, Mr Townsend said. ""The other problem is, being a timber house you get a lot of drafts, and every year or two you'd re-paper and keep the drafts out … over time you end up with 30 layers."" He thinks the McDermotts probably acquired discounted off-cuts from local shops. The cottage's current owner invited Mr Townsend to collect some wallpaper when she was removing it — he wasn't sure what to expect, but arrived with conservation volunteers Linda Clarke and Karen Stott to find ute-loads of it. ""The place was just chock-a-block full of it,"" he said. ""We spotted straight away that some of the early layers were really, really interesting. ""One layer depicted a landscape filled with classical ruins like an MC Escher painting that could never exist in reality; somehow in the 1860s they thought it would make good wallpaper."" Oatlands is known to be a cold and windy town in winter. In an 1860s cottage the occupants would also cover cracks and gaps with old dress fabric, hessian, newspapers and even children's homework, Mr Townsend said. ""We've got 100 years of textile history,"" he said. Between 1864 and 1880 the McDermotts pasted their children's homework to the wall, which Mr Townsend initially thought was for practicality rather than display. Children were given a blank copy book, with each page containing a beautifully written line at the top; some of the lines reinforced moral messages from school. ""Your job was to copy that line 20 or 30 times on the page to end up with that beautiful copperplate handwriting that the 19th century is so famous for,"" he said. ""You see a real transition; the parents are convicts and are totally illiterate."" He said the McDermotts had signed official documents with an ""X"", meaning they could not read or write, ""whereas their kids are getting quite a good education in Oatlands in the 19th century"". ""I think that's why there's so much of their homework pasted to the wall because you've got really proud parents wanting to document what their kids are doing. ""We've found so much of this stuff and there's really only one conclusion to draw: it was the trophy room."" Mr Townsend also found a portion of a letter that was properly signed by James McDermott. ""We know he was illiterate; by the time the kids were old enough to read and write, the parents were using them to write letters for them."" Mr Townsend is writing a book that will tell some of Tasmania's social history discovered through wallpaper. When people looked back at Tasmania's colonial history, it was often a drab picture, he said, ""but if you were living here in the 1850s, you had access to the most amazing shops"". ""You could get pretty much anything you could get in the shops of London or Paris in the shops of Hobart,"" Mr Townsend said. A house in Evandale has bespoke French wallpaper from the 1800s in which the entire room was one individual piece of art depicting two royal families meeting in the deserts of Arabia. ""How on Earth did this end up in Tasmania?"" Initially, decorative wallpaper was for the rich only, Mr Townsend said. ""But then jump to the 1860s and you've got convicts buying it,"" he said. ""The reason is by the middle of the 19th century, you've got machine printing coming in and what used to be a luxury item was suddenly available to everyone.""

5,"Mystery solved: Object that fell through family’s roof was bullet, according to gun expert ",house-and-home,"  Mystery object that fell through Gympie family's roof identified as a bullet The mystery surrounding an unidentified object that crashed through a Gympie family's roof last month may have been solved. The object fell through Tenika Lawther's roof and into their tiled floor, before landing in their baby's chair just after 7pm on May 4. Ms Lawther's five-month-old daughter Oceana Gardner had been sitting in the bouncer moments before the 3 centimetre object fell from the sky. Ms Lawther and partner Matthew Gardner posted pictures of the mystery fragment on social media and were inundated with suggestions it was everything from space junk and aviation debris. They even had offers from people wanting to buy the fragment. The Gympie mother told the ABC they now understand it was a bullet, after having it examined by a local gun expert. Ms Lawther said she was ""shocked"" by the outcome and believed it may have originated from someone shooting into the sky. The couple had initially contacted police who told them it was not a police matter. ""They said just get up and put a tarp over your roof and then you need to fix it and probably get compensated for it,"" she said. Ms Lawther said the couple weren't interested in further investigations and wanted to get on with fixing their home. Long-time Gympie gun shop owner Ron Owen examined the object and determined it was a bullet likely fired by a historical weapon. ""I first of all recognised it as a large cast lead projectile, which would have been used in muzzle loaders,"" he said. ""Or ancient firearms from the 1870s or 1880s."" Mr Owen said he has examined thousands of projectiles over the past 60 years and recognised the object by its shape. ""The firearms that use those projectiles, are usually muzzle loading black powder, or early cartridge guns,"" he said. ""They would have been at least a diameter of 0.577. ""We couldn't measure the diameter (of the object) because it had been squashed."" Mr Owen said there would be thousands of weapons or replica weapons in Queensland that could have been used to fire the projectile. He said he was happy to help solve the mystery for Ms Lawther and her family. ""I could show her the undeformed lead projectiles that we had in the museum, so she could recognise the lube rings on it,"" Mr Owen said. ""And she could see the rifling marks on the outside of it that had not been squashed."" As to how it crashed with such force through the ceiling, Mr Owen said that was due to the gravity of the bullet after being shot into the air. ""It was a surprise as to how it came through the lady's ceiling,"" he said. ""It comes down at 32 feet per second, you know, it's gravity. ""I wouldn't like that to fall on my head, no."" He has encouraged gun owners to consider their surroundings before firing shots into the air. ""I would advise people to not fire directly up into the air too close to town,"" he said.

7,Brisbane 2011 flood victims to receive full $450 million payout by early 2023 ,house-and-home,"  Brisbane 2011 flood class action win of $450 million to be distributed by early 2023 Victims of the 2011 Brisbane floods have started receiving part of the $450 million settlement won in a class action against dam operator SunWater and the state of Queensland. In November 2019, the Supreme Court in New South Wales found flood engineers operating the Wivenhoe and Somerset Dams in Queensland were negligent and failed to follow the manual they had helped draft. While the court ruled in favour of the negligence claim against the Queensland government of the day, as well as Seqwater and SunWater, other aspects of the case failed. The class action alleged the dam operators failed to follow their own manual and did not make enough room for heavy rainfall until it was too late, heightening flood levels and damaging more properties. Maurice Blackburn lawyer Rebecca Gilsenan told ABC Radio Brisbane's Steve Austin some of the almost 7,000 claimants had received an interim payment. She said the total payout would not be distributed until all legal matters associated with the case were finalised. That could take until the end of this year or early 2023. ""We are releasing partial payments now so people can get something,"" Ms Gilsenan said. ""We've paid about 300 people so far and we are paying on a rolling basis — when people accept their loss assessment, we can pay them."" Maurice Blackburn developed a settlement scheme which informed how the money would be distributed among the claimants and took into account their location and the damage sustained. Ms Gilsenan said most people accepted their assessment and wanted to ""move through the process"". ""There are a small number of people who have appealed and asked us to look at that assessment again and we've done that,"" she said. ""They're only ever going to get half of what they lost, at most, because we only settled half the case, half the case we lost, so I can understand why some people are angry. ""But more than 95 per cent understand and accept what's being allocated."" Describing the initial payouts as a ""conservative amount"", Ms Gilsenan said most were valued at just several thousand dollars. She acknowledged the decade-long legal process was too long and left victims without a sense of closure for many years. Ms Gilsenan said some insurers were entitled to a payout as well. Once you're aware of the risks from disasters, you can plan for them — and it can help mitigate some of the impacts. She said some members of the class action were brought in by their insurers who wanted to recoup money they had paid out. ""Like individuals, insurers paid out in a instance where there was a wrongdoer who ended up settling, so they're entitled to a portion of that as well,"" Ms Gilsenan said. ""A bit less than half of the money will go to insurers. There's no disputing the fact a huge amount of money was paid out by them. ""If you've got a house and a car and both of those were significantly damaged in the floods, and your car might not have comprehensive insurance but your house does ... sometimes we've got claims brought by the group member and the insurer together for both of the parts they've footed the bill for."" Lynette Lynch's Fernvale home flooded to the ceiling in 2011 and she lost everything. She described the end of the court battle as a relief. ""We are finally getting closure on all of this and it won't be in the back of our mind so much. It's been very stressful and for so many people it's been awful,"" Ms Lynch said. ""We never got paid by our insurer. We took it to the ombudsman and even then you only get a percentage of your claim. ""The amount [from Maurice Blackburn] was nowhere close to recouping our losses. But we got more going through a class action than we would have individually."" Since the inundation, Ms Lynch said she could only afford insurance premiums if she underinsured her home. ""It was a brick exterior, the brick stayed there, but it had to be Gernied [high water-pressure cleaned] and Gernied and Gernied,"" she said. ""The walls and the doors had to be removed and we had to slowly rebuild. I had a cottage out the back of my home so it was a double rebuild. ""It felt bittersweet because I had to use cheaper materials to rebuild the house. I had to cut back on the cost because I just couldn't afford it."" The flood event may have been 11 years ago now but Ms Lynch said some people would ""never get past it"". ""Some people suffer really badly,"" she said. ""They just relive that day over and over, and when they got back in their homes all their possessions were destroyed. The loss is too great.

8,Andrew Forrest scoops up prime WA land for major residential development,house-and-home,"  Andrew Forrest scoops up prime land in Binningup for major residential development Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest has bought a parcel of coastal land at Binningup for residential development. The Forrest family's property development company, Fiveight, confirmed the deal which includes 260 hectares of land and 2.2 kilometres of beach frontage. The company said it would ""reactivate"" the coastal site, and a key priority was to re-open the nine-hole golf course. Fiveight boss John Meredith said a series of community consultations with stakeholders and interested parties would ""move the discussion forward"". ""We know that demand for quality housing is on the rise, and will only become more vital, as the area grows and develops,"" Mr Meredith said. ""Although this project has a long horizon, we are committed to working closely with residents and community organisations to develop a sustainable, long-term plan for the site, one that will create a vibrant, socially connected local community that people will be proud to call home."" A purchase price was not disclosed, however Mr Meredith said ""the size of the purchase was probably going to be dwarfed by the scale of the investment"", which he estimated would double the size of the current town site. ""We would anticipate that the future of Binningup really does deliver on new opportunities,"" Mr Meredith said. ""While Binningup itself is quite a sleepy, seaside village, it has had plans in place for development for well over a decade. ""The unfortunate thing is the promises of the past have never really been delivered on."" Shire of Harvey president Paul Gillett said the council was supportive of the proposed development despite the planning being in ""the early stages"""" As lithium prices surge, US chemicals company Albemarle is considering a major expansion of its refinery south of Perth, with plans for a 1,000-bed capacity workers' village at Binningup. It follows another recent announcement by US chemicals company Albemarle, which is considering a major expansion of its refinery 200 kilometres south of Perth. It has plans for a 1,000-bed capacity workers' village in Binningup. Albemarle is weeks away from first production of battery-grade lithium hydroxide at its Kemerton plant, just north of Bunbury. Mr Gillett said he understood concerns the development could lead to price hikes for existing homes as evidenced by nearby tourist towns of Dunsborough and Margaret River to the south. ""Hopefully it won't spoil that parcel of land through Binningup, it is magnificent,"" Mr Gillett said. ""It was one of the best kept secrets in WA. Now that the secret is out, maybe a few more people can come down and appreciate what a wonderful place it is.""

9,Here's what you'll need to properly remove mould,house-and-home,"  What's the best way to remove mould? We asked an expert Cruel mistress La Niña ensured large parts of Queensland and New South Wales were drenched with water over the summer and autumn and, according to the BOM, the wet weather is likely to continue into winter. The relentless moistness has ensured that even people in homes and businesses not devastated by flooding are now battling a serious mould and mildew problems. For those not used to dealing with rampant fungi, it's proving tough to get rid of, with tips flying all over social media about the best methods. Lisa Bentley — of Lisa's Eco Cleaning on Brisbane's westside — has been gathering tips on the best way to remove mould for 17 years. Through extensive research and experimentation, this is the effective formula she's come up with. Ms Bentley says clove oil is key to killing the mould spores. (But it can be toxic to humans and pets, so don't ingest!) Studies have shown bleach can kill mould on hard surfaces like tiles, but Queensland Health says it may not be effective in removing it from porous surfaces. A Queensland Health fact sheet says: ""Household cleaning agents or detergents can do an effective job if used correctly."" She says this technique will work on most surfaces, excluding limestone or marble: Prevention is always better than cure, of course, but sometimes that's easier said than done. Removing the dampness and humidity is the key to stopping mould, as it needs moisture and nutrients to grow. Read more tips on how to mould-proof your home here. The Queensland government website says to take precautions when cleaning mould, as it can be dangerous to breathe in. It suggests you ""obtain personal protective equipment, including half-face disposable respirators with P1 or P2 filters, to avoid inhaling mould spores when cleaning. ""You’ll find these at hardware stores."" It also says to place drop sheets on the floor and to make sure others are not around while you clean, if they don't need to be. They say not to put dirty clothes back into your cleaning solution, and ""always use a different cloth with each process and throw them away after, or the mould spores will spread and mould will reappear"". Queensland Health has a few different suggestions: Products like clove oil and white vinegar can be tricky to find at the moment, with so many people battling mould problems. Clove oil — which one retailer described as ""like liquid gold at the moment"" — can be found, when available, at some chemists, health food and organic shops or through online retailers.

10,'Neighbourhood character' a major concern in housing development application denial,house-and-home,"  Housing crisis on City of Bendigo's agenda, but council denies application for 14 dwellings A housing development application for 14 unit-styled semidetached dwellings has been denied in a unanimous vote by the City of Greater Bendigo council. The California Gully application, which has 12 three bedrooms and two featuring two bedrooms, was knocked back for several reasons, with councillors citing maintaining ""neighbourhood character"" as a major concern. Most of the proposed properties were designed to share a wall, unlike the freestanding houses on the street. City of Bendigo councillor Dave Fagg said there had been previous development applications for the lot of land at 25 Alliance Avenue and 26-28 Youlden Street in 2010 and 2014, along with a permit for six dwellings that had expired. More than 2,000 households were added to the social housing register in Queensland last financial year, though demand is stabilising, according to the state government. Mr Fagg said it was disappointing to see the application had been recommended for refusal. However, he agreed with the council officers' decision. ""The reason for my disappointment is the city needs smaller housing developments of this kind which can fill in vacant lots of land with unit housing that can house Bendigo's growing population,"" he said. ""Some might argue that when the housing crisis is as bad as it is, then maintaining neighbourhood character is just not important."" ""However, I think we can chew gum and walk at the same time. we can create infill housing while maintaining neighbourhood character."" City of Bendigo Mayor Andrea Metcalf said the application was also knocked back due to additional concerns about amenity, some of the houses being semidetached and insufficient visitor car park. Throughout the ordinary council meeting, councillors spoke about the urgent need for additional affordable housing options for the city. ""It doesn't mean that we don't want more infill housing, and not necessarily all the same type of housing either,"" Ms Metcalf said. ""Because we do need to have housing that is two-bedroom units; because we know that we do have a lot of households that have just got one or two people living in [a two-bedroom] house. ""That was another reason why it was refused too. It didn't provide a greater variation of housing offering to our community."" Council documents also revealed soil testing assessment found arsenic concentrations across parts of the site exceeded the residential threshold, which can be attributed to historical mining in the area. However, the assessment concluded the site was suitable for unrestricted residential use in its current condition, subject to recommendations. Housing support provider Haven Home Safe says 1,865 Central Victorians had accessed emergency accommodation in the past year. With rental prices going up across the Greater Bendigo region and funding for housing support going down after COVID relief funding ends, support services manager Donna Gillard fears without additional affordable housing soon, the housing crisis will worsen. ""We're always going to have people experiencing homelessness for various reasons,"" she said. ""We're now experiencing higher costs for rental accommodation, and it's just it's unaffordable for us. ""It's certainly unaffordable for the people that we're working with.""

11,Worried about mould in your home? Here are the places you should be checking that may not be so obvious,house-and-home,"  Where you should be looking for mould and how long it takes to start growing With La Niña bringing lasting wet weather and high humidity, many people are finding mould in their homes. If you're worried there could be a mould infestation lingering in your home, here's what to do. Garry Carroll, director of the Australian Cleaning and Restoration Academy, says it really depends on the home, the water exposure and the humidity. ""Mould can start [growing] from 48 hours sometimes, if it’s got the right conditions,"" he said. While there might not be mould in the day or two after heavy rain, a change in conditions — like a humidity hike — can accelerate growth. Look out for dampness, a musty smell and condensation. Mr Carroll says there are two ways that mould infests properties — high humidity and water exposure. After months of wet weather, many people are struggling to contain mould. Here's how to get rid of it. When water gets into your home from leaks or floods, mould can grow in places that haven't dried out properly. Mr Carroll says there's a greater risk of mould when the humidity climbs beyond about 70 per cent. ""Once it goes above that, there’s more of a chance of things hitting dew point,"" he said. ""The air reaches saturation and can’t hold more water. ""Condensation builds up on materials, and then mould forms."" Any room with a water source in it — bathrooms, toilets and laundries. Mr Carroll says it's also important to look in bedrooms that adjoin bathrooms. Look at the entirety of the room, paying extra attention to the corners, ceiling cornices, window sills, carpets and skirting boards. Check soft, porous surfaces like couches and mattresses. But don't just do a quick once-over, inspect hidden places that aren't exposed to the air. Lift up couch cushions, check underneath mattresses, pull back mattress covers, lift up rugs and look under your doormat. And check out items that have no airflow around them — look in cupboards, drawers and behind dressers. If you've got an air conditioner, check the filter. There's also been reports of people finding mould behind picture frames and mirrors hung on the wall. ""Behind a picture frame, there's no airflow,"" Mr Carrol said. ""There's usually cardboard backing or MDF timber — both of those are very absorbent."" And don't forget to inspect your indoor plants, as they are consistently damp (especially if you're watering them properly). ""We recommend that, as soon as you see mould growth, you should act as swiftly as possible,"" Gerard Murtagh from cleaning company MouldMen said. ""Try and clean those areas, and keep your home dry."" Mr Murtagh says you can clean the mould yourself but if the growth is bigger than a dinner plate, it's best to call in an accredited expert. What rights do renters have when it comes to mould growth and who should remove it? Mr Carroll says if you're dealing with surface mould, it can be treated quite easily. But if that mould is growing through the gyprock or plasterboards in your home, say from a leak in the ceiling, it's going to be a bigger job. Mr Carrol says it's important not to just kill the mould, but to remove the dead spores. So if you've wiped over some mould, don't use that cloth again because it'll only spread the spores. The Queensland government says once you've cleaned the mould, you should go over the surface again with a new damp cloth and then dry it with another clean cloth. Mr Carroll says a stabilised chlorine dioxide is the best commercial product for cleaning mould. The Queensland government lists the following home remedies for removing mould: Turning on the fans is a good place to start. If you've got an air conditioner, run it on dry mode or consider using a dehumidifier. Open up the windows to air the place out, but only if it's sunny and not too humid. ""You can't open windows and ventilate when it's [pouring] down outside, you're only letting high humidity in,"" Mr Carroll said. Keep the humidity out and make sure your home is well ventilated. Look out for any water leaks, fix them quickly and install exhaust fans in the laundry and your bathrooms. After you've had a shower, open a window and run the exhaust fan for about 15 minutes to get rid of the steam. Freshen up the paint on your walls, because that'll provide a good protective barrier to prevent porous wall materials from sucking in moisture — the Queensland government suggests adding an anti-mould solution to the paint to help slow down mould growth. Keep your gutters clean, because this stops rainwater pooling during heavy downpours. Check the external walls of your home, clearing plants, soil and leaf litter from weep holes And keep in mind that plants growing on or close to external walls can promote moisture.

13,Timed eBay-style online auctions shake up the power dynamic of high-stakes property purchases,house-and-home,"  New eBay-style online property auctions offer transparency as Australian buyers bid from home When Tyler Hoggard and Jess Farrell recently bought their first house in Wollongong, the auction took place in the kitchen of the Mount Pleasant home that is now theirs. They had walked around the place, loved it and already pictured what life would look like living there. ""It [being there] definitely made an impact on the emotional connection, as it's always hard to properly gauge the quality of a home from photos and videos,"" Mr Hoggard said. It is this emotional connection real estate agents bank on at auctions, but technology could end up nullifying the effect as more bidders are raising their hands from their home or office. Timed online auctions are like buying a house on eBay, away from the theatre and pressure of a live onsite auction. ""I think that bidding online would have made for an entirely different experience and it would be much easier to let it go when the bidding had already gone further than we intended,"" Mr Hoggard said. ""While we went into the auction with a strategy in mind, most of it went out the window after the first few bids. ""There's a strong sense of urgency that comes with being present in the room."" Wollongong real estate agent Neil Webster recently sold a house in Shellharbour using a timed online auction. He said while the technology might not be best for every property, it offered a level of transparency that added credibility to his industry. ""There's a perception that real estate agents aren't the most trustworthy of people, it's a hark back to the bygone era when agents would do some dubious practices at times,"" he said. ""By using these platforms, we can operate in a more transparent way because people register, they're bidding and it's like eBay. ""You get notified every time an offer is made and you know someone is genuinely out there bidding against you."" He said the online auction gave buyers more time to consider their options than an onsite auction. If a higher bid comes in just before the auction closes, another five minutes is added to the auction each time the highest bid is exceeded. ""Sometimes the auction can go past the defined time because we have people throwing in that little bit more,"" Mr Webster said. ""That's what you'd be doing at an auction with the auctioneer saying, 'First call', 'Second call', then I can talk to the buyers. ""And online, it's the same process — I'm calling the underbidder to see if they have more in the tank and if they'll put another offer in."" By taking someone away from the front lawn or the kitchen of the property they are bidding on, an online auction can sever some of the attachment to a property. ""Being onsite definitely heightened the stakes,"" Mr Hoggard said. ""It gave us the opportunity to walk around inside the home and picture how we would live in different spaces."" Neil Webster knows it might end up swinging some control back towards the bidder at an auction, which is why real estate agents may still choose onsite auctions for properties people are more likely to live in. ""Having people stand on the front lawn or in the kitchen of the house they're trying to buy has a greater impact in terms of getting you emotionally involved in the sale process and once that aspect is removed, it takes away the connection to the property,"" he said. ""If you're buying as an investment, it's a different thing – you're doing it online where it's a business decision and you're [the agent] encouraging people to buy based on price and investment return.""

15,New Adelaide shop to sell second-hand building materials to raise money for Habitat for Humanity,house-and-home,"  New Habitat for Humanity shop ReStore to sell new and second-hand building materials in Adelaide A charity store in Adelaide's north-west is the first of its kind to launch in South Australia, selling new and second-hand donated building materials at discounted prices. The Alberton shop, called ReStore, sells new or gently used furniture, paving and plumbing materials, as well as lighting and bathroom fixtures that have been donated by building companies, businesses and individuals. It is an initiative that has been 15 years in the making for not-for-profit organisation Habitat for Humanity, which builds homes for disadvantaged families and apartments for homeless youth. The organisation's South Australian executive officer, Louise Hay, said it would be a relief to officially open the doors to the public on Saturday. ""Everybody has greeted us with such vigour and such interest,"" she said. ""Anybody who is interested in purchasing anything for their home is more than welcome; we're not about just helping low-income [people]."" Ms Hay said ReStore would act as a social enterprise, providing the organisation with a funding mechanism to continue its social housing programs. ""The money that we raise here is what will go back into our programs — so it'll go back into the building the homes for the disadvantaged,"" she said. The organisation has so far built more than 40 homes and apartments for South Australians struggling with shelter. Customer Debbie Richardson said it made shopping easier ""knowing that what you buy, that the money goes to housing people as well as feeling good about keeping things from landfill and having a nice buy for your house"". ""It just gives you an opportunity to perhaps buy something that you might have to save up for or you wouldn't get otherwise,"" Ms Richardson said. Port Adelaide Enfield Mayor Claire Boan hoped the shop would also become a hub for recycling. ""We're certainly looking at ways that we can work together in terms of saving some of the refuse that we put out for hard rubbish that can be collected and saved,"" she said. ""Rather than going to landfill, it can come back into this place for sustainability purposes. ""Why would we put something out into the dump if we can actually use it and put it to good use?"" Two other ReStore outlets operate in Victoria.

17,Campbell bought this 110yo church for $26K. He and Caroline renovated it and are now mortgage-free,house-and-home,"  Young couple turn ageing church into divine new home and are now mortgage-free A young couple have transformed a decaying country church into a new home, with locals ecstatic a piece of their history has been restored. Campbell Michell had only renovated a couple of small rooms before he found the Pinnaroo Methodist Church, about two hours east of Adelaide near the Victorian border, in 2016. The 110-year-old building was in a state of disrepair after the congregation moved out a decade earlier and storms had caused further damage. It was being considered for demolition and the church committee was ready to pay $45,000 to have it torn down. But that's when Mr Michell was visiting family in the town and put in a bid of $26,000 to purchase the church and save the building. ""When I first walked into the big hall here, I could just see how cool it was with the light shining in and I wanted to build a home that kept that feel,"" he said. ""But I also wanted it to be a modern thing with a lot of stairs and a fun English-manor kind of vibe. ""I think we hit it pretty well."" Mr Michell, who is a cabinet maker by trade, met his partner Caroline Forster three years ago after the project had started. Ms Forster has taken the lead on much of the interior design since she came into the picture. ""There was so much work to do and I did underestimate how much there was to do,"" he said. ""It was hard because the cracks were pretty intensive, the original foundations weren't up to modern standards and had deteriorated pretty badly over 110 years. ""It took a while of sweat and blood to chip at the old stuff, put the new stuff in and get it done."" The church was opened in 1912 and served as a town hall and meeting place during its early days. The large hall out the back was built to cater for the burgeoning Sunday school, which was attracting more students than the local area school. Local historian and church member Max Wurfel said Mr Michell and Ms Forster had saved what was an important building to the town's residents. ""As a congregation it was something we still had to maintain even though we weren't using it,"" he said. ""So to have someone come along and take it over was really good for us and the committee. It's really nice that it's still there. ""I'm pleased that they were able to get it and really do something with it."" The couple recently held an open day so locals could walk through and see the transformation to the building where many of them worshipped, were married and gathered with their friends. ""The town has been so supportive and it's been amazing to do a final reveal for them and have them walk through the house,"" Ms Forster said. ""Lots of them were married here and had funerals and baby showers here. ""They're all really happy with the progress and are just happy to see it being used instead of it going derelict."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Riverland's weekly email newsletter. Ms Forster added the renovation had educated the couple about the town they now called home. The large stained-glass windows that rise up inside the main hall bear the names of the town's early residents, each with a story their descendants have been keen to tell. The couple have added their names to the windows, signifying a new era for the church. ""We had a storm come through a year back and it actually damaged one of the windows,"" Mr Michell said. ""Rather than leave it how it was, we replicated the original windows and wrote on there that it was restored by us to add a bit of our own flavour. ""It's also to say thank you to our families too, the Michell and Forster families, because they put in a lot of time and money to help us with this and we're very grateful for that."" Now mortgage-free and ready to begin the next chapter of their lives, Ms Forster said living in the church felt like a ""dream"". ""Waking up in the morning to the church still doesn't feel real,"" she said. ""We're pretty young, we're mortgage-free and we have this awesome home.""

18,What Queensland home owners need to know about the state's fire alarm legislation,house-and-home,"  Queensland fire alarm legislation — what home owners need to know A recent tragedy has put Queensland's fire alarm legislation back on the radar for home owners who must comply with strict new rules by 2027. The Easter long weekend ended in tragedy when six-year-old Max Chirila died in a house fire in Brisbane's inner north on Monday. The Fire and Emergency Services (Domestic Smoke Alarms) Amendment Act 2016 (Qld) commenced on January 1, 2017 and imposed additional obligations on property owners and managers regarding the installation and maintenance of smoke alarms at domestic dwellings. If the existing smoke alarms were manufactured less than 10 years ago and are still in good working order, they can remain in place until 2027 when the smoke alarms are required to be AS 3786-2014 compliant. But that's just for owner-occupiers. Since January 1 this year, where properties were sold, leased or having a lease renewed, interconnected photoelectric smoke alarms must be installed. The Queensland Fire and Emergency Services website states that smoke alarms in the dwelling must also be less than 10 years old; operate when tested; and be interconnected with every other smoke alarm in the dwelling so all activate together. They must not also include an ionisation sensor. Smoke alarms must be installed on each storey, in each bedroom; in hallways that connect bedrooms and the rest of the dwelling or, if there is no hallway, between the bedrooms and other parts of the storey. If there are no bedrooms on a storey, at least one smoke alarm must be installed in the most likely path of travel to exit the dwelling. Smoke alarms must be hardwired or powered by a non-removable 10-year battery, or a combination of both may be allowed. Queensland Fire Alarms & Compliance's Jason Lee said the stipulation that smoke alarms be connected was to ensure occupants of a home were alerted to a fire in any part of the property. ""If there's smoke in a downstairs area, the smoke alarm should go off in an upstairs area too,"" he said. ""The laws have come out for a reason. If you're in a two-storey house you own and the downstairs fire alarm is not interconnected you may not know about a fire in time. ""Only an interconnected fire alarm will give you sufficient time to get out."" Mr Lee said photoelectric smoke alarms could ""see smoke before they sense it inside"" and owners should install the devices as soon as possible. He said the cost to upgrade a smoke alarm system started from about $120 per alarm, excluding labour. Editor's note An earlier version of this story mistakenly used the word hardwired instead of interconnected in this sentence: Since January 1 this year, where properties were sold, leased or having a lease renewed, interconnected photoelectric smoke alarms must be installed.

19,Renovation blowout: We spent a record $12b doing up our homes during the pandemic,house-and-home,"  Home renovation spending soars to $12b as locked-down Aussies extend, beautify their houses Australians have spent more on home renovations during the pandemic years than at any other time since records began 50 years ago. New data shows how houseproud we became, particularly once the initial shock of the pandemic began to wear off. As COVID landed, spread and paralysed much of Australian life, with state and international borders closed and entire cities locked down, we began spending more on renovations — up 10 per cent to $9.2 billion. But last year it must have felt safer to bet the house, with Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showing renovators poured a massive $12.3 billion into renovating their homes, up 33 per cent on 2020. That's almost double what we spent on renovations just 10 years ago. Alongside the pandemic forcing us to stay home was the Federal HomeBuilder scheme that paid out between $15,000 and $25,000 to  those willing to undertake a major renovation. It was designed as a stimulus measure in response to COVID, and since its launch, almost 25,000 renovators have applied. But not everyone was driven by the promise of free money — others were already designing their dream renovation before COVID arrived. Morgan McGahan was one of them, and she was not about to allow a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic to derail her plans. Her family bought their seaside home on the Sunshine Coast almost 10 years ago for about $400,000. In 2019, they had already begun planning to convert their ageing beach shack into a two-storey home with water views. Ms McGahan said moving did not feel like an option, because this was the only home her seven-year-old son Watson and five-year-old daughter Evelyn had known. ""This is a really special spot for us,"" she said. ""We got married out on that beach, we brought our two babies home here. ""We knew that that's what we wanted to do, to renovate and build on what we had already created – just with a little bit more room for the children."" Demolition at the Golden Beach site began just as Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and chief health officer Jeannette Young ordered the entire state to stay at home, and that most businesses be shut down. Although building could continue, they could not escape the spectre of COVID. ""We didn’t know if we would have any job security,"" she said. ""Once we had realised that we were safe in our jobs, and that yes, we can actually pay for this renovation with what's going on, and all the craziness – it continued to flow from there."" Zane McCarthy from Top Plate Building was the renovating builder behind the McGahans' project. He said it was no surprise to him that renovation numbers were breaking records. ""Oh mate, we are flat out — we get enquiries, probably two to three a week, and everyone's renovating,"" he said. The HomeBuilder grant was one of the biggest stimulus injections the housing industry had ever seen, but for those who missed out, it created turmoil. He said people were watching their house values go up, but it was often not enough to buy something bigger. ""I think everyone's at home watching the house value go up and thinking, 'I can borrow some money here'. ""And to buy a new house somewhere else is just not affordable."" Mr McCarthy said one of his projects was a major renovation so the daughter could live nearby. ""They looked at house prices … in the area and it wasn't affordable so they're renovating this place and they're all staying together."" The housing crisis across parts of the country is now critical, with those unable to buy also being turned away from the rental market. Pastor Dale Dowler, from The Shack Community Centre on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, has spent decades working with those either sleeping rough or at risk of homelessness. Will Australia's housing market be the same in the aftermath of the pandemic? He said the rise in renovations might mean higher rents for homeowners, but it also meant fewer affordable homes for those who needed it. ""People are investing in homes and then putting it back on the rental market, but it has priced a lot of community out of that rental market,"" he said. ""We've had families that are still sending their kids to school, but they're living in vans."" And he uses himself as an example, after paying to renovate his own home so his children have a place to call home. ""We bought our house 18 years ago and the cost was $116,000 – that same renovated house now is over $700,000."" It is not just the price of homes that is more expensive. A national lack of building supplies is likely to become more intense as parts of the country rush to rebuild after devastating floods. Mr McCarthy said while his projects continued, there had to be a knock-on effect from the flood disasters. ""It's already affecting us now,"" he said. ""We're probably already delayed a week to get materials we already ordered. ""It's going to be hell for 12 months.""

20,He ran his air conditioner all through Perth's record-breaking summer. The bill? Just $35 a month,house-and-home,"  Loose building standards let homes overheat in summer, stay cold in winter, passive house advocate says When Carlos Acuna and his family moved to Perth 10 years ago, they ""quickly fell in the love with place"". ""We got our permanent residency, and recently our citizenship. We've just loved it here and feel really fortunate to be in a place like this,"" he said. ""But the one thing that really impacted us, and impacts a lot of expats, is how uncomfortable the homes are here."" Around a fifth of new homes built in Western Australia do not have meet six-star energy standards, costing their owners dearly in running costs. Architects say it's time for a re-think. Seattle averages between 4-8 degrees Celsius in winter, while Perth's average winter temperatures are 10-18C, but the family found the houses they rented in Australia the coldest they had ever experienced. ""[The houses are] cold, they're ice chests,"" he said. ""In winter, they're colder than homes I can remember in Seattle, and definitely hard to cool down in the summer. ""We had very high electric bills in the summer to keep the house comfortable."" After years in rented houses, both old and new and that were all hard to keep at comfortable temperatures, he decided to build a highly insulated, airtight house that used passive heating and cooling design to keep the indoor temperature at between 20-25C all year round. He began talking to builders, but found that standards that were common in North America were not a part of most builds in Australia. ""We knew that we wanted a house to be built more towards an American standard, if you will, in terms of insulation and airtightness,"" he said. ""When we started talking with designers and builders, the insulation part was sort of known, but the air tightness was just really a topic that was really unheard of. ""Air tightness is maybe not as obvious, but if you have the best insulation in the world with gaps that allow cold air to escape in the summer, or hot air escaping in the winter, comfort in the house is going to be very difficult to maintain."" He said that every new North American home is tested for airtightness using what is called a ""blower door test"". It measures the number of air exchanges per hour inside a house, showing how quickly cooled or heated air is escaping from the home. In Australia, the current National Construction Code (NCC) requires new homes to be built to do 10 air exchanges per hour or fewer, but does not require blower door testing at the completion of a build to verify the standard has been met. Eight million Australian homes contribute 18 per cent of Australia's carbon emissions, a new report shows. Enacting any major change is especially hard for renters and people in low-income households. ""These are energy efficiency measures that started in the US and Europe with the Iran oil embargo in the 70s,"" Mr Acuna said. ""So today, a typical project builder in the US will achieve three air changes per hour, which is fantastic. ""By time you get below five you have a pretty well-performing and comfortable home that's fairly easy to cool or heat, and it won't escape through the holes."" Mr Acuna said in Australia no testing is required, and he suspects many new builds are not even meeting the six-star energy standards. ""The challenge with those standards is they're written in a way that makes them very unenforceable,"" he said. ""Over the seven years [we rented] older homes that were built in the '70s, and a couple of homes that were recently built to the six star standard, there was really no appreciable difference in performance."" After an extensive search, the Acunas opted for a German Passivhaus design which uses thick, insulated walls and double glazing with tight seals to create an extraordinarily airtight building that, when tested, allows only 0.6 air exchanges per hour. ""The German Passivhaus standard is the most energy efficient standard in the world right now,"" he said. The home is so airtight it needs mechanical ventilation to introduce fresh air and prevent mould, but it also means that a double storey, 200-square-metre, four-bedroom house uses just two small reverse-cycle air conditioners for heating and cooling. While the build was much more expensive than a typical new home, its average heating and cooling costs — which fluctuate with the season — are around just $35 a month. It allows the family to make the most of Perth's climate while staying comfortable. ""When the weather's nice outside, as it is for large parts of the year in Perth, we can open up our windows and allow fresh air in and out,"" Mr Acuna said. ""But as soon as it gets too cold or too hot we can close the doors and windows and know that the heating or cooling that you're pumping into the house is not escaping."" The house has two small split system air-conditioners — one upstairs, one downstairs — which can stay on for months in summer and winter, keeping the temperature consistent. ""We've been living here since January 2019 and we've never had a summer where this space is at more than 23 degrees,"" he said. Despite the energy saving, the high cost of a PassivHaus means it is probably not for everyone. But Mr Acuna believes raising standards, and testing, on conventional builds could make a big difference in all new homes. ""Leaky homes"" are hard to keep warm in winter and cool in summer, but there are simple ways to fix them. ""The building associations are very hesitant to embrace some of these new standards like airtightness, and they're trying to delay the government's implementation as late as they can,"" he said. ""But I do think that people are starting to hear more about this. ""And the truth is it's not difficult to build in a draught-free building envelope. It just needs some attention to detail really. ""Builders are doing it in the rest of the developed world, it's just a matter of time before the builders here learn how to do it, and they'll be doing it for the same cost that they're building houses now."" And he now enjoys winters without freezing. ""You wake up in the morning at five or six to take a shower and the house is at 18 degrees,"" he said. ""In the first winter that was fantastic for us because we'd been living in homes that were at 10 degrees in the morning.""

21,'This is for sale?': Why Natasha left a tiny city unit to run a 180yo country homestead with a big history,house-and-home,"  Historic Narracoorte Homestead in hands of a loving, if 'overwhelmed', Natasha Biggins In June 2021, Natasha Biggins was trying to sell a wardrobe. After living in cities around the world she was based in a one-bedroom unit in Adelaide. ""The people that came to look at [the wardrobe], I ended up selling them my whole house,"" Natasha said. A fourth-generation sheep farmer from Naracoorte on South Australia's Limestone Coast, the pandemic had her seriously questioning where she wanted to bide her time. An offer from her brother to house-sit his farm for a few weeks directed her next steps. ""I went from living in my one-bedroom unit with no pets to looking after ... five thousand sheep, three cats, four dogs … chopping all my own firewood,"" Natasha said. ""I was absolutely exhilarated by that."" A chance encounter with Narracoorte Homestead weeks later stirred her to buy the three-acre site, Naracoorte's first dwelling, with little thought. After 10 years on the market, the historic property was back in local hands. ""I have been inundated by support from the community,"" Natasha said. ""They're just so happy someone is finally here and taking care of the place."" Managing the three dwellings and surrounding gardens is no light task. While experienced in business and tourism, Natasha has had to quickly learn about English cottage gardens, stone masonry and irrigation systems for the property's reopening as a bed and breakfast this Easter. ""I feel like I'm a bit of an Alice in Wonderland. I'm a bit overwhelmed by it all,"" she said. ""I'm the one that's now custodian of all this."" Unaware of the homestead until her mid-20s, Natasha did not know it was on the market until a walk with her mum in August 2021. ""We actually went to about three or four different locations to try and get away from the wind and we ended up walking past here and the sale sign out the front that had sat there for 10 years,"" Natasha said. ""I went, are you kidding me? This is for sale? I need to see if this is a viable option."" It was. Although it was a while before she could get in and have a look. ""Unfortunately, South Australia had gone into a mini lockdown that week,"" Natasha said. Previously restored and run as a bed and breakfast, the place was in pretty good nick. The main homestead was the last building added to the site and consists of four bedrooms and living and dining rooms. A kitchen has been added in more recent years. ""The cooking facilities were previously in another building so they didn't burn the house down,"" Natasha said. The first thing to be built on the site was a lime-washed stone cottage — Naracoorte's first dwelling — in 1842. ""George Ormerod who built that is most well known in the area for going down to Robe and then setting up his businesses down there,"" Natasha said. ""William Macintosh bought it from him and obviously he's got his stamp all over Naracoorte."" After adding a three-floor building to the site he eventually sold it to Thomas and Elizabeth Magarey who built the main homestead. ""It's such a small space and the three most significant families in this town's history have each put their stamp on one building,"" Natasha said. ""The roads in Naracoorte, Magarey Crescent, William Mackintosh Hotel and Ormerod Street ... they're all the guys that were associated with this property."" While the homestead is considered a lavish residence now, Natasha believes Naracoorte's ""forefathers"" did not have anything like the finery in there today. ""I think they were really quite humble and really quite low key and conservative, agricultural people,"" Natasha says. Natasha has recruited the help of Judy Murdoch, an 88-year-old historian — and her former high school teacher — to collate the property's history. ""She's very happily handing over all of her information to me,"" Natasha said. Prior to Natasha's ownership, history of the property has remained scattered. ""For some reason it just hasn't been something that people had the time to focus on here,"" she said. ""They go through droughts and floods and everything here. And it just hasn't been the thing that was important to people."" Locals have gotten in touch with extra anecdotes and personal connections to the place. She is relying on one neighbour to help her link in with the local Meintangk community to document the site's earliest inhabitants. ""[There are] scarred trees here that have been identified as 450 and 500 years old ... you can see a shield and a canoe have been cut out of them,"" Natasha said. ""I think it's really important for us to understand that there was a lot more that happened there. ""There's a little more history than these guys and their buildings."" The spelling of Narracoorte Homestead is intentional and nods to the Indigenous word meaning large waterhole, or place of running water. ""I think it's possibly because the creek was here and there may have been a lot of low-lying water before we did this drainage work in the area to make it more accessible for farming,"" Natasha said. Natasha feels deeply connected to the land she has begun to call home again. ""I love this environment because it's what I know from my childhood,"" she said. ""There is a real connection to place that comes from seeing certain trees and wildlife. There are so many birds here."" Like Natasha, there's a sense that the homestead has also returned to the township. ""The whole neighbourhood has really made this their backyard,"" Natasha said. ""I think it's really lovely because look at this space, you wouldn't want it there taunting you from across the fence."" As well as maintaining the homestead, she is determined to share the place and its history, and has big visions of period drama plays and events. ""I would love it if it could be incorporated into our [school] curriculum locally somehow,"" she said. She has time to pull it all off. ""I'll be here till I'm a very old lady,"" she said. ""I'm not going anywhere. And why would you want to? ""I just feel like the most fortunate person in the world.""

22,COVID turbocharged rental prices in Australia — but not in the major cities,house-and-home,"  Business owner Jack Evans and his partner are relying on family to get a good deal in the home rental market. The report finds regional rents have risen by 18 per cent since the start of the pandemic People's desire for more space to adapt to isolation and working from home requirements have been identified as a factor Government stimulus packages are identified as another key driver in the soaring prices ""We're renting a property owned by a family member, so we've actually negotiated a price for rent that is probably below what the current inflated market value is,"" he said. Mr Evans lives in Orange in regional NSW where rents rose by 20 per cent in the first 15 months of the pandemic. He said he was stuck in the rental market because he still could not afford to buy a house, something he has been trying to do since moving back to his home town four years ago. ""It's gone up quite substantially and it's still a struggle,"" Mr Evans said. It is a common story across regional Australia, according to a new report released today by the University of NSW (UNSW) and the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS). The study, which examined trends in Australia and eight other countries, found low interest rates, government income support, people's ""pent-up savings"" and their desire for houses instead of units, drove the surge in prices. It showed rental prices in regional areas had risen by 18 per cent in the two years to late 2021, whereas in metropolitan areas rents had only just recovered to pre-pandemic levels. ""People have been willing to pay more for more space, so this is this term 'race for space',"" lead author Hal Pawson said. Professor Pawson said in Orange and other areas, at the same time as people flocked from Sydney under working from home arrangements, ""fewer properties [were] being made available on the market"" and that put significant pressure on rentals. The report showed house prices have increased by 19 per cent in Australia, compared with 22 per cent in New Zealand, 17 per cent in Canada, and 12 per cent in the UK. With his rent set to almost double, George Parkyn and his dog, Baxter, could be homeless in a few weeks. He says there's no way he can afford to lease a property in the open market, and he's far from the only one. Professor Pawson said, while popular economic stimuli during the pandemic helped avert a predicted 30 per cent slump in house prices, they came at a price. ""One of the effects of the monetary stimulus, trying to keep the economy going, is it's had this sort of negative side-effect of pumping up the housing market in a way that has been quite damaging,"" he said. ""By making cash grants available on a bigger scale than usual, I think with hindsight it is something that they probably should be regretting now because that only compounded the spike in house prices that we've seen over the past year or just over a year."" While much of the stimuli introduced during the pandemic had fallen by the wayside, Professor Pawson said the impacts of some made a case for long-term change. The report noted that the lifting of other government interventions to protect tenants, such as moratoriums on evictions and price increases, had exacerbated the rental crisis. ""That shone a light on a possible future that we've decided that 'No, we don't want that, we'll go back to what it was before',"" Professor Pawson said. He said the doubling of job seeker payments for a period of time was ""a very insightful response"" and that it was a ""missed opportunity"" when it reverted to ""one of the lowest rates of social security payments among OECD countries"". ""That's an overdue reform, which I think a lot of economists would agree is something that Australia should be contemplating anyway,"" Professor Pawson said.

23,This essential guide can help you flood-proof your home,house-and-home,"  Flood design tips you should know before building or buying a home The architecture firm behind Queensland's flood-proofing guide says people who have adopted its building and design recommendations are saving money on their insurance premiums and getting back into their homes faster. The Flood Resilient Building Guidance for Queensland Homes authored by Brisbane company James David Architect (JDA) was put to the test during the state's recent flood disaster — and it worked. More than 140 homes upgraded in line with the guidance through Brisbane City Council's (BCC) flood resilience program were better protected during last month's deluge, allowing families to clean up and safely move back in within days. JDA founder James Davidson said strategies like raising power points and sealing floors using skirting tiles not only saved homes, it reduced insurance costs for residents of flood-prone suburbs where premiums were on the rise. ""Some of the clients we've been working with have actually received a premium reduction between 40 and 50 per cent based on flood resilience work,"" he said. ""Insurers are open to reducing premiums if their assets are protected."" Not everyone is eligible for financial assistance to flood-proof their homes, but Mr Davidson said understanding your flood risk and shelling out for a few essential upgrades could make a huge difference. Whether you have started the clean-up or are preparing for flooding, here is how to make an insurance claim. ""The first thing I would suggest is asking a surveyor to give you a spot level of your ground floor — that costs somewhere between $300 and $500,"" he said. ""Once you've got that level, approach council about understanding whether you're affected by overland flow, creek or riverine flooding."" Mr Davidson said knowing what types of flooding your home was vulnerable to would reveal how long it could be exposed to water during a flood and what building materials to avoid. ""Overland flow flooding might be in and out within six to eight hours versus riverine flooding, which can stick around for three to four days,"" he said. ""Creek flooding generally could be one to two days."" Sodden plasterboard and insulation piled up on front yards and footpaths was a familiar sight during Queensland's flood clean-up and became a magnet for mould. Mr Davidson said any cavity or gap between building materials, like the void between exterior cladding and an internal wall, were problematic following a flood. ""If you get water ingress in there then that's primed for mould growth and you can actually have long-term issues if you don't let things dry out enough,"" he said. Queensland's flood resilience guidance recommends constructing walls from core-filled blocks or single-skin polycarbonate to eliminate cavities that can hold moisture and silt. It also demonstrates how homes can be designed with spaces to lift important items higher when flooding starts, and styles of perimeter fencing to help floodwater flow away. Keeping up with home maintenance and re-thinking material choice for items like kitchen cabinets and door frames could also save home owners money in the long run, according to Mr Davidson. ""We've generally used hardwood timber frames, rather than pine, because hardwood is less susceptible to mould and to swelling during an event,"" he said. ""There are a lot of materials on the market now that are affordable for cabinetry, waterproof products that can be rained on.""

24,'My kids were getting heat stroke': Perth residents count the cost of living through record summer temperatures,house-and-home,"  Perth residents count the cost of record summer temperatures — and the price is too high for many Jessika Gill has spent much of the past three months with her two children in the one room of her house that has an air conditioner, just trying to keep cool. Perth experienced a record of 13 days with temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius this summer, six of which were consecutive. The city also experienced a record number of days above 35C. The single mother of two children, aged nine and 18 months, spent $700 to buy a portable air conditioner to try to cool her public housing home amid the rising heat. ""My kids were getting heat stroke and nosebleeds,"" she said. It's been a summer for the history books as Perth swelters through its hottest ever on record, with an average maximum temperature that's smashed the previous record by almost one degree. ""At night I'd get a wet towel and put it over me because my body heat was so bad that I couldn't sleep. ""The younger one gets very hot at night; I get really worried that she's going to overheat. A lot of the time it's three of us all sleeping in one room."" Ms Gill suspects that despite just cooling one room, her next electricity bill will be sky high and take months to pay off, but she felt she had no choice for her family's health. ""It's horrible. You don't want to drag your kids out to a shopping centre just so they can be cool. We just want to be comfortable at home,"" she said. ""There are days when me and my two kids will spend the whole day in my bedroom, just so we're in a cool room."" She would like to see the state government install more effective and efficient air conditioners in public housing. ""I think the government should not assume that low-income people can't afford air conditioning,"" she said. ""It's not like we don't budget our bills, and it's a basic human need — we just had the hottest summer."" While Ms Gill's situation is extreme, other Perth residents are looking at what they can do to manage their comfort and energy costs amid rising average temperatures. Georgina Roy moved into a home in the relatively new northern Perth suburb of Aveley last year, and after going through what ""seemed like the longest and hottest summer that we've had"", she is looking hard at what she can do to prepare for next summer. Her home has solar panels and battery storage, but a $900 electricity bill quickly dispelled any false sense of security around her power use. ""One of the things that I'm looking into at the moment is actually getting more solar panels installed,"" she said. ""We're probably only producing about a quarter of the power that we're using currently. ""I'm also looking at putting in some more doors within the house so that I can just cool the areas that I'm in, rather than cooling the entire house, which is not necessary."" But Ms Roy has also realised there is a limit to what she can do on her own, and that decisions made beyond her home have a big impact. ""We live in a suburban area, there are houses that don't have lots of trees, and a lot of houses around me have artificial turf,"" she said. ""It's just made it much clearer to me the impact that those decisions have on the suburb as a whole, in terms of how much heat it retains."" Petra Tschakert researches climate change adaptation and resilience at the University of Western Australia. She thinks there are simple things people can do on a everyday basis to adapt to rising temperatures. ""Things like cool showers, water bottles for spraying, misters, putting your feet into a bucket of cold water while working at home or before going to bed, putting on wet clothing or wrapping a wet cold sheet around us when we go to bed,"" Professor Tschakert said. ""I think we often forget these and think all we have is air conditioning, and I think that's a mistake."" But she said beyond that, state governments would need to do more to protect people from the impact of climate change, especially vulnerable groups and people who lacked the means to do their own home modifications. She suggested the state government investigate mapping areas of vulnerability across the metropolitan area, and look at options like the tree canopies in different suburbs. Socio-economic demographic data could be used to identify ""low-income groups, areas with high proportion of Indigenous people, locations with government housing"" to help target measures where they were needed most. ""Then emergency services and government organisations should focus on providing strategic neighbourhood cool refuges — swimming pools, libraries, services for the elderly, we do not have this,"" Professor Tschakert said. Professor Tschakert also would like to see state government subsidies to help pay for the cost of fitting houses to be more energy efficient and comfortable. ""It's a government's responsibility that retro-fitting occurs for roof and ceiling insulation, for cooler roofs and window blinds and water storage and emergency power,"" she said. ""Living conditions, for many people, are unbearable,"" she said, adding that she had heard of a man who spent nights in his car because it was the only way he could access air conditioning. ""If these are the solutions people have and they are desperate, then the state has failed the poor in adapting."" For people who can afford to modify their homes, the gains are enormous, allowing them to live not just in more comfort, but without the stress of the cost. When the pandemic derailed a big trip she was planning, Meghala Nair put the money into installing solar panels and battery storage. ""It was a huge monetary commitment of around $12,500, but one that I wish I had taken much earlier,"" she said. ""I've gone from bi-monthly electricity bills of $400 to $1,000-odd to much more reasonable bills — the lowest has been around $14. ""I rescue birds and dogs and live with my retired parents, so we keep the air con running for the animals and Dad and Mum throughout the year. ""Emotionally, it's a huge plus knowing that I've played my part in trying to be self-sufficient and environmentally friendly and I don't feel as guilty putting the air con on."" WA Council of Social Services (WACOSS) would like to see the benefits people like Ms Nair are able to afford, extended to people who rent or live in public housing. WA renters are pushing for landlords to provide minimum standards of comfort in properties, as Perth swelters through another heatwave. In addition to arguing for greater levels of Commonwealth income support and more affordable energy pricing for low-income households from the state government, WACOSS is lobbying for improvement to public housing. ""We've been asking of the Minister for Housing that they improve the ventilation and insulation. They've given a fantastic commitment to build 3,300 new social houses over the next four years,"" WACOSS chief executive Louise Giolitto said. ""There has to be a consideration for climate proofing of these houses, to make them energy efficient."" She said there was a strong relationship between heatwaves and presentations at hospital emergency departments, with children and old people the most at risk. ""[Heat makes it] really difficult to live a full and productive life. It impacts people's ability to sleep, and again that impacts their health and wellbeing. ""When you don't have energy efficient homes with appropriate cooling, it impacts every part of someone's life.""

25,Is your dream home taking longer than expected to build? Here's why,house-and-home,"  Home builders, renovators told to expect more delays, price rises Budding home owners across regional Victoria are facing further delays in the construction of their dream houses due to supply chain disruptions and worker shortages. Builders are waiting about nine months for trusses and up to 16 weeks for laminated veneer lumber (LVL), one of the most widely used engineered wood products, according to Master Builders Victoria (MBV). Stuart Allan, chair of MBV's country sector committee, said these shortages were likely to continue into next year. ""It's widespread, but if we're just talking trusses, they're used right throughout the industry,"" he said. ""We are talking with designers and engineers to try and get LVL beams as an alternative to pitch a roof with, but there is a demand for those beams as well and the supply of those beams comes from overseas. ""So now there is a shortage of those as well as; there is demand from a lot of countries [for the material]."" Graeme Pilcher, the managing director of Pilcher Builders in Bendigo, said costs had been steadily increasing over the past two years. ""I'd say it's probably somewhere between 20 and 25 per cent costs overall that have increased and it may even be more,"" he said. ""And it'll be interesting to see what the rise in the price of fuel will do; it's getting close to $2 a litre now, so that'll impact transport and everything like that as well."" Building costs have risen so much that one construction professional says he goes to work every day knowing he'll ""disappoint at least one person"". Due to the worker and supply shortages facing the industry, Mr Allan, who is a builder in Ballarat, said houses were taking 30 per cent longer to build. ""Everyone is having to wait, and it's not just the building industry. The wait on materials, and certainly the Ukraine situation has made things more uncertain because we import so many materials,"" he said. ""But the supply of labour is certainly an issue; we've had that problem for over 10 years."" This has occurred at a time of increased demand. MBV figures show that during the past three months of 2021, the number of loans to owner-occupiers for home renovations was 77.8 per cent higher than a year earlier, with the pace of growth even stronger for investors. COVID workplace restrictions on close contacts and positive cases also exacerbated the problem, Mr Allan said. ""Whether it is truck drivers delivering materials to site or the tiler can't come in, or your plasterer can't come in today … it's just dragging out the process. ""We're hoping clients can work with their builder and be sympathetic to the situation."" ABC Ballarat will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Wednesday.

27,Should bodies corporate be able to fine people for bad behaviour? And would it save lives?,house-and-home,"  Strata reform talks ask: Should bodies corporate be able to issue fines for bad behaviour? A strata reform roundtable is discussing whether bodies corporate should have the power to issue fines to people breaching by-laws in buildings. If approved, fines could be issued to people misbehaving on balconies, smoking or parking in incorrect areas, having unapproved parties or being too loud. Misbehaviour at major events, including Schoolies on the Gold Coast, has played a role in the talks, as have incidents in recent years that have left several people injured and one person dead. Last week at Surfers Paradise, a man in his 20s fell three floors from the fifth-storey balcony of a backpackers' hostel, leaving him with critical injuries. Months earlier, a 16-year-old fell nine metres from the St Tropez Apartments at Surfers Paradise and was taken to hospital in a critical condition. In 2020, a Brisbane teenager died after falling four storeys from a Surfer's Paradise apartment balcony. The incidents are just several of countless that have occurred on the Gold Coast over the years. Misbehaviour at events such as Schoolies includes people risking their lives by balcony hopping and sitting on high-rise ledges. In response, some Queensland building managers have been barring access to balconies during large events. Strata Community Association (SCA) vice-president Chris Irons said the topic of bodies corporate being able to issue fines had come up before and was raised during talks on future reforms for the sector. ""The SCA Queensland is part of a roundtable with a lot of other stakeholder groups who are in regular discussions with government about how to improve corporate legislation and the issues that come up,"" Mr Irons said. ""It's common knowledge that there's a reform process going on and the issue of body corporates being able to issue fines has come up."" He said conversations about fines for misbehaviour were being held at a ""very conceptual level"". ""It comes up in connection with events like Schoolies … where there's a tendency for a lot of people to be on the balcony,"" he said. Mr Irons said the SCA wanted the government to seriously consider allowing fines for anyone caught breaching by-laws. ""This could be one instance — if you’ve got people staying in an apartment out on the balcony and behaving badly, climbing between floors, the next morning if body corporate handed them an on-the-spot fine of $200 or more, it's quite possible the next night that wouldn't happen again,"" he said. ""But at the moment there's zero ability for that to happen … and the government's been very, very reluctant to think about that. ""I get why, but perhaps this might be one case where it is warranted."" Mr Irons, the state government's former body corporate commissioner, said most building managers did not have the authority to ban people from balconies, but he understood why they were doing so anyway. ""They're going ahead and taking a really extreme step to safeguard things,"" he said. ""There's not a great deal you can do about human behaviour — as an owner or body corporate, you can't tell people what to do and regulate human behaviour. ""Even the most level-headed people staying at holiday locations will see the sign about a balcony and go, 'Yeah sure' — but it [just] takes a couple of glasses of wine and they lose a bit of self-awareness. ""The best people can do is try and protect things and hope people exercise responsibility."" Mr Irons encouraged building owners, managers and bodies corporate to be proactive and ""not wait for something terrible to happen"". ""Whether it's balconies or something else, if a body corporate is proactive, has a regular schedule of maintenance, regular inspection, that is always going to be the safest and most logical way of safeguarding themselves,"" he said.

28,'It looked like blood but it was actually honey': Perth couple confront surprise substance oozing from wall,house-and-home,"  Heatwave leads to historic hive meltdown inside Perth wall cavity When Diana Gomes and her husband moved a couch recently, they were startled by a thick, dark liquid dripping down the wall. ""There was this liquid leaking from the wall from the top of the skirting board and going all the way to the timber floor and it just looked really strange,"" Ms Gomes told Nadia Mitsopoulos on ABC Radio Perth. ""It looked like blood,"" she said. ""We got closer to it and checked it out. We touched it and it was thick and sticky. ""It didn't feel like blood, and then I just thought the closest thing it looked like was honey."" Both Ms Gomes and her husband tasted a very small amount, and their suspicions were confirmed. ""It was sweet, and it was just honey, yeah,"" she said. While the couple had identified the substance, they were perplexed by the cause. ""We've got no bees in the house. I've never seen any bees around it."" The area where the honey was oozing from was a blocked-up fireplace. ""We bought the house four years ago. We know there was a chimney there, but the chimney was already closed when we bought it,"" Ms Gomes said. ""My husband went to the roof to check the top and the chimney was completely sealed, there were no bees around or anything."" The couple eventually decided it must have been an old hive that had been in the space for years. Perth experienced two heatwaves over Christmas and January, when temperatures reached over 40 degrees Celsius for up to six days running, which the couple suspect made the honey melt. Ms Gomes said they cleaned the wall and floor but were still left with the problem of the hive trapped in the cavity. ""I don't want to but I think we're going to have to [knock the wall down],"" she said. ""We contacted the home insurance and they don't cover it."" A few days later Ms Gomes confirmed that the couple had bitten the bullet and knocked into the wall, discovering a whopping 101kg lump of honey and hive in the old fireplace. ""Lucky there were no bees, it was just an old massive hive,"" she said. ""We removed it and cleaned everything ourselves and it was a very hard job, but I am extremely happy and relieved we sorted it out."" Honey can survive for centuries in the right conditions, and has even been found in archaeological excavations of Ancient Egyptian sites, thanks to its composition and chemical properties. It is most likely to be preserved in dry conditions as humidity can lead to fermentation.

29,'It felt pretty hopeless': Young home buyers despair of Northern Rivers' prices,house-and-home,"  Northern Rivers house prices double in five years locking out aspiring home owners In the two years Sam Gaukroger has been house hunting in a once-affordable northern NSW town, she says there have only been two or three properties advertised below half-a-million dollars. It has been a daunting process for the 28-year-old Lismore youth worker who has watched the region's median house prices grow to eye-watering levels since the start of the pandemic. ""If I was looking at a house two years ago I would have been able to get it,"" Ms Gaukroger said. ""Since COVID … the housing market has just gone exponentially up."" The latest figures from Domain show seven out of the top ten regional areas in New South Wales for real estate price growth in the last quarter were in the Northern Rivers. In Lismore, prices have almost doubled in five years, from a median price of $340,000 in December 2016, to $612,500 in December last year. For many of the region's younger demographics – those in their 20s and 30s who perhaps grew up there or work locally – trying to buy a property can feel like running after a train you have just missed. Ms Gaukroger, who has lived in the Northern Rivers town for the past decade, said she wanted the security that came with home ownership without severing ties to her community, support networks and workplace by relocating to a different, and possibly cheaper, part of the country. ""I could go and buy a house [somewhere else] … but that's not where I want to be. ""I want to be here in Lismore and I really love the community of Lismore but they're just driving out the young people when you don't have housing. ""It's tough but it's probably just teaching me patience, to sit back and wait, because how long can is this going to be sustainable that housing is going to over $500,000."" The Central Coast, according to some, is quickly becoming part of Sydney's outer suburbs. But as skyrocketing house prices push Sydneysiders up north, who’s being priced out? Northern Rivers mortgage broker of 18 years Sana Hosseini said there was a lighter side to the property price boom. Mr Hosseini said older generations who had benefited from substantial growth in their property values had been able to help younger family members with deposits and by going guarantors on loans. ""That capital growth enables them to assist their children and the next generation in a lot of situations we're finding,"" Mr Hosseini said. Mr Hosseini said for those who did not have parents or grandparents who were able to assist, there were other options, such as the government's First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, which allows eligible first home buyers to purchase a property with a five per cent deposit and no lenders mortgage insurance. But he said the scheme was not without its faults, including the ""unintended consequence"" of driving up the lower end of property prices and limited allocations, which meant waiting lists of up to six months. ""A lot of people have found that really isn't an option for them to wait those periods,"" Mr Hosseini said. Mr Hosseini said another factor which could be contributing to Millennials feeling like they were locked out of the housing market, was a shift in expectations around first homes. ""If you look at the new homes that people live in – they're not the homes that our parents and previous generations have had,"" he said. Mr Hosseini suggests those seeking to buy their first home should view it as a stepping stone, rather than a forever home. He said while median house prices in the more lucrative coastal suburbs like Lennox Head and Byron Bay were well into the six figures, more affordable homes could still be found further inland in areas like Lismore, Casino and Kyogle.

Goonellabah resident Layla Sizer-Robertson, 26, said she was lucky to have been able to purchase a home with her partner through the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. But she said it was not easy. After five years of saving, the couple was finally ready to purchase a $300,000 property around Lismore, where they had always lived and worked, when the pandemic hit. Ms Sizer-Robertson said they initially missed out on the government's home loan deposit scheme and their mortgage approval was put on hold following changes to lending rules, which excluded her job in retail. She said the probation period on her partner's new job also meant that by the time they could secure a mortgage, the properties they had been looking at had jumped by more than $100,000. ""We continued saving but felt pretty hopeless and had basically given up,"" she said. They applied for the First Home Loan Deposit scheme again and were successful. After viewing more than 20 properties and making offers on five, they were finally able to secure a home in Goonellabah for their maximum borrowing amount of $600,000. ""[We're] happy to have a place, and we feel like we got a good deal for the current real estate climate,"" she said. ""However two years ago, our house would have been worth $200,000 less.""

30,Balcony BBQ ban? Former body corporate chief says smoking ruling could have flow-on effects,house-and-home,"  Former body corporate commissioner says balcony pets, vaping, BBQs could also be deemed hazardous A former Queensland government body corporate commissioner says a recent ban on a unit owner smoking on her balcony could set a precedent for anything that could be deemed a health hazard including pet urine and barbecues to smoking or vaping at office buildings. Last month the Office of the Commissioner for Body Corporate and Community Management ordered a Surfers Paradise unit owner not to smoke tobacco products on her balcony after a complaint from her neighbour. The woman was ordered only to smoke elsewhere within her apartment if she took reasonable steps to ensure the smoke was not  affecting another person in the complex on the basis the smoke was a hazard. A Gold Coast unit owner has been banned from smoking on her balcony, a landmark decision that could impact all apartment dwellers, industry experts say. Now a senior vice president of the Strata Communication Association, Chris Irons said the decision had wide reaching potential and had been impossible to achieve from his former office. ""Up until this point it's been nigh on impossible to get this kind of ruling because you had to prove nuisance,"" he said. ""There was a legal precedent established for nuisance and it was so high it was virtually impossible to achieve, but that's now changed. ""Second-hand smoke was declared a hazard, and now that is the statement by which it is set. ""Not only that, the order goes on to say the phrase 'tobacco products', so we're looking at that also including vaping."" Mr Irons said the use of the term ""hazard"" could be argued for many other issues in shared areas, including use of barbecues or even having pets on balconies. ""I do think there's potential for it to widen,"" he said. ""A hazard effectively is something with the potential to cause harm, so as long as someone can prove it has the potential to cause harm and show that quite conclusively — they could win. ""Barbecue smoke, could someone argue that's a hazard? Well if someone had a document from the health department showing it was, maybe. ""Incense? Or another good example would be dog urine, faeces on a balcony. That quite possible could cause harm. ""So I don't think it's automatic, but the potential is definitely there."" Mr Irons said the ruling could impact any strata-owned buildings and spaces. ""It can be duplexes, high rises, you have commercial buildings for office spaces, some hotels, unit lots, commercial developments, shared sheds,"" he said. ""It now opens up an avenue for disputes in a whole range of buildings across Queensland where it was not happening before."" According to Mr Irons, while the ruling could set a new precedent, he said for it to be effective it would need to be enforced. ""This doesn't necessarily solve the problem. The mere fact that the order has been made doesn't stop the person smoking,"" he said. ""That order has to be enforced through the courts and that is a long, arduous, costly process. ""Each situation is also considered on its merits. Each owner, each building is different. ""It would still be up to the individual to follow through and make their case, take it all the way. It wouldn't be a blanket outcome. ""So the potential for the drain on public services when it comes to dispute resolution and the justice system can be pretty high at this outcome, I would have thought."" He said he was not surprised the topic had raised debate in the community overnight, but was not sure whether it was due to the ban on smoking or issues regarding the owner's rights. ""Which part [of the ruling] is bothering people, I'm not sure,"" he said. ""But I can certainly appreciate that people don't like being told what to do in their own home. It will impact tenants too."" We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

31,Unit dwellers could be barred from smoking on balconies after landmark decision,house-and-home,"  Queensland unit dwellers could be barred from smoking on balconies after landmark decision Queenslanders living in apartments could be prevented from smoking on their balconies after a ""game changing"" decision to ban one unit owner from doing so after a complaint from an upstairs neighbour. A unit owner at the Artique Resort in Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast complained that their downstairs neighbour, on the eighth floor, was a ""chain smoker"". The ninth-floor owner claimed the eighth-floor neighbour spends about five minutes smoking and could do so about every 20 to 40 minutes, labelling the smoke ""relentless and unbearable"", causing her to be concerned about her health. In response, the eighth-floor owner disputed she was a chain smoker, saying a packet could last her a week. She said she could not help where the wind blows, and also gets cigarette smoke, marijuana smoke, BBQ smoke, and strong perfume and cooking smells entering her own apartment. She also said she has a disability and ""going downstairs to smoke is out of the question"". The Office of the Commissioner for Body Corporate and Community Management's adjudicator ordered that the eighth-floor owner must no longer smoke tobacco products on the balcony. Furthermore, it was ruled she can only smoke elsewhere within her apartment if she takes reasonable steps to ensure the smoke does not affect any person in another apartment. The adjudicator made the decision in December last year on the basis that the smoking was causing a hazard to the other owner. Kristi Kinast, president of the Strata Community Association of Queensland, the peak voice for body corporates, said the decision by the adjudicator was a ""game changer"". Ms Kinast said she believed it ""absolutely"" set a precedent for other apartment dwellers. Good ventilation is more than just about preventing mould — it's becoming a way to deal with COVID-19. ""Up until now … the onus has been on complainants to prove that the volume and frequency of smoke is a nuisance, and that is almost impossible to prove,"" she told ABC Radio Brisbane. ""This changes things to say that any sort of smoke is a hazard, or any sort of volume and frequency is a hazard, so it will absolutely open the floodgates, we very much expect. ""I think if we look at this in a greater context, in terms of our society, we've seen these changes over the last decade or more where we've seen continued evolving of the restrictions on smokers — can't smoke in airports, restaurants, workplaces — but it hasn't reached, until now, into strata."" Ms Kinast said apartment dwellers could seek information on the process from the Office of the Commissioner for Body Corporate and Community Management, and people could seek mediation or adjudication on the issue. ""The other thing I'd suggest … is to push the government for some change,"" Ms Kinast said. ""Here we've seen an adjudicator make a decision that now impacts all of us, some will say positively, but the government has been sitting on this for years — almost a decade. ""We need the government to give some clarity and some clear direction to our bodies corporate and to the commissioner's office on how this can be treated moving forward."" Former commissioner of Queensland's Body Corporate and Community Management, Chris Irons, said the decision meant effectively anybody who can show cigarette smoke drifting from one balcony to theirs could show it is a hazard. ""This I would think potentially also applies to vaping as well,"" he said. Mr Irons said smoking has been a really ""tense, difficult issue"" in strata for years, with little that could be done about it. ""So this case has effectively thrown the gauntlet down for the government to do something about it,"" he said.

32,'Graciously imposing' old coaching inn on the market for the first time since 1829,house-and-home,"  Oatlands property Kenmore Arms for sale for the first time since 1829 The township of Oatlands in southern Tasmania is well known for its immaculately preserved, colonial era sandstone buildings. Now, history buffs and restoration project seekers alike have the chance to purchase one of the town's significant Georgian properties — Kenmore Arms. The property, situated on the Midland Highway, which joins Hobart and Launceston, includes a house, a shearing shed and a number of outhouses. It was built by Daniel O'Conner, a discharged soldier who received 100 acres of land on the stretch of road known as St.Peter’s Pass as a military claim. He started building the home in the late 1820s and it was used as an inn from 1832. After Mr O'Conner's death, Kenmore Arms was absorbed into the adjoining estate of his business partner, Askin Morrison. The property has been with the Morrison family ever since. Mr Morrison owned a number of other properties across Tasmania and his notoriety as a land owner saw him elevated to political office in Tasmania's Legislative Council. The listing describes the two storey, 503.7sqm residence as ""graciously imposing"". Real estate agent and heritage property expert Dominic Romeo said he expected between $1.3 and $1.4 million for the property. ""I think the price reflects its position. If that was, for example away from the highway, I would say you could comfortably add half a million dollars to it."" He said he expected the house would likely need about half a million dollars worth of work. ""There’s probably $100,000 cost involved in repairing the walls and cracks and the structural work,"" he said. ""The rest of it is cosmetic … probably another $300,000 to $350,000."" The home is a textbook example of a coaching inn, which traditionally housed travellers commuting by horse and cart between Hobart and Launceston. Manager of Heritage Projects at the Southern Midlands Council Brad Williams said they were necessary back when the trip would have taken 3 to 5 days. ""I guess a coaching inn with its stables is like a hotel and a car park these days,"" he said. He said Oatlands and surrounding towns are still home to a number of colonial buildings due to a slower rate of development to mainland cities. ""Tasmania in general has got an amazing array of these buildings that have survive and that's part of the charm I guess,"" he said. ""The whole package of this heritage place, the building itself, the setting, the outbuildings the walled garden the large trees, it's very iconic. It's in remarkably good condition."" The property is listed on both the Tasmanian Heritage Register and the council's heritage list. Mr Williams said the council would work with the new owners to make sure they restored the property with the relevant rules in mind. Farmers Kate Morrison and her husband, Askin Morrison, a descendant of the Askin Morrison four generations before them, are selling the property because the sheering shed attached to it no longer meets their requirements. They have subdivided the land so they can hold onto some of it for their farming operation and are selling off the portion that contains the house, a number of outhouses, and the shearing shed. Ms Morrison said it was both exciting and sad the house would be leaving their hands. ""It's the long association with the one place that makes it special and the fact that it's such a recognisable place on the Midland Highway."" ""Each of the generations have their own memories,"" she said. ""For my father in law who's passed away now, his memory of the sheering shed is this really strict hierarchy for the staff seating at meal times."" ""The wool classer and the property owner sat at the heads of the table and down the sides would be the various staff as they were deemed in the hierarchy."" My husband's memory is just the vast quantity of food that the shearers would prepare for each meal, the swathes of food that came out. For her boys, it's the birthday parties they'd have in the cook house. What she really loves about the buildings for sale is the ""layers of history"" in the walls. ""People who have been associated with the buildings have put their initials, or stencilled their initials, in the beams of the shearing shed,"" she said. Ms Morrison said it was the family's preference for the house to remain a residential property. ""The house is a beautiful house and it would make a beautiful home so I would love it if it did turn into someone's home,"" Ms Morrison said Mr Romeo said there was interest coming in from all over Australia and ""quite a lot"" just within the state. He received around 100 calls in the first 24 hours of its listing and said the fact the property wasn't on a huge amount of land presented a rare opportunity. ""This makes it more affordable for someone who’s really more interested in the building and restoring something special on small acres, and that doesn’t happen often in the Tasmanian market,"" he said.

34,'I hardly use light switches anymore': Meet the Australians automating their homes,house-and-home," Science The future of smart homes: how we might be living in 10 years' time When his children have been watching TV for too long, an automated system notifies Chris and gives him the option of turning off the screen remotely or sending his kids a message. ""I'll send a message to say 'what you are you doing? You've been sitting around for too long,'"" Chris, who lives in Queensland with his family of four, says. When data gathered from local weather stations indicate that rain will strike the eastern side of the house in exactly five minutes, the system tells him what windows on that side are open. If he's not home and an intruder visits, a hidden smart speaker erupts with an aggressive barking noise. ""That's some of the cool stuff,"" Chris says. Technology that automates or remotely controls various household functions, from lighting to security, appears to be going mainstream, helped by a pandemic that has seen us spending more time at home, and more money on comforts like air fryers and smart speakers. But do these gizmos make life any better? Are ""smart homes"" the way of the future, or just the latest marketing gimmick? Chris's house is an extreme example, but locks, lights and doorbells that can be controlled through a phone and programmed to perform tasks automatically are becoming commonplace. According to some, these are the leading edge of a dramatic change in our homes' relationship with technology. This year's influential Consumer Electronics Show (CES) tech expo in Las Vegas saw a rush to capitalise on the trend: big brands launched a range of connected devices, from taps controlled by voice commands to video-streaming dog doors that open at a pet's approach. Other products included: The market research company Telsyte predicts the average Australian household will add more than 10 connected devices by 2025. If current demand is any guide, most of these new devices will be smart power outlets, speakers and light bulbs, as well as video doorbells, remote-activated locks, and surveillance cameras. But this is just the start, according to the smart home industry, which is pushing a new concept: ""contextual awareness"". This is where the home environment adapts to the desires and routines of its inhabitants: alarm clocks read the owner's schedule and set themselves accordingly, health sensors detect signs of illness and automatically order medicine, software dims lights and plays music according to a person's habits — or even their apparent mood. Some Australians, like Chris, are already experimenting with this idea. On the Facebook group ""Home Automation Australia"" (HAA), he and 9,000 other members share knowledge and trade jargon-heavy questions referencing obscure products and protocols. Surveillance cameras are getting cheaper, smaller and more accessible — and increasingly easy to hide. Created in 2017, HAA tripled its members over six months last year, according to one of the group's admins, Brent Wesley. Many members work in IT and most are men aged 25-54. ""Most people seem to be joining for much the same reasons: they are saving energy, improving securing, and adding convenience,"" Brent says. Pool pumps can automatically turn on during the middle of the day, when a rooftop solar array is producing excess energy. Security cameras can be trained to distinguish between a nosy dog and an intruder. Light switches can be activated by voice command. Blinds can rise with the Sun. TVs can spring to life when a person flops on a couch. ""A lot of people are driven towards it by curiosity,"" Brent says. ""When they realise what's possible, it becomes an all-consuming thing."" Another member of the group, Matthew, shared an 11-page list of his home's automations, including a ""goodnight routine"" that notifies ""if teeth aren't brushed"" and a video of a sunrise that increases in brightness on the bedroom television 30 minutes before the morning alarm. ""I have probably one of the most automated homes worldwide,"" says Matthew, who is a moderator of the r/homeautomation subreddit (with 1.4 million members). ""I could do more, like having the shower ready to go before I get up, or having my coffee maker turned on."" A fourth member, Elias, hooked up his lights to respond to voice commands issued to smart speakers peppered about the house. ""I say, 'Hey Google, turn on master bedroom lights', and it picks it up whether you're in the toilet or the corridor,"" he says. ""I hardly use light switches anymore."" If a house that's aware of your presence and can turn out the lights sounds either hellish or pointless, you're not alone. In 2020, Monash University researchers conducted interviews with households in Victoria and NSW to gauge their thoughts on these ""industry visions"" for how most people will live. Some were initially excited by the high-tech possibilities, but most ultimately decided this ""shiny future"" didn't fit with their life, according to Kari Dahlgren, a research fellow and one of the authors of a report on the findings. ""The research was trying to understand what flashy technologies people will accept into the home,"" she says. ""We found there's an initial attachment to these [industry visions] and then they saw this future didn't necessarily match with that life ... no-one wants robotic lawn mowers."" People preferred to retain manual control, even when it cost time or money. Many households disliked the idea of giving energy retailers the ability to remotely switch off customers' heating or cooling when power prices approached a daily peak, in order to reduce household energy costs. Early adopters have a different relationship with technology than ""everyday people"", which may explain why industry visions of a high-tech future are sometimes unpopular, Dr Dahlgren says. Dreams of the labour-saving ""smart home"" go back to the 1957 ""Monsanto House of the Future"" made entirely of plastic and featuring an ""ultrasonic dishwasher"" and a sink with adjustable height. ""People's everyday lives and priorities aren't being taken into account in the design and marketing of those technologies,"" Dr Dahlgren says. ""The rhetoric for a long time has been the smart home is just around the corner. Why hasn't it come? It's been around the corner for 50 years."" Today's automated homes may not be a sign of what's to come, but a short-lived folly, like a sink with adjustable height. Even some ""early adopters"" on the Facebook HAA group are sceptical of the claim our homes will be packed with connected devices. ""There are so many gimmicky products,"" Michael from Melbourne says. ""I've got a smart fridge and the only time I log into the app is when there's been a power outage and I'm not at home. ""I have a smart washing machine and it's only got one great feature, which is sending a push notification when the washing is done. The rest is useless."" Then there's the security issues. David, a HAA member who's automated his Brisbane home, says he worries about strangers having access to the data generated by his family. ""If the data leaks, does it give people the ability to predict when I won't be home?"" The video doorbell maker Ring, acquired by Amazon in 2018, has partnerships with at least 1,800 US police departments that can request camera footage from Ring doorbells. Its millions of doorbells amount to a private surveillance network that's subject to very little oversight. There are also questions around privacy within the family when members can use devices to effectively spy on one another. ""It's super creepy being able to watch things in the house when you're not there,"" David says. ""Is it right for me to see my family turn the air-conditioning on and ring them up and say, 'Why are you doing that?'"" Some say there's nothing wrong with this. Chris from Queensland argues that a bit of electronic surveillance of the family, such as remotely monitoring the amount of time his children watch TV, is convenient for working parents who can't always be there in person. ""It is and it isn't intrusive,"" Chris says. ""There is that oversensitive 'Big Brother watching' issue. Access to the system is limited to me and my wife. ""But convenience outweighs the surveillance side."" And is it worth the money? Chris estimates he's spent tens of thousands of dollars on his ""hodgepodge"" of automations. ""It's nice to have rather than something offering real value. If I didn't have it I could live without it, absolutely,"" he says. ""But we haven't really entered the realm of proper home automation yet."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

35,Some Australians are discarding standard building codes and going above and beyond to future proof their homes,house-and-home,"  Should you build your home stronger to withstand the possible impacts of climate change? As the footprint of climate change becomes clearer, the ability of homes to withstand the accelerating impacts of climate change and extreme weather is turning into a significant challenge. Some Australians are taking it upon themselves to go beyond the building code and standards to protect their home from uncommon, but not impossible, extreme weather events. Working as an engineer for the Tropical Cyclone Testing Station, Geoff Boughton has seen hundreds of homes wrecked and ravaged, with families left without anywhere to live. He most recently witnessed it in Kalbarri and Northampton, an area where houses were not built to withstand the continuous cyclonic wind gusts caused by Seroja. ""They have to start again, and I really don't want that to happen for myself or my family,” he said. When building his own home in Perth, well outside of the cyclone-rated region of WA, this was something he considered. Cyclones are uncommon near Perth, but they're not unheard of. ""When you think of a 1 in 500 year event, if a house lasts for 50 years that makes it a 1 in 10 chance it happening within the lifetime of my house,"" he said. “The other thing is, with climate change, we really don’t know what the climate is going to be in 50 years time."" From the outside, his house looks like a typical Perth home, but its structure is far stronger. It's able to withstand a weak cyclone blowing constant gusts of up to 160kph and is waterproofed for extreme thunderstorm events. And it didn't cost much. He said this was achieved through several features, including strengthening a series of structural elements on his roof to prevent it from lifting even if a window was broken. The windows are a slightly higher specification to keep water out better, and his roof edge is sealed to prevent water from coming in. All up, he said the additional features cost him about $4000 from a new build for his timber home. Meanwhile, 100 kilometres south in Waroona, nestled amongst an old forest so thick you can barely see the house, lives Kingsley Dixon. His house is considered to be in a bushfire-prone area. But having lived through bushfires, including the devastating Waroona-Yarloop blaze, he and his husband have gone well beyond basic code in their build. They have invested tens of thousand of dollars adding a reliable, long-term water supply, superficial sprinklers across the roofing system and fire-resilient landscaping around the house. ""I think we need to move beyond minimum compliance, and ensure what we produce imagines the worst-case fire,"" he said. ""What if we get the 1 in 1000 year fire, which we haven't experienced?"" Like Mr Boughton, climate change and the heightened risk of bushfires in his region has reinforced his decision. Both Mr Dixon and Mr Boughton are part of a growing cohort of people building what is know as 'resilience' into their homes. A resilient house is one that is able to be lived in with relatively little work after a big event. Building standards are constantly under review to include the changing climate, with their primary focus to protect public health, safety and general welfare. But University of WA Environmental Engineer Anas Ghadouani said they are often ""slow"" to incorporate changes, and don't always protect your home from extreme weather events. He said the codes juggle a fine balance of risk to impact. ""The regulator can only look at the minimum standard that will resolve in the minimum damage to a neighbourhood with that building code,"" he said. He said the current risk analysis provided by building codes often meant a house would not withstand 'freak storms', which are getting more likely with climate change. ""So the building codes are protecting you from a 1 in 100 year event,"" he said. ""But the problem is some of those events are occurring more frequently than they're statistically supposed to be."" Building extra strength into your home is being encouraged by government and industry. Following Tropical Cyclone Seroja, the WA Department of Fire and Emergency Services offered grants of up to $20,000 to build additional protection into their homes. Melissa Pexton, State Recovery Controller from TC Seroja, said it was about minimising future destruction. ""With an increase in those more devastating events, we really want to try build in resilience at every opportunity,"" she said. Earlier this year, the James Cook University, Suncorp Insurance, CSIRO and architecture firm Room 11 collaborated to build what they called the ""one house to save many"", a home resilient to fire, flood, storm and cyclone. The directors of Room 11 architects said the final design showed, with thoughtful planning, it could be achieved at a comparable cost to a standard architecturally designed home. ""Things like running the wire in the ceiling and down the walls, and keeping the power-points a meter off the floor costs exactly the same, but your wiring stays dry,"" associate director Kate Phillips said. The costs of building resilience into your home can vary significantly, as demonstrated by the costs of Mr Boughton's features compared with Mr Dixon's. But it's most affordable when building from scratch. Mr Ghadouni said it ultimately came down to personal choice and the need to weigh up the risk with the cost to build. ""Probably not enough people are acting on it in my view, but people are actually not sure what to do,"" he said. He said there was enough climate science on a regional level for the home-owner to be able to make a decision on their risks.

37,Why has my home been overrun by pantry moths and how do I get rid of them? An expert explains,house-and-home,"  Why has my home been overrun by pantry moths and how do I get rid of them? An expert explains Has your home recently been overrun by tiny grey moths, flapping erratically around your kitchen? Spotted some suspicious webs in a cereal box? You might be sharing your dried food with pantry moths (Plodia interpunctella). Although several species of moth can live and breed in our homes, the pantry moth (also known as the ""Indian meal moth"") is one of the most common unwanted moth-guests. Pantry moths are found on every continent except Antarctica. They feed on rice, grains, flour, pasta, cereals, dried fruits, spices, seeds, nuts and other dried food. Their fondness for dried foods makes them a major pest in food storage facilities. So how did they get in your house — and what can you do to get rid of them? Like other moths, pantry moths have four distinct life stages: egg, caterpillar, pupae and adult. The first sign of a pantry moth infestation is often the sight of adult moths flying in an erratic, zig-zag path around our kitchens. Next time you spot a maggot, reconsider the urge to say ""yuck"" — these little, legless creatures are here to help us if only we let them. Pantry moth adults have grey-coloured wings with bronze or tan bands near the wing tips. Although they can be annoying, adult moths do not feed at all. The trouble arises when female moths lay their eggs in or around our food. The tiny eggs hatch into barely visible cream-coloured caterpillars small enough to crawl into poorly sealed food containers. There, they begin to feed. As they grow, caterpillars produce large amounts of silk webbing and faeces, both of which can contaminate food. Once a caterpillar reaches its full size, it leaves the food in search of a safe space to make a cocoon, usually a crack, container lid, crevice or corner. Sometimes they turn up in the hinges of a pantry door. A few weeks later, an adult moth emerges from the cocoon, ready to start the cycle again. Unfortunately, it's likely you brought them home yourself. Although pantry moths can enter via doors and windows, most infestations probably start when we inadvertently bring home eggs and caterpillars in our dried foods. Kitchens full of unsealed containers and spilled food create an irresistible smorgasbord for female moths looking for the ideal place to lay eggs. Like many insects, pantry moths develop more quickly at warmer temperatures. At warmer temperatures, females also lay more eggs and caterpillars are more likely to survive to adulthood. But prolonged exposure to temperatures above 40℃ are lethal to eggs and caterpillars. While pantry moths can be found at any time of the year, the warm temperatures of late spring and early summer are often perfect for supporting rapid population growth. First, eliminate their sources of food. Dry goods should be stored in sealed, airtight containers with tight-fitting lids. To prevent eggs and caterpillars from hitchhiking in on purchases, place dried foods in the freezer for three to four days; this should kill any eggs and caterpillars that may be present. If you already have an infestation, carefully inspect all potential food sources including spices, cereals, grains, dry pet foods, pasta, seeds, nuts, tea, dried flowers and dried fruit. Pantry moth caterpillars are hard to see; look for the silken webbing they produce, which can cause food grains to clump together. These webbed clumps are often more conspicuous than the caterpillars themselves. Infested foods should either be discarded or placed in the freezer for three to four days to kill eggs and caterpillars. Clean up and discard any spilled foods on shelves, under toasters or behind storage containers. Even small amounts of food can support thriving caterpillar populations. Caterpillars can travel considerable distances to find a safe place to make a cocoon, so make sure to check shelves, walls, crevices and ceilings. Moth cocoons can be removed by wiping with a damp cloth or with a vacuum cleaner. Cleaning and proper food storage are the best ways to end a pantry moth outbreak. Sticky pantry moth traps are commercially available and can be used to monitor and reduce the moth population. Pantry moth traps — triangular cardboard covered with a thick sticky glue — are baited with a chemical that mimics the smell of a female pantry moth. Males are attracted to the trap and become hopelessly stuck to the glue. Since sticky traps only target males, traps are unlikely to stop an outbreak on their own; always use them with proper food storage and careful cleaning. Insecticide sprays are unlikely to be effective as pantry moth caterpillars and eggs are protected within food containers. Pantry moths are also resistant to a range of insecticides, rendering them ineffective. Insecticides should never be applied on or near food. While it can be disconcerting to find tiny caterpillars in the cereal you've been enjoying all week, accidentally eating pantry moth caterpillars is unlikely to cause any health problems. Given how common they are in stored food, you've probably already unknowingly consumed many moth eggs and larvae. Thank goodness caterpillars are generally an excellent source of protein!

38,'We've never seen anything like this': house prices high and selling quickly in Mount Gambier despite report of decline,house-and-home,"  Houses still selling like hotcakes in Mount Gambier, despite report showing price decline Figures from a national report show house prices in Mount Gambier have fallen, but a local agent says the market is ""incredibly buoyant"". The September quarter figures from the Real Estate Institute of Australia show there has been a 1.4 per cent drop in the median house price in Mount Gambier to $285,000. It represents a 3.4 per cent drop compared to the same time last year. But principal agent at Key 2 Sale Gail Richards said that did not match up to what was happening on the ground. ""I think that our market has been incredibly buoyant,"" she said. ""The past three months especially have been seen some really good jumps in sale prices."" Ms Richards said the data could be skewed by a large number of cheaper properties selling over the winter months. ""Perhaps those bigger lifestyle properties don't come on the market until spring, and that can be reflected in your data on the median price."" Ms Richards said investor interest from interstate buyers had been ""phenomenal"". ""Just last night, I did an open home with 15 groups through,"" she said. ""I've already got 12 offers on that – and nine of them are interstate investors. ""They're quite comfortable buying sight unseen and having an independent building inspection done on their behalf."" Ms Richards said the demand was pushing prices up. ""[For] the investors, as long as the rent return figures stack up, they're quite comfortable to buy sight unseen. ""The cheaper end, I would say, some of those properties have gone up in excess of 20–25 per cent just because there's so much demand."" Ms Richards said COVID-19 had led to ""a very changed market"" locally. ""In real estate, we always dreamt of a buoyant market in Mount Gambier,"" she said. ""Nearly 20 years I've been in real estate and we've never seen anything like this."" Ms Richard said she believes the trend will continue at least while interest rates stay low. ""We were always a very affordable place to live. ""I know locals are probably saying, 'oh, properties are expensive'. ""But to people coming from a way — out of Melbourne and New South Wales — our property market is still incredibly cheap and good value for money. ""Our markets have never been this hot.""

39,"The $35 hardware in your home that could cost you $14,000",house-and-home,"  Flexi pipes are a cheap plumbing hardware for your home but could cost you thousands As the weather turns sticky and warm and beaches beckon for summer holidays, it's the season to check your taps or risk tens of thousands of dollars' worth of water damage. Since January 2018, insurance company RACQ has received 9651 claims for water damage to homes, with burst pipes and hoses connected to dishwashers and taps a common cause of those claims. Spokeswoman Kirsty Clinton said the average cost of flexi hose related claims rings in at $14,145. ""We often see a rise in these incidents over the festive season when people go away for holidays,"" she said. Master Plumbers Association of Queensland technical services manager Ernie Kretschmer told ABC Radio Brisbane the hoses were in most modern homes and could ""burst at any time if they are damaged."" It's pretty much impossible to check everything about a property during a half-hour inspection. Here's what to keep an eye out for at your next open home visit. He said incorrect installation and corrosive chemicals stored under the sink could shorten the lifespan of the hoses – which are a rubber tube wrapped in braided steel. ""If you liken it to a hernia, once that outer wall is compromised, the inner tube can herniate out and burst,"" he said. ""Then you've got the full bore of the pipe delivering water under your kitchen sink or in the basement or behind your toilet and that will continue to run until you isolate it,"" he said. The reason for rise in claims over the festive season is that no-one is home to turn off the water mains when those pipes burst — so switch off your water mains when you go away. Ms Clinton said flexi hoses started to deteriorate after ten years and home owners should check whether they have one installed in their homes and if they were nearing expiry. ""The damage caused can be extreme, with water flooding your house in a matter of seconds, leading to ruined cabinets, walls, floors, and mould which, in some extreme cases, can make your home uninhabitable,"" she said. ""The other important factor on top of the costs to consider is the distress and inconvenience that incidents of this nature can cause individuals and families, where treasured possessions can be ruined, and homes can even be uninhabitable for periods of time."" Mr Kretschmer said home owners or renters could ""poke [their] head under the sink and have a look"" for damage on the hose – like kinks, stains, rust marks, or fraying. ""If you do have any concerns or if you do pick up some damage or some kinks or something like that, you would have to call a plumber."" Some flexi hoses can retail at major hardware stores for as little as $35 but Ms Clinton said cheap DIY flexi hoses, which were not rated for the pressure or heat, were a growing concern for the RACQ. Mr Kretschmer warned home owners against doing any plumbing themselves. ""Where you might have issues with your insurance is if we're looking at a DIY situation where the home owner has gone to a hardware and done some plumbing themselves,"" he said. ""Now, that's illegal."" We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

40,Sunshine Coast's deepening housing crisis forces fourth generation local family interstate,house-and-home,"  Homeless Sunshine Coast family finds housing, work and opportunities in Melbourne As Queensland has been inundated with southerners moving to the sunshine state throughout the pandemic, a former Sunshine Coast family that was left homeless for six months has bucked the trend and moved to Melbourne. ""I'm just glad to have a roof over my kids' heads now,"" Liberty Page said. The 31-year-old was born on the Sunshine Coast where four generations of her family have also called home. But when the rental property she was living in was sold in November 2020, Ms Page, her partner Aden Kingston, and their girls aged one and three were left homeless. They applied for hundreds of rental properties, and despite secure income and references they were forced to live in hotels and couch surf with friends. Ms Page said it was a very confusing time for the children and stressful for the couple. ""I had to leave my job that I only got just before we had to move because starting a new job was not compatible with not having somewhere to live,"" she said. ""It was scary and emotional not knowing what we were doing and where we were going."" When they were unable to secure a permanent home after six months of desperate searching, the family hit breaking point in March. ""After a tearful night where our blow-up mattress got a hole in it for the second time and I broke down, we made the decision to look at moving to Melbourne,"" Ms Page said in a social media post at the time. She lodged five rental applications for Melbourne properties that night, was approved for multiple properties within 48 hours and moved from Queensland to Victoria two weeks later. ""It just got to a point where I kept hearing about all these people moving up from Melbourne and I thought, 'Well, Melbourne must be pretty empty',"" she said. They now rent a two-bedroom unit on Flinders Lane in the Melbourne CBD for $300 per week, about $200 per week less than the properties they were applying for on the Sunshine Coast. While moving to the world's most locked-down city ""was not easy"", Ms Page said it had been a ""blessing"". In contrast to what she described as a ""lack of employment"" in Queensland, they now have secure work in the telecommunications and construction industries. ""I've been offered three jobs in the past three weeks,"" she said. ""The lockdown did bring other work opportunities … so it has been a bit of a blessing because so many people did leave the city."" She said her mother and aunt have also moved to Melbourne because ""there is so much opportunity"", including ""no competition"" when finding a place to rent. ""There was nobody else at inspections, certainly not round-the-block lines,"" she said in reference to the often dozens of prospective applicants at Sunshine Coast rentals. There's been a significant decline in affordability across some Queensland regions according to the latest annual report based on the Rental Affordability Index. There has been an influx of interstate arrivals in Queensland for more than a year. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that in the six months to March 2021, Queensland gained a total of 16,798 people when taking into account those who left the state. In the same six-month period, Victoria had a net loss of 11,400 people. That increase has seen prices in both the buying and rental markets soar in south-east Queensland, making living in highly sought-after locations like the Sunshine Coast unaffordable for an increasing number of people. Joel Davis from the property management firm Image Property has previously told the ABC that the rental demand was unlike anything he had seen in his career. While earlier this year, John Harrison from the St Vincent de Paul Society Queensland broke down when he encouraged some residents to leave the area. ""We've said to people, where we recognise that there's such a gap between the income they have and the rental market, 'we can't see a solution for you',"" Mr Harrison said. That was advice Ms Page and her partner knew all too well, and like many families the prospect of leaving their hometown and established support networks was so daunting they initially ruled it out. ""How can we just leave that with two small children and no idea on where to go or what to do when we get there?"" she said on social media. But after six months without a home and feeling ""judged, abandoned, and ignored"" after raising concerns with local organisations, the Housing Minister and the Premier's office, the family saw moving interstate as their only option. ""We've always wanted to move to the city and just always thought it was never really going to be possible because it was so expensive and so difficult to do,"" Ms Page said. ""It's definitely worth considering for people because the alternative. I'd imagine, we'd still be in people's lounge rooms and in motels if we had stuck around there.""

42,"analysis: Australia's economy has been muddling along for years, but 'the pandemic might have changed things'",house-and-home,"  Roaring Twenties or a decade-long economic slump? RBA says it's up to us The Reserve Bank is looking at its economic forecasts and is all too aware economic conditions could go either way: boom times or bust. Of course, a third option is that the economy hums along. But this option achieves little by way of economic or wage growth. It's also a throw-back to how the economy looked before the pandemic. ""Investment was low, productivity growth was lagging and many of the behaviours we associate with business dynamism were on the decline,"" Reserve Bank assistant governor Luci Ellis said in a speech to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia. The Reserve Bank is now looking for something to fire up the economic engines. RBA governor Philip Lowe began beating the ""animal spirits"" drum many years ago. That is, he wanted businesses to throw caution to the wind and invest and hire. That, he said, would fire up the engines of growth. Whether or not there were any animal spirits, who knows, but it didn't work. Luci Ellis is now stepping up with the megaphone. She wants ""dynamism"" Ms Ellis defines it as, ""the drive to innovate, adapt and evolve — [which] helps underpin a society's living standards."" She believes if there was ever a time for the economy to ""evolve"", it's now. She wants ""adaptation, innovation and dynamism, and [to look at] how the experience of the pandemic might have changed things."" The key challenge facing the economy in the wake of the height of the mining boom was that other parts of the economy seemed to be sleepwalking, she said. ""Even after the mining investment boom ended, non-mining business investment showed little sign of coming back."" That also shows up in new business entries and exits: Excluding the surge in independent contactors driving for Uber and the like, Australians new firm creation is lower than it was a couple of decades ago, but fewer are also shutting shop. The same risk aversion applies to employees. It may surprise you, but workers have been changing jobs less often since the global financial crisis of 2008. In fact, despite the reputation of the millennial generation as restless job shifters, the reality as measured by the ABS is that job mobility has been on a downward trend since the late 1980s and is currently around record lows. It lead, she argued, to a sluggish and uninspired economy with ""less investment, less job and firm turnover and less productivity growth."" ""They also might connect to some of the other patterns in the economy in the lead-up to the pandemic — low inflation, slow growth in wages and a sense that very low interest rates were needed to stimulate demand, in order to attain decent rates of economic growth."" She wants to see hungry and talented entrepreneurs researching, experimenting with new business ideas and discovering and innovating. ""Business entry is an important part of dynamism because new firms are often innovators. Start-ups are seen as the firms with new ideas, new products and new investment."" Ms Ellis sees risk for businesses who embark down this path, but the reward or pay-off, she believes, is also there. ""Demand is bouncing back strongly, supported by policy. ""Shifts in demand between goods and services have opened up some industry-specific business opportunities, including for new firms. ""Meanwhile, financial sectors globally are in good shape. Business sectors are also in much better financial shape than they were after the GFC. Having created the biggest real estate bubble in history, our very own Reserve Bank now has its hands tied, writes business editor Ian Verrender. ""Profits have recovered quickly, and fiscal support has meant that some firms are considerably more cashed up than before,"" Ms Ellis noted. The theme of the speech was that opportunities for businesses are now presenting themselves — whether they be in research or innovation, or investment and business is supported now more than ever by loose economic policy. She concluded her speech by reminding businesses, big and small that, ""in the dynamic realm of business, innovation and investment … it is more a case of nothing ventured, nothing gained."" That's true. It's also worth considering that Luci Ellis told a parliamentary committee earlier this week those who don't own a home in retirement face poverty. She also conceded children of parents who rent will find it harder to enter the property market. So there are clearly many younger Australians who do not have anything by way of wealth now and may not gather any by retirement. Her call for business bosses to adapt and embrace dynamism has merit, but consumers make up well over half of all economic growth — and, combined with low wage growth — they're trying to survive … let alone thrive.

43,Story about millionaire dog 'selling' Miami mansion part of long-running stunt,house-and-home,"  Story about millionaire dog 'selling' Miami mansion part of long-running stunt For more than 20 years, a line of German shepherds named Gunther have been presented in news stories as the wealthy beneficiaries of a German countess. The story appears to be a ruse created by Maurizio Mian, the scion of an Italian pharmaceutical company, who has used the tale of the globe-trotting canine to promote real estate sales and other projects. International wires agency the Associated Press (AP), reported that a trust acting on behalf of a dog, Gunther VI, was selling a Miami mansion that it had purchased from Madonna for $US7.5 million in 2000 for $US31.75 million. Alongside other news outlets in Australia and overseas, the ABC, which carries AP stories for some international coverage, published the story. The AP story cited claims from Gunther's ""handler"" that the dog was from a long line of dogs bequeathed the fortune of a German countess. While the mansion is in fact owned and being sold by the Gunther Corporation, according to Miami-Dade County property records, the dog's role appears to be little more than a joke that's carried on for decades. And there is no evidence of a German countess. The AP reported on the story after receiving a press release from publicists representing the real estate agents who had the listing. ""The AP published a story that did not meet our standards and should not have been published,"" AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said in a statement. ""We did not do our due diligence in the reporting process. We have corrected the story, and we apologise."" Mr Mian told an Italian newspaper in 1995 that the countess ""was just an invention to publicise the philosophy"" of his foundation. At other points he has claimed his confessions about the countess are the real hoax, and the dog stories are, in fact real. Mr Mian's own money appears to have come from his family's Italian pharmaceutical business. Istituto Gentili, which developed a treatment for the bone-weakening disease osteoporosis with the US pharmaceutical giant Merck, was purchased by Merck in 1997. An Italian phone number listed for Mr Mian was not being answered. Responding to questions from the AP about the veracity of the story, Monica Tirado, director of the Gunther Group, said Carla Riccitelli, who described herself to the AP as Gunther's handler, was Mr Mian's ""ex-partner"". Ms Tirado said the company could not answer further questions, including about the story of the German countess, because ""there is an exclusive contract with a Netflix production"". A request for comment with Netflix to get details about any production was not returned. This is just the latest in a string of tales about Gunther told by Mr Mian. In 1999, The Miami Herald reported that Gunther IV was trying to purchase a mansion from actor Sylvester Stallone. The next day, the Herald reported that it was just a publicity stunt. ""If you want to write it's a joke, you can write that,"" Mr Mian told the Herald. ""I won't do anything."" In Mr Mian's tale of the dogs, the Gunthers are supposedly supported by a multi-million-dollar trust set up by German countess Karlotta Liebenstein when she died in 1992, to care for her dog, Gunther III, and his progeny. The AP has found no evidence that Liebenstein existed. Editor's note (24/11/21): This is an updated version of the original AP story, which AP now admits was the result of a publicity stunt.

44,Want to build a new home? It could cost you 20 per cent more,house-and-home,"  Materials and tradies shortage in central Queensland leaves building industry at tipping point Rockhampton builder Sonny-Jim Fulton doesn't mince his words on the state of the house construction industry. ""Oh, it's chaos, chaos,"" he said. ""I've been in the industry for 15 years and I have never seen anything like it."" The ongoing severe shortage of building materials, combined with the demand for skilled tradespeople, has sent new home build costs soaring up 20 per cent in Queensland over the past 12 months, according to a September survey by Master Builders. It's a problem that won't be fixed by reopening the state and national borders either. Master Builders deputy chief executive Paul Bidwell predicts the new year could be a tipping point. ""The implications are dire. So far, we've not heard of any builders going to the wall as a result, but based on conversations we're having with builders, it will happen, [and] most likely early in the new year,"" he said. ""While opening the borders may ease some of the pressure on trades, it won't solve our material shortages woes. ""Unfortunately, there's no silver bullet."" Mr Fulton is finishing off three new homes in the Rockhampton region that he began in 2020 and he has not signed a new house building contract since October of that year. He said all his goals had gone out the window. ""We don't even make a plan until I get out of bed at 5am in the morning,"" he said. ""It's multiple projects going all at once. But we can't get them finished because the material shortages, ordering stuff and making stuff and staff shortages is just killing us. ""I'll be honest with clients. I tell them, yes, I'll build you a house that's going to cost you on a certain level… [but] by the time you get to the end, you might be $70,000 out of pocket. ""It's too deep for everyone."" Mr Fulton was forced to find other work when his projects stalled as building materials ran short. ""We went roofing because we couldn't get materials like timber, but then iron ran out,"" he said. ""Then we jumped back to framing when the timber turned up. Then we juggle around with the material delays with that and then, when we finished the framing, we go back roofing. ""We just go backwards and forwards, piggyback off each other because we know with the delays, you have just got to stretch yourself out."" Central Queensland Master Builders manager Michelle Traill said builders were enduring a ""profitless boom"" because of the insatiable demand for new homes nationwide. She said on top of demand for timber, bricks and roofing supplies, prices for structural bearers and joists were up by more than 60 per cent this year. Furthermore, Ms Traill said the lack of qualified tradespeople was also widespread, not just for carpenters and roofers. ""Concreters and bricklayers are also in short supply,"" she said. ""As we move into residences that are going through the build process, it's the finishing trades — tilers, the painters."" Ms Traill said the flow-on effect for builders' cash flow was significant. 'Most builders aren't taking on any more work at this particular point in time, which is obviously going to lead to further issues, particularly with the rental market as it is,"" she said. ""There's lots and lots of variables in the mix in this critical situation. ""We are making sure that we can do whatever we can to support builders, so there aren't unfortunate closures of businesses."" Mr Bidwell hasn't ruled out the possibility of businesses folding in the coming months. He said the supply and cost issues were forecast to run well into 2022. ""Builders big and small continue to struggle with the fallout from the 'perfect storm' – the boom in demand off the back of HomeBuilder and the Regional Home Building boost grant, combined with low interest rates and record interstate migration,"" Mr Bidwell said. ""There are a lot of very frustrated builders and clients out there – mostly in the housing sector, but the commercial sector is not immune.""

45,Still cool in summer: How passive solar ideas inspired a 1950s builder ahead of his time,house-and-home,"  How passive solar ideas inspired a 1950s builder ahead of his time From the outside, the suburban home in Perth's northern suburb of Yokine doesn't look much different from others on the street, but it was built in 1955 using passive solar design principles. Scott Overstone's father Rod, a ""voracious"" non-fiction reader, came up with a plan to build an ""environmental house"" in the early 1950s, after reading about one. ""He applied to the CSIRO for plans to build a house in Western Australia and they sent him back a small booklet with design plans and philosophies to build a house that doesn't need air conditioning and would work on the sun and airflow,"" Mr Overstone said. ""And he was a bit of a tight arse so both of his philosophies sort of melded into one."" The plans included ventilation to make the most of the ""Fremantle doctor"", the cooling breeze that sweeps in from ocean every summer afternoon in Perth, and directions on insulating the ceiling and creating a solar hot water system. But with the plans in place, Rod hit a problem. No bank would lend him the money he needed to build such an unconventional house. Undeterred, with the gift of a brickmaker and a loan from his father-in-law, the professional firefighter decided to build the house himself, with the help of wife Joy, friends and family. ""I think he was a frustrated builder his whole life, but he was a pretty handy dude, like most people who were born in 1927,"" Mr  Overstone said. ""He used to go and watch bricklayers at work, so he could work out how to set the house up. ""And a bricklayer around the corner asked him why he kept on watching him and he said, 'I'm building my own house'. ""So that guy came and set the very first course of bricks up for him and then away he went."" The bricks are unbaked and made from a combination of sand, cement and intense pressure and left to dry in the sun – 57,000 of them went into making the house and granny flat, and more were produced later when Rod built the shed. ""I have seen a photo of me as a young, four- or five-year-old little girl standing around all the bricks in the sun,"" Scott's older sister Christine Richardson said. ""That's very clear memory to me."" The bricks, rather than being laid with mortar between each layer, simply ""fitted together like lego"" and after being stacked together, cement was poured into the holes in the bricks at the top, welding the structure together. And while Rod could at least make the bricks himself, finding reflective material to use in the roof insulation proved a harder challenge — reflective insulation material was something he had read about, but couldn't find. ""He started collecting tea chests which used to be lined with silver paper, to use the paper in the roof,"" Mr Overstone said. Eventually however, a friend who worked for a boat building firm managed to track down the material he wanted. The house also has twice the usual number of windows, so many that the joiner who made them didn't believe the quantity was just for one house, and made Rod pay up front. They are concentrated on the east side of the house, with extra windows added to internal walls to allow for airflow throughout the house. ""So the west side doesn't get too much heat and the heat goes out through the east side windows and doors — everything opens,"" Mr Overstone said. The plan worked and the house has never needed air-conditioning. ""It probably doesn't work as well in winter as the modern environmental house so it's probably a coldish house, but in summer it's not a hot house,"" he said. ""I think the modern philosophies work better for winter, that's for sure. But this definitely works in summer no problem at all."" With five kids in the house in the early years, plus people staying in the home's granny flat, Rod Overstone also used his construction skills to build no fewer than seven solar hot water systems on the northern side of the house. ""The plans for the hot water system came with the house plans,"" Mr Overstone said. ""He had a mate who was a plumber and so they just followed the plans and made it. ""They looked pretty much like they look now — just a metal box with pipes in it and glass on top."" Hot water was plentiful in summer, although ""winters were tricky"" he recalled, and the golf course across the road had to redesign a fairway after constant claims golf balls for damage to the solar units. Other additions included a windmill and a back shed built using the same brick-making machine. Rod Overstone died three years ago and remained interested in issues of sustainability and energy efficiency all his life, Christine Richardson said. ""Dad was very proud of what he'd done,"" she remembered. ""Climate and sustainable issues, Dad was driven by them, when we all bought houses, he wanted them to be north-west facing and have solar systems and solar hot water. ""It was a frustration to him, knowing what he knew about solar energy that it wasn't almost law [to build like this] in lots of parts of the country."" Christine now lives in the house again with her family and mother Joy. ""The house really is part of who Dad was and we are still very proud of it,"" Ms Richardson said.

46,Hot demand for backyard pools and spas has some waiting a year for installation,house-and-home,"  For decades, Australians have had a love affair with the backyard swimming pool but the coronavirus pandemic took the relationship to new heights. COVID-19 eliminated the pool and spa industry's largest competitor — travel. The Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia (SPASA) said there had been between a 30 to 50 per cent increase in demand for pools and spas across the country. ""The demand has never been higher,"" SPASA CEO Lindsay McGrath said. ""The aspiration to improve homes and have a better quality of life, while being at home with loved ones, has been a major windfall from the COVID-19 pandemic."" When travel restrictions were introduced due to the pandemic, the industry saw a downturn in pool servicing, construction, and retail. Then the boom hit businesses across the country in 2021. Townsville pool shop office manager Tania Thomson has been busy ever since. ""People aren't travelling. They're spending more time at home,"" she said. ""They're putting money into their backyards and into their pools because that's their holiday destination now."" Townsville fibreglass pool specialist Terry Dwyer was thankful to have stock to meet demand. ""We had 15 pools when this boom hit. It's been a blessing to have that,"" he said. ""During February, we'll have another 15 to 17 pools arrive."" The only limitation to the sector's growth is delays caused by trades and supply shortages. ""It would be even higher if we could supply enough product, have enough applications approved, or tradespeople available,"" Mr McGrath said. SPASA said it was common for people to wait up to a year for a pool or spa installation across the country. Master Builders North Queensland regional manager Emma Peters said some businesses believed waiting times were even longer. ""I was talking to a pool builder just earlier this week and I asked if I wanted to install the pool, how long would I need to wait,"" Ms Peters said. ""You might be lucky to get one by Christmas next year — that is how busy some businesses are."" As concrete and steel prices rise, some businesses are choosing to limit their forward bookings. ""We are fully booked for pre-Christmas construction now,"" Ms Thomson said. ""We don't look at booking things six to 12 months in advance because we just don't know what the prices are going to be."" There is also uncertainty about ordering fibreglass pools with businesses waiting up to 12 weeks for stock to arrive. To help meet the demand, the industry is in search of skilled and unskilled labour across the board. ""We're desperate for people who are manufacturing fibreglass pools, for concrete sprayers, steel fixers, from surveying and excavation, all the way through to hydraulics and people servicing the pools,"" Mr McGrath said. Despite limitations to what businesses can deliver, the industry is encouraging consumers to continue planning and seeking quotes for backyard pools. ""We ask consumers to be patient just as they would with any other large purchase and really consider it,"" Mr McGrath said. ""We are building them and delivering them as fast as we can.""

47,Hobart cracks million-dollar median house price barrier,house-and-home,"  Hobart becomes Tasmania's first million-dollar median house price city The median house price of Hobart's innermost suburbs has surpassed $1 million for the first time, data from the Real Estate Institute of Tasmania shows. The REIT's September quarterly data released today shows 195 properties sold for over $1 million during the three-month period between the start of July and end of September this year. To date, 490 properties have sold for over $1 million compared to 163 the year prior —  a 200.6 per cent increase year-on-year. Launceston-based real estate agent and REIT president Michael Walsh said the seven-figure price tag was on its way to becoming the new normal in Tasmania. ""We Tasmanians [are] getting used to the idea that our real estate market has caught up to the rest of Australia,"" he said. ""I think we're still value for money, but we're just getting used to the fact that a million dollars here and a million dollars there is not an unheard of price now."" Five suburbs in inner Hobart now have a median house price of $1 million or greater. Sandy Bay has the highest median house price in the state, sitting at $1.5 million — an increase of nearly 45 per cent since September last year. South Hobart is the second most-expensive suburb, with a median price of $1,227,500, followed by West Hobart, Taroona and Mount Stuart. Hobart city is the sixth most-expensive suburb, with a median house price just under a million dollars at $995,000. 'Inner Hobart', which encompasses the CBD, Taroona, Dynnyrne, Mount Stuart and Lenah Valley is the most expensive suburb area in the state, with the region now averaging a house price of $1,026,500. Comparatively, 'Middle Hobart', which includes Bellerive, Bridgewater and Lauderdale, now has a median house price of $630,000. The median house price in the region referred to as 'Outer Hobart', which includes Kingston, Margate and Rokeby, is marginally cheaper at $619,500. A rising median house price, including five suburbs now reaching the million-dollar figure, has contributed to greater Hobart's median house price increasing by 5.2 per cent to sit at $710,000 — its highest-ever recorded level. In Launceston, the city's median house price has increased by 15 per cent in the September quarter, and now sits at $530,000. Mr Walsh said this increase was largely driven by Launceston being the ""investment capital of Tasmania"", with 29 per cent of property sales being purchased by investors. ""The market starts moving with the capital city … and Hobart has had a pretty good run for the last four or five years,"" he said. ""Then for some reason it tends to move towards Launceston and hence we're in this situation now where we're sailing on quite nicely. ""Maybe it's our turn to be a place of difference, maybe we're seen as having better bang for buck because the Hobart market has had the well documented rises. ""The market seems to be swaying towards the north now and in my experience, that's always been the case."" The state's north west is also experiencing a similar trend, Mr Walsh said, with the region's median house price increasing by 4.1 per cent in the last three months to sit at $397,500 — which has also been driven by investors. Looking to buy a home? Here's what $1 million will get you in each state and territory — both in our cities and regions. The north west, which includes Burnie and Devonport, have seen investor sales increase by 27 per cent in the past three months, making it the second-most invested-in region in the state. But despite investor numbers increasing by 36.5 per cent on last year's data, investment sales only comprise 19 per cent of the state's total property sales — and many investment purchasers are Tasmanian. The REIT data shows that in the September quarter, 1940 properties were sold but only 22 per cent of those — or 431 sales — were purchased by mainland buyers. Comparatively, close to 70 per cent of sales were made by Tasmanian residents. But with the state's borders to reopen to all mainland states from December 15, Mr Walsh expects that will have an impact on the state's already booming property prices. ""It's probably logical to think that there will be more buyers moving more freely within our marketplace,"" he said. ""It's been problematic viewing property over here ... and the capital areas have had a lot of restrictions on how, in fact, you can sell a house at different times. ""So I think that freedom of movement is most likely going to have some impact on on our market, which may in turn impact prices.""

48,"Cashed-up foreign buyers still seek Australian property, but are they really to blame for price rises?",house-and-home,"  Cashed-up foreign buyers still seek Australian property, but are they really to blame for price rises? While COVID border closures hamper Australian property sales to international buyers, many Australians still struggle to break into the market because of rising house prices. Is this proof that overseas buyers are not to blame for the inflated dwelling costs in Australia? It might come as a surprise to some, but the Foreign Investment Review Board's latest survey shows that overseas buyers' purchasing activity has hit record lows, with residential real estate approvals for foreigners falling from 40,141 in 2015-16 to 7,056 this year. And CoreLogic's research director Tim Lawless says foreign buyers have comprised a consistently smaller portion of residential housing demand in Australia over the past five or six years. ""This group is now virtually immaterial as a contributor to demand for Australian housing,"" he says. However, for some domestic buyers seeking a home in Australia is still not smooth sailing, with agents blatantly preferring foreign money. Cam My Tran-Smith and her husband recently bought their first home in the Greater Sydney suburb of Peakhurst, but they missed out on so many properties that they ""lost count."" The couple inspected three to five properties every Saturday for a year before they made their purchase. ""We felt exhausted and wanted to give up at times because prices were bizarre."" The latest statistics from CoreLogic show dwelling values in Australia have risen 20.3 per cent over the past 12 months — the highest annual appreciation since June 1989. Despite the relief of having ended their house hunt, the Tran-Smiths said some house inspections were bad experiences. ""A real estate agent gave us a cold shoulder at a property viewing in Hurstville but treated foreign families with a completely different attitude,"" Mrs Tran-Smith said. House prices climbed twice as fast as rent during the pandemic, and the dream of owning a home is now beyond reach for many long-term renters. ""The agent was very enthusiastic and said to them: 'Welcome to your new home.' ""We felt like the agent didn't think we could compete with rich foreign buyers."" Ngoc D, who migrated from Vietnam 15 years ago, said that at first real estate agents were highly enthusiastic during house inspections. ""Some real estate agents thought we were Chinese and were chasing us like hounds at first,"" Mr Ngoc D said. ""The enthusiasm gradually cooled down though once they found out we are from here. ""This kind of preferential treatment makes you think only foreign buyers can now afford Australian properties."" Real estate agent Jeremy Tran says he treats all clients equally, regardless of their origins. However, Mr Tran, who specialises in selling Australian real estate to South-East Asian buyers, claims there are many advantages in dealing with overseas clients. ""The majority of my foreign clients are high-end and high-profile people, including leading business owners and sometimes serving government officials,"" he said. ""Their finances are firm and solid and they are willing to buy and make quick decisions. ""Many overseas buyers deal in cash and cash buyers usually attract agents due to prompt exchanges and ease of settlements."" Mr Tran, who has more than 10 years experience in dealing with international buyers, says owning Australian property gives his clientele a sense of ""certainty and security"". The fine print of the inquiry into housing affordability shows it's focus is housing ""supply"" — but supply isn't a particularly urgent problem. ""We call Australia the Swiss Bank of the Asia-Pacific region,"" he said. ""Because of its stable economy and legal system, Australia is such a safe haven for preserving wealth and comprehensive protection for property owners from all over the world. ""Our policies are favourable for overseas buyers who want to invest in Australian properties, while the purchasing procedures are simple and easy."" The salesman highlights that Australia's geographical location is another reason why his clients are drawn to the nation's property market. ""We are the closest developed country to Asia, where the majority of wealthy investors are — mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam,"" he said. Mr Tran says his overseas clients' interest in Australian property has remained strong during the pandemic, but many are still waiting for border re-openings to close deals. He said he had to pivot his target demographic towards first-home buyers over the past two years. ""Sales to first-home buyers have made up for the loss of international clients during COVID,"" he said. ""Many first-home buyers are migrants who recently acquired their PR [permanent residency], and they are highly motivated by their new access to the government's support packages and benefits for first-home buyers."" CoreLogic's Mr Lawless says it is owner-occupiers driving housing demand. ""Record low mortgage rates have been a key factor in boosting housing demand, but also a higher rate of household saving has contributed to an ability to save a deposit,"" Mr Lawless said. ""A range of government stimulus and specific housing incentives have also fuelled demand.""

49,Central Goldfields hits paydirt amid business and property rush,house-and-home,"  Mid-pandemic tree-changers are helping to drive boom times in Central Goldfields The Central Goldfields community is experiencing momentous growth as new businesses open their doors across the shire. Council says it has approved 24 planning permits in July and August and continues to see a consistent number of applications. Peter Duffy opened Pedro's Ink in Maryborough on October 1. He returned to his childhood region after completing a tattooist apprenticeship and 15 years of work in Melbourne. He said prioritising his family's happiness was key to the decision to move to Maryborough, but the unexpected business opportunities have led to the opening of his shop. ""I opened up on the 1st and we're booked 'til after Christmas and that's not including any Melbourne clients,"" he said. ""I was a little bit concerned about the local work but it's a matter of you tattoo one person, five of their friends see it, 'who did that?' and then they're booking in. ""It's like a snowball. It's been a wild ride. I'm going to be that busy, I don't know what I'll do when Melbourne opens up."" Maryborough real estate agent Coby Perry says the region's property market has been in demand since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. ""There's been a strong push from the metropolitan region to make that tree change,"" he said. ""Maryborough's housing affordability allows people to do that, move up this way and have a little bit left over."" Mr Perry said about 50 per cent of potential buyers are from the Melbourne region, leading to diverse businesses taking up leases and purchasing commercial properties to cater for the changing Central Goldfields demographic. ""As Maryborough progresses, we're certainly seeing a demand for a vast range of businesses through the population and opportunities for new businesses to come to the area and open up,"" he said. ""This is across the Central Goldfields Shire, not just Maryborough. Places like Talbot, Dunolly, are certainly reaping the benefits as well."" Mr Perry says enquiries in the regional market have increased over the past few weeks leading him to believe the hot property market trend will continue as Victorian lockdown restrictions ease. Central Goldfields Shire has approved four development permits for Homes Victoria in the past 12 months. Once constructed, it will see 10 additional dwellings in Maryborough. Mayor Chris Meddows-Taylor says it is wonderful to see the growth despite across the region with planning applications put forward for Simson, Alma, Adelaide Lead, Carisbrook and more towns. ""We expect this population growth to increase over the coming years as individuals and families realise the economic benefits of living and running a business in a regional and rural community,"" he said.

50,"'Colossal': This holiday suburb tops national property sales list, almost double Melbourne's",house-and-home,"  A popular Gold Coast holiday and party destination has sold double the number of properties than any other location in the country over the last year, according to recent real estate data. The property report showed Surfers Paradise has had the most sales nationally, well above higher populated locations in Victoria and New South Wales. It recorded 2,325 sales settlements in 12 months — more than double what it would generally sell annually — according to local agents. Ray White chief executive Andrew Bell said it was the only location outside of Victoria to make the top sales list. ""For the first time ever, Surfers Paradise has taken out the title for the highest ranked suburb for sales volume,"" he said. ""The next location was the City of Melbourne which had just 1,210, so that margin really shows how popular Queensland is. ""Surfers really had a colossal number of sales in one year, it shows Surfers Paradise is standing out as a favourite destination"". According to Mr Bell, COVID sparked a large number of holiday rental owners to sell their properties, due to being unable to secure guests and unable to visit themselves. He said the shift saw a large increase in the availability of units in the already popular location on the Gold Coast. ""Apartment availability does a play a part in that, no question, but I think [people selling] has stimulated sales into the marketplace with people being unable to get up here,"" he said. ""It's created more stock. ""I also think the figures reflect the changing nature of Surfers Paradise: It's moving away from being just a suburb of holiday makers and nightlife, we're seeing a significant increase in permanent residents."" Mr Bell said the majority of those who have moved into the units were downsizing from homes and wanted a sea change. ""People want to be near the ocean, so that is apartment living unless you're going into a very expensive home, and Surfers Paradise has more apartments than any other suburb in Australia,"" he said. ""And it's all kinds of people, high-end people buying $10 million-plus homes, or people coming in and renting. But overall there's just strong interest in being in a central location like Surfers Paradise and to live in apartments. ""I'm not overly surprised as we see it on the ground with the number of apartments we sell, but to see it as the number one in the country — that was a surprise."" Besides Surfers Paradise, Southport was also a high-performing Queensland location, according to the Domain data, having sold just under 1,000 units for an average of $385,000. The Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast remain the best performers for sales for the last quarter, according to state-based data, making up nine out of ten of the highest settling suburbs. Caboolture, north of Brisbane, made up the final spot. Similar to the national report, the Gold Coast's Surfers Paradise and Southport were the top two locations with the highest rate of property transfers, followed by the Sunshine Coast's Maroochydore and Buderim. Hope Island, Caboolture, Coomera, Pimpama, Robina and Helensvale made up the remainder of the state's top sales settlements list. Pexa's head of research Michael Gill said the figures often indicate locations of high growth and density. ""Queensland was the standout performer for the September quarter in terms of sales settlement,"" Mr Gill said. ""It the only state to record quarter on quarter growth across the country, and recorded nearly 60,000 sales settlements in that three month period. ""It was ahead of New South Wales and Victoria, the more populated southern states — so quite rare to see Queensland there. ""There's a lot of a strong interest in that Gold Coast region, which is driven by a number of things; obviously there's a lot of demand within Queensland for those suburbs, but we are also seeing interstate buyers. ""I think given the pandemic, the way it's unfolded, Queensland being one of the states that's most successfully navigated the pandemic, a lot of buyers from Victoria are now looking at Queensland"".

51,"Van fans on hitting the road, living cheaply and scoring the best views",house-and-home,"  Van life movement gains popularity as people want to live cheaply with the best views Former Olympic swimmer Brooke Hanson admits she had some hesitation when a friend loaned her a van for a family holiday in regional Queensland. But after five weeks of strawberry picking, exploring K'gari (Fraser Island), bushwalking and swimming at remote beaches, she says she's been converted to the ""van life"". ""We just had a blast. It was so special to connect as a family and explore Queensland,"" the gold and silver medalist from the 2004 Athens Olympics said. ""It's tiny home living ... you've got your favourite outfits and you live simply."" The Gold Coast family of five took their bicycles and left their iPads and electronic devices at home. ""We packed the van up and said 'we're going to make some memories, we're disconnecting to reconnect together,'"" Hanson said. ""We played cards and Uno (card game) and eye spy and listened to all of our '80s music."" There are different levels to the so-called ""van life"" movement, and many people have made the lifestyle change during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fitness instructor Michaela Jensen, 29, and her partner Jarrett Wilbraham, 28, have been living in their van on the Gold Coast beachfront for 12 months. ""We love the nomadic lifestyle and it was the easiest option for us to be living in this area,"" Ms Jensen, who moved from Mildura in Victoria, said. ""It is testing at times having limited things, but at the same time it forces you to live that minimal life that I really enjoy."" Mr Wilbraham used his trade as a carpenter to fit out the couple's van. ""We're living on the beach,"" he said. ""We've got a better view than the people spending millions of dollars living across the road."" Mr Wilbraham said moving from Nowra, on the New South Wales south coast, to the Gold Coast had reduced their living expenses. ""I'm not forking out a lot of money for rent ... we couldn't really afford it,"" he said. ""It costs us about $100 each week in fuel and we don't go much over $100 in food. ""Then there's bits and pieces in between ... so probably $250 per week."" Campervan and Motorhome Club of Australia (CMCA) chief executive Richard Barwick said the group had more than 70,000 members. He said there had been huge growth in the number of people wanting to buy mobile homes and vans. ""It is supply and demand and there are excessive wait periods of 15 months prior to anyone purchasing a new vehicle,"" Mr Barwick said. ""That's led to an explosion in the second-hand market where people are wanting to get out there and involve themselves in the lifestyle and they're prepared to pay good money."" The demand prompted 29-year-old Gold Coast carpenter Dan McCann to stop building houses six months ago and move into full-time work customising vans. ""I had a couple of mates who hit me up to do their van because they knew that I was a chippie,"" he said. ""Then I started doing a few more and then I put an ad out and started doing a few more and then it's built from there."" The Palm Beach man, who has four vans booked in for customising, has employed an auto electrician to help his growing business. He said a van fit-out could cost between $5,000 and $15,000. ""You can get your really basic set-ups of just having a little bed and maybe a little pull-out kitchen,"" the owner of Lifestyle Builds said. ""Our recent fit-outs have had full insulation, full electrical set-up with a kitchen, fridge, ceilings and  walls ... the absolute works."" Mr McCann said his customers were either people looking to use their vans for travel or a permanent home. ""We've had a couple of elderly people, but there's also quite a few young people ... no one's had dreadlocks so far."" The carpenter, who also owns his own van, said he recommended people insulate and install an air vent. ""Especially in the summer in Australia, it gets so hot and stuffy. ""Without them, it's just so uncomfortable, but those two things just make a massive difference."" Mr Barwick said he didn't think the domestic travel bubble would burst when international borders reopened. ""At the moment the lifestyle of RVing is a sexy lifestyle, you want to get out there and enjoy yourself,"" he said. ""There will be a certain percentage [of vans] on the market straight away ... I think people are going to be able to pick up a good bargain. ""You are taking a large percentage of the population that are going overseas each year and for the last 18 months, they've been unable to do it. ""Those people will go back to overseas travel when they feel safe, but there will be a percentage that won't."" Brooke Hanson says she's now searching online to buy a van for her next family holiday. ""We've got the kids so it needs triple bunks, but we realise that we haven't explored enough,"" she said. ""We are definitely exploring more of Queensland, that's for sure.""

54,analysis: I just sold my home in Sydney's hot property market — this is what I learned,house-and-home,"  The pandemic is pushing Australia's hot property market to a whole new level — and the regulator is watching closely You could argue the Australian property market has never been ""hotter"". That is, property price growth is at or near record highs, repaying a mortgage has never been cheaper and buying a first home has never been harder (in terms of the size of the deposit required). But what is it actually like selling property right now? We just sold our two-bedroom apartment in Sydney and I was genuinely shocked by the market's appetite for a new listing. The speed at which it sold — in just 10 days — points to a once-in-a-generation property market phenomenon. An already existing property boom has been raised to a whole new level with the aid of the pandemic — and the supply shortfall that came with it. It's in a time like this you can learn a thing or two about how the housing market, and its participants, operate — because otherwise subtle or niche developments become more obvious. The pandemic has revealed the strength of the demand for both apartment and detached houses, especially when supply is constrained. We prepared ourselves to move all the clutter from our place to and from the garage at least four or five times so prospective buyers could move through the open home inspections without tripping over a toy or two. As it happened, we did that just twice: Our property was on the market for 10 days in total. The statistics were extraordinary. Within the first 48 hours of the property being advertised there were 80 inquiries. The first Saturday open home saw 21 people move through the apartment (one at a time), and seven of those asked for contracts. Within the first week our online property listing had clocked up 1,000 page views. There was a second open home on Wednesday. An offer was made on Thursday and a bidding process began over the phone and on email. It was finalised on Friday evening with an exchange of contracts. The Treasurer gives a strong indication that new limits on large home loans will soon be introduced. Due diligence was done; all parties had lawyers in tow, and strata and building reports were requested and downloaded. However, apart from all parties concerned abiding by Real Estate Institute and Department of Fair Trading guidelines, there were no rules. The bottom line was a property was for sale in an area where supply was low — very low — and both investors and owner occupiers were waiting to snap it up. The demand in the market was so strong that the idea of a Saturday street auction — once the norm in Sydney — was never really entertained. Indeed, an auction date was never set. Our experience, it turns out, was a microcosm of the greater Sydney market. According to CoreLogic there were 841 auctions held in Sydney last week, compared to 786 over the previous week and 812 over the same week last year, overtaking the previous week as the busiest auction week for Sydney since late June. There's evidence some agents are also acting as auctioneers, stretching the limits of the market. Janice Andrews recently sold her mother's Dingley Village unit in Melbourne. She chose Kevin Chokshi as her agent because he pitched the benefits of being both an auctioneer and agent simultaneously. What's the advantage of this? Well, it gives the agent plenty more work to do but the idea behind it is that it prevents an in-person or online auction from slowing down. Auctioneers thrive off a pacey auction. This is one way to achieve that. Janice Andrews says her agent told her that he could be ""quite responsive"" if the auction ""wasn't going well"". In other words, with the vendor's permission, the auctioneer makes on-the-spot decisions depending on how the auction is unfolding. It's evidence that when a market reaches a heightened state, participants find ways to squeeze every last drop out of sales prices, which can lead to unorthodox and potential risky sales tactics. It's also clear the property market is feeding on itself and being driven by emotion. Di Jones real estate agent Linda Ratcliff has been selling homes in Sydney for 26 years and says properties are on the market for the shortest period she has ever seen. What's striking to her, though, is that it's showing no signs of slowing. ""It's been consistently like this for about 2.5 years, it's just getting stronger now,"" Ratcliff says. ""It's been the longest consistent market that I've worked in — and it comes down to the supply."" Importantly, she says, vendors have high expectations on price, and it's pushing prices up. If a vendor hasn't already bought a property, they're compelled, in Ms Ratcliff's experience, to spend all of the proceeds of their sale on a new home, further inflating property prices. ""They think, 'I'll spend what I've got to spend to get back in again',"" she says. ""It's emotional for everyone at the moment."" Like any other market, it's impossible to accurately predict how prices for apartments and detached dwellings will track over coming months. What we do know is that record low interest rates, fewer listings (due to pandemic restrictions), relatively low rates of unemployment among property owners, a willingness from the banks to lend, and fear of missing out (FOMO) are also supporting and, in many cases, consistently pushing property prices higher. If we've learned anything from the past week, the Australian housing market is on a one-way trajectory into outer space and no one is in any mood to alter its course, writes Ian Verrender. What I and other vendors have learned from our recent sales experience is that the sales process itself is fuelling the rapid rise in prices. The market, on occasion, represents something of a frenzy. It's also what is now concerning policymakers. The regulator APRA confirmed to the ABC it's now looking ""particularly closely"" at price-to-income ratios (currently six times, according to Treasury). This is an ever-so-small policy shift, but it's a rare shift all the same. The Council of Financial Regulators, meanwhile, is stalking what's become a highly strung property market. It's just inched a little closer to its prey.

55,New Zealand seeks to cool scorching housing market with new law,house-and-home,"  New Zealand seeks to cool scorching housing market with new law reducing deductions New Zealand moved to cool its red-hot housing market on Tuesday by introducing rules designed to make property speculation less appealing and to improve record-low housing affordability, a major issue for the government of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. The new law will limit property investors from deducting mortgage interest from their taxable incomes. First announced in March, the new rules are to take effect from October 1 and are part of series of real estate measures introduced across the island nation, according to Finance Minister Grant Robinson.. ""Tax is neither the cause nor the solution to the housing problem, but it does have an influence, and this is part of the Government's overall response,"" Mr Robertson said in a statement. Billions of dollars in government stimulus, historically low interest rates and New Zealand's relative success with COVID-19 have seen house prices soar, as returning Kiwis and investors parked their funds in real estate, pushing house prices up, far ahead of wages growth. New Zealand is in an even bigger housing boom than Australia right now, but authorities have moved to stop it. Will Australia follow the Kiwis' lead? House prices had risen nearly 26 per cent in August, year on year, making housing the least affordable among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations. This has had a ""punishing impact"" on marginalised communities, the country's Human Rights Commission said in August, as it launched an inquiry into New Zealand's housing crisis. In March, the government hit investors with new taxes, and authorities pledged more support for first-home buyers by boosting the supply of affordable homes. Early indications suggest these measures have helped reduce enthusiasm among investors to buy existing houses, thereby allowing a more level playing field for first home buyers, Mr Robertson said. The new rules will limit the availability of tax deductions for interest expenses incurred by residential property investors for properties acquired on or after March 27 this year. Interest deductions for existing residential property acquired before this date would be phased out over the period between October 1 and March 31, 2025. The rules do not affect the main family home or new builds. New Zealand's strong housing market has made any changes to housing policy politically sensitive, posing a challenge to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, whose popularity has risen after her success in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the country. However, the opposition National Party slammed the policy, saying it will not dampen prices but, instead, will see rents increase, worsening the housing affordability crisis. ""This is another ill-conceived and rushed policy, with little real input from tax experts,"" Shadow Treasurer Andrew Bayly said in a statement. ""As of Friday, every landlord will be paying this extra tax.""

56,analysis: People from all over Australia send us their dust samples. What's in them may shock you,house-and-home,"  What is dust? And where does it all come from? Everything in our homes gathers dust. But what exactly is it? Where does it come from, and why does it keep coming back? Is it from outside? Is it fibres from our clothes and cells from our skin? Yes, but it's a lot more than that. People from all around Australia have been sending their dust to Macquarie University's DustSafe program. Instead of emptying the vacuum cleaner into the bin, they package it up and we analyse it. As a result, we are getting to know the secrets of your dust! In total, 35 countries are part of this program. Here's a taste of what we know so far. Dust is everywhere. It settles on all surfaces in the natural environment as well as inside homes and buildings — where we spend about 90 per cent of our time, even before COVID. Some dust is natural, coming from rocks, soils and even space. But the DustSafe program is revealing Australian house dust can include nasties such as: radioactive elements antibiotic-resistant genes (genes that make bacteria resistant to antibiotics) microplastics and perfluorinated chemicals (PFAS) found in fire-fighting foams, stain and water protection for fabrics and carpets, some packaging and other sources. Some estimates suggest a third of trace element contaminants in household dust originate from sources inside your home, with the rest migrating from outside via air, clothes, pets, shoes and the like. You and your pets are constantly contributing skin cells and hair to dust. Dust is also made up of decomposing insects, bits of food, plastic and soil. Intuitively, one might think having pets transporting a variety of organic contaminants including faeces into homes is somewhat gross. However, there is emerging evidence that some ""filth"" is beneficial as it may help your immune system and reduce allergy risk. Cooking, open fireplaces and smoking indoors adds very fine dust to your home along with contaminants of concern, which are associated with poor health outcomes. Dust contains a wide collection of chemicals, including those listed on the UN's Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which are linked to certain cancers, birth defects, dysfunctional immune and reproductive systems, greater susceptibility to disease and damage to the nervous system. Chemicals used in pesticides and in our clothing and furniture also combine with dust in our homes. Toxic flame retardants are used in countless domestic products including children's pyjamas and can make their way into dust. Dust also contains microplastics from clothes, packaging, carpeting and furnishings. They're easily inhaled and ingested, especially by children who often put their hands in their mouth. Pefluorinated chemicals or PFAS — known as the ""forever chemicals"" — are used in many domestic products including cosmetics and some non-stick surfaces. These chemicals are in our house dust, too. About two-thirds of household dust comes from outdoors. Garden soil and road dust gets tracked in on your shoes or blown in on windy days. Outdoor dust particles get in on the hairs of your pets. Vehicle exhaust dust also gets inside. Recent dust storms have transported topsoil from farming lands and desert regions to our homes in the city. Bushfires create fine particulate atmospheric dust, which can contain toxic components from past pollution. Dust from nearby mines and industry can result in toxic exposures to children. Poor air quality and damp homes are a source of disease and death. By deduction, dust would also contribute to adverse health outcomes. Certain types of dust are particularly bad; there are renewed exposures concerns about silicosis dust for tradespeople, and asbestos dust from home renovation. Excessive use of disinfectants and antibacterial products has been linked to the increased prevalence of antibiotic-resistant genes, which we can detect in our dust. Nearly one in five Australians have allergic rhinitis (hay fever), caused by dust related allergens such as dust mites, pollen, pet dander and skin particles. House dust is part of life. Even in closed-up homes, it will still settle from the indoor atmosphere, leak from the ceiling cornices and attic spaces, and seep into your living areas through cracks around windows and doors. Any particles of dirt, smoke, fibres or crushed materials that go into the air eventually come down as dust. But there's much you can do. We can try to stop dust getting inside. Use door mats and take your shoes off indoors. Mud-covered children or pets can be towelled down at the door and dusty work clothes should be removed upon entering. We can choose wisely what chemicals we allow into our homes and how they are used. Reducing our use of plastics, pesticides and waterproofers will help to reduce the chemical load. Quit unnecessary antibacterial products. A damp cloth with soap or a detergent is just as useful to clean a surface. Regular vacuuming helps enormously. Vacuum cleaners fitted with a fine particle filter (such as HEPA filter) are more effective at removing allergen-causing dust. Dusting with a dry cloth or feather duster is likely to recirculate the dust back into the air, so use a damp cloth instead. Wet mopping of hard floor surfaces also removes fine dust left behind by sweeping or vacuuming. To find out more about your dust, send a sample to DustSafe.

57,How often do you wash your socks? If it's when they start to smell we've got news for you,house-and-home,"  There's more than just odour and visible dirt when it comes to cleaning, this microbiologist says Cameron Jones is a microbiologist who runs an environment health consultancy. He told ABC Radio Perth's Christine Layton that he strongly suggested people not wear socks two days in a row. ""The reason for that is the fact that they're in close contact with our bodies,"" Dr Jones said. ""We sweat and, obviously, we shed skin cells and that combination is something which is ripe for microbial growth. ""Microbes can grow on the dead skin cells and a range of close body contact pathogens can end up being transferred from our bodies onto the textiles. And that's a bit of a problem."" And while many of us will wait until our clothes start to smell, maybe we shouldn't wait that long. Dr Jones said an odour was a sign that nasties had already started to grow. ""Once something starts smelling, that's a good indication that there is microbial growth,"" he said. ""The reason for that is that those odours are volatile organic compounds that are being given off by the microbes actually feeding on something. ""That tell-tale odour means that you definitely have to find the source of the odour. ""Work out whether or not there's moisture still present and do something about it. In the case of clothing and fabric, give them a wash."" The ABC's Australia Talks survey found that the overwhelming majority of us changed our bedsheets at least once a week (78 per cent). But we're less clear on how often we should wash our bath towels. Sixty-one per cent of us change our bath towels several times a month, 30 per cent several times a week and 3 per cent at least once a day. Five per cent of Australians change their towels several times a year and about one per cent of Australians change their towels less than once a year or never. Dr Jones said there was no hard and fast rule and it depended on how much fuel was being given to microbial growth. ""You need to use your common sense. It depends on how much moisture is actually transferred onto the bath towel,"" he said. ""All of these microbial problems rely on a food source and water, so the higher the water content, the more likely that you're going to need to wash them more frequently. ""But if it hasn't gotten significantly wet and the moisture dries adequately, evaporates from that towel, you can probably use it for a couple of days."" Dr Jones said there were a variety of bacteria and fungi commonly found in the environment that could also be found on used socks, smelly sneakers and soiled tea towels, which, depending on how porous they were, could retain quite a lot of dust and dirt and harbour germs that could lead to some nasty infections. ""Staphylococcus aureus is probably well known to all of us,"" he said. ""It causes abscesses and candida that causes thrush — these are incredibly common in moist areas."" Do you clean your bed sheets too often or not enough and what difference does it make anyway? Dr Jones says athlete's foot, or trichophyton, is also very common. ""In fact, it is the most common pathogen,"" he said. ""We find it again on socks and this can cause quite serious infections in nails, skin, beards, hair."" Dr Jones says the more serious types of bacteria in our environment are the enterococcus microorganisms. ""These are the ones involved with food poisoning, for example, but [are also found in] faeces,"" he said. ""This can cause urinary tract infections right through the much more serious brain infections like meningitis and complications with your heart. ""They're the type of microorganisms that you find everywhere in the environment."" Dr Jones says there is also fungi to consider as well. ""Fungal pathogens are incredibly common,"" he said. ""They're very persistent, they're harder to deactivate and, certainly with your washing machine, you need to use a hotter wash cycle to get rid of the fungi, versus the bacteria that are easier to kill."" While a lot of people think that chlorine and bleach will kill bugs most effectively, Dr Jones says water temperature and the type of detergent you use is most important. He recommended an activated oxygen product. ""It is far more efficient than adding chlorine bleach to your washing,"" Dr Jones said. ""Because the activated oxygen breaks down into hydrogen peroxide — that's what you want — it's a natural disinfectant."" Dr Jones recommended washing at 60 degrees Celsius or higher for a thorough clean. ""Certainly, for decontaminating fungi out of textiles you want a hotter temperature,"" he said. ""If you just have the disposition that you just want to use a lukewarm wash cycle, then you really must use an activated oxygen detergent and run the cycle time for a lot longer."" Dr Jones says even your washing machine might need some attention occasionally, as could your dishwasher, as the seals can retain moisture and also incubate microorganisms. ""The seals pick up the same types of moisture and food or skin cells, and therefore, both can grow all sorts of problems in the seals,"" he said. ""There's lots of research out there about what has been colloquially termed 'black mould' in washing machine seals causing very nasty infections. ""So just be mindful to clean these out periodically.""

58,Timber supply logjam hammers home builders across Australia,house-and-home,"  Timber shortage sees home construction backlog of up to 18 months When Rob Willson moved into a rental home on a rail line during a major renovation job at his house, he did not expect to be still there five months later. The Gracemere retiree is one of thousands of home owners caught up in the nationwide shortage of building supplies that has blown out new house construction times by as much as seven months. ""The delays have been very traumatic,"" Mr Willson said while anxiously looking over progress at the worksite in Charles Crescent. ""Having to rent a house [for an extra two months] is an impost on our finances. And it's taken quite a while to get used to the trains going past [the rental home] every half hour."" Now time is running out for Mr Willson and his wife, Judy, to move back to their home as they need to exit their rental by early September. When Rockhampton builder Day to Day Constructions took on Mr Willson's house project in March it was expected to take three months with the interior gutted for an extensive renovation and new patio. Day to Day's boss Matt Day said they were concerned about building supply delays but had explained to Mr Willson what the construction industry was dealing with. ""As you can see, it's two months more than I calculated but it's great he's been so willing to accept these time delays,"" Mr Day said. ""We've had issues with the doors not arriving on time and we're still waiting for the roof. They reckon it will be here by tomorrow (Friday) now."" Mr Day said his builders were trying to shuffle things around to get the inside finished so the Willsons could move back in. ""And then we are going to tidy up the last few things on the outside while they're living here because we just can't let it go on,"" he said. ""We are doing everything we possibly can to make it happen for them."" He said clear communication between builder and client was vital as they worked through supply chain frustrations. ""These are the issues we are having and it puts a lot of strain on the client and puts a lot of strain back on us,"" Mr Day said. ""We are doing the best we can but with all these delays, it's tough."" Mr Day said a lack of timber was the biggest issue confronting the industry right now as demand for new homes soars across the region, state, and nation. Mr Day said the industry could not take on jobs that timber was needed for. ""We are at a standstill until we can get the backlog done, and then we'll know where we can go from there,"" he said. Despite site-to-site challenges, his team of tradies managed to juggle their time across three projects. ""One thing with having so much work on, there is always another job to go to and start something else but it's very frustrating for the client,"" he said. ""Normally we start and finish jobs and go to the next one. ""But we are in the situation we are in with a number of jobs all at different stages waiting for different materials. ""The client gets frustrated with us because they want their job to get done, but it's out of our hands. We can't do much more than we can."" CQ Master Builders regional manager Michelle Traill said the timber supply crisis was a concern for a region trying to meet demand in a boom cycle but she rejected speculation that builders might have to down tools soon if supplies did not recover in the near future. ""We don't think [local work] is going to grind to a halt any time soon but it's certainly slowing down the pipeline of work and it's having a flow-on effect for all trades as you go through the build process,"" Ms Traill said. ""It's also hard to schedule moving forwards as some builders can be waiting anywhere from 22 to 26 weeks for some timber products. ""There are other issues as well with roofing and lots of different types of materials. It's not just timber."" She said anyone wanting to build a new home now would have to be patient as there was a backlog of work that would last 12 to 18 months. ""A lot of builders in our region have actually closed their books just because of the amount of work they have on,"" Ms Traill said. ""They most certainly don't want to disappoint people by over promising, so they are being upfront with consumers that there is a very long delay. ""Even if people are quoting on work, the builders are telling people you could be looking at 18 months before they start any construction work."" The new home approvals for the CQ region this year — up 54 per cent to 764 dwellings for the 12 months to June — spell out the changing fortunes for an industry that had experienced a decade-long downturn.

59,Why could some West Australian builders go broke in a boom?,house-and-home,"  Western Australia's overheated building industry could see builders going broke in a boom Soaring demand in Western Australia's construction sector could see some companies ""go broke in the boom"", a regional builder says. Last year, up to $45,000 was on offer in state and federal building grants for West Australian households in pandemic-induced stimulus measures. Geraldton builder Warren Taylor said the grants caused a spike in demand for building across the state that was now coming to a head. ""Everything's changed — the whole shooting match,"" Mr Taylor said. ""It's amazing the [number] of people who want to build out there."" Being busier than ever might sound like it should be a good thing, but Mr Taylor said the activity was creating headaches for companies like his. ""People say it's a great problem to have — the funny thing is, they couldn't be further from the truth,"" he said. ""It's probably the worst thing I've ever seen. A lot of businesses go broke in a boom."" Building materials such as timber and steel are in short supply which, Mr Taylor says, is leading to price increases of more than 40 per cent in some cases. In new contracts, that could see a $50,000 increase to the overall cost of a house. ""The price rises we've copped this year are just unprecedented — price rises of over 30 and 40 per cent for some products over the last couple of months, and our margins aren't that big. ""Every single part of the house has gone up in price."" Increasing demand for timber and steel supplies across the nation have seen wait times blow out from two weeks to more than three months, further delaying builds. Mr Taylor said people wanting to build a new home would be incredibly lucky to move in before next Christmas, with build times more than doubling to at least 18 months in most cases. ""It's not just me. It's every single person in the industry,"" he said. ""Perth isn't much better and I've got a mate over in Queensland and he's in the same place. ""That's the frustrating part — it flows on to our clients. It's just crazy."" Price hikes from suppliers are now being factored into the cost of new building contracts, which Mr Taylor says will counteract financial boosts from the state or federal government building grants. In hindsight, Mr Taylor said, the industry and customers might have been better off without the grants at all. ""It stimulated the industry amazingly — the amount of building going on now is just crazy,"" he said. ""Sometimes I think I wish [the government] would never have done it and we'd still be ticking over nice and smoothly."" However, Mr Taylor said it was good that people were getting the chance to enter the market. ""It's giving people, specially first home buyers, a chance to get into their new home, which they may never have been able to afford before. ""So that part, I think, is the best thing.""

61,"This city has the most affordable capital city homes in Australia, but desperate buyers can't crack the market",house-and-home,"  Perth the most affordable capital city in Australia to buy a house, data shows, as shortage persists Susannah Morcombe has spent almost a year looking for a home in Perth, without success. She is one of many who find the current housing market almost impossible to break into, amid rising prices and soaring demand. For her, news that Perth now has the lowest median house price of all capital cities for the first time in 28 years is little relief. ""The main issue is just how quickly things get snapped up,"" she said. ""You will be looking at a property and be asking about a property and it's under offer within the day."" One of many signs of a market under strain, data from the Real Estate Institute of WA (REIWA) shows the median time it took to sell a home in Perth in the June quarter was 18 days. The long-term average in 2013 was more than double that, at 44 days, according to REIWA. Nicola Powell, research and economics chief at real estate listing site Domain, said demand was booming across the city, with sales reaching their highest for this time of year since 2014. ""What we've found is that overall supply is declining at a time when buyer demand is strong,"" she said. ""That has helped push down the total supply in the market."" According to Domain, the median house price in Perth is now $595,823. That puts the city ahead of the previous cheapest capital, Darwin, where the median price is now $608,519. Dr Powell said the shift was not caused by prices in Perth dropping, but instead growing at a slower rate than other capitals. Despite this though, prices are up just over 12 per cent compared to this time last year – the highest rate of growth the city has seen in 11 years. ""The recovery was already there for Perth prior to the pandemic, so we were already starting to see a turnaround in growth,"" Dr Powell said. ""What we have seen is the pandemic has a greater impact on other markets, such as Darwin, which was the other resources market that had seen a multi-year downturn. ""The change in Darwin has been more directly related to the impacts of the pandemic and the change in internal migration, whereas Perth was already showing signs of improvements prior to the pandemic."" This could mean prices in Perth will continue to rise in the short term. ""We have seen a turnaround in interstate migration, we've also got the return of expats, and I think there is still perceived value in the market of Perth,"" Dr Powell said. ""If we continue to see the rate of quarterly growth that we have been recording, we are likely to see house prices reach a new peak in early 2022."" Those predictions worry Mark Glasson, the CEO of social service provider Anglicare WA. ""The fact that we're more affordable to buy a house than the rest of the country is really a bit of a distraction,"" he said. ""Because we've been outstripped by the other states doesn't change the essential problem we have here, that we have a shortage of housing."" The organisation has previously warned at least 15,000 public housing homes are urgently needed, with an overall shortage of about double that. Mr Glasson said the state's housing crisis would only get worse unless action was taken, particularly because of the high demand for housing. ""There's no indication that that's going to slow down, so whilst our growth has been very fast in house prices, it's likely to get worse,"" Mr Glasson said. ""It just contributes to this dire housing situation that we have where people can't find somewhere to live, and that's a basic human requirement. ""We have to do better. We need to build more houses."" Bradley and Nicole Horton have also been hunting for a home, after their rent in Kwinana, south of Perth, jumped by $30 a week when a moratorium preventing landlords increasing rents during the pandemic was lifted in March. Mr Horton said that with both he and his wife out of work because of injuries, their stress was growing. He said the family were hoping to stay in the area but were worried about being able to find an affordable home nearby. ""Our daughter, she's four and she's in kindy at the moment and she's quite settled now,"" he said. ""She's got a lot of friends now, [so] we're thinking maybe we should stay in this area so she could get some friends and grow up with some friends around here."" He said the family was not sure how to handle the situation, stuck between deciding whether to continue renting or trying to find a way to save up enough money to buy a house.

(Hint: You'll have to go back to the home page to do this) ""We were even talking about moving into a country town, but we don't want to uplift my daughter,"" Mr Horton said. ""With everything that's happened with COVID you've got to be prepared to pay a little bit more, or you're on the streets."" For Susannah Morcombe, the prospect of a market unlikely to ease in the short term has left her nervous. ""It's a bit of a daunting prospect to think that you will look and you won't find,"" she said. ""It leaves you feeling quite deflated at the prospect of not having your own home and not being in a position to find something that's suitable."" She said while she was lucky to be able to stay with family while she waited, it could be a long time until she found a place of her own. ""I would love to be able to find a property and potentially the property that I live in for a long time to come, but it definitely does leave me in the position of having to spend a long time looking,"" she said. ""I know that most people would in any situation, however you wouldn't expect to spend years doing that, and I guess given the data that may be something that I have to face.""

62,Older tradies strap on the tool belt 'out of necessity' in construction boom,house-and-home,"  Queensland construction boom means tradies of all ages are trying to keep up An insatiable demand for construction across Queensland is forcing some older builders back onto the tools and seeing many tradies working longer hours. In Townsville in the state's north, house building is three times the rate it was prior to the coronavirus pandemic, and local tradies are trying to keep up. Work hours have increased by 70 per cent since 2020, according to Construction Skills Queensland. Corinthian Constructions director John Mahlouzarides, 62, has put on his tool belt for the first time in three or four decades. ""I've had to go onsite and do a few of the jobs myself because of the demand and just the pressure that we're under,"" Mr Mahlouzarides said. ""I know a lot of the older builders … they're all doing it. ""Even though I like the change, and they probably like the change too, I don't really think they want to do it for any duration. ""They're doing it out of necessity more than anything else."" Robert Sobyra from Construction Skills Queensland said Townsville was experiencing one of the biggest booms of any region across the state and the labour market had not been able to keep up. ""That's pretty obviously the reason why a lot of builders are having to strap back on the tool belts because there's simply not enough labour to jump up the activity levels that quickly,"" he said. According to industry body Master Builders, available tradies are becoming increasingly thin on the ground across the state, with two out of three builders waiting more than a month for roof installers and steel workers. More than 40,000 dwellings were approved for construction across Queensland in the 12 months to May. In May and June alone, 170 dwellings in Townsville were approved, compared with 82 for the same two-month period last year, according to data from the Townsville City Council. Mr Mahlouzarides said his company employed five full-time staff, as well as consultants and sub-contractors to fill the gaps. ""We could easily multiply that quite dramatically if we had the staff and the availability of sub-contractors and materials,"" he said. The home builder boom and low rental vacancy rates have created further barriers for the industry to encourage workers to the region. ""We've got to pump out a lot more houses with a lot fewer people,"" Mr Sobrya said. ""It's going to get worse before it gets better."" According to state government figures, 1,300 students have enrolled in building and construction courses in the Townsville area in the past 12 months — up 7.1 per cent compared with the previous year. That figure includes enrolments in a range of qualifications such as carpentry, plumbing and electrical. Ethan Spooner, 17, recently started a carpentry apprenticeship but said he only knew of one other friend who took up a trade after finishing school. ""I did a TAFE course while I was at school, I really liked it so decided to go with being a tradesman,"" he said. Queensland's Training and Skills Development Minister, Di Farmer, said the uptick in enrolments would help create a pipeline of labourers. ""We actually structure our investment and subsidies according to the jobs that are actually in demand and we're tweaking that constantly to make sure that we're actually meeting those industry needs,"" Ms Farmer said. Mr Sobyra welcomed the influx of new entrants into the industry but said the time lag in training them had not helped to solve the immediate problem. And time is something many builders don't have much of these days. ""It takes time to train them, it takes time for them to get productive and sometimes if you're a builder under the pump it's just easier to do the work yourself,"" he said.

63,"analysis: 'I don't want realism, I want magic': Behind the fantasy fuelling our real estate voyeurism",house-and-home,"  In 2014, a Florida real estate group began advertising its latest in a series of luxury condominiums designed by global ""starchitects"". The ads featured photorealistic computer-generated imagery inhabited by rich and beautiful people lounging by the rooftop pool; staring languidly out towards the endless view of the sea from expansive balconies; working out in the lavishly appointed gym. Its marketing slogan? ""I don’t want realism. I want magic."" This world of magical hyper-luxury also underpins the appeal of reality television shows like the new Luxe Listings Sydney, Sunset Selling, Million Dollar Listing and the soon to be revived MTV Cribs. The real estate voyeurism of these shows — and of pre-reality TV glossy magazines like Architectural Digest (which now has its own luxury YouTube channel), World of Interiors, Belle or Vogue Living — uses the eye of the camera to place us inside these otherwise hidden and inaccessible worlds. A similar voyeuristic impulse might drive us to slip into our neighbours’ homes when they are up for sale. Instead of twitching the curtains and pretending we were never looking at all, an open-for-inspection allows us to wander through the most private aspects of another’s domain while imagining: ""What if I lived here, instead of them?"" Despite all the disruptions of the pandemic, property prices in Australian cities have continued their rise and housing affordability has become even more out of reach. But our current pandemic era seems to be witnessing an intensification of the escape into fantasy. Why do we exhibit an insatiable appetite for property voyeurism and fantasy at a time when young people, especially, are less and less likely to be able to afford housing at all? Why do we love to scroll, watch, swipe and drool over luxury property on television, in magazines and via social media? In May, New Yorker writer Anna Wiener explored Instagram feeds of ""renderporn"": hyperrealistic computer-generated architectural renderings of pure fantasy luxury interiors which will never be built. They represent the denial of real-world constraints and the promise of not just escapism, but of financial escapism. Puzzling over the strangely soothing effect of such images, she wrote: ""Nothing is unaffordable in a [computer-generated] dreamscape, and rent is never due."" Showing off via property — even unbuilt property — has a long history. In the 18th century, the opulence of the ""Louis-style"" of the French court was captured in engravings and pattern books compiled by artists and architects circulated throughout Europe (and even further afield — Jesuit designers brought Baroque style to the Imperial Court in Beijing). The mania for wide-scale luxury consumption began on the cusp of the Industrial Revolution through the dissemination of images of luxury in books and prints. It accelerated throughout the 19th century with its diffusion into the upper realms of the emergent bourgeoise. The château, hôtel particulier, villa, townhouse, country house and, eventually, apartment became the perfect vessels for the display of fashionable luxury. Architects and other designers were called upon to transform these images into built realities (or, in the language of MTV, ""pimp my crib""). All too often, desire outpaced means. Even wealthy individuals plunged themselves into crippling debt in their efforts to, literally, keep up appearances. Over the period of the Trump presidency, much was made of large portions of the American electorate retreating into the realm of conspiracy theories, magical thinking and belief in wishful narratives baring little relationship to truth or reality. Some psychologists say this flight into fantasy is the direct result of declining economic prospects and of certain social groups feeling like unnecessary bit-players in the national story. Whatever the complex underlying reasons, note this: Trump was a figure who had built a global brand on the associations of luxury property, supercharged by reality television. Small tokens of luxury, or even images of luxury, might provide some satisfaction and solace beyond just signalling one’s aspirations, however unrealistic. Perhaps especially when such aspirations are wildly unrealistic. When stable employment, sick pay and annual leave, wages growth, housing security and affordability have been eroded for decades, the economy of images might feel more dependable than the real economy. A large part of sustaining a market that fundamentally depends on speculation in the financial sense is the encouragement of speculation in a more personalised sense: the speculation of fantasies. Fantasy and escapism are well-documented responses to stress and anxiety. What better way to soothe one’s rising panic at the level of debt required to buy even a basic Australian suburban home, or the prospect of even that being permanently out of reach? Switch on the TV and stream someone else’s home. ""I don’t want realism. I want magic."" This line was not dreamed up by a Florida marketing team. It comes from the brute theatrical naturalism of Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire. It is the desperate and wishful plea of Blanche DuBois as she clings to the façade of her supposed Southern gentility, the mask concealing her precipitous downward social spiral. Maybe we are all a little bit Blanche now. Our cultural preoccupation with luxury property television, magazines and Instagram images would certainly seem to suggest so.

64,Sydneysiders not allowed to leave lockdown for regional house inspections,house-and-home,"  Regional NSW real estate agents are refusing to take Sydneysiders through homes for sale or lease in person, as those in Greater Sydney try to find loopholes to leave lockdown. The Real Estate Institute of NSW is advising members that buyers or tenants can go into regional NSW for open homes or auctions ""if it would be for a place of residence"". That ""doesn't wash"" with the Better Regulation Minister Kevin Anderson or regional realtors. ""A reasonable excuse to leave home includes inspecting a potential new home,"" the REI of NSW's FAQ stated. ""If that home is outside of Greater Sydney, then opens and auctions may still be conducted and there does not appear to be any prohibition in the public health order preventing you from attending."" Advice from NSW Health said people in Greater Sydney can ""move to a new place of residence, or between your different places of residence"". Country agents have described the current guidelines as ""murky"", ""ambiguous"" and ""wishy-washy"". ""There's really no excuse for a person to be leaving Sydney as far as we're concerned,"" Newcastle agent Wayne Stewart said. Mr Stewart, like many agents, is checking IDs at open homes and asking where people are from during pre-inspection phone calls. He has been politely turning people away and offering online inspections instead, if they were from a lockdown zone. In the Upper Hunter, Pat Gleeson admitted to being blunt with callers looking to inspect homes. ""I'm a fairly direct person, so I say: 'Where are you from?', and the best answered I've got was 'NSW',"" he laughed. ""When I finally got to the bottom of it, he was from Sydney."" ""Most people are pretty good – but every now and then you just get that one who tries to sneak up and have a look at a property."" Mr Gleeson's message to those in Greater Sydney: ""You shouldn't be coming"". ""At the end of the day I'm not showing [them] through a property."" He said many buyers are happy to view online or via video calls. ""The last three houses I've sold… they've all bought them without coming up and having a look. ""And I respect what they've done. It's a big call to buy a property without coming up and looking at it, they are relying on the agents description."" Muswellbrook-based realtor Sandy Warburton said he'd received two recent complaints and had ""been lectured"" by someone frustrated by the rules. ""They both [said] that they'd spoken to NSW Health and were told that it was an exemption, and it was an essential activity, being able to come and view a property,"" Mr Warburton said. He said one was searching for an investment property. ""Irrespective of what the legislation says, my firm view is that it wasn't left that way for investors. ""Certainly, maybe people that needed to move for their principal place of residence but that doesn't mean as an agent that we have to accept that position and allow them to come through the homes. ""In every case that might come in front of us, those people are given the option either to have a video that's been recorded… or we can do a Facetime or a Zoom call where we can actually do an inspection."" Not only are the agents trying to protect their employees, vendors and tenants, but also the wider community. ""Who wants to be that real estate agent that lets somebody come up and look at a house and then all of a sudden the coffee shop people have got the virus and they've closed down?"" Mr Gleeson asked. Better Regulation Minister Kevin Anderson said ""people are strategising around the rules"" but did not commit to clarifying the wording in the health order. ""It's very difficult to super prescribe absolutely every minute detail of what someone is going to do,"" Mr Anderson said. ""Given the current circumstances and the 'reasonable excuse' law that sits within public health orders, is it a reasonable excuse if you are travelling to regional NSW from a hotspot? The answer is no."" The Minister said the recent lockdown of the Central West highlights how easily COVID-19 could enter any region. ""We don't want people from Greater Sydney heading into regional NSW – it's too dangerous, it's reckless. ""Have some respect for your fellow New South Welshmen. ""Get online, get on with your agent and do it virtually."" Once a home is purchased, buyers are able to move under the health order but will need to follow health guidelines regarding isolating, if they have moved from Greater Sydney. ""Does it pass the pub test? I don't think it does,"" Mr Anderson said. ""Regional NSW is safe, let's keep it that way.""

65,Couple wake to slithering invader shattering their sleep ,house-and-home,"  Surprised Edmonton residents name snake invader their 'Far North Queensland alarm clock' The sound of smashing porcelain is enough to alarm most people in the early hours of the morning, but finding a 3-metre scrub python ""cruising"" the house has given a Far North Queensland couple a wake-up to remember. Edmonton resident Jodie Davey said she woke about 5:00am on Tuesday to the sound of something smashing in her lounge room. ""At first, we thought one of the dogs had been up to mischief but on closer examination, we saw an intruder on the TV,"" Ms Davey said. ""He'd knocked a photo frame over and a vase … but he'd done a few laps of the house because the soap in the bathroom was also knocked over. ""He'd been cruising around for a little while before he broke something that woke us up."" Ms Davey said the python — which they had now dubbed the Far North Queensland alarm clock — was no stranger to their property. ""He's been living around our property for about three years now,"" Ms Davey said. ""He sheds his skin on the lawn, occasionally, and up on the roof. ""We just sort of let him go. He does his thing but this is the first time he's decided to make his way inside and check out the renovations."" It was renovations to the couple's laundry that Ms Davey believed granted their new-found alarm clock entry to the house. ""My husband had been painting out the laundry over the last few days so the big windows in there were left open to air out the room,"" she said. ""The rest of the house has casement windows, which aren't very big. ""We're pretty sure he came down from the roof and perhaps over the pool pump and then in through the open window."" Cairns snake-catcher David Walton said breeding season had recently started for many snake species in the Far North, which could lead to increased activity over the coming weeks. ""The nocturnal species are still a bit slow as the nights are still relatively cool,"" Mr Walton said. ""We're watching the temperature though, as it only has to go up two or three degrees for cold-blooded animals to kick into gear."" Ms Davey said once the initial shock of their serpentine visitor wore off, and she made sure the dogs were safe, they made moves to relocate the snake. ""My husband went and got a fishing rod and was able to lure, pardon the pun, him by the tail and brought him outside. ""We let him go and off he went back down the creek."" The experience has taught Ms Davey to ensure the laundry windows are closed before retiring for the night but — unlike some of her friends that she has told of the experience — it has not put her off life in the Far North. ""I've had friends in Canberra tell me, 'I'll take 5 degree [Celsius] mornings over that any day',"" Ms Davey said. ""We live beside two creeks, so you've got to expect this to happen occasionally but I'd rather it happen outside and not inside."" An Australian scrub python (Simalia kinghorni) is one of the world's longest and largest snakes. Scrub pythons are non-venomous and usually found in tropical forests of Far North Queensland, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. They can grow to 5-8 metres in length and weigh up to 25 kilograms.

66,"Trapped leaves, water damage, fire risk: Are rain gutters more trouble than they are worth?",house-and-home,"  Rain gutters trap leaves, can cause water damage, and are a fire risk, so are they worth it? As Perth and south-west WA face a series of storm fronts that have brought heavy rain and flash flooding, some homeowners are rethinking the best way to keep the house dry. Perth architect Peter Hobbs told ABC Radio Perth's Christine Layton that homes were designed to withstand a lot of rain. ""Box gutters are designed for what's known as 100-year flood event — 172 millimetres per hour of peak rain. ""Eaves gutters are designed for a one-in-20 flood event, and that's not that much less, it's 113mm per hour. ""The reason why they have a higher rate for box gutters is because if they fail, they normally flood inside the building, whereas the whole idea of an eaves gutters is it flows on the outside of the building."" If the worst happens and the gutters overflow, Mr Hobbs said there should be some additional layers of protection built into your home. ""The cavity brick house was designed so that the outside wall would get wet, then there'd be a layer of air, and then the inside would be drier,"" Mr Hobbs said. ""Then there are always supposed to be flashings in the windows, so that if any water did get through that first layer, then it would just be pushed back out again. ""Then recently, we are having more framed buildings, and so there's what's known as a waterproof membrane, which is behind the outside skin."" A house with eaves also provides additional protection from the rain, he said. ""It just pushes the water further away from the building. ""There was a bit of a fashion for clipped eaves where the gutters are actually attached to the wall, and if it fails, it's much closer to where the wall is."" Coupled with that, despite not being in accordance with current standards, Mr Hobbs said many houses had rain gutters that were higher at the front than the back, sending water pouring back towards the house if overflow slots blocked up. Listeners contacted the program for more information: Mike: ""All the gutters I've seen in Perth are higher on the front. If you are in an existing home or building what can you do to account for large downpours, are there practical things you can do?"" ""You have to maintain your system,"" Mr Hobbs said. ""Often we love to have trees around a house and so a leaf, especially a gumleaf which tends not to break down, is the natural enemy of downpipe. ""They block up so you really have to make sure that your downpipes are clear."" But a growing number of homeowners have decided that cleaning downpipes and gutters, which is also required in summer to prepare homes for bushfire, isn't worth the hassle. Neil: ""I took my gutters off about two years ago. They had started to corrode and I just pulled them off. And we holiday in Asia quite a lot, and I noticed they don't have gutters over there. I just capture the water in the gardens. I have buckets out and just water the garden."" In the north of Western Australia, where extremely heavy rains fall fast in the wet season, most homes are designed without gutters. ""In that situation gutters probably aren't going to be able to cope with that peak flow. So in that situation, that's when they have their really wide eaves and they push the water right out to the outside of the building,"" Mr Hobbs said. ""But the important thing if you're not going to do eaves gutters, you have to design where the water falls and you got to be careful that you're not going to erode your footings, the very basis of what's holding the building up. ""You might do that by paving around the house or by having some gravel but you just need the water to get away.""

67,Homebuyers left in lurch after developer backflips on sales three years after deal,house-and-home,"  Canberra homebuyers left in lurch after developer backflips on sales three years after deal Peter O'Dwyer, a single dad with three daughters, bought an off-the-plan townhouse in Canberra's north in 2018. The place was perfect — room for him and his daughters — and it was also about 500 metres from their mother. But in May the developer, 3 Property Group, rescinded its contract for the Throsby property — despite having been paid a deposit. ""My heart sunk, it was just devastating,"" Mr O'Dwyer said. ""We would drive past every day for three years and the girls could not wait to move in."" 3 Property Group said the company had been ""blasted by unfortunate events"" – including a ""significant dispute with the original builder"" – since the contracts were signed. It said it had re-designed the homes and was still planning to complete the Vivace development project. Canberra is currently in a historic property boom, with values consistently rising every month since April 2019. Mr O'Dwyer said that left him and his children with hardly any options — he was forced out of work for six months due to injuries sustained from a motorcycle crash. ""Now we have to try and buy something in this ridiculous market where everything is overpriced it just does not give us a chance,"" he said. Mr O'Dwyer said he offered the developers an extra $50,000 for the property that was initially his but they refused his deal. The townhouse has now been resold for about $140,000 above what he was originally going to pay. ""That is probably what hurts the most … and then there is also the three years' worth of rent I have had to pay,"" he said. Mr O'Dwyer is just one of several people the ABC has spoken to, who have been impacted by 3 Property Group pulling out of the deal. There are currently no laws in the ACT that specifically prevent developers, such as 3 Property Group, from rescinding contracts in a rising market — unlike in New South Wales. But, after questions from the ABC, the ACT government said it would review the NSW laws and consider adopting them in the territory. ACT Attorney-General Shane Rattenbury said it was unfair to buyers, but there had not been a significant trend of developers rescinding contracts in the capital. ""A rescission contract can be an important factor to mitigate risk for both parties, but there is always the potential, as there is with many contracts, for people to try and take advantage of another party,"" Mr Rattenbury said. ""[The] provision in NSW has been in place for a couple of years now … in light of the changing market it's worth looking at what the experience has been in NSW, whether the provision has worked as intended and whether it is worth picking up here in the ACT."" But another affected buyer, Aaron Simonds, said a review and the prospect of future protections did nothing to help him and others who had lost out on the Vivace development. ""I think that it is disgusting — to say that there is no protection for buyers is an understatement,"" Mr Simonds said. ""The protections basically assume we can go toe-to-toe with a massive developer from a financial perspective."" Mr Simonds signed a deal with 3 Property Group to buy a townhouse for $470,000 in July 2018. His contract was also rescinded and the property is currently listed for sale online for $690,000. ""The whole thing feels incredibly underhanded,"" Mr Simonds said. ""For us to have shown that loyalty then to have it ripped away from us at the last moment … feels terrible."" Going through solicitors, Mr Simonds said he had spoken to many of the other buyers who are in the same position. ""I bought this as a first-home buyer as did many of the other buyers, so this is the last thing we were expecting,"" he said. ""Over the past three years, we have looked at this property as a fantastic investment only to have it ripped away from us at the last moment."" But 3 Property Group said unfortunate events outside its control – not greater profits — had led to the cancellation of the sales contracts. ""There has been a significant dispute with the original builder which is something that happens far too often in this industry,"" 3 Property Group director Jaime Farrelly said. ""Since 2018 we have battled through the Black Summer fires, then the COVID-19 outbreak, hitting productivity and the costs. ""Contracts provide protection so the development is not destroyed by the increased costs which must be a commercial reality."" Mr Farrelly said, despite the setbacks, the company had re-designed the homes and would complete the project. The ABC has seen the correspondence sent to one buyer by Lexmerca — the law firm acting for 3 Property Group. The letter refers to ""special conditions"" within the contract — saying that because the developer has been prevented or impeded from completing works by things outside of its control, it was rescinding the contract. The ABC has seen another document from Lexmerca, in which it invites legal proceedings. It is an offer that Mr Simonds and others who lost their properties are considering taking up. ""From a legal perspective we are up against a giant and financially we are at a serious disadvantage,"" he said. ""We are writing to MPs and doing all sorts of things but we are fighting a massively uphill battle.""

68,What's the best way to keep toasty at home without breaking the bank or risking your life?,house-and-home,"  What's the best way to keep warm at home without breaking the bank, or risking your life? A mass of air from the Antarctic led to the second coldest June on record for Perth, while a series of cold fronts have brought high rainfall in July. Combined with lockdowns, it's meant a lot time at home for many — away from climate-controlled offices. If you are looking at options to keep warm, Ashley Iredale, whitegoods expert with consumer organisation Choice, said it was worth thinking twice before rushing out to buy a heater. He recently tested 13 portable electric heaters and found none of them were good enough to recommend. ""Many of them were useful, but not really impressive,"" Mr Iredale told Russell Woolf on ABC Radio Perth. ""We found none of them perform well enough for us to actually recommend them. And two of them actually failed the safety tests. ""We conduct a towel drape test, draping a towel over the heater and seeing if it either turns itself off or sustains any sort of damage. ""That's where these two failed, they actually started to melt during the towel drape test."" On top of that, they were incredibly energy intensive. ""Electric heaters as a category are among the worst appliances for greenhouse gas production because of the energy they use,"" Mr Iredale said. ""From an environmental perspective, they are bad news."" Gas heaters are somewhat more efficient to run and might be a better way to quickly heat up a room, but are not without problems of their own. ""It's a fossil fuel and our gas prices are going up as we're selling more gas overseas,"" Mr Iredale said. ""Also, gas heaters do have a bit of a health risk to them. They pump out carbon monoxide and some other noxious fumes and you should never use them in a bedroom or a small space. ""They also pump out a bit of moisture, so they'll increase the humidity in your home, which, if you've got damp or mould issues, can make those worse."" Far and away the most efficient and effective way to heat your home was a reverse cycle air-conditioner, also known as a heat pump, he said. ""Because they don't create heat energy, they move it from one place to another, and that uses about a third of the energy of actually creating the heat,"" he said. And while current gas heaters were as efficient as they were ever going to get, electric heat pumps like those found in reverse cycle air conditioners, were improving all the time, Mr Ireland said. It could even make sense to leave your reverse cycle on all the time, set at around 16 degrees, rather than just turning it off and on when you come home and feel cold. This maintains an even temperature and means the unit is regularly having to work hard to heat up a very cold space, he said. ""For cooling, we say, turn your air conditioner on early, and let it run and sort of a lower speed to bring the temperature down slowly, rather than wait `til it's really hot, and then turn on full blast,"" Mr Ireland said. Stepping back from actively heating your home, the best thing you can to do is make your home as as thermally efficient as possible, Mr Ireland said. ""Install insulation, if you can, seal up drafts and cracks and close off rooms that you're not using so that you're not heating spaces that you're not in."" Even gaps from old piping and gaps under doors can leak energy from your home. But if you're not in a position to spend thousands on a new system or make structural changes to where you live, there are ways to make sure at least one room is warm and cosy, while closing off the rest of the house. ""Leaky homes"" are hard to keep warm in winter and cool in summer, but there are simple ways to fix them. ""Convection heaters, like oil column radiators, are nice and toasty and good for long term heat,"" Mr Ireland said. ""They build up quite a big thermal mass and create nice, even heat in your bedroom, or wherever you're using them."" However one downfall is that the heat energy heads straight up the ceiling. ""To get the most out of them, you want to combine them with a ceiling fan on reverse just to push that heat energy back down and circulated around the room more evenly, or use a portable fan to do the same thing,"" he said. And if you are worried about bills, keep an eye on the thermostat in your heater and consider reaching for a jumper. ""For every degree of temperature increase in your home, you're increasing your heating energy consumption by 10 per cent.""

69,New owners of dilapidated historic Brisbane mansion share their $15m renovation plans,house-and-home,"  Lamb House owners Steve and Jane Wilson unveil $15m renovation plans for heritage-listed riverside mansion The new owners of Brisbane's landmark Lamb House have begun a major restoration effort on the dilapidated federation-style mansion on the Kangaroo Point cliffs. Jane and Steve Wilson purchased the historic property for $12.75 million in May and plan to spend about $15 million bringing the heritage-listed property back to life. The couple intend to make the multi-million-dollar riverside estate their future family home. ""We fell in love with it many years ago and I think many people in Brisbane and Queensland probably feel that way,"" Mr Wilson said. ""It's exciting for us but we always thought that if we weren't successful [in purchasing the home] that we hoped it would go to someone who wanted to live here because this, as the name of the house is, it's called 'Home' and that's what it was built for. ""It wasn't built to become a library or a school of arts or something."" The couple said it was important to maintain the character of the heavily damaged building, to honour the home's rich, 118-year heritage. ""It's about respecting the history of it, and that's the architecture, the use, and the family,"" Mr Wilson said. ""One family have had it for 109 years, so you can't tell the story of this house without understanding the history of the Lambs. ""It was a prominent house for a prominent Queensland family, the Lamb family. They were successful business people."" The property fell into disrepair when its previous owner, Joy Lamb, moved out of the home in 2015 and failed to pay more than $300,000 in council rates. After lying unoccupied for years, the home became a rubbish-strewn haven for squatters. Walls have been lined with graffiti, while gaping holes in the ceiling have left floorboards and interiors exposed to the elements. ""Inside it's unsafe at the moment, so there's a huge amount of structural work, just to make it safe,"" Mr Wilson said. ""Because the roof is gone, the rain comes in and it's just at that tipping point. ""The damage in the last year has been profound, even in the month that we've had all these heavy downpours causing damage. ""Things are falling apart before our eyes, so we really need to get on with it — it's an urgent job."" The project is estimated to take three years and will involve two architectural firms — one that specialises in heritage, while the other will incorporate a more modern feel to the home. History consultants, heritage architectural consultants and a heritage garden expert have also been appointed to revive the riverside property. ""The mind boggles, how many experts you need,"" Mr Wilson said. ""This house was built 118 years ago so we'll need some modernisation, and then we'll add some extra structure as well, which will require obviously the approval, but you add all that up — it's a lot of money."" ""We know what we're in for, we love heritage and we're in a position to be able to buy and restore, so we're going to do it faithfully and well."" The couple plans to keep as much of the core structure of the house as possible, while adding modern touches like air-conditioning systems. ""Our goal is to do as little chopping into walls as possible,"" Mr Wilson said. ""We had structural engineers examine it and we made sure that it was saveable because if it was too far gone, then it's a different project, and we wanted to restore it. ""It is saveable — hard, but saveable."" The second storey of the house currently has six bedrooms but only one bathroom, prompting the couple to consider the need for ensuites to be installed. The house also has a separate stairwell built for servants — a common feature in federation-style villas, but something the Wilsons say is no longer needed in 2021. ""People used to have servants in the old days, that's no longer the case, so there's no maid and cook living out the back,"" he said. Finding the same materials used in the early 1900s has proved a challenge. ""We've got to go and examine what the timber is and then you try to replicate that, but sometimes you can't get it anymore,"" Mr Wilson said. ""It's the beautiful stained glass windows and door surrounds and the skylight, sadly, that have been either taken or damaged, so that will be a very hard job to replace as well,"" Ms Wilson said.

70,'We definitely stood out': Time turns on Ballina's 'windmill house' ,house-and-home,"  Hands of time turn as Ballina's 'windmill house' is set to be demolished It has been a Ballina landmark for decades, but the so-called ""windmill house"" is set to be demolished and replaced with a modern home. The application to demolish the popular home was lodged by Ardill Payne and Partners on behalf of a landowner with a Sydney address. A development application is before Ballina Shire Council for a four-bedroom weatherboard house with a swimming pool. Sharon Hunt said her childhood home on Shelly Drive began attracting attention when her father, Pieter Gutter, started decorating its exterior while battling ""a few life-threatening illnesses"". ""He had a lot of time at home and he wanted to fill his time using his hands,"" Ms Hunt said. ""He also never wanted to paint it, so he was like, 'If I tile it, I'll never have to paint it again'."" What began as a practical undertaking soon evolved into something much grander and Mr Gutter transformed the property. ""You see an original beach shack that has been completely tiled with mosaic designs, abstract designs, but very colourful,"" Ms Hunt said. ""On the front lawn there's a big windmill, and several other little windmills and lots of tiled letterboxes and lots of tiled plant sculptures."" Ms Hunt said her father's creations drew a mixed reaction in the neighbourhood. ""There were a lot of people who absolutely loved it and were very passionate about it, and there were others to whom it meant nothing,"" she said. ""So very varied opinions but, as a child, we definitely stood out as different."" Ms Hunt said the house was sold about two years ago, after her father's death. ""If any one of us could have held onto it, we would have, but there are three children so basically it was an inheritance and we had to make the decision to sell it,"" she said. ""Believe you me it was very difficult, we tried but none of us could hang onto it."" Ms Hunt said family members had managed to souvenir a number of the yard ornaments. ""We've got quite a few things here at our place, and he built us a magnificent tiled letterbox to go out the front of our house,"" she said. ""Plus we've got some lighthouses of his and lots of planter boxes around. We were able to take whatever we wanted. ""It has been emotional but time moves on, although it'll be sad for sure [when it is demolished].""

74,'Safe paradise' desire sees Cairns house prices tip into millions,house-and-home,"  Southern buyers forcing up Cairns house prices with record number of million-dollar sales Property prices in the once-affordable Far North Queensland city of Cairns are now reaching into the millions, thanks to an influx of new residents from southern states. There are more than a dozen homes currently on the market for well over the million-dollar mark in the city. It's a phenomenon the Real Estate Institute of Queensland (REIQ) says hasn't been seen in the region for more than a decade. Zone chairman Tom Quaid said a waterfront home at Port Douglas recently sold for $8.25 million and another home in the Cairns suburb of Redlynch Valley was currently listed for $3.25 million — a record for the suburb. Mr Quaid said the prices were due to several factors, including the number of families moving to the area from southern states and to low interest rates. ""Cairns has managed to avoid the vast majority of issues that other cities and states have had with COVID,"" Mr Quaid said. ""We are seen as that safe haven in paradise."" Mr Quaid said it was a situation that hadn't been seen in the region since before the 2007 global financial crisis. ""A number of homes are now selling for north of $2 million,"" he said. ""When you look back five or six years, you would only see maybe one a year. ""We're also seeing prices in the very upper range in Cairns of more than $5 million, which is something that hasn't been seen in a decade."" Real estate agent Barbara Wolveridge recently sold a waterfront property perched high on a hill in Port Douglas for $8.25 million. She also has a home coming up for sale at Mooroobool for $7.8 million and has just listed a home at Redlynch Valley in suburban Cairns for a suburb record of $3.25 million. ""Cairns is still very good value compared to the capital cities, [such as] Sydney and Melbourne,"" Ms Wolveridge said. ""Waterfront homes that are selling for $8.5 million would fetch $20 million for the same house in the capital cities."" Rental vacancy rates in Cairns have dropped to an unprecedented low of 0.8 per cent in Cairns, according to the REIQ. Mr Quaid said it was the ""tightest he'd ever seen it"". ""We have scenarios where people are offering to pay six months' rent in advance in order to secure a property,"" he said. Mr Quaid said it was not unusual to receive 30 to 40 applications for a single property and more than a dozen people show up for an inspection. The burgeoning high-end property market is a welcome highlight in a tourism-reliant region hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the March quarter, the city's unemployment rate was 6.5 per cent, a rise of 1.3 per cent over the year. Cairns residents were some of the biggest subscribers to the federal government's JobKeeper welfare program that ended in March. Since then, it's been the target of aggressive tourism and jobs campaigns by the Queensland government, including the Holiday Dollar voucher scheme, the Work in Paradise campaign and the ""Good to Go"" flight discount pitch.

75,"Modern life of bright lights and devices confuse our brains, expert calls for smarter lighting",house-and-home,"  Our circadian rhythms are being disrupted by bright lights, health expert wants lighting revolution Ian Keith of Margaret River allows natural light to wake him from a restful sleep in a house with no curtains. He is following his circadian rhythm and an expert suggests we all should. Mr Keith strives to live in sync with the rising and setting sun, and morning exposure to the sunlight is essential to kickstart his sleep-wake cycle or 'circadian rhythm', the body's internal 24-hour clock, which is triggered by exposure to sunlight during the day. His house has no curtains, just floor-to-ceiling windows that open onto thriving bushland in Margaret River, in the South West of Western Australia. ""We don't need the darkness [provided by curtains] because it's going to be dark all by itself."" ""I've spent an awful lot of time working in offices and being around when the sun's up is an important thing."" Mr Keith seizes the dawn with an early surf, comes home for breakfast, before more outdoor exercise in the afternoon. By sundown, he's ready to crash. His decision to follow the cycles of the sun was not borne of extensive research or planning, he simply did what felt right. ""The more I follow the sun the healthier I am."" ""You find you sleep, and you get up and you feel like you want to do stuff and have more energy to do things."" Sean Cain, a lecturer in psychology at Monash University has been part of research that suggested understanding circadian rhythm could play a significant role in improving sleep and treating or preventing depression. Associate Professor Sean Cain said we are on the precipice of a circadian lighting revolution. ""We not only have a clock at the base of our brain that keeps 24-hour time, but we have clocks in virtually every tissue of the body, and they evolved to get these strong inputs from the sun for day and night,"" Professor Cain said. Professor Cain said current lifestyles, where people spend a lot of time indoors during the day then use bright lights and devices at night, confuse the body and brain, contributing to poor sleep patterns and even disease. ""Light suppresses melatonin, which is a hormone that pushes us towards sleep. ""When we're in light, it's tricking our clock into thinking it's daytime and so it pushes down this sleep signal of melatonin, and then it's harder to get to bed."" Professor Cain said the treatment of many chronic diseases could be improved by considering circadian rhythm as a possible contributing factor. ""[With] almost any chronic disease, you can find some element of circadian disruption, and a lot of the time if you address and repair that dysfunction of rhythms you can make the disease less severe."" According to Professor Cain, installing circadian ""smart lights"", which change colour throughout the day to mimic light from the sun, can help to establish a healthy circadian rhythm and lead to better health outcomes. He said the main barrier to people reaping the health benefits of this technology was a lack of public awareness. But he was also optimistic that within ten years, most households would use smart circadian lighting. ""Part of the problem is we're never taught that light is so powerful … because it's sort of non-conscious, it's not always obvious how it's controlling or disrupting your sleep, controlling your behaviour.""

77,"Derelict miner's cottage sells for $60,000 as interstate homebuyers snap up dirt-cheap renos",house-and-home,"  Derelict Queensland cottage sells for $60,000 as interstate homebuyers snap up dirt-cheap reno projects In Australia's red-hot housing market, it seems anything goes. It only took eight days and a $60,000 cheque to turn a derelict miner's cottage from the demolition hit list into a new homeowner's renovation delight in central Queensland. The quick sale of the rundown two-bedroom home in Mount Morgan demonstrates a surge in demand for even ramshackle dwellings at seemingly bargain-basement prices in the booming property market. It was no surprise to local real estate agent Angela Douglas. ""It sold rapidly, as most things have been up here for nearly 12 months now,"" Ms Douglas said. ""I have had quite a few sales where people have bought completely sight unseen, buying on what they can see from the internet, or a building inspection at best, and maybe a video walkthrough."" Beauty was in the eye of the beholder and Ms Douglas said the Gladstone buyer intended to give the old miner's cottage some TLC. ""It needs to be rewired, re-plumbed … the metal of the old cookout had rusted away, so water was coming in like a sieve,"" she said. ""The holes were so bad that leaves were blowing in through the gaps."" Mount Morgan is a small mining town west of Rockhampton with a rich mining history and there are plans to revive the abandoned gold mine. Ms Douglas said it was drawing many wannabe renovators from outside Queensland, rather than investors looking for a quick rental return. ""Most of the people I have been selling to have been from interstate [NSW and Victoria],"" she said. ""Most of the sales have been triggered by people who are legitimately looking to move into and live in the community. ""That is fantastic. That's stability for this area."" She said in such a competitive market, buyers were highly motivated. ""I had offers [for a bank repossession house new on the market] from five different people in 48 hours,"" Ms Douglas said. ""The people who bought it sight unseen were from down in Victoria. ""[Due to COVID-19 border issues] they couldn't actually get to see it until four weeks after it settled."" REIQ Rockhampton zone chairman Noel Livingston said interstate interest was also very strong on the Capricorn Coast where NSW and Victorians were the ""main players"". Want more local news? Sign up to the weekly ABC Capricornia email newsletter The median house price for Mount Morgan has risen from $85,000 in 2019 to $110,000 in 2021, according to data from CoreLogic. A quick internet snapshot of the cheapest homes on the market in Queensland this week showed there were dozens of options left in the sub $70,000 bracket, but they were largely rundown and in small rural towns or remote areas. These included a two-bedroom home in Wowan for $65,000, a one-bedroom cottage in Aramac for $35,000, and a battered two-bedroom home in Barcaldine for $50,000. The Sunshine State has become a hotspot for interstate migration. Could this be why Queensland's house prices are going up amid a global pandemic, recession and high unemployment rates? Adrian Haks, a valuations manager for Herron Todd White in central Queensland, said the lower end of the market was proving just as popular as the top end. But he had a warning for would-be renovators as the building industry grappled with shortages of materials and workers. ""What they need to make sure of is that they are aware of the ever-increasing cost of materials and labour and also how hard it is at the moment to find the tradesmen to assist in those renovations,"" he said. ""Perhaps if they are doing the renovations themselves, it might be even more attractive.""

Townsville City Council Mayor Jenny Hill said they had to auction the properties after trying for five years to get defaulting ratepayers to settle their bills. But Cr Hill said it could have been much worse. ""We initially had 195 properties on this list,"" she said. ""We brought it down to 40 that could go to auction, and it's been whittled down right down to about seven."" Following the floods and COVID-19, the council put an amnesty on recovering back rates, with the last auction held in 2019. ""What you are seeing at the moment is unusually high numbers because we do have quite a few properties with back rates,"" Cr Hill said. ""Council staff really do try to work with property owners when they have difficulties in paying rates. ""We try to get them to enter into payment plans. If their property has a mortgage, we are often in discussion with the banks."" It's understood the houses sold were investment properties, while two others were vacant blocks of land. According to the Queensland Ombudsman, if the rates remain unpaid on occupied land for more than three years, the council can sell it. Glen and his father, Theo, who did not want their last names revealed, were among 50 people registered to bid in the auction for homes and blocks of land in Railway Estate, Magnetic Island and Vincent. They paid $145,000 for a home across the road from where they live in Oonoonba. ""It's a bit of a mess,"" Theo said. ""It's going to cost some money, I'd say. If he [Glen] gets out of it for $200k, he's doing alright."" Auctioneer Dean Dank said the crowd of prospective buyers was larger than he expected. ""The market is really good, so people probably thought this was an opportunity to get into the market at a lower price point,"" he said. A two-bedroom Queenslander in Railway Estate fetched the highest price, selling for $223,000. Townsville, like many regional locations, has noted a boost in property prices in recent months, but Mr Dank said young buyers, in particular, shouldn't be discouraged. ""Everyone thinks it's too late …it's never too late,"" he said ""Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast are rallying hard, and right up the eastern seaboard and I think it's important that people understand here that the market here is only just in its infancy."" Two of the properties were passed in, with sale negotiations continuing.

79,'No problem with water because I'm still alive': Town recovers after groundwater contamination ,house-and-home,"  Oakey is a town on the up five years after PFAS contamination scandal In 2016, residents in the southern Queensland town of Oakey were facing financial ruin as the land they had worked so hard for was rendered next to worthless. A multi-million-dollar financial settlement couldn't undo the damage from contaminated groundwater supplies caused by toxic chemicals on a nearby defence base. What a difference five years makes. Fast forward to 2021 and the seeds of optimism are finally taking root. Here, like almost everywhere in Australia right now, property is the main game. ""We have a lot of people looking to escape the city and come here for that country lifestyle,"" Oakey real estate agent Geoff Byers said. ""Certainly, the question has come up in relation to water, but people seem to have done their homework."" Land valuations on almost 30 properties affected by the PFAS (per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) contamination were reduced by the Queensland government in 2016. The Queensland Valuer-General has yet to officially reassess land values in Oakey. But new data from the Real Estate Institute of Queensland showed the median price for a two-bedroom house in Oakey increased from $203,000 in 2018, to $227,000 in 2021 – a jump of almost 12 per cent. Mr Byers said people were moving to Oakey from across Australia. ""We are having all cross-sections coming because Oakey is affordable,"" he said. Peter Edge moved to Oakey three months ago after retiring from his job at the Brigalow Post Office and Store. ""We wanted a residential block in a quiet area. I just like the town and I have no concerns,"" Mr Edge said. ""My wife and I are very happy here."" The PFAS contamination didn't put the couple off. ""There is no problem with the town water because I'm still alive after three months,"" Mr Edge said. The communities of Oakey in Queensland, Katherine in the Northern Territory and Williamtown in New South Wales received a $212.5 million settlement from the federal government for property loss, distress and vexation. For some landowners, however, the contamination scandal is far from over, as they remain unhappy with the payment received from a class action against the Defence Department. The scandal battered the town's image as news headlines shone a spotlight on it for all the wrong reasons. However Oakey business owner Andrew Langton said the town's reputation was starting to recover. ""Oakey has changed its image in the last six months,"" he said. ""There has been a lot of new people coming in over the last six months and it's reinforced to the locals that Oakey is a great place to live."" He said while the economy had suffered, the business community had worked hard to turn the town's prospects around. ""We have lost a few businesses over time, but coffee shops have opened up and they have provided an atmosphere that is really busy and vibrant,"" he said. ""The residents of Oakey have been strong like steel over the last 10 years, and I think we are finally starting to see the benefits.""

80,"'I love spending more time with the dog': For people like Kirsti, there's no going back from working from home",house-and-home,"  Nearly half of Australians are now doing some work from home, and the latest evidence is that 'WFH' is here to stay. NAB information technology manager Simon Kooloos is one of those benefiting from the shift. Living near the Victorian regional centre of Bendigo, 150 kilometres north of Melbourne, he was spending four hours on the train every weekday for the return journey. Mr Kooloos said it took a big toll on his work-life balance. ""Really, it takes away the time that you have to interact with the family,"" he said. ""When you think about the time that you need to leave – to catch a 6:30am train – and then you're often actually getting back at 6.30 in the evening. ""So what might be, you know, a normal eight-hour day in the office for a lot of people, you're essentially doing a 12-hour shift when you consider the time away from family and home."" Beyond the tiring routine, the long days made family life uneven. ""It put a bit of strain on me and especially my wife,"" Mr Kooloos said. ""She had to do all the pick-ups, drop-offs, any after school activities. I couldn't really take the load off her for that."" We asked 60,000 Australians about their lives. See where you fit on the issues that matter. The pandemic forced an almost 12-month break from commuting, and Mr Kooloos is now heading back into Melbourne just a couple of times a week. ""We call it hybrid working. What that looks like is I will go into work to the office two times a week,"" he said. ""So with the other three days a week, I'm able to do school pick-ups, drop-offs, some of the after school activities. ""And, it's just changed the dynamic in the family quite a lot … it's definitely brought us closer together, that's for sure."" Mr Kooloos's employer has made some big adjustments too. The bank has redesigned its office spaces to accommodate greater numbers of staff working from home. If all of NAB's 34,000 staff decided to turn up for work on a certain day in the near future, there would only be enough room for half of them. ""Even before the pandemic, we had a very healthy, flexible work culture,"" said Susan Ferrier, the bank's group executive of people and culture. ""What the pandemic has helped us shift to is a culture where effectively everyone is working flexibly, even if you're full time. ""And many of our colleagues feel that they now have more autonomy over where and how and when they work. And I think that's been great for our business."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic For workers like Kirsti Taylor, there's no going back from working from home. ""I love having a bit more work-life balance, I loved having a bit more freedom,"" said Ms Taylor, the manager of a product team at Melbourne software firm Compass Education. ""For me, I love spending more time with the dog, you know, like go for walks at lunch time, being able to have lunch with my partner, which we would never normally do."" The COVID-19 pandemic forced companies to close offices and help workers find new ways to communicate and collaborate, and new data from the Australia Talks National Survey 2021 suggests the change will stick. The survey, fielded in early March, asked people how many hours they worked from home prior to the pandemic, at the height of the pandemic, and at present. Before the pandemic, half of the respondents did absolutely no working from home: zero hours. Almost a third (31 per cent) did anywhere from an hour a day to eight hours or more. But at the height of the crisis, the ""zero hours"" group shrunk to just one third, as more people experimented with working from home. Two years ago the ABC asked tens of thousands of people to share their thoughts, feelings and experiences. The Australia Talks National Survey is back again — here's what we found out. The data suggests the workforce is now closer to an even split, with around 43 per cent of respondents working some hours at home, and 37 per cent working none. Twenty per cent responded that the question was not applicable. The amount of people working from home full-time, eight hours or more per day, has tripled from 4 per cent previously to 12 per cent now. Peter Gahan, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne's Centre for Workplace Leadership, said these changes were likely to stick around. ""We've just gone through a huge experiment in how we can work from home, in a way that most people haven't experienced before,"" he said. ""And they've tried many different things. What we know is that when people experiment with things … they generally persevere with them."" Ms Taylor's work is now tailored to where she's based. On 'home office' days, she's more likely to start earlier, and use time during the day to do errands – ""like run to the doctors or put the car in to get serviced"" – whereas days in the physical office are centred on team-based work. ""The 'office days' tend to be more collaborative, more talking to people and being a bit more 'whiteboardy'. It's a bit more of a social thing. You can tend to have a bit more interaction with people and that's really nice,"" she said. Professor Gahan said the economy's shift to being based on services has led to a situation where a majority of jobs can be done at home, either fully or partially. ""The view is about half of all jobs can at least have part of what they do [as] working from home, and maybe up to sort of 60 per cent or two-thirds,"" he said, pointing to the availability of cheap technology such as laptops and software programs. ""So a lot, a lot of jobs."" That sustained higher level of working from home means offices are being redesigned to meet the needs of people who won't be working in them all of the time. But that doesn't always mean they're becoming smaller. During the pandemic, Ms Taylor's company moved to a bigger building that accommodates workers like her having a desk, but also includes more team-based areas for meetings and intensive work. ""It felt a bit counterintuitive, we're in this COVID period, no-one's in the office, and we're out there looking for larger spaces,"" Compass Education chief executive John de la Motte said. The pandemic has brought out something unmistakeable about Australians — we enjoy being bossed around, writes Annabel Crabb. The company makes software that helps schools manage operations and has 155 employees. Many are in different states and countries, but a majority are based at the new inner-suburban office near a train station. ""We want people to be able to come into the office, whether it's for one or two days. We want to have people interacting, we want to have them in spaces where they have the ability to kind of 'break out' to draw on a board,"" Mr de la Motte said. ""But then we want them to be in an area where they feel like they've got a nice social element as well."" We can expect most employers to adopt a hybrid model of where people work, according to Professor Gahan. He says there are downsides to working from home, even if you have a spare room and good technology. Research suggests that people working in teams, but from home, develop a ""psychological distance from the unit"" and may be ""less likely to cooperate or to coordinate their activities"" as time goes on. For workers at home, they are less likely to get promoted or to have access to training opportunities, ""irrespective of their performance"". And even if they perform well on objective measures, Professor Gahan says a number of studies show that when people work from home, their performance is generally rated lower than those that work in in an office setting. Broader studies tracking people's attitudes show promising results for what is becoming a new reality. ""Generally, people are reporting higher levels of productivity, high levels of satisfaction with their work, and high levels of satisfaction in the balance between work and non-work activities,"" Professor Gahan said. ""So they've worked out how to do things better … and I think with that we'll see people stick with working from home, to a degree.""

81,Tree-change renovators buy up properties in the birthplace of federation,house-and-home,"  Tree-change renovators restore historical buildings in federation's birthplace, Tenterfield When Steve Haslam and Bianca Wicks moved three hours west of their home at Kingscliff on the popular New South Wales north coast, some people thought it was a little strange. ""It was a bit unusual and a few of our friends were puzzling over the move, but there's more of a groundswell of doing that sort of thing these days and we haven't looked back,"" Mr Haslam said. The couple are among a new wave of tree changers moving to Tenterfield on the NSW Northern Tablelands. Known as the birthplace of federation, Tenterfield is where former NSW premier Sir Henry Parkes delivered a speech in 1889 calling for Australia's colonies to federate into one nation. The town boasts some of the country's oldest buildings, which are attracting would-be renovators keen on preserving Australia's heritage. Tenterfield Shire Council economic development manager Harry Bolton said there were buildings dating back to the 1850s, when the town was gazetted. ""Tenterfield mirrors Australia’s history and for people interested in purchasing some of that wonderful history the opportunity is here for them to do that and go through the joys of restoring an old building,"" he said. ""But they [the buildings] don't stay on the market very long."" Mr Haslam and Ms Wicks have renovated Tenterfield's old council chambers, the former Methodist church, and a 160-year-old property called Ayrdrie that will be their ""forever home"". ""There are so many more opportunities for purpose out here, the sense of community in these rural towns is amazing, and these beautiful old buildings just need a bit of love,"" Ms Wicks said. ""We try to keep the history within each building that we renovate because we want to live and be a part of that history of that building and not change it to something new."" Christian and Kirsten Uhrig moved to Tenterfield from Germany, via the NSW Northern Rivers region, in search of a renovation project. They bought the town's first bank, built in 1857, that later became the home of Australia's first recorded surviving quintuplets. ""The first night we slept here you could feel the history. We even thought there may be a ghost, but there isn't,"" Mr Uhrig said. ""It is special in many ways because there’s still a lot of connection to those times and we find artefacts throughout the building and in the garden we found old bottles that were 150 years old."" The building is now a restaurant celebrating the region's German immigrants who first arrived in the 1800s, but it closed for several months after bushfires threatened the town the day of the business's grand opening in 2019. ""We were seeing the end of the renovation period and knowing there was still plenty of work to be done, and there was a big fire … from then on [there were] months and months of helicopters, firefighting,"" Mr Uhrig said. ""It was at the far end of the drought, everything was dry, there was a lot of fuel on the ground and we thought, 'Maybe that's it, [we had] a very short career and maybe we need to start again.'"" Now, Tenterfield is cautiously welcoming its newfound popularity after enduring drought, bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. ""I think it builds the confidence of the community when people come in and see the value of investing, particularly when they're investing in our past,"" Mr Bolton said. Brisbane geophysicist Andrea Rutley said preserving Australia's history was a serious responsibility. She recently renovated Tenterfield's Claremont as a holiday house. The property was built by former mayor and NSW minister for justice Charles Alfred Lee. Ms Rutley worked with the council's heritage advisors to ensure the renovations preserved the property's historical value. ""If you start to reflect some of that history, the town starts to feel someone actually cares about it,"" she said. ""Be respectful of not just the house itself but what the community wants. That way you do gain respect within the community because you can start to develop it and start to contribute back.""

83,That doggie in the window became very expensive in the past year,house-and-home,"  Dog lovers find prices rise steeply amid COVID-fuelled demand Dog lovers and breeders say the cost of purebred and designer dogs has gone up considerably in the past year, due to increased demand and the need to stay at home. While the post rental moratorium housing crisis is leading to an increase in people surrendering their pets to shelters, the past year has also seen demand for purebred dogs rise, leading to big price increases. Des Kehoe is the vice-president of Dogs West, the registry body for purebred dogs in Western Australia. He told ABC Radio Perth's Christine Layton that the start of the pandemic last year led to a spike in enquiries. An increase in demand combined with fewer dogs bred last year saw prices increase. ""There is a shortage of dogs all around Australia,"" Mr Kehoe said. ""When COVID first started, a lot of breeders put their breeding programs on hold because of the uncertainty of the whole thing. ""Buying a puppy should be a personal experience — when you have lockdowns and can't have personal contact with people, it makes it very hard."" At the same time, with overseas holidays off the table and many people spending more time at home, interest in having a canine companion increased. ""There is always a strong demand for purebred dogs, for lots of reasons. At the moment we are certainly getting many more enquiries than we can supply,"" Mr Kehoe said. ""People are thinking this is the time, I'm not going to travel, I'm going to be home, I've got the opportunity to spend time with the dog."" Popular breeds, such as Bostons and French bulldogs, are most likely to have increased in price. ""The more popular a breed is, the more likely a price is going to be higher,"" Mr Kehoe said. Buyers have reported that dogs that once cost around $2,000 before the pandemic have doubled or tripled in price. Pet shops have also raised their prices and while breeders registered with Dogs West are not permitted, under the organisation's code of ethics, to supply puppies to shops, it has had an indirect impact on the prices they charge. ""Breeders have often had to put up prices to match the pet shops and the internet breeders because, otherwise, people think you are not charging enough money, it can't be a good product, because it's too cheap,"" Mr Kehoe said. He said people keen to buy a dog should take the time to do their research and find out about who they are buying a dog from. ""The price of puppies has gone up and with the internet there are a lot of scammers out there. ""Breeders will also interview you to see if you are the right person for this particular breed."" ABC Radio Perth listeners also suggested would-be dog owners foster or rescue a dog from a shelter, before spending thousands on a purebred pup. Lynda: ""You can also foster care a few dogs first to see if having a dog works for you. The dog rescuers are desperate for foster carers."" Clare: ""Get a rescue greyhound. Give a dog a better life and have your heart melted at the same time."" Glen: ""I got our dog for free from up the street. Still an expensive endeavour.""

84,"These Perth suburbs have seen huge price gains this year, and there could be more to come",house-and-home,"  Perth real estate prices are surging, with Bicton, North Beach and Sorrento leading the pack Real estate agents say ""absolutely crazy"" demand is behind 20 Perth suburbs' median house prices growing by over 10 per cent in the first third of this year. Data released by the Real Estate Institute of WA (REIWA) today revealed prices in the riverside suburb of Bicton had grown 20 per cent since December, going from $950,000 to $1.14 million — the biggest increase in the metropolitan area. Of the 20 suburbs in the list, nine are below the median house sale price for all of Perth. ""Over the latter half of 2019 and into 2020 it was certainly a top-end recovery in the market,"" REIWA president Damian Collins said. ""We saw mainly the higher-priced suburbs starting to do well, but since the latter half of 2020 and now particularly in 2021 we've seen a significant across-the-board movement in price."" Mr Collins said there were a number of factors behind that change, including an increase in general confidence in the market. ""A lot of these suburbs where you can still buy houses under $300,000 are certainly very affordable when you can borrow and get a home loan at two per cent, so people are taking that opportunity to get out of renting,"" he said. He said that trend had also partially been fuelled by the end of the rental moratorium in late March. ""The end of the rental moratorium has seen people, where they are seeing rent increases, look at the assessment of affordability and realise that in many cases in a significant number of suburbs in Perth it's now cheaper to buy than rent,"" he said. ""Of course not everybody can get out of the rental market, but we certainly are seeing more people take advantage of that opportunity to buy a house, and at the same time also decrease their cost of accommodation."" In Medina the average median house sale price jumped 13 per cent from December to April, increasing from $230,000 to $260,000. Real estate agent Sue Done said after a quiet period in the area, demand suddenly picked up earlier this year. ""We were very short on listings, people couldn't get rentals [and] people were just desperate to buy,"" she said. ""I've been doing this for eleven years and I've never seen that before."" Lauren Mandolene is also a real estate agent in the area, and said demand had been ""crazy"". ""We can't really quantify what has caused all of a sudden everyone to come out,"" she said. ""We even asked people when we are at home opens and most people just said they felt like it was the right time. ""A lot of people are saying they want to purchase now before it really booms, and they don't want to overpay for property."" But the chief executive of Shelter WA, Michelle McKenzie, said the increasing prices were worrying because they meant an already strained rental market was shrinking, as investors looked to sell their properties. ""We know that rents have increased by 15 to 20 per cent, and if more rental properties are lost what does that mean for rent prices?"" she said. ""The market is not delivering housing for people at the lower end of the market, and there's a key role for governments — federal and state — to invest in social housing … and affordable rental houses."" She said the only solution to the issue is to direct more funding to social and affordable housing. ""As more stimulus is put into the demand side, like first home owners [grants] … it's making the market worse,"" she said. ""Without that commensurate supply-side response, which is an increase in affordable rental homes and social housing … we're not going to get ahead of the game."" REIWA had forecast the value of homes across WA to grow by 15 per cent this year, with six per cent growth recorded already. ""Obviously some suburbs will do more than that and some will do less, and while we've seen certainly some suburbs already up 15 plus per cent, some are just starting their growth journey,"" Mr Collins said. ""We overall expect price to still continue to rise this year, likely up another eight or nine per cent from where they are today."" In Medina though, Ms Mandolene expects things to level out from the surge in demand this year. ""The beginning of this year was just unbelievable, and a lot of the stock's now been sold and we're finding now it's kind of steadying off a little bit,"" she said. ""My personal opinion is that it might just slow down a little bit, but still keep quite steady, just not as crazy.""

85,analysis: Starting a home renovation but not sure how much to spend? Ask yourself these questions,house-and-home,"  How much can I spend on my home renovation? A personal finance expert explains Home renovation has long been something of a national sport for many Australians, but community demand for home fix-ups has reached fever pitch since the pandemic. If you're lucky enough to own a house — and able to afford a renovation — chances are you've found yourself wishing for a better work-from-home area. Or perhaps you've thought, ""If I can't travel and am to spend all this time at home, I may as well make it more pleasant around here."" Add to that the HomeBuilder grant and you get a market where builders are in high demand, architects are run off their feet and the cost of renovating is going up. How, then, to decide how much you can afford to spend? There are no easy answers, and a lot depends on property market conditions where you live, how much financial risk you're willing to tolerate and how much you're prepared to forgo luxuries in other parts of life. But as an ex-financial counsellor and former consumer credit educator for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), here are the questions I'd encourage you to ask yourself to help you decide how much to spend. Start with thinking what you want to do and getting a good idea of how much it's going to cost. Then, factor in extra for unexpected surprises along the way. Once you have a rough idea of how much you want to borrow to fund your renovation, plug it into a loan calculator with your current lender or on the MoneySmart website. Add on a couple of percentage points to account for the assumption interest rates might not stay at current historic lows. It's a good idea to see if you could afford the monthly repayments even if mortgage interest rates increase quite a bit in years to come. At this point — although this is a good thing to do at any time — look for ways to reduce household costs. Are you getting the best possible interest rate from your lender? If you are on a variable rate, you can tell them, ""I am thinking of borrowing more but I notice the rate you have on my loan on is higher than others are offering."" Often they will knock something off your interest rate straight away. If you are on a fixed rate, you could change to another lender but remember to account for break fees. Can you reduce other costs by getting a better deal on car insurance, health insurance, phone and electricity bills? Often you can get better prices just by calling your providers and pointing out their competitors have a better deal. What expenses are coming up in the next few years? Will you likely need a replacement car soon? Are schooling costs or childcare fees on the horizon? If you went all in on a renovation and could no longer afford holidays, nights out, entertainment spending — would you be comfortable with that? Think also about income. If someone in the household couldn't work due to illness, or wanted to or had to work part-time, how would that affect monthly payments? If something goes wrong or you have an unexpected medical cost, could you afford it even with the extra debt that comes with the renovation? As yourself: if there was a drop in my income or a wage freeze, could I sustain payments to the mortgage? This is where the sheer craziness of the Australian real estate market comes into play. Even very conservative financial commentators like me are forced to admit that the property market shows no sign of slowing or stalling. It's quite likely a renovation would drive up the resale value of your house but unfortunately there's no easy way to find out by how much. A cash boost for women's health and safety, money to improve aged care, but renewables get left behind — who's got what in this year's budget. Much depends on where you live. If you are in a regional area where prices have not grown as stratospherically, you might need to plan for a more moderate growth in the value of your house. If you are fortunate enough to have property in a major capital city, your house value is likely to appreciate even if you don't renovate. So if your only concern is increasing the resale value, the market may take care of that anyway without the stress of renovation. There is still a shortage of property in Australia and demand wasn't even particularly dented by the pandemic. But past performance isn't always a reliable predictor of future outcomes. So you need to think about how you'd manage if there was a big shock to the economy or to your household. Ask yourself: how likely is it that I lose my job? If I did, could I reliably get another? How long could I maintain payments if I was unemployed? Think carefully about job trends in your industry and what you'd do if, years from now, you were made redundant. There are no easy answers on this one. Each person has to make a judgement call about how well they can tolerate risk. Ultimately, it's up to each person to decide what life you want to have over the next decade or more. It's all well and good having an improved home but if you can't afford to travel anywhere or ever have a night out again, you need to factor that in. If you can afford to see an independent financial adviser, it is not a bad idea before you launch into a big financial decision. You could also consider seeing a free financial counsellor who is independent of any lenders. They can be contacted on 1800 007 007 or through the National Debt Helpline.

86,Flashback to the 70s: Nursery owners notice a boom in indoor plant sales ,house-and-home," ABC Rural Graeme Brindley has seen trends come and go during his 40 years growing and selling indoor plants, but the past 12 months have been unlike any other. After starting his wholesale nursery in Coffs Harbour on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales during a plant boom in the late 1970s, it appears Mr Brindley is having a deja vu. ""Forty-three years ago people would be mad on collecting all different types of indoor plants,"" he said. ""In the past five years that trend has come back and there is a whole new wave of people collecting plants again and getting right into it."" ""It's particularly been with younger people, which is great to see."" In 2005,  Mr Brindley relocated his nursery 20 minutes north of Coffs Harbour to a 2-hectare site at Sandy Beach as production continued to increase. Download the ABC News app for all the latest. ""We've gone up in production … It depends on variety and size but [we're producing] about half a million plants a year,"" he said. ""It's all grown and sold to other nurseries, garden centres and your chain stores like Bunnings in New South Wales and Queensland and some other states."" Nursery and Garden Industry of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory (NGINA) CEO Anita Campbell said COVID-19 was the key reason why more of the population had become interested in house plants. ""Because people couldn't travel domestically or internationally they were spending a lot more time at home and a lot more time looking at the liveability of their home,"" she said. ""[People were] spending a lot more time in the garden and a lot more time with their plants inside. ""So, [the industry] was already growing and doing really well but COVID definitely supercharged it, no question."" Ms Campbell said nursery owners across the country were experiencing a rise in sales. ""We have found that the interest in gardening and interest in plants has created a boom,"" she said. ""We're seeing [the plant boom] not only in NSW and the ACT but across the entire country."" And it was not just indoor plants. ""A lot of people in their smaller living spaces are putting a lot more plants on their balcony and on their terraces,"" Ms Campbell said. ""They are using plants to improve their livability … stretching out as much to a garden even people in small living spaces can manage."" Nursery industry statistics, released in March, showed the Industry generated billions of dollars each year. ""Over 2.2 billion plants were produced and sold in Australia in 2019–2020 at a total value of $2.6 billion,"" Ms Campbell said. ""This is quite an increase from years before. ""In 2018–2019 we were looking at only $2.47 billion, so we've gone up significantly in the past year or so."" Ms Campbell said indoor plant sales had increased from around 9 per cent to 13 per cent of the market, clearly growing in popularity. ""We are a massive contributor to the economy and to people's health and wellbeing,"" she said. ""We are a lot bigger and a lot more important than people realise.""

87,"The town where you can earn $1,000 a week renting out a $500k property",house-and-home,"  If any town in Western Australia is symptomatic of the state's boom and bust cycle, it's Port Hedland. Once again, the town, where the Pilbara's rich iron ore is shipped to the world from, is experiencing soaring rents and property prices. The latest data from the Real Estate Institute of Western Australia showed Hedland house prices are up 41 per cent from where they were a year ago. But despite the huge growth, Port Hedland's median house price remained modest at $325,000 because, in line with the town's boom or bust nature, it was coming off a very low, post-mining boom base. Hedland First National Real Estate Agent Danielle Mariu put the price rises down to mining companies having to house normally fly-in fly-out workers locally amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic ""Basically what was a very east coast-based FIFO sector,"" she said. Ms Mariu said this had led to a rental accommodation shortage, which had in turn pushed up house prices because local families were having to buy properties just to have somewhere to live. She said mining and mining services companies were also buying houses, to ensure their staff had a roof over their heads. ""So a house [for sale] for about half a million dollars, you would expect to be in a new modern four-by-two in the newer estate in South Hedland,"" she said. ""For argument's sake, a mortgage on that, give or take … we roughly say around $500 a week at most it would cost you to actually own that house [in repayments], as opposed to if you were to rent the exact same identical house, you would be expected to be paying $1,000-plus in the current rental market. ""So your rents are double the amount of mortgages on any given house in Hedland right now."" Ms Mariu said it was this strong rental yield that was attracting investors back into the market. She said of the 17 properties she had sold in Hedland this month, 10 were to local families but seven were to investors — some local, but also some from the east coast. ""Yes, our insurances are higher up here, our holding costs are higher up here, but [I'm] pretty sure your insurance isn't $500 a week,"" she said. ""So it is an income, it is enough for someone to substitute an income."" But Ms Mariu was conscious the price hikes were devastating for the town's low-income earners. ""That's the unfortunate part … people are being forced to leave town,"" she said. Beryl Parker owns a small trucking business that tows trailers out to the iron ore mines, and she counts herself lucky for recently securing a $225,000 house in South Hedland. It is in need of renovations but went for almost double the $120,000 price it sold for in November 2019. ""I've been watching the market for such a long time, but I hadn't had the capacity,"" she said. ""I had to sell a house down in Melbourne to be able to buy that. ""I thought I'd missed the boat of cheap housing."" Ms Parker also bought two local properties mid-last year to house staff in, fearing they would soon struggle to afford rentals. ""It's part of the cost of doing business [in Hedland],"" she said. In the gold mining town of Kalgoorlie, 23-year-old speech pathologist Katie Moore is trying to buy a house because her landlord wants to house someone else in the property she is living in. Property prices there have jumped 12.1 per cent in the past year. She made the decision to try to buy despite only having moved to the regional city three months ago. ""I was looking for rentals but there are just none available that I find appropriate for me, so I'm deciding to buy a house,"" she said. Ms Moore said she was looking at buying on her dad's advice. ""[He] told me that that's actually probably a better option for me considering the rental market,"" she said. Ms Moore had been paying $160 a week rent in her share house but was now looking at houses to buy worth between $300,000 and $350,000. ""Which on repayments, it's probably cheaper, the same if not cheaper, for your repayments on the mortgage for the rent I'm paying.""

88,Would you sell your house without an agent?,house-and-home,"  Selling your house without an agent is doable but what exactly does it take? Australia's property boom is keeping real estate agents busy, but could you buy or sell a property without one? Brisbane man Philip, who did not want to use his surname, thought as much and sold his Fairfield home without an agent. ""I have an aversion to paying someone else to do something I can do myself,"" he told ABC Radio Brisbane. In his mind, real estate agents do three things: put an advertisement online, show potential buyers through the property and negotiate a price. ""I can do that, and you can do that too,"" he said. Antonia Mercorella from the Real Estate Institute of Queensland said there was a bit more to it than that. ""An agent has what we call a fiduciary obligation,"" she said. ""It's the same level of obligation that's imposed on a doctor-patient relationship, a solicitor-client relationship, and it's come of the highest levels of responsibilities that the law imposes. ""An agent is actually legally obliged to get the client the best result possible and avoid any potential conflicts of interest."" They are experienced dealing with buyers, including buyer objections, and can provide advice on the value of your property and any elements that might hinder a sale. ""Most importantly, real estate agents know how to negotiate the best price for the seller. It's what they do best,"" Ms Mercorella said. ""Agents also have access to a database of active buyers. ""This enables them to offer 'off market' sales to sellers who prefer discretion. ""It also offers a massive kickstart to a sales campaign immediately attracting buyers whose needs and wants to match the property."" Ms Mercorella said in Queensland, real estate agents facilitate contracts for sale, reducing legal costs for sellers. Confident in his own abilities after reading a couple of books on the topic, Philip set about putting the property on the market. ""I first contacted those people who years ago who had expressed interest in the house,"" he said. ""The second thing I did was to put out the two signs. ""And the other thing was to advertise in real estate websites."" Philip was able to pick up a couple of signs from a hardware store for under $50.00 and took his own photos for the advertisement but getting his house on a real estate website required a licensed agent. ""There was one website I could advertise on myself but that was not successful,"" he said. ""People will put your ad up online for a fee ranging between $200 and $700. ""I paid $249."" While many opt to have their houses staged for professional photos, Philip said the photos he took on his phone worked just as well. ""One of these books I read warned that these professional house photographers take photos that are unrealistic, and so people walk into the house already upset and angry and misled,"" he said. ""So, that's not a very good starting point. ""I took the photos, and they were just photos that captured the character of the house."" He also paid for a solicitor. Once the signs were up, and the ad was posted online, Philip's inbox filled up fast. ""[ I received] constant emails, phone calls and for the next two weeks I was booking people every half an hour to come and see the place."" Philip took more than 70 people through his home and received 33 offers to buy it. He said he ended up selling it for a price 18 per cent higher than the highest estimate of one of the agents who provided him with a property value. As part of his research, Philip relied on a couple of books, one of which was by real estate analyst Terry Ryder. ""I think probably the biggest single reason that most people appoint an agent is that they are probably a bit intimidated or fearful of the negotiating process,"" Mr Ryder said. ""They don't know how to negotiate or aren't comfortable to do that. ""That's the thing people need to think about the most."" With property prices surging and competition among first homebuyers heating up, Katie Higgins turns to social media. It's a move one housing expert says is not surprising. For owners looking to go down the DIY route, Mr Ryder recommended going in with a realistic attitude and being willing to arrive at a win-win situation for themselves and the buyer. ""One of the motivations for selling a property privately and not using an agent is you can save a big lump of money by not having to pay the agent's commission,"" Mr Ryder said. While you may not be keen on paying an agent, Mr Ryder said there was one area people could not afford to skimp on. ""You should be prepared to spend a decent sum of money on getting good legal advice to make sure you've got that aspect well covered."" Mr Ryder said he would recommend someone try to sell their property themselves, at any time but said with more buyers than sellers in the current market. There was no time like the present. ""I think it's a very good time to be doing it right now because the Brisbane market, as with elsewhere in Australia, is particularly strong at the moment,"" Mr Ryder said.

89,"Urban streets need more trees, straighter footpaths and less traffic",house-and-home,"  Streets need more trees, straighter footpaths and less traffic to welcome pedestrians, planner says Eric Denholm, an urban planner with Hatch RobertsDay in Perth, believes the design of footpaths and streetscapes around Perth is unsafe and uncomfortable for pedestrians and focuses too much on the needs of vehicles. ""I've been focusing on local residential streets because that is where a lot of people experience their day-to-day,"" Mr Denholm told Nadia Mitsopoulos on ABC Radio Perth. ""Since the 50s and 60s there's been a practice for any new subdivisions to have 10 per cent public open space. ""That's very good but when you think about the public realm that you experience on a day-to-day basis, a lot of us only visit the street and a lot of us are only using it to move from A to B in our cars."" He argued that the design of residential streetscapes was hostile to the significant proportion of the population who did not drive cars — children and older people. ""What happens typically in newer suburbs is engineers design roads first to move the cars and then we think about the pedestrians as an afterthought,"" Mr Denholm said. ""In many of the streets that we're creating out in newer suburbs, these aren't necessarily safe places where kids can play because, I would argue, some of the street standards that we're using are creating unsafe and uncomfortable environments."" He said something as simple as the position and angle of the footpath could make a huge difference to usability. Newer footpaths that hugged the curb and curved around corners alongside the road were much harder to cross and pushed pedestrians closer to traffic. He said crossing the road at an intersection on a curb-side footpath required ""looking back at speeding cars that are taking a corner at speed and then you have to slowly navigate off and you're not exactly on the correct sightline."" Traditional straight footpaths that joined up across roads made a surprisingly big difference, he said. ""If you push the footpath onto the property line then you get a straight run across the intersection and you generally find you have eye contact with the motorists,"" Mr Denholm said. ""In some cases, especially in local residential streets, a lot of cars will be cautiously approaching those intersections and, in many cases, give way to the pedestrians."" He said the ideal design involved a buffer of nature strip and street trees between the road and the footpath. ""They provide shade and shelter for people walking and, in making a comfortable environment, they also create a sense of enclosure,"" Mr Denholm said. ""They separate people from the fast-moving cars so a perception of safety makes it much more comfortable."" Surprisingly, on-street parking also created a friendlier walking experience. ""Things like on-street parking actually create friction — it slows vehicles so that's a good thing,"" Mr Denholm said. ""Pedestrians can walk in an unencumbered manner across the street when they please with vehicles travelling at lower speeds."" Mr Denholm advocated for an approach called Healthy Streets, a design guidance program that is currently used in London, which looks at issues such as noise, shade, and places to rest on streets. Mr Denholm also championed council projects like the urban forest strategy adopted by the Town of Victoria Park, just south of the Perth CBD. While there was a perception that adding trees and other elements to streetscapes would add to council maintenance costs, he said there was also a financial return. ""We've actually been doing studies for some enlightened local authorities that are actually seeing a return on their investment because every dollar that they spend in the public realm has an increase to the land value in the private realm,"" he said. ""Which means they get increased rates, and it supports increased density."" ABC Radio Perth listeners said they had observed firsthand the impact street design had on their lives: Tony: ""Footpath! I dream of a footpath. In my street in Mosman Park there is no footpath on either side. Kids have to walk, ride, play on the road or stay inside."" Andrea: ""I reckon we have the best street in Perth. It's horseshoe shaped and there is a little park in the median strip in the middle. Since Covid it has brought everyone closer together. The design of the street really helps with this."" Mary: ""Underground power is also crucial as it provides for more tree canopy and tree type options. It addresses heat stress for humans and wildlife, provides a calming feel to the neighbourhood at a minimum.""

92,"When Jess's roof started leaking, it took five months to find someone to fix it",house-and-home,"  Canberra residents struggle to find tradies as skills shortage hits home When Jess Johnson's roof started leaking last year, she thought it would be a simple matter of calling in a tradie. ""All that really needed to be done was just some replacement silicon and deck tights,"" the Canberra homeowner said. But she didn't factor in the city's trades shortage and five months later her roof remained unfixed. Ms Johnson is one of many Canberrans who say they have been unable to get simple repairs completed, as the ACT construction industry faces a shortage of tradespeople and materials — leading to delays in building and repair work. And Canberra tradies say although they have been busier than ever, they have struggled to find the staff they need to keep up with growing demand. Some experts have blamed the success of government building initiatives alongside the ACT's population boom for pushing services to breaking point. Ms Johnson said she struggled to find someone to fix her roof after a deluge of rain last year created a ""heavy"" leak in one of her rooms. ""I put in online quotes with different tradies, then when I didn't hear back I started calling them, but I still didn't hear back,"" she said. ""It got to a point where I had a list that I was cycling through of different companies on my lunch break everyday."" According to Ms Johnson, one company finally returned her call and set a repair date, but she said when the day came they never showed. The months-long delay meant Ms Johnson had to cut power to the room and abandon it every time it rained. That process continued for five months. ""It was around October that I started calling and my roof was fixed in February this year,"" Ms Johnson said. ""It was a journey."" Canberra plumber Tom Martin said his company had turned customers away because he did not have the staff to meet demand. ""We're turning away work every single day just because we can't get there,"" Mr Martin said. He said that was despite his company, and several others he knew of, offering better wages, extra leave and other incentives in a bid to attract workers. ""In the last six months we've seen about a 20 per cent increase in employee wage costs, and that's largely being driven by the shortage and the fact that everyone's advertising and we just can't find good, reliable plumbers,"" Mr Martin said. ""We try to encourage a team culture, we've got a new incentive which is free personal training sessions twice a week which we're offering to all of our staff and team dinners and that sort of thing."" In the longer term, Mr Martin said he was trying to get as many apprentices qualified as possible. ""We've got a significant ageing population in the trade industries and specifically plumbing, where a lot of the plumbers are baby boomers and they are retiring,"" he said. ""I think if we don't start pushing more and more apprentices through, we're going to have a real problem in the next 10 years."" Master Builders ACT (MBA) said the success of the federal government's HomeBuilder Grant had bolstered demand for tradies at a time where resources were already stretched. MBA chief executive Michael Hopkins said, as a result, there would likely be delays for anyone who already had projects underway. ""We want to make sure trade apprenticeships are well funded by the government and, in fact, increased, so that we can attract more people and really send the message to anyone thinking about their future career that the construction industry is a long-term, secure, well-paid industry,"" Mr Hopkins said. Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT) said trade enrolment numbers were high compared with previous years, but were still not enough to meet growing demand. ""Canberra has been growing for the last couple of years, so with that population boom comes increased need for housing construction, and, as a result from that, means an increased need for workers and the need to put on more apprentices,"" CIT trade skills director Fiona Dace-Lynn said. ""We've had a significant increase in numbers of students across all of our trade courses.""

93,Small increase in fire pit complaints after Brisbane overturns ban,house-and-home,"  Fire pit complaints rise slightly after Brisbane City Council overturns ban Nearly a year since Brisbane City Council lifted a ban on fire pits, complaints about backyard burning and smoke nuisance have seen a slight monthly increase but remained steady overall. In June last year, the council began a three-month trial allowing fire pits to be used in private backyards and afterwards amended legislation in September to permanently allow fire pit use citywide. It followed one family's autumn marshmallow toasting night in late April last year being interrupted following a smoke complaint. Data released by the council to ABC Radio Brisbane shows in June 2019, when fire pits were illegal, the council received 43 complaints about backyard burning and 17 about nuisance smoke. But in April 2020, when the story of Oxley mum Kirsty George's cancelled marshmallow night emerged, the council received 158 complaints about backyard burning and 11 for smoke nuisance. The next month, in May, complaints rose to 203 for backyard burning and 40 for smoke nuisance before the trial began in June. Fire pits are popping up in backyards across the country, but as one Brisbane mother found out maybe you're not allowed to actually light them. Throughout winter last year, when the trial was underway, the council had 78 complaints about backyard burning in June, 80 in July and 70 in August 2020. In contrast, complaints in June the year prior sat at 43, up to 50 in July and 67 for backyard burning in August 2019. Through spring and summer, last year, complaints declined down to just 19 in February for backyard burning. The council's community health and safety spokeswoman Kim Marx said the council had received 487 complaints for backyard burning and 136 complaints about smoke nuisance since the beginning of the trial in June last year. ""Following last year's three-month fire pit trial and widespread community support, we were happy to continue the trial,"" she said. ""The majority of Brisbane residents continue to do the right thing and show us they can use them safely and minimise impact to neighbours."" Cr Marx said complaints were not exclusively caused by fire pits but could also be attributed to indoor fireplaces and heaters and residents burning garden waste and rubbish outdoors. Opposition leader Jared Cassidy said fire pits, while popular, should be properly regulated. ""A number of serious concerns have been raised about fire pit laws in Brisbane, especially from residents with respiratory illnesses,"" he said. Fire pits must be above-ground for good airflow, using dry wood, gas, ethanol or charcoal, and be at least 2.5 metres away from any structure or vegetation. Anyone using a fire pit must make sure the smoke does not impact neighbours and cannot use a fire pit during a total fire ban.

94,"'Vulnerable' landlords at risk of being 'caught out' in tight market, body warns",house-and-home,"  Real Estate Institute of Queensland urges landlords to choose renters on merit, not on money offered Queensland's peak real estate body is warning landlords to be wary of offers of hefty, advanced rental payments, as they could be ""too good to be true"" in a tight market. The Real Estate Institute of Queensland (REIQ) says it's become common practice for prospective tenants, often from interstate, to offer above the asking price or payments in advance to secure rental properties. But some landlords have been caught out when tenants break their pre-paid leases early and ask for the large lump sums back. Agents say it's important to take tenants based on their merit and not to start setting budgets on over-inflated rent. REIQ Sunshine Coast zone chairman Matt Diesel said while the rental crisis was difficult for tenants, there were many challenges for landlords too. He said that on the Sunshine Coast, most agents were reporting a zero to 1 per cent vacancy rate, with many properties rented before they even got to the market. ""It's unprecedented times. So we're finding with the increased competition, tenants are thinking up new and interesting ways to go through, and make them stand out from the crowd,"" Mr Diesel said. ""We're seeing people going through and offering six months, 12 months in advance to secure a rental. And while this may sound good, it can go through and it can leave the landlord exposed and vulnerable. ""If they break the lease early, whatever the residual amount is from that rent, that has to be paid back, and that's where some landlords are getting caught out."" Mr Diesel said it was vital that landlords still conducted their regular checks on tenants, ahead of focusing on the money they could offer upfront. He said there was nothing wrong with renters offering more for the property or offering rent in advance. ""But what we're saying to landlords is make sure that you take people on their merit, not based on what that offer may be,"" Mr Diesel said. ""Check based on their background checks, and also their references. That's probably the most important thing. ""And if you can, make sure that you're renting through a reputable rental manager who knows the legislation and knows how to go through and safeguard you and your property moving forward."" Mr Diesel said he had seen cases where tenants were offering large sums for long rental periods, but with no plans of staying the full term. ""Some of those tenants typically are not looking for long-term rental. They're just looking for a short-term stop,"" he said. ""That rental may go through and may finish up earlier because they've built a house, found a property to purchase. ""So they're the sort of things where the person that offers the best, sometimes it might look the best, but it might not be the best long term for the landlord. ""They then have to go through and give that portion back, whatever is outstanding."" McGrath Real Estate agent and general manager Andrew Cairns said there were other reasons such offers which ""looked great for landlords didn't turn out to be sustainable long term"". ""We don't want to cast aspersions that landlords are out there sort of making the most of a buoyant market … it could be for a number of reasons. They might be on JobKeeper, looking for additional income, might be under mortgage stress,"" he said. ""But we're also conscious of that if they're not budgeting correctly, or if they're not financially prudent, they can end up getting themselves into trouble if and when the market does actually correct or at least stagnates. ""It can get to a point where people overextend themselves because they believe that the bubble's never going to burst."" Mr Cairns said the market might correct itself, and over-inflated rents may no longer be available, leaving some landlords short. ""If you've budgeted for $1,000 a week, then all of a sudden that correction hits and now all of a sudden true market value is $800 a week, there's an additional $200 a week you've got to find if you've committed yourself financially based on that income coming in,"" he said. Mr Cairns encouraged landlords to take a balanced approach to property management, adopting tenancies and investments. ""It doesn't necessarily mean that the end is near, but the reality is, which has been evidenced for many years, it will find its balance at some point in time, "" he said. ""Whether demand drops off or supply increases, things start to go back to normal.""

95,analysis: The truth about tiny houses — they're more expensive than you think,house-and-home,"  The tiny house movement is booming — so why aren't more of us actually living in them? Despite early forecasts of a COVID-driven slump, house prices are now surging in many parts of Australia. This is further widening the gap between the housing ""haves"" and ""have-nots"", and we are seeing related rises in housing stress, rental insecurity and homelessness. In Australia and elsewhere a movement has emerged that supports tiny house living as an important response to the housing affordability crisis. One of us argued in 2017: ""[Tiny houses] have significant potential to be a catalyst for infill development, either as tiny house villages, or by relaxing planning schemes to allow owners and tenants to situate well-designed tiny houses on suburban lots."" Yet, to date, research begun in 2014 shows no appreciable increase in Australia in the proportion of people actually living in tiny houses, including the archetypal tiny houses on wheels. That's despite the tiny house movement continuing to gain in popularity over the past decade, buoyed by Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. Google Trends indicates the level of interest shows no sign of abating. A Tiny Homes Carnival in Sydney in March last year attracted more than 8,000 people to see tiny houses for sale and listen to tiny house celebrities such as Bryce Langdon of Living Big in a Tiny House and Zack Griffin and John Weisbath of Tiny House Nation. But that popularity isn't translating into more people living in tiny houses. Data from four surveys of the tiny house community (the latest in February this year) show the proportion of respondents living in tiny houses remains under 20 per cent (fewer than 200 people). It hasn't grown in the past seven years. The surveys were posted as links to tiny house social media sites, so of course the findings cannot be extrapolated to the whole community. Nonetheless, most tiny house advocates in Australia belong to these groups. Some in the movement argue this is due to obstacles such as restrictive planning policies and difficulties in getting finance and secure access to land. In response, some local governments — Cairns and Byron Bay, for example — have published helpful fact sheets and guides. However, in a recently published research paper in Housing Studies, we argue even if these obstacles were removed, we might not see a big increase in tiny house living, especially in tiny houses on wheels. We reached this conclusion based on what people who are part of the movement, including our survey respondents, said about their motivations and aspirations. They had three main motivations: having access to affordable housing achieving a degree of economic freedom living in a more environmentally sustainable way. In reality, professionally built (off-the-shelf) tiny houses on wheels can cost three times more per square metre than standard houses. The most popular size for a tiny house on wheels is 7.2-by-2.4 metres, which is around 27 square metres (including loft space). That can cost upwards of $80,000. Of course many build their tiny houses fully or partly themselves, which can greatly reduce costs. We suggest that for many (but certainly not all) members of the movement, their strongest commitment is to their principles and aspirations, rather than to a particular type of dwelling. Some research indicates that tiny house dwellers live a more sustainable lifestyle even after moving to another type of dwelling. One of the important benefits of tiny house living was the opportunity to be part of a rather ill-defined ""community"". The most recent survey unpacked this concept of community. For over 90 per cent of respondents this meant living in a defined area with other tiny house dwellers. As one respondent said, their ideal was ""to share land with a group of tinies, without caravan park zoning"". We found more generally this meant a place with shared access to facilities such as vegetable gardens, workshops, tool sheds and community areas. So, this research casts doubt on claims that tiny houses represent a major solution to the housing affordability crisis, held back mainly by cumbersome local council regulations and a lack of tailored finance. This is not to say better regulation and finance would not be welcome. Reforms could include amendments to the National Construction Code. These include ensuring tiny houses are structurally sound, energy-efficient and achieve a minimum bushfire attack level rating. Local councils could also look more favourably on tiny houses on wheels. This would be subject to certain conditions, including the control of environmental waste and the creation of an appropriate local rates category. Given the interest in community living, councils could also consider relaxing restrictions on multiple dwellings on larger properties. This would enable a degree of communal living, perhaps in peri-urban areas. These changes would help many aspiring tiny house dwellers achieve their dream. Perhaps the most significant contribution the tiny house movement has made so far has been in opening up an important debate about housing choice. It has raised important questions, including: Are smaller but well-designed homes better than big and poorly designed ones? How can we support the market in providing much more diverse housing (in terms of size, tenure, price and so on)? Should we become more tolerant of well-designed and innovative infill developments to rectify the ""missing middle"" — the lack of low-rise, medium-density housing options such as townhouses and duplexes — in our cities? Can tiny houses help meet the housing needs of particular groups such as single older people who would like to live near each other but not necessarily under the same roof? In encouraging this debate, the tiny house movement's greatest contribution might be to remind us of economist E.F. Schumacher's famous principle that small is beautiful and more sustainable.

96,The top five riskiest renovations and how homeowners can avoid the headache,house-and-home,"  The riskiest renovations and how homeowners can avoid the headache When Brisbane man Daniel Baker* set about finding a contractor to paint the outside of his Queenslander, he thought it would be relatively straight forward — get quotes, choose one, and hey presto. ""He painted the house and said, 'You've got a 10 year warranty on any defects, contact me if anything happens,'"" Mr Baker said. Three months after the completion of the job, which took six months, and $23,000 later, the paint started peeling from the weatherboards. ""I called him and called him and tried to get him back,"" Mr Baker said. The contractor finally returned, but Mr Baker said the weatherboards were not sanded and the peeling paint was patched up with a different colour. ""It looks awful, let's put it that way,"" he said. ""In desperation, I guess, I contacted the Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC) and made a formal complaint about the painter and the lack of action."" Despite the QBCC recognising that there were multiple defects with the work, the regulator could not take any action because Mr Baker had made the complaint outside the seven-month reporting period required. He found out too late that the contractor — and therefore Mr Baker — did not have insurance under the Queensland Home Warranty Scheme. Dissatisfied with limitations of the seven-month reporting period, Mr Baker is now making a complaint to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT), but he is not hopeful. Mr Baker wants his experience to act as a cautionary tale for others about to embark on renovations, but he is certainly not alone. Painting tops the list for causing the most headaches to homeowners, with the QBCC receiving 1,641 complaints in the current financial year. ""If you are engaging a painter to come and do a job on your house and it's worth more than $3,300, that person does need to be licensed and you should check that they have that licence,"" QBCC assistant commissioner Kate Raymond said. ""Consider getting someone who is licensed to do the job, no matter how big or small, because they've got the qualifications."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Coming in at second place is joinery, with 720 complaints. ""Doors, windows, installations including hinges, trims, things like that,"" Ms Raymond said. ""The issues can be that it's sticking, or it's not aligned, or it's not closing properly — or it could be something a bit more serious like waterproofing."" Next up, taking out bronze, is work on walls and ceilings, with 451 complaints. That was closely followed by tiling, with 417. Roof cladding came in as the fifth most complained about renovation, with 327 complaints. Ms Raymond said there were a number of things people should do before they engaged in building work. Visiting the QBCC website, which includes specific information and guides for homeowners, should be the first port of call, she said. Once you have engaged a contractor, keep the communication clear and get everything in writing. ""You should be asking for a written contract that sets out the details of the work, the scope, in as much detail as possible, preferably,"" Ms Raymond said. Ms Raymond said a contractor asking for a deposit of more than 10 per cent should be a red flag for work between $3,300 and $19,999. ""Where the contract is $20,000 or over, the maximum deposit is 5 per cent,"" she said. But if 50 per cent of the work is done off-site, a contractor could ask for 20 per cent. Any more is a red flag. Ms Raymond said customers should ensure their contractor was licensed and covered by the Queensland Home Warranty Scheme for residential construction work above the $3,300 threshold. ""The contractor pays that on behalf of the owner to the QBCC and the cover is provided by the QBCC,"" she said. Customers should ask their contractor if they are paying for the cover and whether it is included in the quote — but keep in mind the scheme doesn't apply to all works. If you are unhappy with work, communicate that in writing to the contractor. When it comes to making a complaint to the QBCC, it is important to know the period of time that you have to lodge it. The timeframe begins from when you first notice the defect, though that can differ depending on whether it's structural or not. ""If you've got a non-structural defect, for example, you need to let us know within six months of becoming aware of that defect,"" Ms Raymond said. ""You also need to bring a claim within seven months from the completion of the work."" For structural defects you must notify the QBCC within three months of noticing the issue. ""We don't have discretion on the timeframes that exist within the legislation,"" Ms Raymond said. If you're unsure, contact the QBCC for advice. ""We will walk you through the steps,"" Ms Raymond said. But not being happy with a job may not always mean regulators can take action on your behalf. ""That's why getting that communication up front is so critical,"" Ms Raymond said. She encouraged homeowners to communicate with tradespeople as much as possible. ""Ripping up tiling is a huge job,"" she said. ""So if it's the case that it's actually acceptable and it's within the realm of what an ordinary person might have done, it's just not what you wanted, there may be nothing that we can do as a regulator, because it's not really a defect as such. ""If it was in the contact between you and the tiler that you were going to have it a particular way, then you could take some action against that tiler, potentially … if you can't get an outcome with the tiler.""

97,Margaret River's beauty hides homeless disaster as property prices boom,house-and-home,"  Margaret River's beauty hides homeless disaster as property prices boom On any given night, 290 people turn up for a feed at the Margaret River's ""soupie"" in Western Australia's south-west. For many people ""Margs"" is synonymous with good food, big surf, and fine wine. But since the pandemic hit, people in search of the good life have flooded the property market, pushing people and families out to the fringes. The town's problem with homelessness goes largely unseen by tourists as people tend to sleep rough, camping in the bush or on the beach. Local housing advocate group Just Home said it was difficult to get a full picture of the scale of the problem, but its recent survey found 191 people, including children, were struggling with insecure accommodation in the wine region. ""There are families that are living in a caravan, or someone's backyard, or camping by the river, and both their parents are working,"" Shire of Augusta-Margaret River councillor Naomi Godden said. Angela Wellman's family is one of them. She and her husband and their four children, including five-month-old Ayla, are sleeping in a camper trailer and two tents under a peppermint tree on a property just outside of the town. They were forced out of their rental property earlier this year when the owner decided to sell. ""There was nothing to apply for and it's quite common in Margaret River, especially in the summer holidays, to struggle finding rentals. That's not a new thing,"" she said. ""We thought once school goes back rentals will come back, that's what usually happens. However, we were very unaware of this whole crisis."" There are very few properties on the market in the shire and a family home cost between $460-560 a week to rent. Stocker Preston property consultant and licensee Mark Murray said the pandemic had a big part to play in the changing dynamics of the town's property market. ""People wanted to come here because this was part of their life plans,"" he said. ""They worked out they could work from home and plug into the internet wherever they were, so why wouldn't they live where they wanted to live if their career was transportable."" ABS population data shows Australia's cities recorded the largest quarterly net loss on record during COVID. But will tree-changers stay put in the country or flock back to the big smoke? Mr Murray said there was simply not enough supply of homes for the number of people wanting to buy or rent in town. ""There is significant demand and not a lot of supply. We don't want to be talking about when there is a thousand people looking to rent and one rental — we're not there yet,"" he said. The Cullen name has been associated with the wine making region for decades. A stalwart of the town, Shelley Cullen said she had never seen so many people struggling to find secure housing. ""The numbers have gone out of sight,"" she said. ""After COVID it's everybody. The local dentist couldn't find a home. ""There are domestic violence issues that have accelerated. ""We're seen as a tourist area, but we actually have a lot of problems with people just not feeling secure about the housing they've got."" Just Home deputy chair Craig Mathieson has struggled with homelessness for the past six years. He moved to Margaret River to be close to his young daughter, but he said securing a roof over his head has never been more difficult. ""It's really confronting, being aware of how many people in a community like Margaret River are homeless when there is so many holiday homes and we know that 30 per cent of houses at any given time are empty,"" he said. ""People need to realise that on the streets of beautiful Margaret River we have people with terminal illness living rough, or post major surgery, like hip surgery, things like that."" Mr Mathieson has been given notice by his landlord and is currently looking for a new place to live. ""I have no idea where I'm going,"" he said. ""I'm doing all I can to get a vehicle so at least I have a vehicle to stay in."" Naomi Godden said although Margaret River was seen to be a wealthy community, the average income is less than neighbouring regions. ""We are tackling this issue where there are low-income people living here and they cannot afford to live here, yet they are the people that work in casual work — particularly in our tourism industry, she said. ""There is a huge disparity between the way our community is structured economically, by the reputation of our tourism industry, and the fact that it is a beautiful place to live and we have a growing underclass."" Dr Godden said she was extremely worried about what will happen with these people once the McGowan government's rent moratorium ends on March 28. Once the moratorium ends, landlords will be free to increase rent and evict tenants that can not afford to pay. Just Home's survey found 150 families were on the precipice of losing their homes after the moratorium ends and many said they would leave the region if they could not secure a place to stay. The uncertainty is putting Angela Wellman and her partner, local tour guide Andrew Haskell, under extreme distress. ""It looks like a great holiday set-up, but having been in it for two months now I'm starting to tire of our camp,"" she said. ""I have good days and bad days. You've got kids, you've got to keep it positive. ""I'm starting to go 'I don't like this anymore' and to then try and keep it together so your kids don't see that you're getting over it."" With the days getting colder, the novelty had well and truly worn off. ""I think when my kids got sick that was then that it really hit me,"" she said. ""They were all unwell. They had colds, had a bit of a cough, and you want to keep them warm. You want to protect your kids when they're sick."" Housing stress is being exacerbated in regional New South Wales as sea and tree-changers drive up property prices and demand for rentals, pushing locals out of the market. Ms Cullen said the town was canvassing for solutions for homeless people before winter hit, including the possibility of emergency camping facilities on local vineyards. ""This is a unnatural disaster caused by a number of converging factors that we have got to take responsibility for,"" she said. ""We can't let these people be out in winter on the streets. We just can't."" Ms Cullen said it was time for the government to step in as the town was running out of ideas about how it could help people pushed to the fringes. ""I think it has got to come from the government, and to a degree our local government, that they help with answers immediately,"" she said. ""I would like the government to offer a range of low-cost shelter and housing for people who are going to be out on the street.""

98,'This place is like Swiss cheese': Massive mine blast leaves residents shaken,house-and-home,"  Huge Mt Charlotte gold mine blast leaves Kalgoorlie-Boulder families shaken The owners of an underground mine in Western Australia's Goldfields have played down nearby residents' concerns over a massive blast which had families running from their homes, terrified their roofs would collapse. Residents of the Kalgoorlie-Boulder suburb of Williamstown feel blasts from the historic Mt Charlotte gold mine every day — but say last Saturday's explosion was far bigger than usual. The mine, which has been operating continuously since 1963, has underground workings that extend about 1.2 kilometres below the surface, including underneath Williamstown. A notice delivered by the mine operator Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines to Williamstown residents last week stated the blast would be 390 metres below the surface, move 128,000 tonnes of rock and use 62 tonnes of explosives. The letter said the blast was ""larger than what we normally fire due to the location of the stope and how it interacts with our existing workings"". Williamstown resident Mandy McPhee said her children were screaming as her whole house aggressively shook for a minute. ""We're long-term residents of Williamstown so we're familiar with blasting, however the blast that happened on Saturday was pretty extreme,"" she said. ""I would liken it to a small earthquake. The kids were terrified. ""I was doing my best to comfort them."" A separate resident, who did not wish to be identified, sent the ABC video footage in which the loud and prolonged rumbling of the explosion could clearly be heard. Ms McPhee said the blast had some residents concerned their homes were at risk. ""I didn't know what to do. It was a crazy moment,"" she said. ""The residents surrounding me were running out of their houses terrified, people had pictures falling off walls, we had a glass item fall and smash."" Ms McPhee has started a petition asking KCGM, owned by Perth-based gold miner Northern Star Resources, to agree not to detonate blasts of that scale again and to take responsibility for any potential damage to homes. Download the ABC News app for all the latest. She said her insurance policy did not cover damage from mining activity and she could not afford to pay to have it fixed. ""We're not bothered by the regular blasting — we've lived here in this house in Williamstown for 13 years,"" she said. ""We've always supported the mining, we're not worried about that. ""The issue is the blast that's just been was huge — much, much bigger than anything we've ever experienced."" Ms McPhee said she was concerned about the ongoing impacts the blast had on her daughter. ""Ever since that blast has happened, my eldest daughter, every time there's a regular blast she comes running to me frightened saying, 'Mummy another earthquake's going to happen',"" she said. ""That's not acceptable — we're in a residential area and KCGM needs to remember that. ""There's children around who don't understand what's happening, which is why I'm going out and doing this."" Paul Harris has lived in Williamstown since 1996 and said he believed a house could eventually collapse or fall through the ground due to the blasts. ""This place is like Swiss cheese,"" he said. ""You can hear things fall in the middle of the night here … big thuds. As far as I'm concerned it's dirt falling. ""There's quite a few houses that have had mine shafts open up here after blasting and they've had to refill the mine shaft."" Mr Harris said he did not think the petition would make a difference as he had made more than 150 complaints to KCGM over the past 25 years, which he said had not been addressed. ""I already wrote on it [the petition] 'good luck to you trying', because I've tried that many times,"" he said. ""But I'm willing to sign the petition because you have to keep going even for the young people that are up here."" But not everyone was bothered by the large explosion, including Williamstown resident James Watson. ""We get blasting every night and in the morning, blasting doesn't actually worry us,"" he said. ""The only thing that concerned me about this other blast is that it seemed to go on for a longer period than normal, then again they know what they're doing."" Mr Watson said he was not concerned about damage to his property but did say it was possible, considering how long the blast went on for. He said he attended community meetings organised by KCGM and he was happy with the organisation's conduct. ""They always seem to be quite open about everything we question them on,"" Mr Watson said. KCGM general manager Kous Kirsten said the company always took into consideration the potential impacts of their operations on the Kalgoorlie-Boulder community. ""KCGM maintains an independent seismic monitoring system for both Mt Charlotte and the Super Pit,"" he said. ""The level of Saturday's blast vibration was consistent with regular blasts at the underground mine, although it was longer in duration."" Mr Kirsten said residents were encouraged to contact KCGM's public interaction line to provide feedback and discuss concerns or participate anonymously in the Local Voices survey online.

100,House prices hit all-time high in regional SA,house-and-home,"  Median house prices at all-time high in regional South Australia as demand continues to grow House prices are at an all-time high in regional South Australia as realtors battle to keep up with increased demand. The lowering of interest rates and release of government assistance packages are just two factors driving the highly competitive housing market. It has seen median house prices soar to record highs in places such as Mount Gambier and Port Lincoln. Sales manager Ben Jeffrey, from Gebhardts Real Estate in Mount Gambier, said he had not seen the demand for homes this high during his 14 years in the industry. ""Probably the first run of strong interest was years ago when the first home buyer grant came out, but that was really capped at houses under $200,000,"" he said. ""The demand that we're seeing now is really broad across the whole price range. ""It doesn't matter if it's $150,000 or $800,000, there's just strong buyer demand across the whole range."" Mr Jeffrey said buyer confidence had grown in the months before COVID-19, but he did not expect it to grow even further. ""I think all agents would say they did not expect it to push so hard and so strong,"" he said. ""We're regularly getting three, four or five offers on the same property. ""There are around 160 properties available in Mount Gambier at the moment — if you went back 10 years there were 1,000 or more to choose from."" In the fourth quarter of 2020, Port Lincoln's median house price reached a record high of $340,000 up around $50,000 on the previous quarter. Kemp Real Estate principal Steve Kemp said a huge jump in interstate inquiry had been a contributing factor to the Port Lincoln surge. ""We would normally get 8 per cent interstate enquiry, but we're currently getting 21 per cent,"" he said. ""I think since COVID people are looking at regional areas and seeing the lifestyle because people have realised they can now do business in a different manner."" Mr Kemp said, as a result, the demand for homes was exceeding supply. ""Every time that happens, we see price rises in all areas,"" he said. ""We are selling more properties than have probably been sold since back in the good old '80s. ""It has been quite astounding that demand just seems to keep going."" People looking to enter the competitive market have found it a challenging process. First home buyer Brandon Kranz made a conscious decision to start looking for a property in Mount Gambier around March last year. After capitalising on the government's first home buyer grants, Mr Kranz had just three months to find his first home. ""Those first homeowner grants were getting used up very quickly, so I had to jump on that before they ran out,"" he said. Download the ABC News app for all the latest. ""Only having three months was pretty stressful because obviously the market was going up and up and making it more difficult to find the home I wanted."" After adjusting his budget and expectations, Mr Kranz found a suitable home and was fortunate enough to have an offer accepted. ""I just had to bring back what I was expecting to get out of the house a little bit because the prices were getting blown out of the water,"" he said. ""I was very lucky to get in when I did because, even after the process had finished, I was still checking out the market and some of the houses that are very similar to mine were even more expensive again.""

101,"'The walls are being propped up': House sells for $750,000 over listing price as house values soar in Adelaide",house-and-home,"  A dilapidated house with propped up walls has sold for $750,000 more than the asking price in Adelaide, where buyers and sellers are seeing big price bumps in recent months. The cottage at Glenunga, in Adelaide's inner-south-east was advertised for three weeks before being sold at auction for $2.05 million, despite its condition. Agent Daniel Oliver had a feeling it would gain plenty of interest after advertising for the 1,200-square-metre property went live. ""Within two hours we actually got an offer that came in at $1.5 million, which was $200,000 above what the owner wanted, which would have been a great result,"" Mr Oliver said. That trend continued in the weeks leading up to the auction, with 88 buyers wanting to purchase the property before auction. The 1950s cottage has three bedrooms and two bathrooms, but it's not in good shape. ""The walls are being propped up at the moment,"" he said. He said there were about 500 people at the auction with nearly 50 registered bidders. ""It [the first bid] started off at $1.4 million and the second bid really wowed the crowd and it went straight to $1.8 million — a $400,000 increase in one bid,"" he said. ""It ended up at $2.05 million."" Despite the extraordinary result, he admitted the property went for more than it was worth. ""Statistically it was worth $1.3 maybe $1.5 million in this market."" He said homes in the suburb had been popular, with many buyers wanting to secure a home within the Glenunga International High School zone. President of the Real Estate Institute of Australia Adrian Kelly said the sale was following a trend across the country. ""It's not surprising … it just goes to show the resilience of the Australian property market,"" Mr Kelly said. ""We're seeing records being broken all over the place, but we weren't expecting this 12 months ago — we were staring down the barrel of 20 to 30 per cent value reductions in housing and that obviously hasn't occurred."" Mr Kelly said the ""silver lining"" of rising property prices was that they were being driven by first-home buyers at both a state and national level. ""In the most recent quarter we saw an almost 26 per cent increase in first-home buyers in South Australia alone,"" he said. ""In the COVID year, first-home buyers increased by 65 per cent."" A combination of record-low interest rates, combined with State and Federal Government incentives has helped first home buyers get into the market as investors took a back seat. ""That's largely due to confidence issues stemming from COVID and also non-eviction periods for tenants,"" Mr Kelly said. ""This trend [of increasing house prices] will probably correct itself as investors return to the market and they will this year — with interest rates remaining low, it means their money is better off in the housing market.""

102,"This young couple just made $52,000 in 17 months thanks to Perth's surging property market",house-and-home,"  Perth property prices surge as Kwinana, Mandurah, Belmont, Victoria Park lead the way Jessica Hawes and her fiance Callan Bennett sold their Parmelia property in Perth's south last week for $115,000 above what they paid for it in September 2019, thanks to a huge house price boom in the area and across the country. The City of Kwinana, which includes Parmelia, recorded the biggest increase in property value in Perth in the last 12 months, up by nearly 11 per cent, according to CoreLogic. The couple bought their four-bedroom, two-bathroom home for just over $300,000 and quickly started renovations worth around $50,000, including spending $20,000 on the kitchen. ""We're still in disbelief about how much we actually sold our house for because it's insane,"" Ms Hawes said. ""I think we're walking away with about a $52,000 profit, which is huge."" The pair were not planning to sell, but the booming property market was too tempting especially because it was not their ""forever home"". Ms Hawes said she was not nervous about selling because of how well the market had been doing, but did not expect the first and only offer would come through before the home was even listed online. Coulson & Co Real Estate, which sold the couple's home, primarily services the Kwinana and Rockingham areas and has recorded a huge increase in business in the last year. Owner Michael Coulson said around 18 months ago, his agency was selling about five properties per month, but that had now more than doubled to 10 to 14. He said the attitude of buyers had also shifted dramatically. ""What we're noticing is the change in mentality, [it] has gone from 'what's the least the sellers will take?' to 'how much do we have to pay to get this property?'"" he said. ""I think there's a lot of fear of missing out now, certainly from the buyer side."" Mr Coulson said that was clear as more and more often properties were being sold to buyers on their database before they were published online. The increase in value was leading to a discrepancy between property valuers and agents, he said, because agents were working to the current market whereas valuers dealt with historical evidence. ""The value is going off of results from two to three months ago, which are properties that may have sold four to five months ago,"" he said, noting buyers were prepared to pay much more. Several other real estate agents shared similar experiences, with urgency among buyers being a major factor. Real estate sales coordinator at The Agency, Marcia Burke, said properties were being sold almost as soon as they were listed and prices were ""way over"" what was expected. She said one of her most successful properties, which had undergone minor renovations, attracted 15 buyers and recently sold for $850,000, after being purchased just four years earlier for $700,000. Ms Burke said since the five-day shutdown in the Perth, Peel and South-West regions, properties were selling even quicker, with some interstate buyers purchasing blind. Her patch largely focussed on Duncraig in Perth's north, and she said on average, houses were selling for $30,000-50,000 more than what they previously would have. She said in 2014 when the market was ""crazy"", they would receive multiple offers, something that drove prices up — and the same was happening now. Property values in Kwinana rose by 10.8 per cent in 12 months, while Mandurah, Belmont and Victoria Park all recorded a growth rate above 8 per cent, CoreLogic's head of research Tim Lawless said. Mr Lawless said typically ""affordable"" areas were seeing the biggest increase in house prices across WA as the state's housing market clocked its biggest growth rate since the mining boom in mid-2014. Fifth on the list was one of Perth's most expensive suburbs, Cottesloe, where house values rose by 7.3 per cent in the last year. But Mr Lawless said housing affordability in Perth was still quite healthy in comparison to other capital cities. ""We're still seeing housing values in Perth about 17 per cent lower than when they peaked back in the middle of 2014,"" he said. ""Even though we're seeing values rising quite quickly now, in dollar-value terms, we're seeing homes roughly at the same level value-wise is what they were in late 2006, early 2007."" Did you know we offer a local version of the ABC News homepage? Watch below to see how you can set yours, and get more WA stories. (Hint: You'll have to go back to the home page to do this) Despite sizeable growth in value in Kwinana, he said property prices were still around 20 per cent below what they were during the 2014 peak. ""But if we do see housing values continuing along this rapid growth trend, then no doubt, we will start to see some affordability challenges,"" Mr Lawless said. The data from CoreLogic was part of a nationwide analysis which revealed Australian house prices had posted their sharpest monthly increase since August 2003, with every capital city posting an increase as well as some regional markets. The report also found an extreme disparity in rental markets across the country, with rental conditions very tight in both Perth and Darwin. It found rental growth for houses and units was above 10 per cent. Meanwhile, WA's peak real estate body reported sale listings in Perth stooped to a 10-year low in February, with less than 8,000 properties listed on their website. It was the seventh month in a row sale listings declined in Perth, according to REIWA. Its data also showed the median sale price in Perth in February stood at $490,000.

105,The Stephensons believe they are the only Australian family living in an old prison,house-and-home,"  When James and Melissa Stephenson were handed the keys to Mount Gambier's old prison in 2010, they closed the doors for 18 months. ""It was horrible, it really was … It just felt really sad and heavy,"" Mr Stephenson said. In the decade prior to them moving in, the heritage-listed site had been a halfway house and hostel for the town's homeless population. ""Every square metre of the jail was used to house junk, [there was] animal faeces, there was a lot of drug use in here,"" Mrs Stephenson said. Nevertheless, the Stephensons believed they could transform the premises into a successful hotel as well as a beautiful family home in which to raise their three children, Caine, Ari and Lulah. In the years since, they have converted the 150-year-old prison into Australia's only full-time boutique jail accommodation, attracted visitors from all over the world, and hosted musical acts including Suzi Quatro, Jimmy Barnes and The Hilltop Hoods. But not without opposition. The Stephensons were living in Queensland when they returned home to Mount Gambier and discovered that the jail was up for grabs. ""[We wanted] to turn it into a tourism destination, not only for our community but Australia-wide and internationally,"" Mr Stephenson said. When they beat 70 other businesses for the tender, the response they received was far from warm. ""The way the media had spun it was 'this couple coming down from the Gold Coast', they didn't say it's two homegrown kids coming home to do their best,"" Mrs Stephenson said. ""It was front page [in the local paper], 'James and Melissa kicking homeless out in the cold'. ""It was difficult obviously but … I don't think that was a surprise to either of us that there would be some hostility."" On top of that, they spent the first few months living in a cell waiting for the previous tenants to leave. ""I think they stayed here for four months cohabiting with us on our lease. It was tough,"" Mrs Stephenson said. To give the community a sense of what they were working with, they opened some corners of the jail to the public. ""As soon as we opened that up to the community, it totally spun around and they embraced us … [since then] it's been really fantastic."" The fact that few believed in their vision for the old limestone-and-dolomite premises was a massive motivator for the couple, especially James. ""Everyone just said, 'You're crazy, this place is an absolute dive',"" Mr Stephenson said. ""I like the fact that the council and the whole town and the region said we couldn't do it."" But with James having visited more than 70 countries and having worked in tourism and hospitality around the world, and with Melissa's background in Australian travel and community work, the council agreed to give them a shot. ""When me and Melissa first looked at starting the jail, we did an operational plan, we did a business plan, we did a capital plan, we did visions,"" Mr Stephenson said. ""The council looked at our visions and said, 'We've got to give you guys a go'."" It took a long time to get the jail ready for guests. ""It was really important for us, because it is our family home …  to have that positive feeling,"" Mr Stephenson. Early on they had local Boandik people conduct multiple Aboriginal smoking ceremonies, painted walls with thick layers of white paint and planted hundreds of native trees to brighten up the place. ""To be honest, I don't really see it as a prison anymore, I see it as a beautiful old home,"" Mr Stephenson said. The hotel now sleeps 68 people in a series of self-contained family suites, twin rooms and dorm rooms for school groups. Being quite small, the rooms can only fit double beds — and as the property is heritage-listed, the Stephensons were unable to alter any room sizes. ""For a while there it was a bit frustrating for us because we were growing and there were some things we couldn't do,"" Ms Stephenson said. ""But we've come to accept that and just work around it and since we have, it's just flowed and it's actually quite easy."" One of the common rooms for use by hotel guests is the converted prison chapel, which retains a large wooden crucifix, but also features welcoming couches, historic photographs and interesting artwork. But if you're hoping to bump into a ghost or two, you might be disappointed. ""We get asked if it's haunted, but for me, personally, being haunted means spirits causing problems,"" Mrs Stephenson said. ""We haven't had any hauntings here."" Mrs Stephenson said getting the balance right between prison and boutique hotel was an ongoing process. ""Some people think it's way too much like a jail — other people think we've taken away aspects of the jail,"" she said. ""We just really try and keep things really simple and basic, we try to keep the textures of the jail there or a feature we think is interesting. ""At the moment, we're right in the middle of turning all the history that we've been finding into decor so it's more and more history."" The Stephensons have worked hard to separate work from family life. ""We all love living in the gaol. It's such a unique adventure,"" Mrs Stephenson said. ""It took us a long time to work out how to live here and set boundaries around our personal space. ""It also took some time to work out how we could keep our kids safe living here with so many people coming in and out. ""People [used to] just walk into our house thinking it was the entrance. No ill-will there but it was just such an invasion of space. ""There are a couple of doors that we have shut down now, we don't open them anymore."" They scrapped the 24-hour check-in too, changing it to times that suit their family. ""We were under these illusions that this was what you had to do to survive in our industry,"" Mrs Stephenson said. A few years back the couple bought a shack at Southend, an isolated beach 35 minutes from the prison. ""One of us can tag team, go down to the beach for the night and come back in the morning,"" Mr Stephenson said. It was an important getaway during the worst of last year's COVID situation. Prior to the pandemic, the hotel was the busiest it had ever been. ""Overnight, same with everyone, it stopped,"" Mr Stephenson said. They took their kids out of school and bunkered down at the shack for a few months. ""We took that time to health check our family, health check our business, health check each other,"" Mr Stephenson said. Since reopening in September, the couple describe having a ""new lease on life"". ""So many people in business don't get two or three months [off[, they work seven days a week for 10 years. We certainly did that,"" Mr Stephenson said. ""We just felt really grateful that we had that opportunity to sit and go through all that and decide again, 'Is this what we really want?'"" Mrs Stephenson said. They both decided it was.

106,analysis: Why the Australian dollar is rising — and what that's got to do with your mortgage repayments,house-and-home,"  Why the Australian dollar is rising — and what that's got to do with your mortgage repayments The Australian dollar is on the move, now hovering around 80 US cents. Over February alone it's gained roughly 5 cents against the US dollar. That's quite a move for any currency. The Australian dollar is increasing in value for several reasons, and one of those reasons is also tied to how much you'll be paying on your monthly mortgage repayments — potentially as soon as later this year. Before we look at that link, let's explore what's pushing the dollar higher. The Australian dollar is what's called a commodities currency, meaning its value against the US dollar, for example, rises and falls as commodities prices move. The price of Australia's biggest export commodity, iron ore, has been roaring ahead in recent months as China ramps up steel production. Far from jumping in to stop an emerging housing bubble, policymakers are keen to let it run in the vain hope it may kick-start the economy, writes Ian Verrender. It's currently north of $170 US/tonne — an enormous increase on where it was this time last year at around $90 US/tonne. This is the main driver of the Australian dollar at present. The arrival of a COVID vaccine in Australia, and what that means for consumer and business confidence, is also pushing the Australian dollar higher. More than that, though, the economy is improving. Australia's unemployment rate is falling, tens of thousands of jobs are being created, and low to no coronavirus case numbers mean shoppers are once again loosening their purse strings (by and large). We're not out of the woods yet, but we're moving out of recession, not into one. This all pushes the currency higher. A basic rule of thumb is that when a country's currency rises in value, it's a sign ""things"" — aka the economy — are going well. The National Australia Bank's latest economic growth forecast points to this. ""We have revised up our forecast for 2021 GDP growth to 5.0 per cent (previously 4.5 per cent) and expect growth of 3.9 per cent in 2022,"" senior economist Tony Kelly wrote in a note. The economy's improving enough now to prompt financial markets to shift up or move forward their expectations of when interest rates will start rising. The ANZ's Head of Australian Economics, David Plank, watches interest rate markets for a living. He says despite the Reserve Bank's statement that it would not raise interest rates until 2024 at the earliest, financial markets are betting they will go higher earlier than that. ""The market is allowed to do that, it's all about trying to assess what's going to happen in the future,"" Mr Plank says. ""The RBA's commitment about the cash rate staying where it is an expectation, it's not a pledge. ""So, if the data does do much much better than expected, maybe the cash rate will rise before 2024."" Financial markets tend to shoot first and ask questions later. Earlier this week, the interest rate on the three-year Australian government bond began to rise. Money markets are looking at the outlook and literally thinking, ""I think interest rates will be higher than they currently are in three years' time"". Download the ABC News app for all the latest. The RBA knows this and has become concerned. It has in the past signalled it'll be in the market buying up bonds (which lowers the yield on bonds) making sure interest rates on those bonds (of any maturity) don't rise until at least 2024. So, naturally, when the rate on the three-year bond rose, the RBA went into the market and bought $1 billion worth of three-year government bonds (to lower the yield). Here's the thing, though: the market viewed this move as the Reserve Bank not being particularly serious about keeping a lid on the interest rate on the three-year bond. ""The RBA really needed to [buy more] to emphasise its determination to make that bond trade where it wants to,"" Mr Plank says. In response, the RBA's move actually prompted a sell-off in the three-year government bond market and, as you can see below, that produced a lift — albeit a very small one — in the interest rate. Even a sniff of a higher return attracts investors from all around the world, so when this interest rate rose, investors bought up the Australian dollar to take advantage of the market movement. So the Australian dollar is rising because the economy is improving, commodities prices are rising, and there's a hint Australian interest rates could be rising higher. Even more than this, global traders — not just local money market dealers — are questioning the Reserve Bank's resolve to keep a lid on interest rates. This matters if you have a fixed rate mortgage. The ANZ Bank's David Plank says three-year fixed rates will change based on movements in the rate of the three-year government, and the Reserve Bank's Term Funding Facility or TFF (which is also facilitating ultra-cheap commercial bank funding). ""Fixed rates are influenced by where market rates are,"" Mr Plank says. ""The key there, though, for fixed rates is really the TFF. ""The TFF is an anchoring point for the cost of funding for three years and so that is really setting the three-year mortgage rate. ""So when the TFF [ends], which the RBA has signalled could happen at the end of June, I would expect to see fixed rate mortgages rise as a consequence of that."" Analysts at the ANZ Bank and the Commonwealth Bank expect the Australian dollar to trade as high as 82 US cents by the end of the year. That's an indicator they expect the economy to continue improving. It's also an indicator that Australians' interest rates (not necessarily the overnight cash rate) will continue to rise. This might worry those home buyers who have stretched themselves to the limit financially; it may also excite property hopefuls who can afford to finance at a higher rate but are desperate for house prices to come down. As for overseas travellers who would normally benefit from a rising Australian dollar: What can I say? It's frustrating, isn't it?

107,139-year-old house rolls to a new San Francisco address,house-and-home,"  Movers load 139-year-old San Francisco house onto giant dollies, roll it to new address six blocks away After 139 years at 807 Franklin Street in San Francisco, a two-storey Victorian house has a new address. The green home with large windows and a brown front door was loaded onto giant dollies and moved on Sunday (local time) to a location six blocks away. Onlookers lined footpaths to snap photos as the structure rolled — at a top speed of 1.6 kilometres per hour — to 635 Fulton Street. The house's journey has been in the planning stages for years, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Veteran house mover Phil Joy told the newspaper he had to secure permits from more than 15 city agencies. Mr Joy said the move was tricky, in part because the first part of the journey involved going downhill. ""That's always difficult for a house,"" he said. Along the route, parking meters were ripped up, tree limbs were trimmed and traffic signs were relocated. The owner of the six-bedroom house, San Francisco broker Tim Brown, will pay about $US400,000 ($508,828) in fees and moving costs, the Chronicle said. The house, which needs massive repairs, sat on a prime lot so valuable its owner sold the property to a developer who planned to build an apartment block on the site, the paper added.

109,"Their homes are threatened by 'massive' falling rocks, and no-one knows what to do about it",house-and-home,"  These isolated Sydney homes are under 'massive' boulders which could fall at any moment, and authorities don't know what to do In Greek mythology, the sword of Damocles signified perpetual peril suspended over someone's head, ready to fall at any moment. Suzie and Joe Haddock know the story well — they're living it — and are, so far, on day 120. The couple's home, in one of Sydney's most remote suburbs, has been the subject of an evacuation order since October 25, when several boulders tumbled off a nearby escarpment and into their garden. Authorities are worried there are more on the way. The situation is so perilous, the Haddocks are only allowed to enter their home for 10 minutes a week. ""We've got the sword of Damocles hanging over us, literally,"" Joe said. ""We live in limbo, and I just think — how can this have happened to us?"" On a stormy night at Great Mackerel Beach (or ""Mackerel"" as the area's three-dozen full-time residents call it) the Haddocks woke to what they thought was thunder, then a crack and a thud. When they peered outside, they saw a massive boulder had landed four metres from where they were sleeping. Their neighbours weren't so lucky. Two doors down, Ray and Lorraine Kemp's place was smashed by the rock slide. They weren't there at the time, but have seen drone pictures of the damage — walls and windows destroyed, furniture broken, the boulders even felled their fridge, leaving rotting food all over the floor. ""It's all open at the back, so there's going to be animals in there, doing their business,"" Lorraine said. ""Everything is just going to be ruined."" ""It would only take one more to come down, and that's my place flattened I'd say,"" Ray said. ""Now the path is clear, there's a good chance it could just be barrelling straight into our house."" Another nearby home was largely destroyed in the incident, which has left an enormous scar on the cliffs that soar over Mackerel — a suburb wedged between Pittwater and the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and accessible only by boat. Four months after the incident, authorities remain unsure what to do. A risk assessment by global engineering firm Jacobs shown to residents last week found ""massive"" rocks on the side of slope were ""frequently overhanging"". ""Several detached blocks with maximum dimensions up to 5m are perched near the crest of the escarpment,"" it read. The assessment rated the risk of fatalities from a similar event in the future as ""unacceptable"" at three properties, including the Kemp's and the Haddock's. The only solution proposed in the report to protect the houses — a fence — would be ""challenging and expensive"" to construct, and ""onerous"" to maintain, it warned. In a statement, a National Parks and Wildlife Service spokesperson said the organisation's priority was keeping residents safe. Download the ABC News app for all the latest. They said a more comprehensive analysis of the slope above the homes, and potential solutions, was being planned. ""Specialist geotechnical engineers will complete the detailed analysis as quickly as possible to provide residents with the certainty they need,"" the spokesperson said. For now, the Haddocks are homeless. ""I've never been an anxious person, but I've discovered during this that I am,"" Suzie said. ""When you start waking up each morning in tears, you know that it's really affecting you."" The Kemps have been living in another home they own, but insurance assessors have been unable to access their Mackerel property because it's too dangerous. The Haddocks, meanwhile, are caught in an insurance loophole — as their property is not damaged, they can't make a claim. Even if they could, it doesn't solve the problem of their home being deemed too dangerous to live in. They've been surviving on the generosity of friends, and crashing wherever they can. ""In May, Joe turns 70. I don't think that he thought he'd be couch-surfing at that age,"" Suzie said. ""We can't sell our property, we can't move on. We can't do anything."" The initial evacuation order was for a month, but it's since been extended. After a meeting with authorities last week, the couples now believe it could be years before there is a resolution. Petrified the sword would fall, Damocles begged to be allowed to escape from under it. While he eventually did, the future for these couples is more complicated. Despite loving Mackerel, the Kemps and Haddocks are resigned to the fact they will likely have to leave and are even open to having their properties forcibly acquired. But it's not that easy. ""We don't own two houses, like a lot of people do on Mackerel,"" Suzie said. ""We've invested everything we own in that house. ""If this goes on for two years, I don't know what we'll do.""

110,'People lined up around the block': House prices hit record highs in Adelaide as demand surges,house-and-home,"  Adelaide's housing market had often been considered an affordable option when compared to the eastern states, but buyers are becoming bewildered at the increasing price of property and level of competition. Late last year, Adelaide's median house price reached a record high, peaking at $510,000, and so far this year, dozens of properties in various suburbs have exceeded expectations at sale. ""The median price has reached a new record high and the volume of sales has significantly increased across metropolitan Adelaide and the entire state,"" the state's Real Estate Institute stated in its December quarter report. ""It is a testament to South Australia's reputation as one of the safest, most affordable and most liveable places in the world."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic With supply down and demand up, and properties selling for tens of thousands of dollars above the asking price, Adelaide has become a seller's market. Experts say the reasons for the price boom include fewer listings, higher levels of interstate interest, the impact of coronavirus on disposable income, a partial reversal of the so-called ""brain drain"", and South Australia's comparative success in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Market analyst Kevin Brogan, from property advisory firm Herron Todd White, said there had also been a fall of around 11 per cent in new listings in Adelaide in the past 12 months, which was driving higher prices. ""The demand at the moment hasn't really been met by significant new supply coming online,"" he said. ""Compared to this time last year, we've probably got fewer sellers bringing their properties to market."" While Adelaide's property market remains considerably more affordable than Sydney and Melbourne, Mr Brogan said sellers had the advantage. ""We generally have a much more stable market, we're not that given to market volatility, so we don't see quite the same spikes and troughs that you'll see in some of those eastern capitals,"" he said. ""But at the moment the market in Adelaide has shown tremendous resilience through the coronavirus pandemic."" Real Estate Institute of SA chief executive Barry Money described what was occurring in the South Australian capital as a ""mini-boom"". ""There will be some very happy sellers out there,"" Mr Money said. Agents are currently ""busier than they've ever been"", and Mr Money said Adelaide's traditional selling points — such as reduced commuting times — remained attractive to interstate investors. ""I think we are going to see, over the next 12 months or so, a pick-up of interstate investors in the market,"" he said. ""It's worth considering selling your property at this point in time because of the level pricing has reached."" Recent house-hunter Brooke DuBois said she was among the lucky ones, having purchased a home just before Christmas. She said by the time she and her husband Jeremy made the purchase, they were at the end of their ""tether"". ""In the beginning we thought we might get a bargain here, if people are wanting to sell quickly — perhaps feeling a little bit nervous in a COVID environment — but we realised pretty quickly that wasn't going to happen,"" she said. With a second baby on the way, Ms DuBois and her husband were keen to move closer to work and to Adelaide's CBD, and started house-hunting in late 2019. Little did she know they would end up attending hundreds of open inspections, and putting in several unsuccessful offers — including one about $7,000 above the top end of the asking price range. ""We were looking and looking and just getting blown away by how many people were in the same situation as us,"" she said. ""Every open inspection — quite often you'd have people lined up around the block and you'd get the same people at each inspection. ""Everyone in our position was fighting for the few houses that were available … you could tell how hungry the buying market was."" She said it took months of searching, dozens of weekends attending inspections, and three unsuccessful offers before she finally managed to land a successful bid. ""We missed out on three different homes we put offers on. A couple of times we upped our offers,"" Ms DuBois said. ""It probably did get harder, but at the end we were just frustrated and chucking an absurd amount of money at things and still missing out."" Ms DuBois has now moved her family into their new home at Blackwood, in the Adelaide Hills. ""We really loved it and decided to go hard on this one. We went above the asking price and nabbed it,"" she said. Some properties in Adelaide are currently selling for more than $100,000 in excess of the asking price. A property at Maylands with a listed price guide of $850,000 recently sold at auction for $1.08 million, while another at Prospect listed at $900,000 attracted a successful top bid of $1.13 million. Accompanying the higher prices is a drop-off in listings — data shows the total number of listings for houses and units across Adelaide has declined dramatically in recent months. According to investment research company SQM Research, there were 13,391 total listings in January 2021. That represents a decline of about 26 per cent on the recent high of 18,139, which occurred just over 12 months earlier, in November 2019. Source: Department of Treasury and Finance While Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews generated headlines when he publicly questioned why anyone would want to come to South Australia, the festival state is proving popular with young professionals. ""South Australia would appear to be a remarkably affordable market compared to some of the alternatives in the eastern states,"" Mr Brogan said. He said several factors were driving the trend, including historically low interest rates and government stimulus funding in response to the pandemic. But he said South Australia's comparatively strong track record in handling coronavirus outbreaks was also attractive to interstate buyers. ""The fact that we have had effective mitigation measures when they're required has actually enhanced Adelaide's reputation amongst interstate purchasers,"" he said. ""The 'brain drain' where young and highly qualified people leave South Australia tempted to the eastern states by what they perceive to be greater opportunities — there's a reasonable rate of those people returning."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Mr Brogan said wealthier investors had more disposable income at the moment, which was also driving up prices. ""I've certainly seen numerous examples in markets like Byron Bay and the Sunshine Coast of precisely that — in upper income brackets, people making an annual allowance for overseas travel et cetera are now actually finding an alternative purpose for those available funds,"" Mr Brogan said. Ms DuBois said she was surprised to see huge levels of interest from prospective buyers interstate while she was house-hunting. ""A lot of the open inspections, you had people going around on FaceTime or Zoom or whatever with their phones just showing someone on the other end of the line into all the rooms,"" she said. ""That was really common, which made us think there were a lot of really brave people putting offers on things without ever seeing them.""

112,'It's not just hippy': Welcome to the house made from hemp,house-and-home,"  Hemp houses low-impact, fireproof, termite-proof and cost-effective, says couple When  Alexia Jankowski and her partner Ben Whitaker decided to build a low-impact house in the hills, they turned to hemp — and say they hope one day their ""very alternative building product"" will be seen as mainstream. They hope building with hemp will become cheaper as more builders use it The Western Australian couple hand built the three-bedroom home on a five-acre bush block in Kronkup, 30 kilometres west of Albany. They say hemp, a plant product, has been used in numerous countries as a building material for thousands of years but it is relatively uncommon in Australia. Ms Jankowski, an environmental scientist, said their goal was to build a house that was as low impact on the environment as possible. ""[Hemp] is an amazing insulator, it's fireproof, termite-proof and it also absorbs water vapour, so you don't get mould or dampness building up in your house,"" she said. ""Over the life of a building, it actually gets stronger. It feels like it turns into stone."" The couple's home is also solar passive, with its windows, walls and floors designed to collect, store, reflect and distribute solar energy in the form of heat during winter months and deflect heat in summer. Most of the couple's hemp came from leftovers at the Denmark DecoVillage community housing project. The hemp was mixed with lime and water to form hempcrete blocks, which were then used to make the walls of the house. Margaret River builder Brendan Kelly put down the slab and erected the timber frame, the hemp walls and the roof. Ms Jankowski and Mr Whitaker did the rest. ""When it was the middle of winter, camping in the cold and compacting sand for the fifth week in a row, we definitely questioned whether it was worth it,"" Ms Jankowski said. ""But standing here now, enjoying the views and seeing everything we designed and imagined coming to fruition, it was definitely worth it."" For a building constructed from natural materials, the hemp house is surprisingly minimalist and modern in design. A polished concrete floor is adorned with rainbow stones, shells and even sperm whale teeth to add unique character. The internal walls have been left as exposed hemp, featuring cross sections of marri tree limbs. ""People might think of hemp as a very alternative building product, but it doesn't have to be like that,"" Ms Jankowski said. ""It can be a budget-friendly choice to have a house that is really modern looking ... It's not just hippy."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Great Southern's weekly email newsletter. Ms Jankowski said the total cost of the build was about $300,000, which put it in the ballpark of conventional building products like double brick. However, she acknowledged they had reduced the cost by building much of the home themselves. ""If anyone is exploring the idea of using an alternative building product they should definitely look into it [hemp],"" she said. ""There are a lot of builders exploring doing hemp in panels that can speed up the process and make the labour less intensive. ""Every year there's more people building hemp houses and I'm sure it will only get cheaper and more accessible.""

113,It's official – Australians really are fleeing big cities during COVID. But will the sea changers stay?,house-and-home,"  ABS data confirms a city exodus during COVID, with biggest internal migration loss on record It's official. Australia's capital cities really have been losing people in record numbers during COVID. But will tree changers stay put in the country, or flock back to the big smoke? Provisional internal migration data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows the nation's capital cities had a net loss of 11,200 people during July, August and September last year. That was the largest quarterly net loss since records began in 2001. Internal migration is the movement of people across a specified boundary within Australia involving a change in their place of usual residence. This can be within a state or territory, or even within a city. The ABS said the net loss in the September quarter was the result of both fewer arrivals into capital cities (-10.6pc) and more departures from big centres to non-capital city areas (+1.2pc). The September quarter coincided with the months after Australia's first hard COVID lockdown, when some city dwellers were starting to pack up for the country and real estate agents began reporting a rise in demand for homes in regional Australia. It also coincided with the start of Melbourne's second extended lockdown, when borders were closed to Victoria. Sydney experienced the biggest loss of people during the September quarter, however, the data shows this trend had been happening to some extent even before the pandemic. Meanwhile, the exodus from Melbourne increased by a factor of eight compared to the pre-lockdown period. Some capital cities did make gains, however. Brisbane and Perth saw an increase in internal migrations, while Hobart, Perth, Darwin and Adelaide were relatively steady. In net terms, NSW gained the most people from Victoria, and lost most to Queensland. Locked down with closed borders for much of that period, Victoria in net terms did not gain people from any state or territory during the September quarter, with the largest proportion of those leaving choosing to head north to Queensland. And after years of losing people at the end of its gas boom, Darwin saw its first net gain from internal migration since 2015. After enduring one lockdown, Ellie Bonnett left Melbourne for regional Victoria in August 2020. Her job in human resources had gone from a Melbourne-based office to permanently working from home, which allowed her to relocate to Daylesford and buy a home for the first time. As well as allowing her to live a quieter lifestyle, the move also allowed her to buy a bigger property than she would have ever dreamed of purchasing in Melbourne. ""I wanted to embrace the situation we're in with COVID and move to Daylesford,"" she said. Ms Bonnett said she had embraced the small and ""welcoming"" town, despite the difficulties of making friends in regional Victoria at a time when the pandemic was still ongoing and social events were limited. ""I ended up meeting my neighbours via video conferencing,"" she said. Ms Bonnett said she had an element of ""FOMO"" when Melbourne started to open back up again, but that she did not regret her move. She has so embraced the remote-working lifestyle, that she is now set to rent out her Daylesford property, and hit the road in a caravan to travel Australia while working on her laptop. ""I expect to spend a lot of my time in Byron,"" she said. ""If I could be in all the places at once, I'd be in Daylesford and on the road. I have no regrets buying there. I'm so proud of the community. ""But I now see a lot of value of being on the road and trying to surf as much as possible. Being free to move with the COVID landscape."" Ms Bonnett does not see herself moving back to a big city any time soon. But she said she would be keeping her options open. Daylesford house prices were already rising when Ms Bonnett moved to the town. As the pandemic drags on, data by CoreLogic is now showing that house prices in regional Australia are overall rising at a much faster rate than capital cities. Regional areas recorded an average 1.6 per cent increase last month, and were up 7.9 per cent over the year, while the combined capitals rose only 1.7 per cent over the past year. As well as a desire for a working-from-home sea change, the cost of housing in Sydney and Melbourne is potentially also a factor behind why people are leaving the big cities for the regions. The last noticeable wave of regional migration was back in 2017-2018, when property prices were hitting new peaks in both cities. Coastal regions have been in particularly hot demand during Australia's COVID summer, with this even creating precarious situations for renters, as some markets experience housing shortages. If price trends continue, it could become less affordable for people to contemplate a regional migration. CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless, said the divergence between metro and regional housing demand in NSW and Victoria was more substantial than in other states. ""Internal migration data shows more people are leaving Sydney and Melbourne for regional areas, resulting in a transition of activity from the metro regions to the outer fringe and regional markets,"" he said. ""This demographic trend is further compounded by the demand shock of stalled overseas migration. ""As Melbourne and Sydney historically receive the vast majority of overseas migrants, these metro areas have been the hardest hit by this demand shock."" ANU demographer, Liz Allen, expects the trend to be ""short lived"". ""Sydney and Melbourne have experienced the greatest [COVID lockdowns] and necessary behavioural change, so it's not at all surprisingly that people have been moving out and away from these restrictions and into other areas,"" she said. ""The trend we're seeing at present is the result of others not moving into the areas where people have left, which would ordinarily happen. ""I expect this trend of net excess movements away from capital cities will be short lived."" She believed this was because some people may migrate to the regions and then realise ""the infrastructure is woefully inadequate"" in some places compared to big cities. ""Queensland has been an attractive place to move to from elsewhere within Australia, even before COVID,"" she said. ""The thought of suffering through a lockdown compared with popping down to the beach for a quick dip is very alluring. But the novelty wears off when the realities of distance and geographic inequalities kick in."" She also believed the trend could be stymied as employers start asking their workers to come back into the office. Some major corporates are starting to ask workers to come back on a part-time basis. In Victoria, after its hard second lockdown, the State Government has just announced workforce capacity can return to 75 per cent. ""With a greater push for workers to return to physical offices, the opportunities for living in regional areas will be constrained,"" Ms Allen said.

116,Bricklayer shortage means it could take longer to take advantage of HomeBuilder,house-and-home,"  Bricklayer shortage could blow out timelines for housing, taking advantage of HomeBuilder A shortage of bricklayers is expected to blow out construction times for thousands of West Australians who have signed up to build new homes. Over the next year, 20,000 houses are expected to be built in the state as thousands of Australians take advantage of state and federal home-building grants. It has prompted concern there will not be enough tradespeople to fill jobs in wet trades like bricklayers and plasterers, which have long struggled to attract workers. Stan Liaros, head of the Apprentice and Traineeship Company, said despite government subsidies and incentives, finding young bricklayers had been a problem for years. ""It's not one of the sexiest trades. You are out there in the elements, the hot sun,"" he said. Mr Liaros said it took much longer to find apprentices in wet trades and sometimes he could not find people at all. ""If you had 20 applicants, one might be interested in wet trades."" With WA experiencing a construction boom, Mr Liaros said he was concerned the situation could get worse. ""People in the industry are concerned about, as we ramp up and there's more and more activity, who's going to be building those houses? ""I would say by the middle of this year, we would be talking about skills shortages."" Bunbury bricklayer Jason Gobby has been looking for an apprentice for two years but said many young people had turned their back on the trade. ""Occasionally I'll get someone show up but, you know, they either don't show up the next day or say look this isn't for me,"" he said. ""I think the mines have got a lot to do with it. We can't compete with what boys get paid on the mines."" Mr Gobby said with so many housing and commercial projects underway, bricklayers were already run off their feet. ""Last Friday I turned three builders down. Monday I had to ring another one up and say I couldn't get to his job,"" he said. The WA Master Builders Association is predicting 20,000 homes will start being built in Western Australia over the next year, up significantly from last year. The Federal Government has unveiled its HomeBuilder package, offering $25,000 for people to upgrade or build their homes — but access to the scheme's free money won't come cheap. ""Building approvals have really skyrocketed on the back of the Federal Government's home building program and the State Government's building bonus,"" executive director John Gelavis said.

117,Bob Hawke's childhood home to be converted into visitor accommodation,house-and-home,"  Bob Hawke's childhood home in Bordertown to take in guests for overnight stays The childhood home of late former prime minister Bob Hawke will be turned into tourist accommodation for visitors to the regional South Australian town of Bordertown. Hawke House is presently being used as office space for community organisations. The Tatiara District Council has endorsed a business case that would shift its use to tourist accommodation. Chief executive officer Anne Champness said there were essentially three primary reasons for the council's decision. ""One, we wanted to maintain that heritage asset, make sure that it's retained and is available to be accessed by the public,"" she said. ""Two, that we really didn't want its ongoing operation to come at a massive cost to ratepayers. It needed to be able to carry itself. ""(And) that it was used, and that it was used a lot and didn't end up being a dusty little museum that sees maybe 1,000 visitors a year."" Ms Champness said the council, under the direction of consultants, had looked at the many use options for prime ministerial houses. One option had been to run Hawke House as a museum, but it came with an approximate price tag of $10,000 to staff. As prime minister for almost nine years, Bob Hawke brought in major economic and environmental reforms that endure to this day. ""We really didn't want to see the financial burden fall back on the council and ratepayers,"" Ms Champness said. ""So we're looking for something that's used and that can carry itself."" ""In the end, the short or longer-term accommodation, or the residential option, was really the one that worked best."" The region faces an ongoing accommodation shortage for short-term workers, but Ms Champess said the change was not made with worker housing in mind. ""This is really probably more looking at the visitor market rather than the worker market,"" she said. ""What council really liked about the proposal that came back was that the option to run it as a B&B also allowed for it to be accessed by the public at times it isn't booked. ""Or [the public could] use it for other purposes on a more flexible basis than if it was permanent office accommodation, or booked really long term by somebody as a residential home."" Ms Champness said she thought the community would be pleased by the decision. ""I think it's quite a positive project if we can retain that heritage asset, but not at a significant cost,"" she said. ""So I think that, to me, is a really positive way forward with this project.""

118,Court finds 17-bedroom house with water meters for each room not just a family home,house-and-home,"  Court finds house with 17 bedrooms and bathrooms not a family home and orders changes The owner of a 17-bedroom waterfront mansion on the Sunshine Coast, which was operating as an illegal boarding house, has been ordered to make structural changes after failing to convince a judge that it was just another family home. The three-storey building on Birtinya has en suites for every bedroom, kitchens on each floor, plus power and water meters for each room. There are no bathrooms in shared areas, no master bedroom, and multiple laundries. Rooms in the building were rented out for $220 a week for more than 12 months to March last year. If fully occupied, it would amount to almost $15,000 a month in income. Michael Ivan Gavin's operation of the house breached the Sunshine Coast Regional Council's planning rules and landed him in the Planning and Environment Court. Judge Glen Cash ordered Mr Gavin to make changes to his property to make it harder to operate as accommodation in a residential area. The required changes included the removal of certain doors, sinks and kitchen sites, but the ruling stopped short of demolishing parts of the house — a request put to the court by council. In the ruling handed down in late December, Judge Cash found Mr Gavin was warned first by a private certifier, then by council officers, that the house must be used as a home, not paid accommodation. Councillor Peter Cox said he was pleased with the decision and that the house ""did not comply with the local area plan"". ""Bringing the amenity back to the neighbouring residents was the result council was pursuing,"" Cr Cox said. Judge Cash described how Mr Gavin misled authorities with two different building plans — one reflected the true nature of the project, while the other was designed to deceive council officers. When building began in early 2018, it took just weeks for a council officer to raise concerns during an inspection, only to be told by Mr Gavin that it was a home and nothing more. Mr Gavin moved into the house with his family for about two months in late 2018, before attempting to rent out the rooms individually as ""private rooms"" or ""one-bedroom apartments"". One neighbour told the court there were about 15 people living in the building, causing parking havoc on the suburban street. Judge Cash said Mr Gavin ""was not an impressive witness"" when questioned by the court over the property. ""He was garrulous, unresponsive and, at times, mendacious,"" Judge Cash wrote. ""I do not accept his evidence that he did not set out to use the house as an accommodation building."" The Sunshine Coast Regional Council wanted the court to order the demolition of eight of the 17 bathrooms and for officers be able to inspect the site at any time with 24 hours' notice. The council said it wanted to ensure such a misuse of the property was not allowed to happen again. The court rejected both requests. However, Judge Cash warned any attempt to undo or disobey the changes could cost the owner — whether Mr Gavin or a future buyer — more than $600,000 in fines or two years' prison. The ABC has tried contacting the homeowner for a response to the ruling. The Birtinya house, now with 16 bedrooms and 16 bathrooms, has been listed online to rent, as a whole, for $1,250 a week.

119,'Pooping machine' pigeons wreak foul havoc for solar panel owners,house-and-home,"  Pooping pigeons prove problematic for properties with solar panels Pigeons are known for their ability to find their way home, but the numbers taking up residence underneath solar panels are causing a headache for property owners. Ivan Cindric, who runs a company that cleans and pigeon-proofs solar panels across Brisbane, says the opportunistic birds are flocking to the suburbs to breed. ""Seven years ago we pigeon-proofed three properties over the course of a year and now we service two to six homes every single day,"" Mr Cindric told ABC Radio Brisbane. ""That gap between the solar panels and the roof is a perfect habitat for them. ""They go in there, they build their nest and they're safe from any predators. ""Once they start building their nests, they won't stop because, as you can imagine, they're breeding."" Mr Cindric said pigeons were not the most house-proud tenants and the mess they left could attract mice and cockroaches. ""The amount of mess they make on the solar panels and on your roof is absolutely … disgusting,"" he said. ""Everyone has solar panels because they want save money, but you can imagine with all those pigeons pooping all over the panels, they become quite inefficient. ""The poop doesn't stop, because they are a phenomenal pooping machines."" The birds' faeces can clog gutters and create an environment for plants to grow. ""We've been to many houses where literally the gutters were overflowing with pigeon poop,"" Mr Cindric said. ""Pigeons themselves are also disease carriers — they carry a lot of lice."" Mr Cindric cautioned those looking for a DIY solution against climbing up on the roof with some chicken wire and a screwdriver. ""If you screw something into your panels you've actually voided the warranty,"" he said. He also recommended using specially designed clips and mesh with large enough openings to prevent the panels from overheating. ""The hotter the panel gets, the less efficient they are,"" he said. RSPCA spokesperson Michael Beatty said while there were a number of native pigeons, including the crested pigeon, the common grey pigeon was considered a pest. ""They are an introduced European species and legally they have to be put to sleep,"" Mr Beatty said. ""We can't put them back into the wild because they are taking resources from native birds."" The choice of home seems to be exclusive to the introduced bird — Mr Cindric said he had never seen native pigeons build nests under the solar panels.

120,Carly's lease on the Surf Coast is up. She can't find another rental as supply hits record lows,house-and-home,"  Rental vacancy rates hit zero in Australian coastal towns as they hit COVID capacity The pandemic has brought on a property boom for surf towns as cashed-up city dwellers make a sea change. But while that is great for homeowners selling at high prices, it has created a nightmare for some renters. Data supplied to ABC News by CoreLogic shows just how slim the availability of rental homes has become in several key coastal regions, including Byron Bay, Newcastle and the Gold Coast. Demand has risen so far beyond supply that there is almost nothing sitting empty for potential renters. Victoria's Surf Coast is the most impacted and has an official rental vacancy rate of zero. The strip of coast an hour from Melbourne includes popular surf towns Torquay, Jan Juc and Anglesea. Its rental market is always tight during the summer months as people flock to the beach. But local real estate agent Simon Bogdanov said in the last four months there had been a ""staggering increase in property demand"" from Melbourne residents making a COVID sea change. ""The incoming enquiry level and applications from prospective tenants wanting to make the sea change has been overwhelming at times for our rental team,"" Mr Bogdanov said. ""Rentals are being snapped up in a matter of hours from being advertised. ""There is a 0 per cent vacancy rate. The last time this happened was over 30 years ago."" Another local real estate agent, Kellie Papworth, told ABC News that another factor putting pressure on vacancy rates was that some people who normally leased out their homes over summer were not doing this during the pandemic. ""Residents were also not taking risks to buy investments or upsize or move around, therefore creating fewer leasing opportunities,"" Ms Papworth said. ""We also saw a lot of tenants' employment affected by inability to travel internationally and ski fields being closed, resulting in those tenants needing to find alternate accommodation quickly."" It's not just the rental market that's getting more competitive. CoreLogic data shows Surf Coast houses sold for almost 6 per cent more on average in December 2020 than they did one year earlier in December 2019. That has officially pushed the region's average house price over the $1 million mark. The situation is, of course, great for landlords who can rent out their homes easily and sell houses at high prices. But it has also created a situation where some renters are giving up hope. Young student Carly Davies grew up on the Surf Coast and has been living in a share house in Torquay. The owner of the property sold it a few months ago during the COVID boom and now its new owners are moving in, meaning that Ms Davies and her flatmates have to move out. ""We have been looking for new houses in the Torquay region for three months. Then we branched out into (the nearby regional city) Geelong and it's still not looking good,"" Ms Davies said. ""We have been inspecting three to four houses a weekend for months and applying for most. ""Every time we go to an inspection now we say: don't get your hopes up, it's too good to be true. ""A lot of (real estate agents) are saying that share houses aren't suitable for the property and that they'd prefer families."" Their lease ends this month and now they are packing up with nowhere to go. ""We're just going to have to couch surf until something comes up. ""It's a bit scary. I've lived here all my life."" Surf Coast removalist Dean Attard has also been witness to the surge in demand from Melbourne buyers and the resulting flow-on effect to renters. ""We had one woman (on the Coast) who'd been there 15 years and the owner put it on the market and it sold within one day,"" he said. ""Then the new owners doubled the rent. ""And this poor lady who lived there by herself had to move to near Melbourne as she couldn't find anything locally. ""It was actually quite sad."" Serena Leitmanis and her partner also both grew up on the Surf Coast and love its relaxed coastal lifestyle. They moved to the regional city of Geelong, a 30-minute drive away, a few years ago to chase their careers but had always planned to move back near family and have a child enrolled at a school on the Surf Coast. When they started looking at rentals midway through 2020, they quickly realised the rental market had escalated to new heights. ""Five years ago we were living in Jan Juc paying $270 [a week] for a house. Now we're lucky to get a non-renovated bedroom for $500 [a week],"" she said. ""We've just stopped applying at this point because it's become too expensive. ""It's so competitive now. ""It's really utterly disheartening and we can't get home. It's breaking my heart."" Another locally born-and-bred single mother, who didn't want to be identified, told ABC News she had to move back in with her parents in Jan Juc after her Surf Coast rental lease ended and she could not find another one. ""It's always hard to find a house here but this is worse,"" she said. ""I'm not even bothering to look because there's just nothing. I don't have a huge budget and prices are increasing."" Another local single father whose Surf Coast lease ended just before Christmas told ABC News he had to move into a caravan on his friend's property because he could not find a new rental. ""Locals like myself are being forced into temporary emergency accommodation like my caravan situation,"" he said. ""I just don't feel very safe and secure and it's starting to take a toll on my physical and mental health. ""It's just totally unfair."" Some renters are frustrated after having homes that they were living in sold over summer to sea changers, putting them in a precarious position. Some long-term locals are angry and feel they are not being prioritised for rentals. Others worry that the relaxed nature of the region will be lost forever if locals are priced out of the region by sea changers. ""I now call it Toorak by the sea,"" one local said. Ms Leitmanis compared the situation to when Byron Bay boomed and all the long-term locals moved inland into the more affordable Hinterland. ""The culture will change and that's a real shame,"" she said. But nobody technically owns a lifestyle, as much as locals would like to. And if sea changers have the money to buy in to the Surf Coast, then the sky is the limit. However, some are not in a position to do this and the rental squeeze is seeing some people from out of the region go into precarious arrangements too. After enduring Victoria's two lockdowns, Jane Macdonald and her partner are so keen to leave Melbourne for the Surf Coast, they are taking a chance with a two-month lease. ""We've been excited to move to the Surf Coast, but since October we've watched rental availability dry up,"" Ms Macdonald said. ""At times it's felt quite hopeless. ""Networking with the local community helped us find a short-term lease with a private landlord. People have been really lovely. ""Fingers crossed we land a rental long-term!"" Speaking to the ABC earlier this week, CoreLogic analyst Tim Lawless said the substantial rise in property prices in regional Australia during the pandemic could see many town's affordability decline. At least on Victoria's Surf Coast, that issue is already leading to heated debate.

121,Jolt for Perth property market with house prices tipped to surge 10 per cent,house-and-home,"  Real estate market heats up in Perth with forecast 10 per cent jump in median house price Perth's property market is on the rise as reduced travel increases buyer activity, with expectations the median house price could grow by as much as 10 per cent during 2021. According to data from the Real Estate Institute of Western Australia (REIWA), December 2020 saw a jump of 42.5 per cent in house sales compared to December 2019. REIWA president Damian Collins said reduced travel during December had allowed people to benefit from the favourable real estate market. ""Traditionally December experiences a reduction in the number of house sales due to buyers going away for the festive period,"" he said. ""Yet this year we have seen a significant increase in buyer activity, which suggests that people are taking advantage of the market conditions whilst they are unable to travel."" Perth's average house price remained stable in December, sitting at $480,000, while REIWA data showed 45 per cent of suburbs saw an increase in property value during the month. Kelmscott saw the largest increase in its median sales price during December, jumping 6.2 per cent to $375,000. Yokine followed with a 4.8 per cent increase to a median price of $650,000 house price average, while the median price in Wellard rose 4 per cent to $399,500. ""With listings for sale decreasing 16.5 per cent in December, it is only a matter of time before median prices start to increase,"" Mr Collins said. Ray White chief executive Mark Whiteman said both buyers and sellers could take advantage of the current market. ""At the moment, to buy a property, you would be paying interest rates that have never been this low before,"" he said. ""Buyers have nearly every condition they need to buy — low rates, good prices, affordability of the established property market is very good. ""The only thing forcing them to make the decisions is if they don't buy the property, it may well be gone. ""That's the only thing making the purchase market difficult, is there is not the same amount of supply coming through."" Mr Whiteman said the balance of power was starting to shift. ""We are seeing increased buyer demand, fewer properties available for them to choose from, and that's really starting to throw the balance of power towards the seller,"" he said. ""We are seeing record numbers of bidders at auctions which is a great litmus test for who is willing to buy. ""We have had five years of a poor market, so the sellers deserve to have a win."" Mr Collins said Perth remained very favourable for investors, and he expected Perth's median house price to rise by between 6 and 10 per cent during 2021. ""I would advise those who are thinking of about purchasing their first home, trading up or investing, to act soon before prices inevitably rise,"" he said. Mr Whiteman said the Perth market had shaped into an investor's dream. ""Investors are having a look and realising it's a cheap price to buy out, the interest rates are low, and there is every chance [they're] going to get a tenant willing to pay a higher rent,"" he said. ""Investors were reluctant to enter the declining market in the past five years. But we now have a rising market, we have full occupancy and investors will start to come back and create more stock for tenants."" There were 3,655 properties leased in Perth's rental market in December, a 9 per cent increase on the previous month. Mr Collins said it was pleasing to see the rental market pick up in a time when activity traditionally slowed down. ""As we see the rental stock levels continue to remain low, we can expect rents to continue increasing, however we need to remember that rents are still a lot cheaper than they were in 2014,"" he said. Mr Whiteman said government stimulus measures were expected to create some relief in the next few years. ""We continue to see the decline in the amount of property on the market, but consider the fact the big property players are beginning to put more supply in place,"" he said. ""The stimulus that drove the new home construction, which saw our local building industry swamped by inquiry to the point they couldn't build anymore than what they could sign up.""

122,House price boom as demand outstrips supply in Tasmanian regional towns,house-and-home,"  House price boom as demand outstrips supply in Tasmanian regional towns Moving to Tasmania has been a decades-long dream for Ardione McLachlan. She first expressed her desire to move to the island state when she was 16, but finally took the plunge last month — some 37 years later. Ms McLachlan's family had lived on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland for years, but now she, her husband and teenage daughter call the north-west Tasmanian town of Penguin home. ""I love the cool over being really hot all the time, but also it's really relaxed,"" she said. ""Even when we were living out west, it still had that real urgency about it; everyone was in a hurry to do things and it just doesn't seem so hurried down here."" Diane Reed made the move to Tasmania from Victoria two years ago, and now runs a popular Facebook group dedicated to helping those who want to follow suit. She said membership to the group has been ""pretty steady"" since it first started, with the majority choosing to move for a better lifestyle. ""It definitely hasn't slowed down or stopped because of COVID in the last year; people are still moving here and happy to make Tassie their home,"" she said. Ms Reed said she wasn't surprised to see rising house prices in the state, especially in regional areas. ""It's bound to happen with more people moving here, the prices will rise slightly,"" she said. ""It's still cheaper than most places on the mainland but (that's) not always the case."" There had been growing speculation about people making the move to Tasmania from interstate, with anecdotal evidence now backed by CoreLogic data. Their latest figures show dwelling values in regional Tasmania have increased by 11.9 per cent — the strongest regional housing market performance in the country. CoreLogic head of research Eliza Owen said the biggest driving force behind the strong regional performance was the declining affordability of the Hobart housing market. ""It seems that that demand is really spilling over from Hobart into Launceston, the south-east and the west of Tasmania,"" she said. ""Really, every regional sub market within Tasmania has grown by double digits in the market values. ""But certainly 2020 has really shown a preference for regional lifestyle markets that offer a tree change or a sea change, so there could be a lot of interstate demands driving that as well."" It isn't only those people moving from interstate that are behind the regional price increase, according to the Real Estate Institute of Tasmania. ""Our last stats that came through showed that 90 per cent of those were Tasmanian, so there was a big drive for Tasmanians coming out of the built-up areas into the regional areas,"" said the group's president, Mandy Welling. ""People are realising that they don't need to be in the built-up areas in order to be able to work. ""They can actually work from home, so they tend to go towards the regional areas, which gives them a bit more space with their families."" Ms Welling said the rising prices in regional areas could also be a double-edged sword. ""For the people who already live in those regional areas and want to sell their property, they then need to purchase, so the property prices have increased on the other side of that transaction for them,"" she said. Although selling her new home isn't on the horizon for Ms McLachlan, she was told her house had already appreciated in price before arriving in the state. ""When we got here our real estate said 'look, I could put your house up for sale now and you'd make a huge profit already, and you've only just got here',"" she said. ""It did surprise us that it jumped so quickly, but I'm not surprised that anyone wants to come and live here. ""It's so worth it.""

123,"When Matt came to Australia to live the 'van life', things didn't go to plan",house-and-home,"  As a stand-up comedian, Matt Watson is well-versed in the art of the joke. But as he arrived in Australia from Canada for the trip of a lifetime — only for the nation to shut its borders, rendering travel all but impossible — you'd be forgiven for thinking he'd become the punchline. ""My goal of coming to Australia was to tour all over, but my home base was going to be Melbourne,"" he laughs. ""Turns out I picked the worst state to isolate in."" Watson is part of the nation's burgeoning ""van life"" community — a social movement of travellers, shirking their reliance on houses and hotels for life on the road. Taking root in the 1960s, the lifestyle once consigned to hippies and vagabonds is now an industry in and of itself, made up of those looking to invest in their own rolling home, or travellers simply seeking a new way to holiday. And with the pandemic abruptly changing how we work, alongside an increased push to holiday at home, there's been a renewed interest in the ""van life"". ""Because you can't travel overseas, we're seeing more and more people decking out their vehicle with at least a bed to just go camping,"" says Jonny Dustow, co-founder of Vanlife Diaries. For Watson, the decision to buy a van upon arriving in Australia was a no-brainer. He'd conquered his first foray into the ""van life"" during a sojourn in Europe some two years prior, and with comedy gigs lined up across the country, the idea of paying rent for a home he'd hardly be in was a tough pill to swallow. But as borders closed, recommendations turned to restrictions and he began receiving ""concerned calls"" from his family back home in North America, he admits he began to question whether he could really ride out the pandemic (quite literally) in a van. A chance encounter with his now-girlfriend, Jasmine, a fellow artist who had invited him to park outside her home in Mornington, Victoria, was the clincher in his decision to stay, he says. ""I figured being I had Jasmine as a safety net with a home in Mornington, if things got too crazy, I would have a wonderful person to lean on,"" he says. ""And that in fact was the case, I wouldn't have been able to get through it without her."" For those on the road, these sorts of unexpected challenges (albeit, a global pandemic probably wasn't on too many people's bingo list) are all part and parcel of the experience — and a valuable learning curve. Just ask Dustow, who first dipped his toes into the van life movement some nine years ago. After deciding he wanted to spend ""more time on the road"", the travelling musician sold his property and bought a van (""It was the easiest way for us to travel and not worry about booking accommodation and being able to explore towns along the way between playing gigs,"" he remarks). But while ""getting away from the stress of a mortgage and rent felt amazing"", it all came crashing down when he accidentally wrote off his vehicle. ""I didn't get insurance for it and now I didn't have a home and didn't have my rolling home and had to move back with family and save up again for another van,"" he says. ""The best of both worlds is actually having a base, whether it's somewhere in a town if it's a house that you own or a shed on a farm or something, and then road tripping."" For Megan and Grant Harrison, their van — known affectionately as Pamela Van-derson — has become a home away from home. While the shift workers are the first to admit they've never been big on camping, their foray into the lifestyle came naturally — if not unintentionally — early last year. ""It actually wasn't originally supposed to be van life. It was more [that] we noticed around our hometown... vans hanging around the beach,"" offers Megan, who is parked with Grant on the side of the road, en route to the couple's latest holiday. ""And I said to Grant, if we could get a van then you'd have a surf van."" Before they knew it, the plan evolved, and the couple found themselves ""travelling and just trying something different"", adds Grant. But while the pair ""fell in love"" with the lifestyle, it would be remiss to suggest it's been all smoothing sailing (or driving). Their first trip away was a ""baptism of fire"", and while they've picked up a few tricks along the way, it has been a steep, and at times expensive, learning curve. ""We came across this injured goat, it'd been hit by a car and basically left on the side of the road to die,"" says Megan, who pauses before chuckling: ""So Grant took it upon himself to deal with the situation. ""He ended up in hospital for two days getting surgery because he hurt himself in the process."" Despite the challenges, for every pitfall, the couple can list off 10 drawcards. And for Megan, having the opportunity to experience the wonders of Australia first-hand has proven perhaps the most rewarding. ""To be honest, to begin with we were very narrow-minded about it, we didn't think we'd ever want to explore Australia until we were old,"" she says. ""You think, oh you go overseas and explore all of those countries first, but we've just been blown away by what we've found."" Though you'll encounter varying schools of thought about almost every facet of ""van life"", if there's one thing those who have done it can all agree on, it's the need to invest in a reliable vehicle. Because the ""lifestyle has become quite popular"", Dustow notes, vans have become ""a bit more expensive"". But while Megan and Grant admit they shelled out more than they had intended to, they say it was difficult to put a price on peace of mind. ""We didn't want to be stuck and caught somewhere that we're going to have no phone service and no way of getting in and out,"" says Grant. ""We wanted a van that was trustworthy."" It's a sentiment echoed by Watson, who recalls picking up his first van in the United Kingdom for a steal — only for it to break down within the first six months. ""It broke down in Edinburgh, which is such a beautiful city,"" he laughs. ""So I continued to live out of it for another year and a half just in this parking lot. ""But a little bit of more money up front might save you a headache in the long run."" If there's one thing Dustow has learnt from almost a decade on the road, it's that there's no shame in taking it slow. It's important to ""work your way into it"", he says, and get a feel for the vehicle before you purchase. ""I think the best way is if you can just trial it, like even rent a van, take a mate's van for a few nights — there's heaps of people with vans who actually rent it out for the weekend,"" he says. ""Try it for a couple of weekends, and then you can work out what size you want."" Above all, the group notes, is that the lifestyle — and people's experience with it — is ultimately defined by their own attitudes. Despite taking due diligence in buying a vehicle and investing in the necessities for life on the road, Megan and Grant have encountered their fair share of problems along the way. But having a ""good travel partner"", Grant says, makes the challenges pale in significance. ""Most of the time we were bloody laughing, and the whole time we never took anything seriously,"" he laughs. ""If you're travelling with your best mate, that just makes everything so much better."" If you go into the experience expecting things to go wrong, adds Megan, ""that's when they do"". ""Like when Grant ended up in hospital for two days and we lost two days of travel, neither of us were cranky about it,"" she says. ""We just laughed at the situation, that's how you have to approach the whole thing."" For Watson, the experience ""wasn't at all what I planned it to be"". Instead, he says, it ""exceeded my wildest expectations"". ""It turns out I picked the worst state to be isolated in... but I fell in love with with Jasmine,"" he offers. ""If I'd have parked anywhere else, I could have been out and traveling so much sooner. But I would have missed out on on on the wonderful human being that is in my life now.""

124,Australia's housing market suburbs with the biggest growth in 2020,house-and-home,"  Several of Sydney's eastern suburbs recorded the highest median housing values, according to CoreLogic data, which says Australia's $7.2 trillion residential real estate market has proved ""remarkably resilient"" despite the nation's largest economic downturn since the 1930's. CoreLogic's Best of the Best 2020 Report shows while the coronavirus pandemic dented house prices earlier in the year, they have ended 2020 higher and predictions are they will continue to rise into the new year. In terms of capital cities data, Sydney's eastern suburbs are still showing the highest median values, starting with Darling Point ($7.06 million) followed by Bellevue Hill ($5.72 million), Vaucluse ($5.39 million) and Double Bay ($4.76 million). But Adelaide North recorded the lowest median home values over the year. Elizabeth North's median value was $176,386, followed by Elizabeth South ($188,116), Davoren Park ($194,903) and Elizabeth Downs ($195,511). The highest median unit value was recorded in Point Piper ($2.28million), while the lowest was in Queensland's Kooralbyn ($164,543). The data also breaks down the highest total sales for the year, as well as the median home values for Australia including cities outside the main capitals. On those metrics, a property in Sydney's Point Piper recorded the highest sale in April at $51 million. And in terms of the median across Australia (including cities outside the main capitals) while Darling Point had the highest home value median, Sunshine Beach on the Sunshine Coast had the highest annual capital growth in houses nationally. In terms of units, while Point Piper had the highest median value, Horsham in Victoria's north-west had the highest annual capital growth. CoreLogic's head of research Eliza Owen said the luxury market was impacted during the pandemic, but saw a rapid recovery in the wake of lower interest rates and an improvement in consumer sentiment. Reserve Bank Governor Phillip Lowe has previously said the cash rate is unlikely to drop to zero, but that rates are likely to remain low for about three years. A 40 per cent fall in Australian house prices is an ""extreme but plausible""' scenario, the RBA says. For the time being, the central bank has left the cash rate at a record-low rate of 0.1 per cent. Ms Owen said the market would hold up next year thanks to record-low mortgage rates, the deferment of mortgage repayments for households impacted by COVID-19 and support for low income households, as well as grants and concessions for owner-occupier purchases. While the initial shock of COVID-19 led to a 2.1 per cent decline in national property values between April and September, Australian housing values were 1.1 per cent higher over the year to November. ""Institutional interventions will continue to shape the profile of property buyers, particularly as HomeBuilder is extended at a reduced rate into the first quarter of 2021,"" Ms Owen said. The Housing Industry Association (HIA) New Home Sales report for November 2020 showed new home sales rose by 15.2 per over the month to set a new decade high. New home sales in the three months to November were 41.1 per cent higher than the same time last year. CoreLogic's report also showed the pandemic had hurt unit prices, but they were also recovering. ""In the suburb of Melbourne, for example, unit values declined 3.4 per cent between the onset of the pandemic in March, and the end of September,"" Ms Owen said. Real estate agents say COVID-19 has sparked a new wave of enquiries from Australians interested in moving from capital cities to regional areas. ""The total value of sales is down 3.9 per cent in the year to September 2020 compared with the year to 2019."" But the suburb of Melbourne has gone from having the sixth highest total sales value in 2019, to claim the number one spot in 2020. There's also been some evidence of Australians fleeing capital cities in the wake of the COVID crisis, in search of a sea-change or tree change. With the exception of the highest median value suburbs, the report showed regional areas across the country performed well. Sunshine Beach on the Sunshine Coast had seen the highest annual capital growth in houses nationally, compared with 2019 when St Kilda in Melbourne saw the highest housing growth. The report showed disparate rental market performance, with Greater Melbourne unit rents falling 7 per cent in the year to November 2020. Inner city rental markets of Sydney and Melbourne also fell to a lesser extent. The evidence is clear: women have been hit hardest by the COVID-19 recession, with the lowest paid and most insecure workers bearing the brunt of the downturn. Brisbane property had benefited from historically high demand from overseas migrants, but the closure of international borders has hurt the city. But Ms Owen said there was a different dynamic in rental markets across Perth, Darwin, and other mining-related markets. ""Following the long withdrawal of investor demand and several years of low new supply additions, [those] rental markets are tightening,"" she said. ""Across the suburb of South Headland, which holds the position of highest rental yields for units across the country, rents have increased significantly over the year following a long correction post mining-boom. ""This is also reflected in the WA capital, where Perth rent values have increased a remarkable 8.2 per cent across dwellings over the year."" Looking ahead to 2021, Ms Owen said record low interest rates would help keep property values high. But it could take years before employment and wages recover. The recession may technically be ending but it will take much longer for Australia's economy to get back to where it was before the pandemic, as wages stagnate, unemployment remains high and cuts to Government subsidies loom, Stephen Long writes. Ms Owen warned the inner-city Melbourne market ""is seeing greater risk in 2021, with an increase in listing stock weighing on a recovery in values"". ""For example, modelled sales volumes for November estimate 4,301 transactions took place across Melbourne, compared with 8,054 new listings added to the market in the same period,"" she said. ""This means there was around 0.5 sales for each new listing added. ""This is very different from conditions across other capital cities, where the November sales to new listings ratio averaged 1.2 sales for each new listing added."" Despite Melbourne dwelling values recovering in November, and values rising 0.7 per cent in the month, the disproportionate volume of stock to sales volumes could slow the rate recovery across the city in 2021. ""Property investment activity is likely to increase across smaller capital cities such as Perth, where rent values rose a remarkable 8.2 per cent in the year to November,"" she said. ""In Hobart, where gross rent yields are 4.6 per cent across dwellings, the investor share of mortgage finance increased from a recent low of 16.4 per cent in August 2020, to 21.8 per cent in October across Tasmania."" As of June the housing debt to income ratio was 141.2 per cent, with housing debt accounting for most of Australian household debt. ""This poses an ongoing risk to the Australian economy, especially where heavily indebted households may be more likely to save rather than spend during periods of uncertainty or economic hardship,"" Ms Owen said. National house prices continue to withstand the otherwise devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but how long will this last asks Nassim Khadem. ""As a result, policy makers and regulators may watch for signs of rising household debt, or a decline in prudential lending standards that could lead to higher household debt."" The RBA has been modelling 50 per cent theoretical house price falls, and has said that Australia's economic recovery will be ""unpredictable and uneven"". But after years of dire predictions that Australia's property bubble could burst, national house prices continue to withstand the otherwise devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Property analysts no longer expect 10 to 20 per cent declines in house prices, and expect that if the virus remains under control in Australia, prices will rise more by early next year.

125,Demand for swimming pools soars as Aussies invest in 'lifestyle' during pandemic,house-and-home,"  COVID-19 spurs demand for swimming pools in backyards as industry notices boom Pool and landscaping businesses have been run off their feet as more home improvers seek to live out the Australian dream of cooling off in their own backyard this summer. But the Swimming Pools and Spas Association of Australia chief executive Lindsay McGrath said it was not just those on home soil that were dipping their toes into pool ownership with the trend noticed across the globe. ""Applications for new pools isn't just a South Australian or even an Australian phenomenon at the moment, it's certainly a worldwide trend,"" Mr McGrath said. ""But many of our builders are fully booked for the foreseeable future, and there's a lot of demand at the moment."" Regional businesses have also been busy in recent months. In South Australia's Riverland region, Riverscape Landscaping and Pools usually experiences an uptick in business in the lead up to Christmas and the warmer months. But co-owner Luke Hampshire said he was pleasantly surprised that people were comfortable in making such a significant investment during the coronavirus pandemic. ""The region seems to be ticking on quite nicely and people have confidence in spending the money on their properties,"" he said. Mr Hampshire said he attributed the increased demand to restricted overseas travel and a renewed focus on home improvements. ""I've had a few clients indicate to me that the money they're using for their backyard was going to be their holiday to Italy,"" he said. ""They're not confident travel is going to be returning anytime soon, so they're investing in their lifestyle."" The Swimming Pools and Spas Association of Australia said for those who had not already taken a dive into the deep end, there were some important things to consider before purchasing a pool. Lindsay McGrath said safety gates and fencing, landscaping and other running costs were worth investigating before making the commitment. The Pool will be screened on ABC TV Sunday September 22 and 29 at 7:40pm, and streamed on iview. ""They see the pretty pictures and they understand that it's just the pool, but it's always a little bit more than that,"" he said. But, despite the associated costs with installing and running a pool, Mr McGrath said there was no sign that demand would decrease in the short term. ""It’s always been part of the Australian culture to have that beautiful piece of blue in the backyard, and I think COVID-19 has just brought forward all those plans.""

126,"Buying an apartment? Forget lip-service gloss and check the basement, advocate says",house-and-home,"  Apartment buyers urged to look past fittings and check structure, builder reputation Apartment living can provide a low-maintenance, convenient lifestyle, but there are important things buyers should do to avoid crises like those experienced by the residents of the Opal and Mascot Towers in Sydney. Samantha Reece, founder of WA Apartment Advocacy, a not-for-profit that promotes the benefits of apartment living, is working to overcome the cultural opposition to higher density development in Perth. But she's the first to admit high-rise living can go wrong, so she has created a guide to help people make the switch to apartment living while avoiding the pitfalls. ""I'm a big believer that you really need to ask these questions when you move in or are looking to buy, because there's a lot of developers out there who are doing the right thing but there's some who are not,"" Ms Reece told ABC Radio Perth Breakfast. The first thing she suggests is paying less attention to the appearance of the building and finding out more about the structure of an apartment. ""When you're looking at an apartment, you're always looking at the pretty things, the benchtops and the soft-closing cupboards, when what you need to be thinking about is actually what's beneath it, because it's the water membrane that actually is critical in apartments,"" she said. ""If you actually move into an apartment and there's water membrane issues it starts erosion within the building. ""You need to actually ask the developer if there's a water membrane manufacturer's warranty because that warranty will last between 10 and 16 years, whereas the building warranty lasts six years."" She said any part of the apartment that comes into contact with water should have that membrane, and as well as asking questions, she suggests also putting it to the test. ""Everything has to have a water membrane, even your balconies, bathroom, laundries, kitchens, swimming pools,"" she said. ""With a balcony you should actually, as a part of your pre-settlement checklist, ask to do a flood test on your balcony. ""That way then you can see if the water is actually draining away like it should or if it's pooling. If it's pooling, don't buy."" The other major issue, as residents of Sydney's Mascot Towers know too well, is structural cracking. ""One of the other things that we suggest is that you actually ask the developer if a structural engineer has inspected anything below the ground level [such as] car parks,"" she said. As well as ensuring the structure has been checked before buying, you also need to make sure the building is being inspected every year. ""Then, if you actually start to see some cracking and there is construction happening next door, you know it's the construction next door that's causing that cracking, and then you actually have some legal recourse."" Ms Reece isn't just speaking theoretically. She found out — to her cost — that an apartment she owns had not been given annual checks. ""When we had the maintenance review done there were a number of things that we hadn't been doing, and we voided our warranty,"" she said. ""Now, whatever happens comes out of the strata's pocket."" For people buying off the plan, where it's not possible to check the building itself, she recommends investigating the developer and builder as much as possible. ""Buy from a developer that actually has a long history with apartment construction,"" she said. ""You don't want to have someone who's been doing townhouses and then can see that the market's taking off and they've transitioned into apartments. ""I would also recommend that you ask to go and inspect one of the apartments they have constructed previously, and even speak to the strata managers or council of owners chair in that building to see if they're satisfied with the construction quality. ""Anyone who's worth their weight in salt will have no hesitation in doing that with you."" She also suggests checking out the developer and builder to make sure they will be around after the apartment has sold. ""You want to check that they haven't previously done 'phoenix companies'; i,e. they start the company up, they build the apartment, they close the company and then you've got no recourse,"" she said. While she has created a kit warning people how to avoid the many pitfalls of buying an apartment, Ms Reece is a firm believer that they are a great housing option that will continue to grow in Perth. ""I call it the easy breezy lifestyle because once you move in you actually have so much more free time on your hands, because you haven't got as much maintenance to undertake with the garden and so forth,"" she said. ""I believe they can suit you at any age of the life cycle, because it's all about what you actually want to enjoy in your life, not necessarily your life stage.""

127,"Gold, grog and grand larceny behind a town hoping to boom again",house-and-home,"  History for sale as Beaconsfield banks on a mine-led recovery A historic hotel associated with an unsolved bank robbery that still has locals hoping to stumble on the stolen loot is up for sale. The 13-bedroom Exchange Hotel in Beaconsfield is on the market with an asking price of less than $600,000. In 1884, Exchange Hotel owner Richard Collins and his son George were among seven men arrested over a robbery at the local Bank of Tasmania branch. Jan Critchett's book Beaconsfield Gold recounts the day they were imprisoned in the pub four days after robbers ambushed the bank's acting manager, took his keys and stole notes, coins and gold bullion worth about $2 million. Charges against the publican and his son were later withdrawn. No one was ever convicted for the robbery, which Launceston's Examiner newspaper described as ""daring"" and ""unparalleled in Tasmania's history"". The president of the West Tamar Historical Society, John Dent, said most of the stolen loot was never found. ""When you're digging a hole in the ground … a couple of times people have said to me, 'Oh, you're looking for the gold from the Beaconsfield bank robbery, are you?'"" he said. Pub listing agent Paul Scott said the craftsmanship of the Exchange's heritage fittings and 12-foot high ceilings were irreplaceable. ""It's very good value, and if you tried to replace it, it would be in the millions of dollars,"" he said. ""It's got a fantastic feel about it and ambience, and although it hasn't been in business for almost three years, it feels like you could just walk in, flick a switch and start trading tomorrow."" James Gardner has previously snapped up another historic Beaconsfield pub, the Orphir Hotel. The hotel had extension work completed in 1910 and hasn't been operational for years, but its bottleshop has been popular. ""The more you look through The Ophir, the more you get a sense of the potential the property has got,"" said Mr Gardner. The experienced publican, who sold his hotel in Queenstown on the state's west coast two years ago, explained the circa-1870 hotel in the town's main street was an easy buy. ""We live in Launceston so it's just a short drive every day, really,"" he said. Mr Gardner is the latest investor in the future of Beaconsfield, one of many small business owners branching into the town after rumblings of a restart at the Beaconsfield gold mine, famous for the underground rescue of two trapped miners in 2006. The mine was at the centre of global media coverage in 2006, when workers Todd Russell and Brant Webb became trapped down the mine shaft for two weeks and their colleague, Larry Knight, died in the collapse. The gold mine, that was once the lifeblood of the area, closed in 2012 due to a dip in the gold price. Beaconsfield resident and director of commercial real estate firm Shepherd and Heap, Andrew Heap, said the town took a hard hit when the mine closed. ""It caused business to shrink a bit, and there was a bit of a hard period over a couple of years but it's really starting to pick up again at the moment,"" he said. In February 2020, Australian mining company NQ Minerals bought the mine for $2 million and has been working towards restarting operations by the end of the year. Mr Heap said since that announcement, a number of small businesses have opened, including a craft brewery, a winery and some new shops. ""We have a history with mining and talk about it a lot, and I think there are some positive signs the mine may get going again in the next few years,"" he said. ""With the outlook for the gold mine here, I think the town can support two or three healthy hotels and restaurants."" Mr Gardner said the potential reopening of the town's gold mine was a good incentive to buy up. ""There were a lot of things that went into the decision to buy and that was definitely one of them."" Mr Heap said during the 20th-century gold rush, Beaconsfield boasted up to 12 hotels, but that dwindled over the decades. When the gold mine was operating in the early 2000s, there were three hotels and that's decreased further since the mine's closure. Mr Scott said people were more confident to invest in pubs with the prospect of gold mining recommencing. ""It gives people confidence that there's going to be further employment in the area and everything relies on confidence,"" he said. Mr Scott estimated 60 per cent of his sales were to people from mainland Australia. ""We're getting a lot of inquiries from the mainland, with a lot of people wanting to move to Tasmania,"" he said. Mr Gardner has found the same thing, saying the market has ""really fired up"". ""Tassie's always been about 10 years behind the mainland and that is now holding a real attraction for people,"" he said.

128,'We have been selling a huge amount': Bric-a-brac big business at op shops during pandemic,house-and-home,"  Bric-a-brac boom: Interest in household items soars at Perth op shop during coronavirus pandemic COVID clear-outs and a desire for something new may be behind a surge in bric-a-brac sales, with sales up 20 to 30 per cent in one Perth Vinnies store. ""We have been selling a huge amount,"" Angela Garden, retail manager of Vinnies Wembley said. ""A lot of people cleared out, a lot of people have decided they don't like where they live anymore so they have moved house, so they bring all their items to us, and other people have been buying stuff."" It is good news for the Vinnies organisation, which has also seen an increase in requests for help this year. They put the funds raised from its op shop sales into services which help the elderly, the homeless and people living in poverty. While many of the items that come in are straightforward household wares that can be washed and put on the shelf, others are given more careful consideration. ""We do get a lot of interesting items that you have to research,"" Ms Garden said. ""Sometimes we even take them to an antique dealer if we feel it is something that could be quite valuable. ""We feel that if we have some of these precious things you have to take a little bit of care and so we're not just putting it out for $2 when it's something precious and valuable."" The current fashion for items from the mid-20th century and the resurgence of vinyl records has also seen vinyl records overtake CDs and cassettes on the shelves. ""We get quite a lot of records now,"" Ms Garden said. ""They go in with the bric-a-brac and some of them, their age and their condition, are very collectable while some are just worth a dollar."" Other items that come in are not particularly valuable but highly unusual, like a Betty Boop-style plaster figurine (with a small chip) recently given to the store. ""One of the ladies that works here said that when she was a child they used to give them out at the fairground as prizes, rather than a cuddly toy,"" Ms Garden said. ""With something like that we would overlook the fact that she's chipped. ""That would still be an item of value to someone, it's very unique. I've never seen one before."" Ms Garden has also learnt never to underestimate what will sell, even when it's a stylised 90s artwork of a Holden Commodore parked in an orange desert that recently came in. ""I think the Commodore will sell to be honest, because that brand is now gone,"" she said. ""Some of the items you look at and think, 'I don't know who would buy that,' but a lot of the time it is nostalgia for people. ""It will be something they remember from their childhood."" And then there are the items that are simply a mystery — especially kitchen and food-related items with a purpose that simply is not clear. ""Sometimes we will get something in and we have absolutely no idea what it's for, and we can't figure it out,"" Ms Garden said. ""We'll put it out and get people asking us what it's for, and we're hoping someone will tell us."" While some of the donated bric-a-brac could probably have been sold online for profit, Ms Garden thinks many people prefer the convenience and feel-good factor of handing over a box of donations to an op shop. ""I think quite frankly a lot of people don't have the time,"" she said. ""If people downsize, they will keep a few things and give us the rest. ""People just want to pass it on and give it us so we can help other people with it."" While the retro revival means many of the shoppers are probably vintage sellers trawling for items to re-sell, Ms Garden does not think that's a problem. ""I think a lot of people do on-sell items because we try to price things so most people can afford something vintage,"" she said. ""We do have a lot of dealers that come into the store, but everybody is making money from it. ""That will happen at every single charity store.""

129,'You fall in love with a place like this': 160yo country homestead's amazing transformation,house-and-home,"  Transforming 160yo Moyhall Homestead back to life a labour of love, time and money Anna Robinson's story is much like a fairytale. A fairytale set in the Australian bush with a run-down homestead in lieu of a castle and guinea fowls instead of horses. When the then-Melburnian fell in love with a farmer from South Australia's south-east, she had no idea the relationship would come with a 160-year-old homestead. Or the responsibility of restoring it. ""He told me that he would look after the outside and I had to look after the inside,"" Ms Robinson said. A few months before meeting Anna at his brother's wedding in 2007 to a dear friend of Anna's, Georgie McCulloch, Andrew 'Robbo' Robinson had bought the 3,800-acre site with his family for farming purposes. ""It was all about the land here … finding a place for him to start farming his own place,"" Ms Robinson said. ""The fact that it's a beautiful old house was a bonus."" In the 10 years of living there and starting a family, the Robinsons have piece-by-piece invested in their 'labour of love', restoring the once-pristine Moyhall Homestead, and the many buildings connected to it, back to its former glory. Despite always loving old things and the stories behind them, Anna Robinson promises she didn't marry Robbo for the homestead. ""I didn't know if I was going to end up living here because we were just swinging hands back then,"" Ms Robinson said. Besides, restoring it was a huge task. Not just a house property — it was home to a secondary cottage, woolshed, shearers' quarters and 10 or so sheds. Not intended for one person, the homestead once employed several staff, including two gardeners. One managed the garden while the other, a Chinese gardener, oversaw the vegetables. The homestead took many years to build and will take many years to restore. ""We didn't really realise what we were getting into until it was too late,"" Ms Robinson said. With few records to document the building plans, the Robinsons have learnt about the foundations as they go. ""Two of the rooms had a piece of carpet with a bit of tar in the middle with another layer of tar and another layer of carpet,"" Ms Robinson said. Other things have been more rewarding to find. ""When we did the kitchen, we ripped up the lino and it had old jarrah floorboards [underneath] in just amazing condition,"" Ms Robinson said. ""That's a day I'll remember for a long, long time."" The Robinsons have tried to do most of the restorations themselves in a bid to save money. ""One little job is never easy but it's all part of it,"" Ms Robinson said. One of the first things Ms Robinson did when they moved in was get rid of all the heavy curtains everywhere and paint most of the rooms white. ""It's a crying shame not to have the light flooding in and [to be able to see] the views,"" Ms Robinson said. ""You can make a big transformation without much money if you're willing to do the hard yards."" Over the years they have painted over the purple bathroom and green kitchen, scrubbed off wallpaper, stripped floors and renovated the shearers' quarters with a new roof, ceiling, and floor. They have plans to extend the upstairs balcony but have been told there are a few things that need to happen first. ""The next project will be to replace the roof and all the windows and all the surrounds and all the fly screens,"" Ms Robinson said. ""And then after that the kitchen."" ""And then, hopefully, by the time it's all finished it will be time to hand it over to the kids. ""That's a long time [then], isn't it?"" For Anna Robinson restoring the homestead has been a lifestyle, not a chore. ""You're prepared to put in lots of hours to improve it all the time because it's very satisfying,"" she said. Midway through peeling back the wallpaper in one of the kid's rooms she hit gold. ""I got to that last section where I just could have screamed [because] I was so over it,"" Ms Robinson said. On the last little panel, she saw the words ""John 1907"". ""Most people would find it a bit pathetic getting excited over those things but to me all those little [things are] fragments of history."" Just metres from the upstairs master bedroom is an old lift installed more than 100 years ago. One of the early inhabitants of the house, Annie Robertson, was paralysed in a horse-riding accident. ""So, they imported some materials [from overseas] for a lift to be made so that she could get up to her bedroom on the top floor,"" Ms Robinson said. These stories have been passed down to Ms Robinson from local historians. It is from them she learnt about the three-day party that was held when the home was finally finished in the mid-19th century. She knows it involved wallaby coursing, whiskey, and the then Governor of South Australia. ""If these walls could talk, I would love to hear what they had to say,"" Ms Robinson said. The Robinsons insist on keeping as much of the original elements of the house as possible. ""In order to do that you have to put a lot of time, effort and finance into keeping it restored and the way that it should be kept,"" Ms Robinson said. They upcycle where possible to avoid things going to landfill. ""Older things can last a long time … they made things well back then,"" Ms Robinson said. Some things she has not been able to save. Like the old Cyprus trees they had to rip out because they were getting too dangerous and hard to remove. ""Sometimes you've got to take off your sentimental boots and put on your realistic and your practical ones,"" she said. While the lift may have an incredible story, they plan to remove it. It is not an original part of the house after all. While life with two children, a half-renovated mansion, a new online business, and a hard-working husband keep life in constant motion, Ms Robinson would not have it any other way. ""I just think living on a farm is the best lifestyle you could hope to have,"" she said. ""People thought it was strange that I'd spend 10 years in Melbourne and then fit right in here, but I just have."" Not just her but her children. ""They love the city lights when they go there but we always love coming home,"" Ms Robinson said. ""How lucky are we to have this as a playground?"" She is not sure if the house will ever be finished but intends to keep chipping away in the meantime. ""You really want it to be standing for another 160 years or more,"" Ms Robinson said.

130,First home buyer frenzy tipped to fuel hot property market,house-and-home,"  Gold Coast property market tipped to 'increase dramatically' in first home buyer frenzy A surge in first home buyers is set to fuel house price hikes, with the Real Estate Institute of Queensland (REIQ) tipping property values will ""increase dramatically"" in 2021. It follows a 40 per cent surge in first home buyers entering the Queensland property market in September and predictions of a nationwide property boom. REIQ corporate affairs manager Olivier Bleylock said suggestions of a 25 per cent increase in interstate migration to Queensland next year would put further upward pressure on the cost of housing. ""The Gold Coast has seen an annual growth of 3.2 per cent year on year for housing,"" Mr Bleylock said. ""We actually expect that growth will continue but will also increase quite dramatically in the next 12 months. ""For units, it's been a little bit more mild at 1.8 per cent but we're still seeing some steady growth."" Some Gold Coast suburbs have recorded bigger price hikes with values in Arundel increasing 5 per cent and Broadbeach Waters 7.2 per cent. ""Clear Island Waters — that reached the highest at 11.3 per cent which is quite significant,"" Mr Bleylock said. ""We're also expecting prices to continue to rise probably a lot more than what they are at the moment."" The REIQ said the appetite for Queensland property had ramped up in recent months with a frenzy of activity from first home buyers across the state. ""A 41 per cent boost just in September alone and that equates to 3,100 loan applications that were taken out. ""What we're seeing is first home buyers are really coming out in force. ""We're also seeing with interstate migration is there's been an 18 per cent increase from February through to August this year and that's primarily coming from NSW and Victoria."" Property analyst Terry Ryder said first home buyers were the most active they had been in a decade. ""I think first home buyers are the most active cohort in the property market across Australia and it's no surprise,"" he said. ""I would argue there's never been a better time to be a first home buyer in Australia, provided you have secure employment. ""Interest rates have never been lower and the level of government assistance for first home buyers has never been higher. ""In years gone by first home buyers were often competing with investors for the same property but that's not so much the case. ""Despite all the buoyancy in the market, investors are largely sitting on the fence."" Mr Ryder believed Australia was heading into a nationwide property boom with strong markets across the nation but especially in regional areas. ""In various parts of the country that boom is already underway, it's already a reality. ""I think also the trend of expats wanting to get the hell out of wherever they are in Europe, where the virus is just out of control and come back to Australia. ""Expats are coming back in large numbers, hundreds of thousands of them have already returned."" Broadbeach real estate agent Troy Fitzgerald believed a lack of stock was also driving prices higher. ""It's actually quite nuts at the moment,"" Mr Fitzgerald said. ""I haven't seen it this good since before the GFC. ""Especially in the southern market, like anywhere between Mermaid down to Tugun and Bilinga — so all the way along the coastline."" The REIQ predicts the relaxation of border restrictions will make it even harder to find a rental property on the Gold Coast. The current vacancy rate was 1.6 per cent but it was even lower in southern suburbs. Mr Bleylock said Palm Beach tenants were facing a serious rental property shortage with a vacancy rate of 0.2 per cent and in Miami it's 0.4 per cent. ""Vacancy rates will remain as tight as they are,"" he said.

131,"Four years after moving in, Robyn Cairnes and her family have been forced out of their 'poisonous' new home",house-and-home,"  Mould in newly built Perth home blamed for family's rashes, joint pain and headaches A Perth mother has blamed festering mould due to building defects in her four-year-old home for a series of chronic health problems suffered by her family. Robyn Cairnes and her two children, aged 10 and 14, are now living in a caravan in the front courtyard of their house in Wembley due to health issues including joint pain, rashes, serious headaches and chronic fatigue. They have moved out of the house several times for short periods, but moved out for good earlier this year after consulting a specialist doctor. ""It's been trying but we know that the house is poisonous and we can't be in there,"" Ms Cairnes told ABC Radio Perth. ""My daughter actually walked into the side of the house where the bathroom is and she immediately got rashes last night. ""We can't be in the house without getting sick."" Ms Cairnes said a building inspector who carried out an investigation found a defective faulty waterproof membrane in one of the showers in the house. She said there was also no waterproof membrane in the other shower. The sole parent has been pressing the builder, Ventura Homes, to fix the problem since 2016 when she first complained about a mould smell in the house. Ventura Homes is no longer operating, but BGC Housing Group, which took over the company earlier this year, said it had carried out ""relatively minor"" remediation work at the family's house following a ruling from the State Administrative Tribunal. ""BGC prides itself on the quality of the homes we build for Western Australians and all our homes are covered by a lifetime structural warranty,"" the company said in a statement. It also said it had paid an additional amount in compensation to Ms Cairnes. But Ms Cairnes said the amount of about $14,300 came nowhere near to covering how much the problem had cost her in the past four years. She said she had so far borrowed about $150,000 to pay for alternative accommodation, along with mould inspections and reports. A building inspector with 45 years' experience, who assessed the remedial work in June, found that it had not been completed in a proper manner and ""could only be described as totally unacceptable"". Since then, Ms Cairnes has made a further complaint about what she claims is another major defect, discovered by a plumber. ""I asked the plumber to take the bath up and there's a large hole in the slab and there's no waterproof membrane under that slab,"" she said. ""And there is a mould-contaminated, swampy, wet soil that we have been breathing in for four-and-a-half years."" An assessment of the property by a specialist laboratory, Mycolab, in October strongly recommended remediation, reporting ""low-moderate"" to ""high"" levels of fungal concentrations in the house. Ms Cairnes said both her daughter and son had ended up in hospital due to their illnesses. ""All the doctors told me it was not the mould that could be making my daughter so sick,"" she said. ""But a couple of months later, my son ended up in hospital. ""I put him to bed one night, he said he had a terrible earache. ""After half an hour, he had a temperature of 40.5 and his whole left side of his face had swollen up."" Finally, Ms Cairnes went to a specialist physician, who she said had advised the family to get out of the house. Did you know we offer a local version of the ABC News homepage? Watch below to see how you can set yours, and get more WA stories. (Hint: You'll have to go back to the home page to do this) In its statement, BGC said it would carry out more work at the house if the Building Commission believed there were issues that still needed to be addressed. ""Naturally we will gladly undertake this work,"" the company said. ""However, BGC is of the firm position that it has complied with the SAT orders and that no further works are required."" Ms Cairnes's lawyer, John Hammond, said his client was one of three taking action over similar issues. He said he was exploring avenues for a damages claim related to the health impacts. ""It's increasingly a growing area for all the wrong reasons,"" Mr Hammond told ABC Radio Perth. ""I think it's a question of time before someone goes to the courts and gets a ruling on it."" Ms Cairnes believes she and her family have been suffering from a condition called Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, which is thought to be caused by mould or moisture damage in homes. In October 2018, a federal parliamentary committee handed down a report calling for more research into CIRS and related conditions and how prevalent they were in Australia.

132,analysis: I've studied people who made a seachange. One choice helps decide whether it's a success or disaster,house-and-home,"  The idea of moving to the country has gained momentum through the COVID-19 pandemic. Many workplaces have introduced new policies on working from home that give employees the flexibility needed to make the switch. Lockdowns have shown many just how cramped and uncomfortable life can be when you cannot escape to the usual activities that get you out of the house. And if everything is closed, what is the point of being in the city and paying a higher rent or mortgage anyway? The Reserve Bank has noted rents have gone down and vacancy rates have gone up in major cities. At the same time, some real estate agents have noticed an upturn in interest in renting or buying rural and regional properties. The demand in some regional areas has pushed up prices by as much as 30 per cent in the year to October. It seems many are already making the switch to country living. It sounds idyllic. Escape the rat race, have space to grow veggies and let the kids play outside. You won't have to commute any more, and you might even be able to buy a house in the country at a time when city prices remain out of reach for many. You could be living the dream. So how do you know if this is right for you, or a disaster waiting to happen? In my research with people who moved to the country, I found successful moves came down to how closely aligned people's values were with the attributes of the place they moved to. For example, some people value space and quiet more than bustle and activity. If they found these attributes in their new home, then they were able to craft a new life that was deeply satisfying. When you look through the pages of a glossy magazine such as Country Style, you might find yourself yearning for the lifestyle it depicts — the grassy fields, the peaceful but quirky homes filled with flea-market finds, the home-grown abundance and the happy, contented people. These are long-held and highly regarded values that many hold dear. The roots of these ideals are deep. Representations of the country as a rural idyll, a place to escape to, are centuries older than our current media. Epicurus (340BC to 270BC) moved from the centre of Athens to the countryside just outside so he could grow vegetables and live simply. Virgil's (70BC to 19BC) Eclogues emphasised a rural idyll, as did much later painters such as John Constable and Eugene von Guérard. Henry David Thoreau's Walden (1845) is an oft-quoted classic about an urban dweller moving to a rural place to live a better life (albeit temporarily in his case). Early Australian writers such as A.B. ""Banjo"" Paterson and Henry Lawson took up this nostalgic ideal in the fledgling colony. So did artists such as Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton and Charles Condor when they travelled to then-rural Heidelberg, now part of Melbourne, to paint the uniquely Australian countryside. More recently, we have seen Peter Mayle's A Year in Provence (1991) sketch a romantic picture of city dwellers moving to rural France. And there are popular television series such as The Good Life (1975-77), Seachange (1998-2000, 2019), River Cottage Australia (2013-16) and most recently Escape from the City. We know the media is a powerful factor in helping us develop and share our identity and personal narratives. We respond to television shows, books and magazines that we are interested in by becoming their audience. We might share values, goals, ideas or even similar stories with the media we watch. We then, consciously or unconsciously, learn from or adopt those ideas and values in a process of socialisation that shows us how we might live a better life. Media are only a representation, however. A multitude of factors, not least of which are sales and advertising revenues, go into the process of decision-making as images and stories are crafted for the various outlets. There can be a tendency for media to adopt stereotypes as a shorthand form of communication, but these do not necessarily reflect the reality they purport to depict. This might seem obvious, but it is all too easy to accept these images as truth when we are inclined towards that viewpoint anyway. Do you value the things that make a rural place what it is, whether that is peacefulness, an absence of people, vistas of rolling hills, or the community of a small country town? If you do, there's a good chance a move to the country will enable you to live more closely in line with your values and so be a successful one. If, on the other hand, you value city-style living, which includes attractions, shops, events and being close to services, you might want to reassess whether a seachange or treechange is right for you.

133,Here's what the proposed scrapping of stamp duty could mean for you,house-and-home,"  Stamp duty vs property tax and what the proposed change could mean for you The NSW Treasurer has proposed a massive overhaul of the way houses are taxed, with stamp duties to be potentially scrapped. In a move heralded as one of the biggest changes to the way Australians have been taxed on property since Federation, Dominic Perrottet has unveiled an ambitious plan to replace stamp duty with an annual land tax. ""Stamp duty is a tax from a bygone era,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""This will be like the Netflix of property tax."" While the scheme is yet to be finalised, home buyers are already asking the obvious question: ""will we be better off?"" Here's what we know so far. Stamp duty in NSW is approximately 4 per cent, so based on Sydney's median house price of $1,154,406, buyers currently pay approximately $46,176 to the Government. But under the new scheme, instead of forking out for a one-off upfront payment, home buyers could opt to pay an annual tax based on the value of their land. Chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics, Sarah Hunter, said that would remove some significant barriers to entering the property market. ""At the moment if you're a first home buyer, you've got to save up for the deposit to put down on the house and the mortgage on top of that, but you've also got to save up to cover the cost of the stamp duty and it's quite a significant amount of money,"" she said. The NSW Budget has become a cash splash amid Australia's coronavirus-driven recession — find out if you're a winner or a loser here. Upside Realty CEO Adam Rigby said the same was true for people already in the housing market, particularly elderly residents looking to downsize. ""When you add agent fees and stamp duty together, you can be looking at a year or two salary just to change properties — that's very expensive for the average Australian."" Currently first-home buyers are eligible for stamp duty concessions if the property is valued at less than $800,000 but if Mr Perrottet's plan passes, first home buyers will instead receive a grant of up to $25,000. The plan requires every other state to sign on and the Federal Government to compensate the switch. Australians only have to look across the ditch to scrutinise a property market without stamp duties. In New Zealand, the Government raises most of its revenue from GST (albeit at a rate of 15 per cent compared to 10 per cent in Australia) as well as income and corporate tax. Want more news and analysis about the NSW Budget? Check out these stories: Brendan Coates from the Grattan Institute said Australia was an outlier compared to many other countries in relying so much on stamp duties. ""In New Zealand there is no stamp duty; in the UK stamp duty does exist but it does tend to have lower rates than in Australia; and in the US you do have some stamp duty in some states but you tend to rely on more broad-based property taxes,"" he said. Interestingly, a similar proposal has already been implemented in the Australian Capital Territory with a lengthy transition period to the new scheme now underway. While economists have been pushing for stamp duty to be abolished for decades, Sarah Hunter from BIS Oxford Economics said the devil would be in the detail. ""It is hard to work out who is better or who is worse off but there will inevitably be, with this kind of change, some winners and losers when you add it up at the bottom line."" She believes by removing stamp duty there will be less financial burden on many people and thus more movement through the housing market. Dominic Perrottet's proposed land tax could wreak havoc with NSW's finances and irritate his Canberra colleagues, writes business editor Ian Verrender. But a ""phasing approach"" is necessary to level the playing field, she said. ""It almost certainly won't be the case that you if you paid stamp duty a couple of years ago you would then go straight into paying a land tax, they'll phase it so that that doesn't happen,"" Ms Hunter said. Brendan Coates from the Grattan Institute contends that as a whole, the community would be better off. ""The details for the individual person we just don't know yet — the Government has signalled that they're probably going to go down this path with a plan to consult through to March and then come up with announcements, presumably in next year's budget,"" he said. ""We don't have all that detail yet but at a community level, this is a really important reform that would certainly make the people of NSW better off in the long run. ""This is a really positive step — it's just about the best tax reform that any state government could adopt.""

134,Going underground — lessons for suburbia from subterranean Coober Pedy,house-and-home,"  Going underground — lessons for suburbia from subterranean Coober Pedy It is summer in Australia and the temperature is soaring towards the 40s, so you reach for the air-conditioning remote but cringe at the thought of the energy bill come March. The struggle for energy efficiency in a changing climate and the mental maths of keeping your home comfortable are a dominant point in day-to-day life. But deep in the South Australian outback is a town that has been dealing with this problem for years. So, what's the secret? Coober Pedy is a difficult place to live. Set on the edge the Stuart Range, the town of 2,000 people sits atop a bed of sandstone glittered with opal, with no topsoil and practically no vegetation. The average daytime temperature in summer is 37 degrees, but living in a house in such conditions is uncomfortable and expensive. So, the locals turned to dugouts: underground homes. Stephen Berry, manager of the University of SA's Research Node for Low-Carbon Living, said it was obvious why. ""When you have a building that's covered in earth or is underground, you effectively get infinite thermal mass,"" he said. ""That means the indoor conditions remain remarkably stable — they hardly vary at all. ""If you have a building with high thermal mass but let the sun's light pour in uncontrolled, it would be uncomfortable."" Despite the temperature edging into the 40s during summer, dugouts in Coober Pedy usually stay between 19 and 25 degrees, which saves residents huge amounts of money on cooling expenses. If underground housing has such obvious benefits, why isn't it more widespread? Dr Berry said not everywhere was as well suited to building underground as Coober Pedy. ""Coober Pedy is fantastic because it's soil type allows for relatively easy construction of underground buildings,"" he said. ""In many other places, there are different soil types — there's a groundwater table that you have to deal with."" Martin Freney, a lecturer in Sustainable Design at the University of South Australia, said while building underground homes in suburban areas was not impossible, it was extremely difficult. ""You're essentially digging a big hole and if that's near neighbouring buildings or fences, there's the potential for undermining and the collapse of those structures,"" Dr Freney said. ""If you want to build a fully underground house, you might get some pushback from the planning officer at council, because it probably won't comply with the streetscape rules."" While building underground homes might be difficult, there are alternatives. Alongside his work as a lecturer, Dr Freney also runs a business that builds a style of house known as an 'Earthship'. The Earthship concept was developed by an American architect named Michael Reynolds in the 1970s and was designed as a self-sustaining, off-the-grid house. Earthship-style buildings are dug slightly into the ground and the rear of the building is covered with an earthen mound and reinforced with a retaining wall made of recycled tyres. The mound gives the building a high thermal mass: absorbing heat during the day and radiating it at night to keep the temperature consistent. ""If you have the mound itself, ideally to the east, south and west, combined with glazed glass facing north and well insulated walls, you can get the benefits of an underground house in suburbia,"" Dr Freney said. ""At the end of the day, you don't have to use nearly as much energy for heating and cooling."" But according to Dr Berry, much like entirely underground houses, the Earthship is not without its downsides. ""The earth sheltered concept is a fabulous one, and it's very useful for particular situations,"" Dr Berry said. ""We're unlikely to see a high number of earth-covered buildings in suburbia … because each type of house isn't valid in every location.""

135,Can a mulberry tree really help save a property from bushfire?,house-and-home," Science Want a bushfire-smart garden? Here's what's involved When Brett Hawkins returned to his property north of Bega after the New Year's Eve bushfires, he found an incredible sight. ""I could see straight away the house was intact ... but everything else around it was burnt, with the exception of the mulberry tree,"" he told ABC News. In the face of horror bushfire seasons, Australians are being increasingly encouraged to clear vegetation from around their homes. But gardens are a source of beauty and inspiration, and provide all manner of benefits — not least shade, wildlife habitat and privacy. So can certain types of plants, like Mr Hawkins's mulberry tree, help things stay cool and moist, and reduce the risk to your home? While there's no magic formula, here are a few things to think about if you want a bushfire-smart garden. Beyond the mulberry tree anecdote, there have been a number of amazing stories over the years of particular plants — many of them European — helping protect buildings from bushfire. And while it's dangerous to think there is a simple solution here, it is true that plants differ in their flammability, so can play a role reducing the risk in your garden. Discover a town built to survive and adapt to extreme weather on your mobile in AR. For example, plants with wide, flat, thick or soft, fleshy leaves generally contain more moisture than very fine needle-like leaves, and are less likely to dry out and burn when a fire comes. On the other hand, scented plants contain waxes and oils that add to flammability, and this is one reason eucalypts burn well. But some species of eucalypts — those with loose, papery or stringy bark — are more likely to be a fire hazard than others. Plants with closely packed branches are also more likely to burn easily, plus they trap a lot of dead material that is perfect fire fuel. Trees with branches that go all the way down to the ground also help fire spread by providing a ""ladder"" of fuel for fire to spread upwards into tree canopies. The Victorian Country Fire Authority has developed a handy tool called a Plant Selection Key to help gardeners choose fire-wise plants CSIRO bushfire risk expert Justin Leonard recommends you plug in the characteristics of plants into the key to work out their flammability. And, he emphasises, ""it's not a native versus non-native situation"". There are also many lists of actual species that are supposed to be less flammable than others — just do a quick online search for 'fire-retardant' or 'fire-resistant' species. But Brad Murray of the University of Technology Sydney warns these lists can sometimes be contradictory, and often don't offer much evidence to back them up. He says the most reliable advice comes from bushfire authorities. Dr Murray has been testing the flammability of species by checking what temperature their branches ignite at on a ""plant BBQ"". His early findings in the Blue Mountains suggest non-native garden species — including lemon, magnolia and camellia — are less flammable than eucalypt-dominated bushland in the same area. Some lists have noted mulberry as having low flammability, but this particular tree is yet to be tested. Dr Murray hopes to eventually identify low-flammability natives that could be used in gardens. ""We'd like to screen native rainforest species,"" he says. Whatever species we choose, low-flammability gardens should be seen as just part of a larger ""fire-fighting tool box"", says fire ecologist Tim Curran of Lincoln University in New Zealand. ""They are not failsafe, nor should they be the only approach used."" Brett Hawkins believes his well-watered mulberry tree provided a nice moist buffer to resist fire. While the rest of his property had dried out in the drought,  he had managed to ""sacrifice"" a fair bit of water to keep his mulberry tree alive and pumping water through its leaves. His view is supported by Dr Murray's latest research that shows moisture in plants helps reduce their flammability. Earlier research on the 2009 Black Saturday fires by Phil Gibbons and colleagues at the Australian National University also found homes with greener, moist gardens were more likely to survive. But there are no silver bullets when it comes to a fire-wise garden, Dr Gibbons says. ""Concluding that the one tree was the reason the house survived is a dangerous conclusion to make."" ""Most houses survive bushfires for a myriad of reasons, including luck."" And some low-flammability species appear to switch to being highly flammable when they dry out. While experts agree keeping plants well-watered should reduce their flammability, this is tricky to do during drought conditions. So, if watering is going to be difficult, it might be worth looking for fire-wise species that are also tolerant to extreme climates. Fire authorities emphasise it's easiest to protect your home if you remove most of the flammable material from around it, creating a 'defendable space'. While experts like Mr Leonard support this, they want people to avoid clearing more than is necessary and much of it comes down to garden design. They say with a bit more thought, we can try and hit a ""sweet spot"" that reduces risk while keeping the benefits of vegetation. One principle to bear in mind is to break up the 'fuel' to make it hard for fires to reach your house along the ground, which means: Another principle is to make it hard for fire to reach up into tree canopies from the ground, which means: Apart from flames, another danger to your house from a passing fire is radiant heat, which can set buildings alight. While having trees in the garden could help provide a buffer from radiant heat, they need to be fire-wise species. Otherwise, the advice is to have most of your trees downwind from the likely direction of a fire — this way, they are less likely to spread embers to your house if they catch alight. While trees may protect against some embers, Mr Leonard from CSIRO cautions there's a limit to how much they can do this. Embers can be blown onto a house even when the fire front is some distance away. The best protection from these, and from any flames that reach a home, is to have a building that is less likely to catch alight, he says. With unique access to Australia's emergency services, first responders and local communities, Big Weather is an emotionally gripping series filmed over one intense summer. While the right plants in the right place may reduce your bushfire risk, there are no guarantees. Some fires just won't be stopped, so always have a bushfire plan and know what you're going to do if you're threatened. RMIT University's Sarah Bekessy, who is an expert in combining biodiversity and urban planning, urges us to be realistic. ""If you live in a fire-prone environment, there's got to be a level of acceptance that that's what you've chosen to do,"" Professor Bekessy says. ""Some people think the ultimate solution is for the whole world to be a car park without any trees, but this would be uninhabitable. There's got to be a balance. ""Vegetation doesn't have to be your enemy when it comes to fire risk — it can actually be your friend as well. It just requires careful thinking and design.""

136,Caring for backyard bobtail lizards,house-and-home,"  Bobtail lizards are coming out in warmer weather, and there are things we can do to care for them With the weather beginning to warm up, you may notice the odd reptile in your neighbourhood, including bobtail lizards, according to gardening expert Sabrina Hahn. She says there are things you can do to help them. And good reasons to try. ""You will quite often see bobtails and snakes in the same area,"" Ms Hahn told Gillian O'Shaughnessy on ABC Radio Perth. ""Although it's pretty unlucky if you have bobtails and snakes in your backyard if you live in the urban environment, I think you're pretty safe. ""Most bobtails you will see are usually solitary, the only time they come together is September and October [to breed]."" ""If you have bobtails in your garden, always leave out a flat tray of water because in summer they do drink a little bit of water,"" Ms Hahn said. But Healthy Wildlife, Healthy Lives — a website that advises the public on living near native animals — advises against feeding them, because it can risk them becoming over-dependent or eating way more than they can handle. Feeding a bobtail just half an apple is the equivalent to a human eating 37 apples. Instead, avoid pesticides and let them feast on the cockroaches, beetles and snails in your garden. ""They are not the fastest machines on four legs, which is why snails are so good,"" Ms Hahn said. ""They don't attack the vegie garden,"" she added, but will feast on strawberries if they can find them. ""If they have a nice big fat tail when you see them it means they are well fed,"" she said. ""If their tail is flat and quite shrunken, they actually haven't eaten in a long time, so go and get a little snail for them."" Ms Hahn said the biggest predators of bobtails were cats and dogs, so she advised keeping them in at night and creating a pet-free area in your garden. Bobtails also needed plenty of shelter. ""[Leave an area with] at least 10 centimetres of leaf litter, some logs and some rocks they can hide in,"" she said. ""Kookaburras, butcher birds and other birds of prey do knock them off. They are too big for magpies but crows will have a crack, so they need those hidey hole areas."" Healthy Wildlife advises against transporting bobtails from your garden to nearby bushland, as the evidence shows they rarely survive long after such a move. Ms Hahn advised grabbing a bobtail by the back of the head if you do need to pick one up to move it out of harm's way. And do try to avoid accidentally killing one, because they mate for life. ""If you run over one on the road, you've just taken out someone's lifetime partner,"" she said. ""They only have two babies a year, and if their mate dies they don't breed again.""

137,Meet the Australians using coronavirus as a chance to change careers,house-and-home,"  Food has been a mainstay in Jessica Nguyen's life, but she never thought it would be her career. More than eight months into the pandemic, her home cooking is paying the bills. With a decade of experience in public relations and marketing, the Melbourne woman worked with some of Australia's most recognisable beauty brands, enjoying what she described as a ""comfortable"" life. But, like thousands of Australians, she was unexpectedly made redundant at the beginning of March, and joined the ranks of those who have decided to reskill. ""The first lockdown was pretty much imminent, so I was just trying to find another marketing or PR job,"" Ms Nguyen said. ""But we went to lockdown, and no-one was hiring."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Rather than frantically scramble for a new position, Ms Nguyen adjusted her focus. ""I love cooking, so I made that the therapy or the hobby, whereas other people might do yoga and whatnot,"" she said. She began ""cooking her way out of COVID"" in the middle of Melbourne's first wave, putting her recipes on Instagram Stories as step-by-step guides. When she realised the reach her posts were getting, Ms Nguyen decided she could take her experience as a brand manager to launch her own business as a food freelancer. She is now creating a range of content, offering everything from recipe tutorials to cook-along Zoom sessions. With more than 50,000 Instagram followers, a slew of brand partnerships, and big plans for her future, the gamble and hard work have paid off. ""When things like this happen it's terrible, but it forces businesses and people like myself to rethink and pivot and change,"" she said. Statistics are hard to come by on the number of Australians who have reskilled or changed jobs since the March lockdowns, but there are indicators. A May study by finance group ING found that as many as 3.3 million Australian adults were rethinking their careers because of the devastating impacts COVID-19 has had on the economy. ""What a lot of career development practitioners and career professionals are doing right now is assisting clients with looking at the data and seeing where the growth is,"" said University of Queensland career educator Jennifer Luke. ""The growth industries are health and social assistance. COVID is definitely fuelling it."" When Virgin Australia employee Shannon Stanbridge was stood down, the Adelaide woman chose to take the time to reskill in a field she had always been interested in. ""I applied for close to 50 jobs when I left Virgin,"" Ms Stanbridge said. ""Then I thought maybe I should look at studying, because I'm never going to have that time again."" She chose to enrol in a Certificate III in Pathology Collection, to retrain to become a phlebotomist — someone who draws blood for laboratory analysis. ""My second lesson I was taking blood,"" she said. ""I was rapt it was so hands-on — that's how I learn."" Ms Stanbridge is far from alone in making the switch — TAFE SA enrolments in nursing and pathology have increased by more than a third over the past 12 months. ""The pandemic was that push to see if, firstly, there was something else I was interested in, then, secondly, giving me the chance to go for it,"" she said. When working-from-home requirements emptied his office, Cian Ash found himself focusing on the parts of his office job that he disliked. ""When there weren't a lot of people around, it was really starting to get to me,"" he said. ""There was me and one other guy in the office, which took up the entire floor of the building. It was apocalyptic."" Now, he is six months into his Certificate IV in Commercial Cookery, and has no regrets about making the change. ""I'm 35 and starting something completely new,"" he said. ""I've got a lot of hard work and kind of paying my dues ahead of me, but something being hard isn't a good reason not to do it."" Employment expert Ruth Bridgstock said while coronavirus had created necessities, it had also created opportunities. ""There are instances of individuals who have maybe taken advantage of the push that coronavirus has provided to reinvent themselves and their careers,"" Professor Bridgstock said. ""Understandably, some people may be in financial situations where this may be difficult, but we want people who are considering career changes to be moving into roles that will be suitable for them, that will be a good match. ""There might not be a ready-made job for you [but] you might be able to create something by drawing on capabilities you have."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic With early data showing about a million Australians were laid off in the initial stages of the pandemic — and 30,000 jobs lost in September alone — the job market is hugely competitive. ""We've seen a number of shifts as a result of COVID,"" LinkedIn senior director for talent and learning Adam Gregory said. ""It's a much more competitive marketplace now."" It is particularly tough for women, with female-dominated industries disproportionately impacted. ""The pandemic is definitely affecting women in the workplace very differently to men,"" Mr Gregory said. ""The data is showing women are less likely to get back into the workplace during COVID, and we've seen their applications lessen."" With a spike in the number of applications being received per role, and overqualified applicants flooding entry-level positions, Mr Gregory said there was a ""real focus"" on soft skills such as communication and creative thinking. ""If you think about someone who has no specific industry experience, they could still have a lot of the soft skills that are transferable,"" he said. For job seekers who find themselves with gaps on their resumes, Mr Gregory said investing in self-development was important. ""As a potential employer, I'd be looking at someone who is investing in themselves, investing in learning and developing their own skillset,"" he said. ""That's going to be a really important factor for people who are finding themselves out of work for a longer period of time."" Looking back, Ms Nguyen is the picture of pandemic success, pivoting perfectly from a job to launching her own business. ""There were a lot of sleepless nights and a lot of conversations I had with my husband, who I had to convince that this could potentially be my new job,"" she said. ""He was pretty reluctant because I guess he doesn't really understand the world of influencer marketing and how you can make money off that. ""Once I convinced him, then I just went full steam ahead and decided to do this.""

138,Melburnians who've 'never lived anywhere else' make sad decision to leave after lockdown,house-and-home,"  The toll of COVID-19 lockdowns in Melbourne is pushing some to move from the city they love, seeking a fresh start elsewhere. Data trends show that recent enquiries from people looking to leave Melbourne far outweigh the norm. Usually, thousands actually want to move to the city each year. Online removalist booking platform Muval, which analyses search data, found since April a rising trend in searches like 'can I move during Coronavirus' and 'can I move during COVID lockdown'. Muval's chief revenue officer Adam Coward said the most startling data has been out of the Victorian capital. ""You would have seen on average about 53 per cent of people back in 2019 coming into that August-September period wanting to move into Melbourne. In the last three months since July we've seen 70 per cent of people wanting to move out of Melbourne versus moving in, so it's completely switched around,"" he said. The data shows that Brisbane, northern Queensland and more recently Adelaide and Tasmania are the key destinations for Melbourne inquiries. While it's estimated around a half million people move between states in Australia each year for employment opportunities, family reasons and sea and tree changes, this year many like Paul Menz are looking for a reset. ""I'm so sick of my apartment and I'm so sick of my 5 kilometre radius — finally moving away after essentially living here for 40 years,"" he said ""I don't think I'm even going to be that sentimental about my neighbourhood because I've had so much of it over the last seven months."" Mr Menz is a freelance copywriter and linguist who planned to buy an investment property in Brisbane at the start of this year and split his time between the two cities, but COVID-19 changed that. He and miniature dachshund Hugo have packed up their St Kilda East pad and are waiting for restrictions to ease, so they can drive north over the border without having to quarantine on the other side. ""After a few months of the COVID lockdown, my mind just started going to 'why don't I just move there?' and I just thought for something good to happen this year I needed to do something like that, make a big change."" Michael Di Cecco, his partner Ava and children Giuseppe, 5, and Tilda, 1, are leaving their home in Tecoma in Melbourne's outer east, bound for Tanglewood, north of Byron Bay. The former musician's world came crashing down along with the music industry in Melbourne when COVID-19 hit in March. He went on Job Keeper and Ava was made redundant from her job, ending a few chapters for the family. ""It was the second lockdown when I couldn't find work, so I started looking for other ways of making an income and I did the mortgage broking course and started to re-skill in that industry,"" he said. ""A year ago if you'd said I'd be a mortgage broker and moving up north, I would have probably laughed rather heartily — it's very random. ""I'm pretty sad, I've never lived anywhere other than Melbourne my whole life. ""I'm really excited about just a fresh life start for the family. It's both scary and exciting but I'm looking forward to giving it a crack and seeing what happens."" Australian National University demographer Liz Allen said COVID-19 has disrupted lives on a seismic scale and has resulted in some ""pull"" and some ""push"" responses. ""Is it that Melbourne is still meeting the needs of people who live there? Could it be that people can no longer afford to be there? It could be the realisation that you just want to reprioritise life,"" she said. ""During periods of trauma, we take stock of our lives and I think this COVID crisis has led to not just people in lockdown but people all across Australia re-evaluating the priorities in their lives."" She believes there will be a correction in the long term and people will return to Melbourne with restrictions lifting across Victoria. Mr Coward expects inquiries to leave Melbourne will taper off, although it will take time for people to return. ""You'd probably expect people won't make big interstate moves every 3-6 months, it's probably like a 12-month cycle,"" he said. ""You might see that rebound and come back into more people wanting to move to Melbourne over the next 12 months once they've had their stint somewhere else.""

139,analysis: Rates so low that you nearly profit from your home loan? We're almost there,house-and-home,"  The Reserve Bank may cut interest rates to very close to zero — so what does that mean for borrowers and savers? The Reserve Bank meets on Tuesday to decide whether or not to lower its cash rate target to 0.1 of a percentage point (from 0.25 percentage points). That takes us very close to a negative interest rate. But already some interest rates in Australia are negative — if you take account of inflation. Annual inflation, as measured by the CPI, is currently 0.7 percentage points. And as it stands, the effective overnight cash rate — that's the interest rate the Reserve Bank attempts to influence every month and reflects the rate that banks lend to and borrow from each — is sitting at roughly 0.13 percentage points. So the ""value"" of the money banks are lending out after adjusting for inflation is falling at roughly 0.7 per cent per annum (on the current rate of inflation), while the ""rate of return"" the banks receive from that money is well below that at roughly 0.13 per cent. The banks' money is being eroded over time, as opposed to growing — which is the effect of negative real interest rates. Economists say this means the cash rate is ""effectively"" negative right now. The RBA's monthly catch-up is called a ""live"" meeting, because the bank may very well to decide to lower the cash rate during its hours long meeting on the day — as opposed to simply justifying the decision during the meeting. But all eyes will be in the accompanying statement from the governor, Philip Lowe. If you can look away from the Melbourne Cup Form Guide for a moment, it will be interesting to see if he makes reference to the bank's further plans for easing monetary policy. To date, Dr Lowe has said it's ""extraordinarily unlikely"" the bank will move the cash rate into negative territory. Then again, he was similarly unequivocal about the chances of the RBA engaging in a money printing program, and that quantitative easing program is now well established. The big commercial banks have deposit accounts with the Reserve Bank, to record the value of their Exchange Settlement balances. That's a fancy way of saying the commercial banks bank with the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank is trying to stop the financial system melting down and telling us to brace for impact amid fallout from coronavirus, writes Gareth Hutchens. Normally the big banks receive a return on their accounts much like a regular customer would receive on their deposit accounts — only the rate is the cash rate. In making the cash rate negative, the Reserve Bank effectively charges the commercial banks for holding money with it. Most banks, the thinking goes, would shudder at the thought of paying the RBA to hold their cash overnight, so they'd make an effort to lend it out instead. This is why it's understood to be a stimulus policy — because it's thought to encourage lending. That's the theory anyway. The reality is more of a highly distorted banking system. Banks take bank deposits and lend out. That's the basic business model. Interest rate cuts simply can't address the underlying supply and demand problems that a coronavirus pandemic will cause. But there are some policies that might, writes Michael Janda. Logic would dictate that if interest rates turn upside down, then customers would be charged for their deposit accounts and mortgagors would make money, not lose money on interest. And that's exactly right. As the National Australia Bank's chief economist, Alan Oster, puts it: ""Certainly if [the RBA] went negative, you would see fixed rates go down, and they'd all probably have a ""one"" in front of them,"" he says. ""As a borrower what might happen, to use an extreme example, is that if you have a mortgage of $1,000, by the time you then pay it back, you might just give back the bank in total $900."" As for depositors, the interest rates on most accounts would basically fall to an extremely low number. Again, adjusting for inflation, your money's better off under the mattress. Most economists say it's unlikely banks would move to charge depositors because it would lead, they say, to mass withdrawals and that has the potential to crimp the banks' ability to lend. Apart from RBA governor Lowe's obvious reluctance to employ a negative interest rate policy, Mr Oster says if the policy were to be deployed, ""it would mean the economy has crashed"". Australia has just recorded its worst economic contraction on record, so why are we still talking about a recession not a depression? Michael Janda explains. That's not hyperbole. The fear is that banks stand to lose billions under a negative interest rate scenario because the money they make on deposits pales in comparison to the billions lost on the slump in lending. Yes, borrowers stand to make money on transactions, but with less funds to draw on, the banks are constrained in how much they can lend and the business model itself starts to collapse. So we're left with a game of limbo — how low will the Reserve Bank go in lowering its cash rate target? The ""effective"" cash rate is currently hovering between eight basis points and 13 basis points (0.13 per cent), because the money market has pushed the rate below the RBA's cash rate target of 0.25 per cent. But the effective cash rate — the rate which influences your mortgage — could easily fall very close to zero. From there, the bank will be trying its best to lower longer-term interest rates. You can see why the RBA governor has tried to shift the focus to what the Federal Government can do in recent years. Dr Lowe is painfully aware of the potential limitations of the bank's arsenal.

140,Possums in the suburbs: How backyards are also vital in helping conservation,house-and-home,"  Urban backyards are an important habitat for native wildlife too, study finds Conserving areas of natural bushland is crucial in protecting threatened species, but there is now evidence that the suburban backyard may be a vital habitat as well. Bronte Van Helden, a PhD student at The University of Western Australia, has set out to find out just how important the backyard is to native mammals. At the crux of her research was an investigation into how wildlife use gardens and what sort of garden features might help native animals to thrive. While much of the previous wildlife research has focused on larger gardens on the urban fringe, Ms Van Helden was interested in over 50 different backyards in the city of Albany in WA's Great Southern, recruiting households to volunteer. ""Basically, the only criteria was that you had to be within an urban area of Albany and the resident had to be willing to let me traipse in and out of their garden for over a year looking at their wildlife,"" Ms Van Helden told Jessica Strutt on ABC Radio Perth. ""We had everything from really vegetated areas with many native things, to really good exotic gardens to completely paved gardens."" What she found, during long nights spend monitoring outdoors, was surprising. ""I found critically endangered western ringtail possums, brush-tailed possums and seven different species of bats,"" she said. ""We didn't even know that we had seven species of bat right in the heart of Albany before I started my research. ""These are some of our most highly threatened species and we've got them right here in our backyards in really high abundance. ""When you look at the diversity of mammals in gardens it's actually comparable with what you find in bushland areas — which is really cool."" The other unexpected finding was that, rather than moving between native bushland and backyards, the animals she tracked were living solely in residential gardens. ""I found that every single one of the individuals I tracked exclusively lived within gardens — they were eating, they were sleeping, they were reproducing in our backyards. ""The fact that we've got them living exclusively in gardens, it just goes to show that we could actually use these urban areas to improve our ability to conserve."" Professor Owen Nevin, chief executive of the Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute said the findings offered an opportunity for the general public to play a part in conservation. ""Around 90 per cent of Australians live in what's defined as an urban area,"" Professor Nevin said. ""Bronte's work is really interesting because she's finding the whole home range of those critically endangered animals falls within, not wildlands or in protected areas, it's in people's gardens so there is a real opportunity to start to look in much more detail in real urban areas. ""Enhancing habitats in our gardens is something that can be applied across the spectrum."" Albany resident Janet Traylen volunteered both her backyard and her time to help Ms Van Helden with the tracking and said it was a thrill to discover just how much wildlife her garden was hosting. ""One thing that really blew me away was that we actually found all seven local species of bat in my backyard,"" Ms Traylen said. ""I had seen bats there but just presumed they were all the one species, so to find out that there were seven different ones there was really special."" ABC Radio Perth listeners also reported finding rich wildlife inside the metropolitan area: Carol: I have bobtail lizards in my garden [in Mosman Park]. One was so thirsty on the weekend that he drank water out of a mug I held out for him. Roma: I have several quendas in my garden. The big ginger cat is quite intimidated by them. One of them often plays around my feet when I'm hanging up the washing. Kate: We put a pond in our garden in East Fremantle and tried to keep fish, but they kept getting taken by river birds like heron. So we gave up on the fish but lo and behold the frogs have since moved in and we have had lots of motorbike frog tadpoles that have reached maturity. While the Albany study found mammals living in spaces with little more than concrete and a lemon tree, there are small things householders can do to make their blocks more hospitable. ""If people want to make a difference, they can actually do it right in their back garden with really simple things like keeping your pets inside at night if you can,"" Ms Van Helden said. ""Planting some shrubs or some trees as a bit of shelter — that increases the likelihood of animals being there. ""Also providing a water source can also be really beneficial for wildlife, like a bird bath. ""I hope [my research] inspires people that they can make a difference in their back garden, it really doesn't take much to protect wildlife and increase the value of their gardens for them.""

141,Is this Australia's cheapest dairy herd?,house-and-home,"  Cootamundra couple's collection of 500 ornamental cows sold to Riverina dairy farmer When Cootamundra couple Lynn and Barry Gavin put their prized collection of 500 ornamental cows up for sale they wanted to keep the herd together. Happily, it's now on the 'moo-ve' to a Riverina dairy farm. From milk jugs and cups, to soft toys and clocks, the sprawling collection of black-and-white cows has been bringing cheer to the Gavin family for decades. ""Full is not the word,"" Mr Gavin said. ""They are side by side, back to front, you could not get another one in there. ""There is basically anything you want to name, there are candles, cookie jars, dishes, a crumb sweeper, a sandwich maker, a xylophone, clocks, and pencil sharpeners. ""They say pigs might fly but we have a flying cow. ""It's actually tethered with a fishing line and a hook, it hangs about a metre from the ceiling and it's got a battery in it and some soft wings and you open it up and get it going and just give it a little push and it keeps going around and around."" The collection was quickly snapped up by a dairy farm in Finley for $950 after being posted on Facebook. ""A bargain at less than $2 per cow,"" Mr Gavin said. While the collection represents many memories, Mrs Gavin said she was ready to part with it. ""Every year for my birthday, Mother's Day and Christmas my four kids would buy me cow stuff,"" she said. ""The kids don't want it when I am gone, so I thought, oh well, sell it. ""I do have a shelf that I'm not selling. It's actually a cow-shelf, so I am keeping it."" As the Gavins carefully wrap and box the collection, they are taking comfort in the knowledge that the cows are going to a good home. ""It's very hard to sell collections as a collection. A lot of people want to pick the eyes out of the herd to only get the valuable or rare ones,"" Mr Gavin said. ""Luckily enough a lady called, and she's down at Finley and they've got a dairy farm and that's where they are going.""

142,"Sunshine Coast renters forced to consider sleeping in cars, as vacancies dry up",house-and-home,"  Sunshine Coast rentals dry up, with real estate agents citing investor sales to owner-occupiers The Sunshine Coast's increasingly tight rental market has pushed some renters into caravans, garages and other short-term accommodation until they can find a new property. Figures from the Real Estate Institute of Queensland (REIQ) show the region's median availability in September was 0.5 per cent, a significant drop from 1.9 per cent in June. The figures showed several areas had less than 1 per cent vacancy in September, including Coolum Beach and Pelican Waters at 0.3 per cent and Nambour at 0.2 per cent. An REIQ spokesperson said availability of 2.5 to 3.5 per cent was considered healthy, 1.5 to 2.5 was relatively tight, and anything below 1.5 was extremely tight. ""It shows that there's very limited stock around,"" the spokesperson said. Real estate agencies in the area confirmed this. David Powe of McGrath Estate Agents, Noosa, where the vacancy in September was 1.1 per cent, said his agency had next to no available rental properties on its books. ""Whenever you get [a vacant property] now, it just seems like just heaps of people inquiring … and people trying to call in favours … because they're so desperate,"" he said. ""It definitely is an issue in the community."" Amy Ryan of Caloundra City Realty said the demand had gone crazy in the last few months, and that it could be quite upsetting hearing the stories of tenants' differing situations. ""Owners are needing to move back into their properties because they've had their circumstances change … or say an owner's lost their job and they need some extra money, so they've had to sell that property, and that's gone to an [owner-occupier], so that tenant can no longer stay in the property,"" she said. ""It's quite sad to see, really."" Talitha Ellery had to temporarily move herself and son Roman into a caravan after two months of unsuccessful applications and a looming Term 4 start date with a new school. ""I really had no idea that it was going to be as hard … to get a little roof over my little family's head,"" she said. The pair relocated from the Gold Coast after Roman was awarded an ongoing soccer scholarship at Peregian Beach College. Having been with her last agent for four years, with all her tenant history ledgers and reliable employment history to show, Ms Ellery did not expect the rental search to be so challenging. ""Weeks and weeks kept ticking by and I still was not getting accepted or approved for anything,"" she said. ""And that's when, after a few conversations with real estate agents, I realised the demand in what's happening up here."" She was able to store her furniture with her mum while living in the caravan for three weeks until finally landing a rental. ""It was hard to be brave for [Roman]. It makes me a little bit emotional,"" Ms Ellery said. ""It consumed me … I was applying all day, every day."" After applying for 30 to 40 properties, it was not until she offered more rent and her ex-partner put his name on the applications, that she was approved. ""I absolutely bawled my eyes out,"" she said. ""I know I am paying way too much for what we have and that does feel unfair. ""It does worry me [for] single mums and single dads, or just one-wage earner families."" Anthony Ridley and his wife are down to the wire trying to find a new home for their five kids before the October 18 leave date on their current rental. ""It's been pretty crushing for myself and my wife … We're trying to sort of shield the kids away from it,"" he said. He and his family were given 90 days to vacate their home of five years when the owner decided to sell, but on one income and part-time salary they needed a month to get the bond and moving costs together. Mr Ridley said they submitted applications for about 20 to 25 properties in the last month, and were looking into break-leases and the National Rental Affordability Scheme. ""It's pretty nerve-wracking thinking that we're potentially on the verge of being homeless in a week and a half,"" he said. The option of renting a caravan or an Airbnb temporarily is financially unviable, considering they would have to put furniture in storage and pay higher weekly rates. ""We've been told very clearly by our current real estate, if we're not out by the 18th there'll be eviction,"" he said. ""If it was just me, I'd be OK … I could sleep in a tent under a bridge if I desperately needed to. ""But because I've got the kids, and especially because I've got younger kids, that's what makes it so, so hard and so stressful and so crushing."" In the process of spending three and a half months applying for rental homes, Becky Shandeliar had to put her things in storage and move into the property of an extended family member. ""It hasn't been ideal, but I've been very lucky to have that,"" she said. ""I've been living out of suitcases, and just constantly having that feeling of being deflated every time you get knocked back, or turning up to a property where there's literally 50 people lined up."" A longtime Sunshine Coast resident in the arts industry, Ms Shandeliar was terrified when she was told she'd have to move out of her temporary accommodation by the end of that week, which was later renegotiated. ""I thought I might have to sleep in the car with my cat … I've been on edge,"" she said. ""And there's a recession coming, so you think, 'Shit, if I don't get in some way soon, am I ever going to be able to get in anywhere? … And there's people with kids that are going through this. ""Seeing the [online rental] threads of people in just dire need of finding places and pleading with people, 'Please help me. I've got three days until I'm homeless', it's really confronting, and not what I would have expected to be happening on the Sunshine Coast this year.""

143,'Earthbag house' gives family fresh start after 'mini tornado' destroys home,house-and-home,"  Earthbag home gives family fresh start after fire, 'mini tornado' destroy two houses in three years An affordable ""earth home"", built from rendered clay and materials from the local area, has given a family a fresh start after a fire and then a storm destroyed two of their homes in the last three years. In February this year Claude Carter and his wife Andrea Pindan watched as their transportable home was torn down around them as they were preparing to go to sleep. A terrifying and fierce storm described as a ""mini tornado"" swept through their property in the remote Aboriginal community of Bawoorrooga, near Fitzroy Crossing in West Australia's far north. It was the second time the family had been struck by disaster in recent years. In 2017, their home burnt down and the dongas that were destroyed in February were their temporary accommodation. But heading into the next wet season, Mr Carter says the family are feeling stronger than ever. After three years' work they are finally moving into their new earthbag home on community, which they built themselves. ""Once our family built this house it made us stronger too — in life,"" Mr Carter said. ""When that storm came I was running around here, there was water laying all around, and the only safe place was to run to this house. ""Since I've moved in, I've been having a good sleep."" An earthbag home, also known as a superadobe home, has rendered walls that are filled with bags of locally sourced soil and rock materials. The homes are cheaper to make than typical homes, and have lighter environmental footprints. The opportunity for Mr Carter and Ms Pindan to build their home was brought about by the Foundation for Indigenous Sustainable Health (FISH), which has been working with locals to teach the skills of how to make an earthbag home. Chief executive of FISH Mark Anderson said the home was the first of its kind to be built in Australia's north. ""This is the first national prototype of a superadobe home in northern Australia, developed on the principle of co-design and co-construction, by the community for the community,"" he said. While it may look like a replica of Luke Skywalker's dwelling on Tatooine, this house is actually a council-approved residential abode made entirely out of bags filled with soil. Mr Anderson said the home's design aimed integrate the family's culture and withstand the extremes of the harsh desert environment. ""The house has been culturally designed for not only the integration of culture in the building but also for how the family lives,"" he said. ""And it has also been designed specifically for the environment for which is situated. ""When the cold desert winds blow, the house is warm inside, and during the heat of the day, when it can get to 40 degrees, the house is cool inside — it sits at an average temperature of between 24 and 26 degrees."" Mr Carter said he designed the house to bring parts of the country into his home, like flat rocks from his grandmother's country and circular windows to represent watering holes. ""I reckon my house is alive; it's always breathing and I feel like I'm down the river,"" he said. ""All my kids will really look after this house because we have built it together.

144,This family is fearing eviction after their landlord began calling in 'deferred rent',house-and-home,"  As parts of the country begin to lift restrictions on landlords kicking out tenants, Matthew Emptage and his family are waiting to see if they get the message no tenant wants to receive: an eviction notice. ""Not knowing if you're going to have a roof over your head is worrying,"" he said. ""We're a young family. We haven't got any immediate family we can move in with or [who can] take care of us."" Next week, Queensland becomes the first state to end its rental eviction moratorium, meaning tenants unable to pay rent could be out of their homes within weeks. Mr Emptage is a freelance video engineer who works at major music festivals, concerts and conferences. He's barely worked since March, when the COVID-19 pandemic brought the events industry to a devastating halt. With his household income down 60 per cent, he negotiated a major cut to his rent with his landlord, agreeing to pay a little more once his income was partially restored by the Federal Government's JobKeeper plan. He signed the papers in April and they said nothing about paying the money back later. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Things were going well until he got an email from his landlord. ""He was saying now we need to pay full rent again and start paying back the arrears — what he classes as the deferred rent. ""We didn't agree to a deferral, it was a reduction; a reduction is what we need."" The family are now facing a bill for thousands. On top of that, Mr Emptage's JobKeeper payments are about to be cut by the Federal Government, setting him back another $300 a fortnight. It's a triple-whammy that could start hitting renters right across the country when other states begin to follow Queensland and lift eviction moratoriums. Tasmania's emergency measures for tenants are set to end on December 1, while NSW and Victoria currently plan for protections to stay in place until March next year. Since the start of the pandemic, researchers have feared that renters could end up with large debts if they're offered a deferral in rental payments instead of a short or long-term cut to their rent. Because it has been left to individual landlords and tenants to negotiate agreements, no one knows for sure how many tenants have put off payments they will have to start paying back. New data accessed by researchers at the University of New South Wales and shared with RN Breakfast shows that in some states, up to one-in-three rental agreements that were altered have seen deferrals instead of cuts to rent. The data was provided by state departments to Chris Martin, a senior research fellow at the University of New South Wales' City Futures Research Centre. He said these agreements represent only a small fraction of those made between tenants and landlords and it is likely many tenants and landlords are confused about whether they have negotiated a reduction or a deferral. ""At a sector level, there will be a problem,"" he said. ""As moratoriums lift, if we have landlords looking to terminate tenancies at that point then we'll have a really serious housing eviction problem going on."" Dr Martin believes the higher deferral rates in New South Wales and Queensland than Victoria could be the result of the real estate industry in those states pushing harder for tenants to sign deferrals instead of rental cuts. That's been strongly disputed by the industry. But according to the Real Estate Institute of Australia president Adrian Kelly, even the real estate agents accept some owners will have to forgive debts that renters have built up because of deferrals. ""For those property owners who were able to hit the pause button on their mortgages but the mortgages still continue to accrue, unfortunately, the tenant will still have to come up with some way to pay the outstanding rent,"" he said. He said insurance policies mean many owners will be able to claim back deferrals that are never paid by renters but won't be able to get the money back if they negotiate a rent reduction. Mr Emptage and his family could be evicted from their Gold Coast home in the coming weeks. He doesn't blame the property owner, who is also struggling financially because of the pandemic. If he loses his home, it's not clear where his wife and two children will go. ""Employment prospects are poor at the moment for many people in my industry. You're going to look like a less-than-ideal tenant. ""It's going to be very difficult to find a new property to move into.""

145,Land is being snapped up on this Queensland island for as little as $16k but the locals are worried,house-and-home,"  It has long been known as a haven for retirees and those seeking the cheapest land in South East Queensland, but the Southern Moreton Bay Islands have seen a renewed interest in a COVID-19 property market. Property sales on Russell Island have effectively tripled in the last three months, while it is estimated that building activity has doubled. Real estate agent Chris McGregor said historically around 350 blocks would sell on the islands per year, but judging from monthly figures, sales were nearly three times higher. It is not uncommon to see bush blocks advertised as low as $16,000 on Russell Island. Cleared land and waterfront property are more expensive, but still a fraction of the price of equivalent land on the mainland. ""We have people who sell up in capital cities, and come and buy their house outright with money left over, and we also have a lot of owner builders,"" he said. Mr McGregor said property prices were rising before the pandemic, but are now at their lowest since 2007. ""We are selling between 50 and 60 blocks on Russell Island a month,"" he said. Mr McGregor believes the $25,000 home-builder grants that were announced as part of coronavirus economic stimulus packages are driving land sales. John Bonett runs an earthmoving and tree-clearing business based on Macleay Island, while servicing all of the Southern Moreton Bay Islands. He said the demand for his services had gone up, but complexities around zoning and moving machinery between islands had made the job difficult. He said he is worried issues around infrastructure and planning could limit the region's growth. The company is operating out of residential areas, with very limited industrial zoned land on Macleay Island. ""At this stage, we are working out of home ... and the best we can do at the moment is scatter the machines around to different employees, until we can work out what to do to better it,"" Mr Bonett said. ""We have nearly 20 people working for us, and I like to think we are doing our bit for the community with keeping those people employed. ""But it is getting harder and harder when I am not only battling the everyday costing of quoting and controlling the crew, but battling neighbours and council. ""There needs to be a lot less talk and a lot more action. This is not a new issue for us … this has been going on for eight years. ""If we were having our base camp on the mainland, for example, we would be bringing people over. ""That would be taking money off the islands where we want the infrastructure to grow … we want better shops, service stations and facilities for the kids."" Many of the roads on the islands remain unsealed, while there is no kerb and channel drainage and no access to sewage, with every new house built having to put in a septic tank. ""We have to move a bit quicker because the islands are moving quicker,"" Mr Bonett said. ""If people find it too hard to build here and too complicated and expensive, they will stop building and put properties back on the market. ""So, instead of seeing a housing boom like we are now, we will see a housing slump."" Redland City Councillor Mark Edwards said the area had been ""chasing its tail"" with infrastructure since the islands were transferred from the State Government administration to the Redland City Council. ""There is probably more building here right now than I have seen in the last 20 years,"" Councillor Edwards said. ""Probably in the last eight years we have done a lot of investment into the islands, which has been a double-edged sword, because when people come out to have a look, they see all the infrastructure that has been built, and that is driving our population growth up more,"" he said. ""The biggest fear for the community is, 'When does our population get too big?'."" He said the population had already outgrown infrastructure. ""We have a program that has been ongoing for a number of years to seal our roads,"" he said. ""We have about 35 kilometres of roads left, and hopefully that will be done in the next three or four years. ""We are spending over $35 million on our jetties, but how long will those jetties last for the current capacity if we have a greater population? ""The biggest fear is sewage. We are on septic here, and we know that when we get to certain levels of density those types of systems can't cope, so we need to look at sewerage and who is going to pay for that. ""When you put sewerage into a place the population goes up again because you get density."" Mr Edwards said the community needed to have a public discussion about what they would like in the future.

146,Riverland homes are hot property as many are snapped up before hitting the market,house-and-home,"  Riverland homes snapped up as soon as they hit the real estate market Property is in high demand in the Riverland, as low stocks force prospective buyers to move quickly to secure their dream home. Real estate agents are reporting properties being snapped up as soon as they are listed, even before they have been advertised. The demand has been attributed to low interest rates, fewer homes coming onto the market and an increased interest in local property and land since the introduction of the Government's first home owner's scheme. ""Probably 12 months ago there was a downturn in homes coming on the market and they were going either before they were going on the market or at the first open,"" Elders agent Kym Radloff said. It was about this time that Brooke Humble and her partner bought their first home in the Riverland. The home they chose was listed for sale on a Thursday morning, the couple inspected it that afternoon, and within a week they had put in their offer to buy the rural two-bedroom brick house. ""We certainly felt that we had to move quickly knowing the price bracket and knowing how competitive the market was at the time,"" Ms Humble said. The couple had been watching the market for 12 months, waiting to find their dream home. ""It was very competitive, but we were also quite picky with what we wanted,"" Ms Humble said. Ray White sales representative Karen Nash said she had also seen strong demand for Riverland properties. ""At the moment it is a seller's market,"" she said. ""Properties are going under contract quite quickly at the moment; some don't even make it to the market with any advertisement, others are snapped up prior to that and some are going quite quickly once they're marketed."" Mr Radloff said while demand had been high for 12 months, the pandemic had made homeowners hesitant to sell. ""Because of COVID, people might be a little cautious at the moment, but the couples that are putting their house on the market are very pleased with the response,"" he said. Both locals and people from outside the area are in the market for land and homes. Amanda Burnim committed to her own piece of real estate paradise just a month ago. She, too, said she experienced the need to move quickly. ""We knew if we found something that we loved, we needed to act a little faster. We couldn't be too relaxed about these things because things looked like they were moving faster,"" she said. She expanded her target area to include other towns because there were not many properties on the market. ""When we found this house, we went 'Ooh, I think this is it',"" Ms Burnim said. ""The space is right, the location is right — we got a little nervous, like we can't wait too long to actually make an offer, that if we want it, we're going to have to do it because it looks like things are moving quickly.""

147,'Everyone's struggling with it': Building industry calls for grant extension to ease demand,house-and-home,"  For decades, Australians have been working to attain the dream of buying a block of land and building their first home. This year, the Federal Government — in partnership with the WA Governments — offered grants of up to $45,000 to help foot the bill of building a home. For Melissah Craven and her husband and four children, the offer has turned their dream home into a very real possibility. ""It's a dream. It's 10 acres, on the river,"" she said. ""I've grown up on a station so having that much space close to town is phenomenal, really exciting."" But the dream might have to be put on hold. In order to take advantage of the grant, the Cravens must purchase their block before the end of 2020 and begin building within six months. Prospective home buyers around the state flocked to building companies in droves to try to secure blocks and lock in plans. New homes sales increased 211 per cent between May and June 2020 following the announcement of the grants, according to the Housing Industry Association of WA (HIA WA) That surge in demand has overwhelmed real estate agents, contractors, and builders like Warren Taylor. ""At the moment it's fairly chaotic,"" Mr Taylor said. ""It's put probably 12-18 months work into six months, so timelines have just totally gone out the window for everything. ""Everyone's struggling with it."" Where the finance for a house and land package was once finalised in 90 days, Mr Taylor said it was now taking more than 120 days. Those delays could burst the first-home dream bubble for families like the Cravens. If finance approvals fail to arrive within the next month, the land the Craven's have made an offer for could slip through their fingers. ""[We'd be] devastated. It would be a really big shame,"" Ms Craven said. ""The opportunity to build is huge and it would be devastating to lose it. ""We're going to have to apply for an extension [on the land sale] and hope the buyer is accepting to that."" The building industry is calling on the Government to extend the deadline until June 2021, in order to process the current demand for services. ""What the Government's done is great ... but they've got to extend it because it's unrealistic,"" Mr Taylor said. ""The timelines now is totally unrealistic, and it's putting pressure on the builders, and it's putting stress on the clients."" An extension to the building timeframe would relieve that pressure and reduce safety concerns, HIA WA executive director Cath Hart said. ""We'd like the land developers to be given until June 30, 2021 to title lots, and once that's done we'd like the builders to be given six months to commence after lots are titled,"" she said. ""Smoothing out the workflow like this will be important for the safety and sustainability of our workforce."" Last week the WA Government added $30 million to the building bonus fund, taking it to $147 million, but did not agree to extend the plan. ""We continue to closely monitor the situation. Any potential adjustments to the program are being carefully considered,"" the Premier's office said in a statement. In the meantime, Ms Craven said she would request an extension on the purchase of the land and keep her fingers crossed her family's dream could be kept alive.

148,People buying homes 'sight unseen' as Queensland's regional property market runs hot,house-and-home,"  Regional Queensland  is experiencing a real estate boom, with the market so hot some buyers are purchasing houses without even seeing them in person. Demand is high but prices are yet to rise Sold signs are littered across Bundaberg, a dramatic turnaround from a few years ago when some homes sat on the market for up to 12 months. Third-generation real estate agent Kurt Dempsey said he had never seen the market so busy, with interest coming from around the country and overseas. Mr Dempsey said the coronavirus pandemic was playing a major role, as city dwellers looked to move away from inner-city density for a more relaxed, open-air regional lifestyle. ""The real estate in Bundaberg is going off,"" he said. ""I think Bundaberg has so much to offer, and with all the madness that's going on in the [capital] cities, people are making the change to move to regional areas."" The spread of coronavirus across Australia could see unemployment reach about 10 per cent and house prices drop 20 per cent, says one economist. With its coastal location and proximity to Brisbane, Mr Dempsey believed it was not just rum and ginger beer that Bundaberg had to offer. The region produces 25 per cent of Australia's small crops, has consistently mild weather, and easy access to natural wonders like Fraser Island (K'gari) and the southern Great Barrier Reef. A median house price of $280,000 is also hard to beat. ""Now we are selling properties sight unseen; we are doing Skype tours,"" Mr Dempsey said. ""The value is there, people are just prepared to pay the price — this is the best it's ever been. ""I think they have needed a reason to move, and they have literally bought a house in Bundaberg to get out of the situation they are in."" Bundaberg is not the only centre where houses are selling quickly. About 200 kilometres to the west, buyers are snapping up homes in the North Burnett town of Monto for less than $100,000. Real estate agent Louisa Bambling has sold 40 houses this year, more than she ever expected. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Wide Bay's weekly email newsletter. Ms Bambling said she believed affordable prices and access to essential services made Monto attractive to retirees wanting a home base while traveling around Australia. ""Price point is definitely a part of it,"" she said. ""We've had a lot of sales under or around $100,000, but I think buyers have been looking to regional areas, and the community feel of Monto really captures them. ""They don't want to go to a small town where there is nothing. They want a hospital, doctor, chemist, supermarkets — they are all pretty important."" A few hundred kilometres south of Monto is the South Burnett town of Kingaroy, but it is not peanuts or the local bacon festival that are attracting people. Builder Peter Davidson said he had had his busiest-ever period as tree-changers looked to escape regions like Brisbane, Sydney or the Sunshine Coast. ""We've probably got 20 houses ahead of us, but we could have more,"" Mr Davidson said. ""I think people are trying to get away from the hustle and bustle. ""They can sell their house in Brisbane or Sydney and buy a cheap block of land, build a nice house and afford to retire."" Coronavirus recession leaves 1.4 million Australians in mortgage stress, almost 100,000 could default after JobKeeper ends The regional property boom has not pushed up property prices yet. However, the chief executive of the Real Estate Institute of Queensland, Antonia Mercorella, said as border restrictions eased, housing demand could jump higher, pushing up prices. ""We've seen modest house growth, we haven't seen that frenzy that Sydney and Melbourne has experienced, and that's not a bad thing,"" she said. ""It's been steady and reliable, but I do think in a post-pandemic world, our property market is set to do incredibly well."" Ms Mercorella said listings were down, creating higher demand. ""My advice to sellers is if you are waiting, pressing pause, don't do so,"" she said. ""If anything, that is our biggest challenge — we just don't have enough stock. ""The data is telling us it is a very good time to sell.""

149,Duke and Duchess of Sussex come good on promise to pay for home renovations,house-and-home,"  Prince Harry, Meghan pay back millions for Frogmore Cottage renovation Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have refunded British taxpayers 2.4 million pounds ($4.34 million) for the cost of renovating their UK home. The repayment was a commitment they made after announcing in January they would step back from royal duties. The refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, a house within the grounds of Queen Elizabeth's Windsor Castle, west of London, was criticised by some British media as too expensive. The repayment comes as Harry and Meghan, an American former actress, seek to forge new careers for themselves and attain greater financial independence. They announced last week they had signed a contract with Netflix to produce content for the streaming platform. Officially known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the couple has moved to California but will keep Frogmore Cottage as their home when they come back to Britain, under the terms of their agreement with the Queen, Harry's grandmother. ""A contribution has been made to the Sovereign Grant by The Duke of Sussex,"" a spokesperson for the couple said, referring to a pot of taxpayer money used to fund the monarchy. ""This contribution as originally offered by Prince Harry has fully covered the necessary renovation costs of Frogmore Cottage, a property of Her Majesty The Queen, and will remain the UK residence of The Duke and his family."" The terms of Harry and Meghan's contract with Netflix have not been disclosed. Prior to that, the bulk of their income was coming from the private estate of Prince Charles, Harry's father and the heir to the British throne.

150,Steve was about to buy his first home when hackers robbed him of $90k,house-and-home,"  Hackers foiled in attempt to steal $90,000 from church abuse survivor in email compromise scam At 54, Steve Fisher thought he was finally about to realise his dream of home ownership when hackers robbed him of $90,000. Mr Fisher had long thought he may not be able to buy a home in his lifetime. After being abused as a young boy by an Anglican priest, the quest for justice took a toll Mr Fisher faces a daily battle with PTSD, anxiety and depression. This year, he reached a compensation settlement with the Anglican Church and planned to use that money to purchase a home in Tasmania's north-west. ""I was happy with the settlement and then everything went south,"" he said. The conveyancing lawyer Mr Fisher used sent him an email with settlement details and an account to transfer the $90,000 to. After he made the transfer, Mr Fisher said he received a phone call from the lawyer asking where the money was - the email had been intercepted by a hacker and the account details changed. ""I felt so sick I actually thought I was going to vomit,"" Mr Fisher said. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said Australians lost more than $130 million last year because of email compromise scams. The organisation's Delia Rickard said the hacking Mr Fisher fell victim to was known as business email compromise scams, where hackers change bank details. ""They were the number one cause of loss in 2019,"" she said. Ms Rickard said the crime was becoming increasingly common, and that real estate buyers were a target. ""Conveyancing lawyers should always call and confirm, not just rely on an email,"" she said. Michael Connory, who runs a research organisation which looks into cyber events in Australia and New Zealand, said he had seen business email compromises double since this time last year. ""As soon as COVID hit, March 13, we saw numbers spike and they've continued to go up since then,"" Mr Connory said. In the 12 months to June this year, he said there had been a 127 per cent increase in these types of attacks, and that people were more vulnerable working from home using their own computers and WiFi. Mr Connory said people needed to make sure they ran the latest anti-malware and anti-virus programs and secured passwords with two or multi-factor authentication. He said people could also do regular credit score checks to make sure no-one had tried to steal their identities and request credit. Mr Fisher is one of the lucky ones. After discovering what had happened, he contacted the two banks he had transferred the funds from and Tasmania Police. Police traced the hacker to Queensland, even coming up with a name and address. But when they went to the property, no-one by the hacker's name was there. A Queensland Police spokesman said the person might not even be a real, but that an alert had been issued in case they emerged again. The investigation into Mr Fisher's case remains open. ""We were so lucky to get the money back, it was incredible, most people don't,"" Mr Fisher said. The money took four weeks to retrieve. Mr Fisher said during that time he didn't know if it was gone forever. ""I never want anyone to feel like we did, it was the longest month of my life,"" Mr Fisher said. Now happily ensconced in his unit, he said he feels like he's finally on a par with his peers. ""It's not winning the lottery, it's putting me back where I should have been if I hadn't been abused by an Anglican Priest,"" he said. 1800 Respect, National counselling helpline: 1800 737 732 Bravehearts, counselling and support for survivors of child sexual abuse: 1800 272 831 Child Wise, counselling provider: 1800 991 099 Lifeline, 24-hour crisis support and suicide prevention: 13 11 14 Care Leavers Australia Network: 1800 008 774 PartnerSPEAK, peer support for non-offending partners: (03) 9018 7872 Find support services in your state or territory.

151,Got a huge electricity bill? Here's what you can do,house-and-home,"  Many Tasmanians are receiving power bills that are much higher than they were last winter. The State Opposition said it was hearing stories from ""all corners of Tasmania"" of families receiving bills for thousands of dollars. For many, the reasons why are a combination of more time spent at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic and state-owned electricity company TasNetworks' decision to estimate electricity usage during April and May, also because of coronavirus. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic It is no surprise that households would receive higher bills during the COVID-19 pandemic: people who would not normally heat their homes during the day found themselves working from home, and people were also home in the evenings more often. The pandemic also led to TasNetworks suspending reading electricity meters in April and May. Bills for that period were estimated and based on a household's, or small business's, average usage from the same time last year. People were spending more time at home from late March, when coronavirus restrictions came into effect, so their usage was generally much higher than it was during the same period last year. Chief executive of Tasmania's electricity retailer Aurora Energy Rebecca Kardos said those factors meant many estimated bills were under-estimated. The additional usage is being added to bills for the current billing period. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Aurora has an energy support program which can help develop an affordable payment plan for customers struggling to pay their bill. It also provides tips to save energy and reduce electricity costs. Aurora also established a $5 million COVID-19 customer support program. Ms Kardos said there was still $4 million in the fund, which is being used to help people pay their energy bills. Support includes bill relief, waiving fees and charges, freezing debt and payment plans. University of Tasmania research fellow with the School of Technology, Environments and Design Philippa Watson has an interest in sustainable change in built environments, including energy efficiency. Dr Watson said there was a range of measures that would help reduce electricity use, particularly for houses built before about 2004 when energy efficiency legislation for new-build homes came into effect in Tasmania. She said renters often had the hardest time and were generally in poorer-quality housing, but could improve energy efficiency by draft-proofing doors and getting thick curtains. She said curtains could be expensive but second-hand shops were worth checking for cheaper options. ""There's a couple of major things that are really worth paying attention to. We know that heating and hot water are huge chunks of people's energy use in their home,"" Dr Watson said. She said people could check their heating and hot water use on their power bill if a heating and hot water tariff was applied, or she suggested taking shorter showers to see if that resulted in a lower bill. ""Heating's a really big one … a lot of houses in Tasmania are still using very old heaters or just inefficient heaters,"" she said. Dr Watson said a heat pump was an efficient form of heating. And as for the theory that leaving a heat pump running constantly was more efficient, she said that was most probably a myth. ""Heat pumps can actually warm up quite quickly and they're warming the air not people … turn your heat pump off while you're not there, I think it'll save you electricity. ""Each situation is different but that's pretty much where we've all got to — turn it off when you're not there."" According to Aurora Energy, a temperature of 21C is best and it also recommends closing doors to rooms that are not being used. Aurora also recommends turning heaters off overnight and, if possible, using timers to start them again in the morning. For people who are considering what sort of heating to install in their home, Dr Watson said expert advice was essential to find the right heating for their space. She said insulation also made a big difference to energy use.

153,Step inside a tiny home created in a 'secret' WWII ammunition bunker,house-and-home,"  Tiny home fashioned from 'secret' RAAF WWII ammunition bunker in Queensland David and Julie Hinds never set out to live in one of Australia's most unique homes, but thanks to a rainy winter day they ended up bunkering down in an abandoned World War II ammunition bunker in the middle of the bush. ""We had a grazing property nearby, and thought it'd be a nice addition to our property with 20 empty sheds,"" David Hinds said. It turns out that some of those 'sheds' were concrete-lined bunkers built into the side of a hill by the RAAF during WWII. ""Some of the neighbours used to store hay inside the bunkers, and the day we were inspecting the property it was cold and wet, and I looked inside the bunker and it was dry and warm. ""I think I must have said, 'wouldn't it be good to live in here', and the rest is history."" ""It's been a great adventure,"" Julie Hinds said. ""Although, there were challenges for the plumber,"" she laughed. ""And you can't get very good mobile phone reception inside at all!"" Ten inches of concrete line the walls around their home, with a metre of earth on top. ""You get used to curved walls,"" Mr Hinds explained. ""The radius is about 3 metres, and it's 12 metres long. And that's an efficient size for two people to rattle around in without bouncing off the walls."" They started by moving out the grain that had been left in the bunker and installing power and water, and then got to designing. ""We worked out where we would put the basic parts of the house — the kitchen, bathroom and bedroom — and away we went,"" Mr Hinds said. ""I suppose you'd call it an open-plan home."" Cupboards curve around the walls and help define different living spaces. ""It's much smaller than our old farm house, but I've put managed to put a lot inside,"" Ms Hinds said. ""I have a lot of paintings that I haven't been able to hang. Hanging paintings on a curved concrete wall is not easy, and that's why each end is crowded with paintings. ""It's got wonderful insulation, and I have a garden on the roof,"" Ms Hinds said. She says she misses hearing rain on the roof, ""which is a bit of a shame, but then again there's no hail damage"". ""But you don't want to bang your head on the wall, there is no give in it at all,"" she adds. There are no windows to clean, just a large glass door where heavy blast doors once stood. ""It's quite low-maintenance,"" Ms Hinds explained. ""It's dark and quiet at night, and I can cope with that."" ""One thing we do in summer is put sprinklers on and water the roof to cool the concrete down. That works quite well. ""It can be 26 (degrees Celsius) inside when it's 40 degrees outside in summer."" The base was known as RAAF Kowguran, halfway between Brisbane and a US Air Force base in Charleville. Both bases were not well-known to the public at the time. ""This was regarded as a secret base,"" Mr Hinds said. ""The townspeople would not have known what exactly what was going on, although the servicemen probably talked about it, and word gets around a small town,"" he laughed. Over the years, they have had visits from people who served on the base during the war. ""They lived in wooden barracks which were cool in winter and warm in summer,"" Mr Hinds explained. ""They complimented us saying 'we should have thrown the bombs outside and lived inside the bunkers ourselves!'"" As the weather starts to turn, Mr Hinds says his underground home is a nice place to bunker down during summer. ""There's no humidity at all inside,"" he explained. ""All that concrete helps dry the towels at night, and I think it has given me a dry sense of humour as well."" And if to prove his point, he continued: ""I suppose, we're already a metre underground, so when we're finished we'll just go a bit further down.""

154,What does the sale of a run-down cottage say about Tasmania's property market?,house-and-home,"  What does the sale of a run-down cottage say about Tasmania's property market? Run-down, ramshackle and filthy are some of the words that could be used to describe 17 William Street, West Hobart. But there is another word attached to the townhouse that might surprise those flicking through the pictures of it — sold. What is perhaps more shocking or depressing — depending on which side of the housing market you are on — is the price tag attached to it. On August 29, the two-bedroom cottage, built in about 1900 and described by the real estate company as ""a terrific opportunity for those willing to take on a project or re-create what once was"", sold for $435,000. Real estate agent Brad Stephens said more than 150 groups inspected the house in the four weeks before it was sold at auction on the weekend. ""Without doubt the location [drove interest] and the intrigue of a property in this tired condition,"" he said. ""It sparks the [enthusiasm for] DIY and reno inside people."" He said the fixer-upper was ""very much unique"" and proved to be popular across the country. ""They don't come along that often, properties that are in these kinds of conditions, but it's been one of the most popular properties I've sold to date,"" he said. ""It was the most viewed property in Tasmania on some of the major real estate websites and one of the most popular in Australia over the last couple of weeks."" Despite that, Mr Stephens said the property's final price ""definitely exceeded expectations"". ""It was always hard to tell. A property like this you don't know what it's going to sell for, but it certainly exceeded what my gut feel was,"" he said. Meanwhile, in the laid-back surfing suburb of Seven Mile, Annette and Steve Bourke have just sold their house for $1.2 million, a record for the suburb. ""You have to pinch yourself to make sure that it is real. We were just over the moon,"" Ms Bourke said. Mr Bourke said the price exceeded their expectations and they could not believe it when the house sold within four days. ""I found it very surreal,"" he said. ""I actually woke up the following morning, went out to the sign just to double check it, and then contacted [our real estate agent] Harry and said, 'It's not a dream?'"" It appears the state's housing market has defied predictions it would be severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is great news for homeowners, but not so great for those looking to finally crack into the market. Real Estate Institute of Tasmania president Mandy Welling said high demand coupled with low supply had helped the state weather the pandemic. ""We have a huge shortage of stock but a really active buying marketplace, and I think we've created a safe haven and that's seen the buyer confidence increase, "" she said. Ms Welling said while the state had experienced ""a real lull in listings"" that reluctance was disappearing. ""Even prior to COVID-19, we had a very, very buoyant market,"" she said. ""We did expect that to ease off, as we did around the entire country, and we just didn't experience that."" ""It's just been that steady improve. Just been that bit of a reluctance for more properties to come to market."" Ms Welling said while Hobart had remained reasonably stable, the north-west and north had actually seen slight increases. She believes unless Tasmania gets a second wave, or the market is flooded with properties, prices will remain stable. Core Logic's head of research, Eliza Owen, said Tasmania's property markets had been resilient in the downturn. ""There are definitely signs that as the economic downturn becomes more broad based, I think that will eventually filter into Tasmania property values as well,"" she said. ""As we see border closures, weak levels of consumer sentiment and reduced social consumption and economic demand, we see new listings and sales volumes become subdued and property prices gradually trend down as well."" But she said one aspect of the Hobart market did take a significant hit. ""It has been more impacted in the rental market really more than any other capital city, with Hobart rents down 2.5 per cent since the start of the pandemic,"" she sad. Ms Owen said Tasmania might see some declines in sales either later this year or early next year, but it was ""likely to be fairly mild"".

155,Canberra's house prices are reaching record highs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here's why,house-and-home,"  Canberra's house prices are reaching record highs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here's why The global health crisis is crippling economies across the world and Australia's real estate market is feeling it too — but not in Canberra, where values are going up. Total stock levels of property for sale in the ACT is currently at a five-year low, according to CoreLogic data. In July, Australian home prices fell 0.6 per cent — continuing a downward trend in the nation's property markets. But in the ACT, low supply and high demand is driving prices up. The national capital bucking the trend has caught people like Farhan Abbasi by surprise. ""I was thinking with COVID the prices would go down just like Melbourne and Sydney,"" Mr Abbasi said. ""It seems the market here in Canberra is quite consistent, and in fact I have seen a hike"". Mr Abbasi is a first home buyer who was hoping to bag a bargain, finding a property big enough for him, his wife and his child. His budget is around $750,000, but in this climate he said it would seem that was not enough. ""I do a 9-to-5 job but maybe I have to look for an alternative as well,"" he said. Yes and no. Canberra real estate agents say with a lot of buyers, houses are being snapped up fast — many above market value. But they say with not many sellers on the market, those who decide to sell could end up in the same position as those who are looking for a place. ""The current market in Canberra is very drastic,"" real estate agent Shaun Iqbal said. ""Not many people are moving and they are not selling because they can not go anywhere. ""When there is no stock, obviously the demand and supply factor kicks in and the prices in the Canberra market are rising at the moment."" Real estate agents say COVID-19 has sparked a new wave of enquiries from Australians interested in moving from capital cities to regional areas. Mr Iqbal said even though values were going up, there was still a lot of uncertainty from homeowners about what the future holds. ""I am spending the whole day chasing listings and people are not ready to list and sell,"" he said. ""I am working long hours, making lots of phone calls and constantly answering inquiries from buyers. ""As soon as we list a property in their price range we let them know, but currently it is short supply everywhere you look."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Not a global health pandemic, apparently. While governments have agreed that renters struggling with the COVID-19 recession shouldn't be evicted, they're not getting much other help, writes Daniel Ziffer. Since the onset of the coronavirus crisis in March, property values in Canberra have risen by 1.3 per cent. This might seem counterintuitive, but CoreLogic's head of Australian research, Eliza Owen, said COVID-19 had not impacted Canberra as badly as other jurisdictions. ""The most resilient market has definitely been the ACT,"" Ms Owens said. ""Jobs have been relatively stable in the higher paid sectors and in the public and safety and administration sector employment has declined less than one per cent. ""There have been increases in some sectors as well."" Real estate agent Peta Barrett said it was understandable that Canberrans with relatively steady jobs were looking to take advantage of record-low interest rates. ""Canberra's always a bit funny because of the public service,"" she said. ""We've got a lot of people with a bit of money around and they can't travel at the moment."" But she said the news that Canberra's housing market was going against the grain was not something bargain hunters wanted to hear. ""There is so much competition,"" she said. ""There are a few people being let down and missing out."" According to research from the Reserve Bank of Australia, for every one percentage point reduction to the cash rate, property values may increase by eight per cent over the following two years.

156,"Homeless shelter 'no longer required', Mayor says, but replacements not yet in place",house-and-home,"  Bunbury homeless shelter 'no longer required', Mayor says, but replacements not yet in place A regional Western Australian city is set to rip out a homeless shelter it set up just over a year ago in the CBD, saying it has become ""a health and safety risk"" and is ""no longer required"". In June last year, the City of Bunbury, south of Perth, spent $15,000 on an open-faced shelter in a carpark in the centre of town. At the time the council was frustrated with people sleeping at the local concert area, the Graham Bricknell Music Shell, and spoke to the homeless community to come up with the idea. ""It wasn't ideal, I admit, but it was something we had to do to provide some form of protection for them,"" Mayor Gary Brennan said. The shelter is set to be removed in the next couple of weeks. ""While the shelter provided a short-term solution during a time of need, a number of significant health and safety risks for those using the shelter, service providers, staff who service and attend the site, and the wider community have been identified more recently,"" the city said in a statement. Ann Dunstall, a support worker at drug and alcohol action group Doors Wide Open, spent almost a year homeless in Bunbury herself. She said while it was unfortunate the shelter will be removed, there have been several violent incidents at the site. ""There have been some assaults that have actually taken place there. Not only to some of the staff who have actually gone down there to service the shelter but also to the rough sleepers,"" Ms Dunstall said. ""Recently, it has become quite a common occurrence. ""We can't have that happening."" Local member Don Punch said one of the biggest issues with the shelter was that it was unsupervised. ""People get very territorial over space so you can have issues of conflict and fighting about the area,"" Mr Punch said. ""It was built with good intentions but it also has some disadvantages."" There has been heightened community concern about homelessness in Bunbury over recent years. It prompted the WA Government to step in with an offer to subsidise rentals for up to 20 Bunbury families as part of its Housing First initiative. The program also matches clients with a caseworker to help them though issues like poverty, trauma, or addiction. ""If you just find a place for someone to live and they haven't got that support it's a very difficult challenge,"" Mr Punch said. A State Government-funded plan to build so-called tiny houses in Bunbury was also flagged in 2018 to combat homelessness but was delayed due to planning issues. Despite neither homelessness initiative in place yet, Cr Brennan flagged them as reasons why the temporary homeless shelter was ""no longer required"". ""There have been comprehensive discussions with all of those key stakeholders involved in direct contact with the homeless,"" the Mayor said. ""I'm grateful for the fact that they feel that there's no need for the shelter and these people can be accommodated in proper accommodation."" The Housing First initiative is expected to roll out in coming weeks, but the lead agency of the tiny houses trial Accordwest recently admitted the trial could still be several months away.

158,'Sometimes people don't believe it': Inside Australia's only 'bubble house',house-and-home,"  Australia's only 'bubble house' goes on the market in Ipswich Most people think Ipswich architect Graham Birchall is joking when he tells them he lives in a bubble house. ""Sometimes people don't believe it when I tell them where I live,"" he said. Mr Birchall said the design was something that had to be seen to be believed. ""There are 11 domes in all ranging from four metres in diameter to eight metres in diameter, it has 16 rooms over three levels so it's rather large,"" he said. ""It's got two libraries, a movie theatre, and circular windows that open and close with an iris. ""I love it because it is so spacious. You don't even notice the ceiling and the spaces just flow on from one to the other."" The Ipswich architect built what is known as 'the bubble house' in Karalee, west of Brisbane, in the 1980s after an idea he had during his final university thesis. Mr Birchall researched ferrocement — a mixture of iron and cement not usually used for homes — as part of his architecture degree. ""I thought, let's see if it works and we designed the house,"" he said. ""It took 10 years to build, we built on weekends from Father's Day 1983 to Father's Day 1993. ""There were a lot of challenges — we had to invent a lot of tools like a curved ladder to build it. ""We calculated it all manually as well, one dome took six pages of manual math calculation to work out. ""It was a lot of fun to do."" ""Half of it is the Flintstones and the other half looks more like the Jetsons."" Mr Birchall even contacted NASA for some tips on design and said they responded and offered some tips. ""I knew they had something like it on their mars rover and they sent the drawings to me, I was surprised they answered the phone call,"" he said. Mr Birchall said it made the tough choice to put his property on the market on Monday after decades of living and working from his dream home, but said he was excited to move closer to his grandchildren. The architect said he was already planning to design a new, equally unusual home. ""It won't be exactly like this but it won't be typical,"" he said ""I don't have too many straight rulers, but you have to have a bit of fun when you're designing. Real Estate agent Helene Shephard said hundreds of people had already contacted her about the listing.

159,Can you make your wood heater better for the environment?,house-and-home,"  Expert calls for government regulation of wood heaters to reduce smoke pollution Wood fires are a cosy way to stay warm in winter, but making this an environmentally friendly heating option for your home means burning the right firewood. John Todd has 30 years in wood heater research and understands better than most for how to make them burn more efficiently. He says that while a good heat pump or reverse-cycle air conditioner have low emissions, in Tasmania ""wood heaters are only marginally worse"". Getting hold of good firewood can be a challenge, especially late in winter, as wood needs to be air dried for at least a year. Professor Todd said the water content of firewood affected its heating ability and the amount of smoke it created. ""Too wet or too dry is a problem,"" he said. Professor Todd says the most efficient firewood to burn is air dried for 12 to 24 months since harvest and has a moisture content of 16 per cent. Whereas kiln-dried wood has a moisture content of 10 per cent or less which makes the wood burn too fast in wood heaters. ""The heaters are designed to only let a certain amount of air in, so kiln-dried wood is trying to burn faster than the air supply in the heaters allow,"" Professor Todd said. ""You get gases coming out of the wood escaping as smoke if the wood is too dry."" He said firewood that was not let left to dry enough was inefficient. ""If the wood is too wet … it reduces the temperature causing a lot of energy to go into evaporating moisture,"" Professor Todd said ""The energy is not going into the heat so the wood heater's temperature is too low and more smoke comes out."" Professor Todd said that Christchurch in New Zealand has a very serious problem with wood smoke pollution, similar to how Launceston once was. ""In New Zealand they have been very strict setting government controls on new wood heaters and on forcing the replacement of old wood heaters when houses are sold,"" he said. While there are standards that industry is meant to comply with in Australia, as with any industry, one of the big issues is that there is very little enforcement. ""We could do something here but it does require regulation and control,"" Professor Todd said. ""I don't think self-regulation where there is no government intervention ever works really well,"" he said. Provided people were careful where their firewood came from, Professor Todd said people choosing to heat their homes with wood heaters was sustainable, but the smoke was problematic. ""Wood heaters are good from a carbon footprint point of view, but from an air pollution point of view we have a serious problem in Tasmania and across Australia,"" he said. ""Firewood is genuinely sustainable either by replanting or by natural regrowth. ""There are a small number of farmers that specifically grow firewood commercially in Tasmania and, even though trees are not replanted, the natural regrowth is maintaining these forests naturally."" In Australia, people often overloaded their wood heaters before going to bed, which could be inefficient and created excess smoke, according to Professor Todd. ""They also turn the air supply right down and that leads to high pollution levels,"" he said. Professor Todd said while you could load up your wood heater with firewood to keep your home warm all night, there was an efficient way to do it. ""You must leave the air supply fully open and get it [the fire] going really well before you turn it down,"" he said. ""That means running it for 15 to 20 minutes and by doing that, you significantly reduce the amount of smoke coming out overnight."" While Professor Todd acknowledges that wood heaters have a different ambiance to other heaters, the smoke they create is a problem. ""Unfortunately, the beautiful open fire gives off considerably more emissions than an enclosed heater.""

160,"Hatherley House, built on a foundation of gold, could be yours for a small fortune",house-and-home,"  Launceston's grand Hatherley House up for sale at around $3 million A grand, historic mansion that's been owned by some of Launceston's most influential individuals is on the market. Hatherley House in High Street dates back to the 1860s, and is listed on the National Estate and Tasmanian Heritage registers. Overlooking Launceston, the mansion is one of the city's most prominent properties. President of the Heritage Protection Society, Lionel Morrell, said it had been home to many esteemed families over the years. ""Hatherley was built, I believe, just prior to the beginning of 1867 by the son of the mayor, Henry Dowling, who lived in the original house at the bottom of the garden,"" he said. ""It was a piece of land that was certainly dating from a grant in 1827, but the actual house was built by Mayor Dowling's son."" It was then sold to Frederick Grubb, who was one of the major shareholders of the Beaconsfield gold mine in northern Tasmania. ""He extended the house, a two-storey extension creating a ballroom and in due course that passed on to his son,"" Mr Morell said. ""It was the gold money from Beaconsfield that funded much of the wealth of Launceston and that continued on for several generations. ""All of the city buildings with their elaborate Victorian facades were in fact changes to the earlier, more primitive Georgian buildings that had been built, so those grand Victorian facades and edifices were all as a result of the gold money flowing from the Beaconsfield gold mine."" The home was then owned by the Stackhouse family, relatives of the Grubbs, and then sold to a magistrate in the early 1950s. It was also owned by Dr Bob Green, who was the zoologist at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery. After that it was set up as a boutique hotel. Current owner Jack Birrell said it had been a privilege to own the property for the past 10 years. ""The property goes back to 1827, and it reads like a bit of a 'Who's who?' of colonial Australian history,"" he said. ""You kind of become really acutely aware that you have a commitment to others in the past, the present and the future. ""You're actually living in a time capsule that tells stories about events and places across time, across parts of the world. ""You've got to be enthusiastic about caring for it and passing it on."" As an architect who also has his business based at Hatherley House, Mr Birrell said he was constantly amazed by the building's architecture. ""Not a day goes by where you're not blown away by the quality of light, the materials, marble from Africa and marble from Italy, on fireplaces hand painted with mercury,"" he said. ""There are technologies [and] techniques in this building that almost don't exist anywhere else."" Mr Birrell thinks it has the largest tessellated tile floor in a residence in Australia, and is hoping to sell the building for more than $3 million. In 2000, it sold for $550,000, and in 2011 it changed hands for $1.9 million. Mr Morrell said the Dowling family played an important role in the development of Launceston. ""They helped establish the Baptist Church, and one of the notable sons of the family was Robert Dowling, the great colonial portrait painter who had an illustrious career when he returned to England,"" Mr Morrell said. In recent years, period features have been kept in renovations to provide luxury accommodation. It has also been used to host tourism, arts and music events. Mr Morell said it was designed to impress. ""It is certainly ostentatious, from the chimney pots to the tessellated tiling in the hallway, and the grandeur of a lot of the interior plasterwork,"" he said. ""It is one of three or four houses in Launceston that actually had ballrooms, and that of course was the great social venue for these major prominent families in the city.""

161,"Rats are nesting in Gold Coast cars, causing thousands of dollars' damage",house-and-home,"  Rats take up residence in Gold Coast car engines, cause damage in the thousands of dollars Never mind snakes on a plane; it's rats in cars you have to be worried about. Rats on the Gold Coast have been wreaking havoc and causing thousands of dollars worth of damage to vehicles. Palm Beach mechanic Glenn Joyce said it was not uncommon to see rats that have been nesting in cars during this time of year. ""When it's cooler weather they seek out warmer places to live,"" he said. ""Of course you come home late at night, park your car, and little do you know you've got these rodents climbing into your car and having a warm place to sleep for the night."" Mr Joyce says typically it is people who live close to the water who are at risk of an infestation. ""Certainly people who live around places like Tallebudgera Creek, Currumbin Creek and on any of the canals probably see that as well,"" he said. Mr Joyce said the result of rats nesting in a person's vehicle was an expensive problem to fix. ""In most cases people will see an immediate cost of hundreds of dollars of damage,"" he said. ""But in extreme cases it can be thousands of dollars of damage."" Mr Joyce says said cars that have an infestation of rats will likely have any rubber in the engine chewed out. ""For some strange reason they like chewing on the rubber components of your vehicle; hoses, the insulation around your wiring,"" he said. Mr Joyce says that is where the main problems starts, because modern cars are fully computerised with more wiring components that are prime real estate for rats seeking warmth. ""That causes a lot of problems with ECU (Engine Control Unit) monitoring and you and your computer running correctly through your vehicle,"" he said. If you want to know whether rats have taken up residence in you car there are a couple of tell-tale signs. Mr Joyce said if the engine light remained on or if there were physical signs of rats then you could have a problem. ""If you look in that engine bay you might be able to see their husky kind of bed,"" he said. ""Of course with that you will have the rat droppings as well."" Mr Joyce said people have tried different methods to eradicate their unwanted rodent pets, which included leaving their car bonnet open to cool the engine, or leaving rat baits in the car, however he warned that it was best to get expert advice as rat baits should not be left near a heat source.

162,How do you know when you're officially Tasmanian?,house-and-home,"  Think you're Tasmanian? You'll have to tick a few of these things off first There's no doubt Tasmania is a unique place loved for all its quirks. So we asked our ABC Hobart Facebook audience what makes a person a true Tasmanian. Here is what they said. Irene Kirczenow said the mark of a true Tasmanian was being able to ""go out on an 11-degree day in a T-shirt and think it's actually quite warm"". Unsurprisingly, the ""Tassie tuxedo"" featured heavily in the comments. But apparently having just one might not be enough to earn you kudos of fellow Tasmanians. ""'A' puffer jacket? I think I have three plus a vest. The coat rack by the front door looks like we could equip ourselves for an Antarctic expedition at a moment's notice,"" Libby Wilkinson said. The other Tasmanian uniform? ""Thongs in winter with a beanie,"" Melissa Bessell Wear said. According to other comments, it's not good enough to simply withstand the cold, you have to enjoy it too. Lauren Foreman noted it's important to ""tell everyone when there's snow on the mountain"" when it's there, while Leila Maclaren said you should be able to ""talk about [Bridgewater] Jerry like he's your best mate"". The best thing about living in Australia's smallest state is never having to travel far. Rachael Hamill put it nicely: ""[You know you're living in Tasmania when] you can visit the beach and the mountains on the same day and still get home for lunch"". Christie Berechree says it means you are very familiar with the public loo at Campbell Town. Despite many moving here to avoid the traffic chaos in bigger cities, Kristy Wright said you're not living in Tasmania until you ""complain about the 15-minute commute to work"". And because you've spent quite a bit of time on the road, as Mitch Anthony said, you couldn't possibly be living in Tasmania until you have seen ""a 30-year-old Hilux carrying double its GVM in illegally obtained firewood"". Many commenters were adamant that you couldn't be a Tasmanian unless you called your heating unit a ""heat pump"". And obviously, as put by Alexandra Sumner, you're used to ""referring to the architecturally designed showpiece that your rich uncle owns on the East Coast as the 'shack'"". You also have to know your Dutch Creams from your Pink Eyes. Jan Gibbs said part of being Tasmanian is ""knowing the names and best ways for cooking potatoes. Not just using potatoes as a generic term"". Liam Connor said you are truly living in Tasmania when you ""explain to outsiders what turbo chook is"". Most importantly, you know you're living in Tassie when you have unmatched pride about your home. ""Get mad at mainland television for thinking Tassie is not part of Australia."" — Fran Spears ""Always ask in restaurant: 'Are they Tasmanian scallops?'""  — Joan Parker You've ""experienced the things that take your breath away: the places, the people, the pristine beaches, the cleanest air & water.

163,Should solar panel owners pay for the privilege of selling their power?,house-and-home,"  Rooftop solar panel owners could be getting charged fees to sell energy back to the grid Householders with rooftop solar panels and batteries have reacted with fury to proposals which could see them charged for exporting power to the electricity grid. Over the past decade, state governments have actively incentivised households to feed their solar into the grid, by offering generous feed-in tariff schemes. Most have now closed to new entrants. But now, welfare groups and transmission company SA Power Networks (SAPN) have asked the Australian Energy Markets Commission to change market rules to allow charging of household exporters. They argue that under the current system, households without solar could be unfairly burdened with the cost of augmenting power networks to cope with the increase of new panels, which is already placing a strain on the network in states with heavy solar penetration like South Australia. SA Power Networks spokesman Paul Roberts said the state's grid is already reaching its capacity to support household solar networks. ""Actual customers themselves are seeing that their inverters are turning off at times because of voltage rising in the network,"" Mr Roberts told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""And the renewables industry is getting concerned that networks like ours will have to impose zero limits on new customers so that we can accept those customers, but they won't be able to export. ""So there needs to be a solution to that."" Mr Roberts said SAPN's proposal would likely see $10-$30 added to the annual electricity bill of a solar customer, and would not change the overall amount of money that the company was allowed to charge customers. He said the current proposal would see existing solar customers excluded from paying, but conceded that could change. The idea has drawn a furious response from many solar panel owners, including Adelaide man Michael Preus. ""People will just disconnect them, and tell them to get stuffed, that's what I would do,"" he said. Mr Preus said he had installed his household solar PV system to save money and help the environment, but was now questioning his investment. ""We'll never, ever in our lifetime recoup our investment, the return is just not there."" But welfare groups including the Australian Council of Social Service and St Vincent de Paul Society are backing the move to charge people who export power. Under the rule change proposal put forward by ACOSS (ACOSS) and the Total Environment Centre, solar owners would only pay if they chose to increase their export limit beyond a base level. The proposal puts forward modelling which suggests that under current conditions, solar owners would be better off paying a small amount to make additional exports. SA Council of Social Service Chief Executive Ross Womersley said without change, households who cannot afford solar could be unfairly penalised for the cost of maintaining electricity supply. ""Those non-solar households that don't have the benefits of solar will be left holding the grid and bearing the additional cost,"" he said. SA Power Networks spokesman Paul Roberts likened the charge to proposals to taxing electric vehicles, which are not contributing to petrol excise. ""Governments are really thinking about how are we going to get people who buy electric vehicles to contribute to road funding,"" he said. ""And in the same way, I think we should be thinking about that for solar customers."" The Grattan Institute's Director of Energy Tony Wood said the problem should have been fixed years ago. ""We should have got this right in the first place,"" he said. ""It does seem fair that you should pay for the use of that grid, otherwise the people who are not using solar are effectively subsidising your solar system. ""They're not doing it deliberately. ""These people who have got solar are not looking for a free ride, but it's just a reflection of the history of this thing.""

164,From train to tiny house: Tasmanian family transforming 130yo carriage into a modern home,house-and-home,"  Tasmanian couple's tiny house plan for 130-year-old train carriage shunting along When Ash Barwick and Jake Williams-sims transported their new 130-year-old train carriage home to Tasmania's Gravelly Beach on a truck, bits of it fell off on the highway. ""They just missed our car, but I went back and picked it all up,"" said Mr Williams-sims. A year on, the couple are absorbed in a dramatic restoration of the carriage, which will see it transformed into a tiny house for their family's new self-sufficient life. ""She's in pretty rough condition, but we're going to make it into home."" For years before the couple acquired it, Mr Williams-sims had been admiring the carriage as it sat in a backyard in Westbury. Then came a stroke of luck, after the couple had arranged to do some gardening for the carriage's owner and saw that he had put it up for sale. ""We said 'We'll buy it off you', and he said, 'Well, you can do the work cheaper, and we'll do a bit of a trade',"" Ms Barwick said. ""So yeah, [we] took it home,"" said Mr Williams-sims. Curious about its history, Ms Barwick contacted the Tasmanian Transport Museum, which provided blueprints and photographs of the carriage in its prime. The couple learned that their carriage had been one of 52 carriages in the DB class, which transported passengers, freight and livestock across Tasmania from the 1890s to the 1980s. Having secured carriage ""DB15"", they are now keen to find out what happened to the others, and have discovered another one is also undergoing a conversion. ""We've come into contact with another lady who's got the DB19,"" Ms Barwick explained. ""She's living in it, doing the same thing as us."" While restoration of the carriage had to be delayed for many months, work is now well underway. ""Jake took the roof off, and we haven't stopped since,"" said Ms Barwick. ""We've stripped the roof and resealed it with some waterproof membrane, installed a wood heater and the flue, replaced one outside wall, and done two original window frames."" It is a project that the couple, who have two children and run their own gardening and landscaping business, expect will keep them busy after-hours for a year. ""I knock off work and go back to work,"" said Mr Williams-sims. The finished 12.8-metre carriage will act as living room, kitchen and bathroom for the family, while a converted shipping container might serve as bedrooms. The plan is for these small living quarters to be installed on a block of land big enough to support the family. ""Ultimately we do want to be self-sufficient … to be able to grow all of our own food,"" said Ms Barwick. ""We travelled around Australia in a caravan for four and a half months two years ago … and it inspired us to live a bit more simple,"" said Mr Williams-sims. Unfortunately for Ms Barwick and Mr William-sims, living self-sufficiently is an increasingly popular goal among land buyers in Tasmania, and acquiring a block to put the carriage on has proved difficult. It had become more of an issue since coronavirus struck, they said. ""Since the COVID thing, everybody's gone towards that self-sustainable sort of living,"" said Ms Barwick. ""I think a lot more people are on track to that sort of lifestyle, after being stuck in their little house in suburbia. ""They want to grow their own food."" For now, the partly restored carriage sits where it has for the past year, in Ms Barwick and Mr William-sims's front yard. ""We were a bit worried that the council was going to make us move it as soon as we put it here,"" laughed Mr Williams-sims. ""But no, everybody loves it, they all stop in and have look."" ""We get quite a few [elderly] people saying 'I travelled on this train when I was a young boy,'"" Ms Barwick said. ""They're just like, 'Wow, this is beautiful.'"" For Ms Barwick and Mr Williams-sims, the greatest joy in doing up the carriage is giving an old ""broken"" thing new life. ""We need to appreciate what we have … and we teach the kids, if it's broken, hey, let's fix it,"" said Ms Barwick. ""And what better way to put those words into action than by restoring this beautiful train carriage … that's going to be our house. ""It's so cool, I can't wait.""

165,Want to cut down your power bill? Find out where your home is bleeding energy,house-and-home,"  Want to save on power bills? It could be as simple as stopping air from escaping your home Air leaks are the biggest barrier to keeping your home warm in winter and cool in summer, according to an energy efficiency expert. Michael Ambrose, a senior experimental scientist with the CSIRO, is blunt when describing the energy efficiency of Australian houses. ""Australian homes rule the roost when it comes to leakiness,"" Mr Ambrose said. ""It's never really been considered an issue. ""We are lucky in that we have a very temperate climate, but means that we haven't really seen the need to address it."" But with many of us spending more time at home than ever in the depth of winter, addressing the problem now could help decrease power bills. ""Many things make a house leaky,"" Mr Ambrose said. ""But the main thing is where we have got gaps between our nice air-conditioned indoor space to the outdoor space — under doors, around windows, inside cupboards. ""If you have an older home that is raised off the ground, not on a slab, it can be through floorboards."" It's also worth checking cupboards, particularly in kitchens and laundries, for hidden leaks. ""[Gaps] can also be hidden away in cupboards where old services were connected — a dishwasher, washing machine,"" Mr Ambrose said. ""When they are removed the piping is removed and often the hole that the services came through is left there and no plugged up, and air can escape. ""Go looking, try to find those holes in the laundry and kitchen, you can just get expanding foam [to plug them]."" If they are not used for a roaring fire in winter, fireplaces and chimneys can also be major source of air loss and draughts. ""A lot of heat gets lost up the fireplace, if it's not in use,"" Mr Ambrose said. ""Some people block their fireplaces off with a cover and you can actually get a chimney balloon that expands and blocks off the chimney. ""You've just got to remember to take it out if you want to light a fire."" Another easy spot to target is the air vents in ceilings and walls of older homes. The vents were a building requirement back in the days when unflued gas heaters were common, and authorities were concerned that the gases they released, such as carbon monoxide, needed an escape route. ""But with new heaters and flued systems the requirement for vents was removed, that's why you don't see them in new homes,"" Mr Ambrose said. ""If you don't have an old style heater then we do suggest to people that they can actually cover up those wall vents because they are large source of leaks."" Mr Ambrose said creating a completely passive, sealed home is an expensive exercise, but products that plug leaks can be bought cheaply from hardware shops. He suggests door snakes to block draughts and weather sealing strips that can be stuck around door frames are worthwhile. Speaking to Jessica Strutt on ABC Radio Perth, listeners shared their own tips on how to plug leaks at home. Anon: ""We have a heritage listed home built in 1925, which has been rehabilitated to be passive. It is nearly airtight, have huge amounts of insulation and the windows etc all work amazingly. We have 3.3 metre high ceilings, floorboards etc. It is better than any modern house I have ever lived in."" Rosie: ""If you have an old fireplace that is not used a lot of warm air escapes from it. Best to block it up during winter."" Dan: ""One of the first jobs I did on our home in the hills was insulate underneath our floorboards. Our home is on stumps and although access was tough it has made a huge difference."" Donna: ""I lived in Minneapolis for eight years where the winters can hit -40C. I learnt to put plastic cling film over our windows in winter, sealing it with a hair dryer to stop any form of fresh cold air coming into the home. Mr Ambrose suggested using the most efficient heating you can. ""Blow heaters are pretty inefficient. Old gas heaters can be pretty inefficient as well,"" he said. ""The most efficient heaters are actually your air conditioner, if it's reverse cycle. They are a heat pump, the same technology as your fridge. ""For every unit of energy they bring in, they are able to put out about three times as much energy out.""

166,Are we grey-washing our suburbs to be boring and bland?,house-and-home,"  Queensland house painter sees 50 Shades of Grey in 'Hampton-style' suburban makeover For many house painters, 50 shades of grey is not a book — it's their every day. As homes are built or renovated, painters report that grey and white are often considered the 'it' colours in suburbs across the country. Queensland house painter Rob Jenner, who has been in the business for more than 20 years, said he was painting more and more houses grey. ""I have a colour consultant who has done the next three jobs, and they will be grey as well. ""Grey is here to stay, like beige was 10 years ago."" He said ""Hampton-style"" grey and white homes had created interesting paint colour names, such as Mountain Duck Quarter and Lexington Quarter. ""Dark colours fade but grey doesn't, and it's neutral. It's not like white as it's easy to clean and hides many sins, like dirt."" Mr Jenner added that the cheaper price point of grey shades had made the colours popular choices for townhouses and affordable accommodation. Artist Jan Jorgensen, known for her urban landscape paintings, lamented the grey-washing, saying it made for ""bland"" streetscapes. ""Everyone is painting their houses grey and white. Even their fences are white. And the neighbour's house is grey,"" she said. ""I look at the hills of Paddington [in Brisbane] and everything is bland and non-colour. ""We used to have red and emerald-green roofs, which are disappearing, and it's heartbreaking."" Things do not seem to be changing anytime soon, though. Colour consultant Andrea Lucena-Orr said grey had dominated the market for nearly a decade and she expected it to continue. ""A lot of it is driven by fashion and the interior market generally,"" she said. ""The colours are warming up, with a browner base rather than grey, so there is hope. ""There will be more warmish tones as well as a bit of a greenish undertone in many of the grey shades which can catch the light different."" Ms Lucena-Orr said it was difficult to consistently come up with new colour names, with 90,000 already in her company's database. ""Eight out of 10 colours we would come up with today would be taken — we're into double-barrel naming now, with fun names like Self Destructive or Cinnamon Sand,"" she said. ""In theory, though, we will still see grey for a while yet.""

167,"Hydrogen didn't work for the Hindenburg, but could it work for households?",house-and-home,"  Hydrogen didn't work for the Hindenburg, but can the gas be safely supplied to Australian homes? Ever since the Hindenburg airship disaster of 1937, hydrogen gas has suffered from an image problem. The inferno killed 36 people at Lakehurst, New Jersey, and effectively brought to an end the era of the passenger airship, as well as leaving lasting doubts about hydrogen as a source of fuel. The Hindenburg didn't rely on highly-flammable hydrogen for power, but for lift, because the gas is lighter than air. Despite that disaster, there have been attempts in recent years to safely harness hydrogen's flammable properties, and develop it into an environmentally-friendly fuel that is piped into Australian homes. ""Our understanding of how to handle things like hydrogen in the 1920s and 30s was very different to what it is now,"" said Professor Ian Mackinnon, an industrial chemistry expert at the Queensland University of Technology. ""Hydrogen is now able to be managed much more carefully and safely. ""We are now going back to the idea that if we increase the calorific value or the heat value of our natural gas by adding just a little bit of hydrogen, we'll get a bit better efficiency and better performance."" The Federal Government has outlined a national hydrogen roadmap, and there are more than a dozen pilot projects around the country, including in Tasmania and Queensland, considering ways to add hydrogen to the mix of natural gas for domestic use. Those projects include one in suburban Adelaide, which recently marked a major milestone. The State Government has announced the installation of what it said was Australia's largest hydrogen electrolyser at the Tonsley technology hub. The electrolyser will allow hydrogen to be extracted from water using renewable energy, and pumped through the natural gas network into hundreds of homes in the southern suburb of Mitchell Park. The Tonsley project was announced in 2017, and SA Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan said it could eventually lead to improved energy affordability for households and businesses. ""This is actually the start, in a hands-on way, of the revolution of bringing hydrogen into our economy,"" he said. ""This is the foundation of not only strong and safe domestic consumption of hydrogen, but also of an incredibly valuable export opportunity, billions of dollars of value down the track."" Mr van Holst Pellekaan said the 1.25-megawatt electrolyser would reduce the carbon footprint of the state's gas supply by using renewable electricity to extract hydrogen gas from water. Once operational, he said the $11.4 million demonstration project would be capable of producing up to 480 kilograms of hydrogen per day. ""That will supply more than 700 properties in nearby Mitchell Park with a blend of up to 5 per cent renewable hydrogen delivered through the existing gas network,"" he said. Mr van Holst Pellekaan said the Government's intention was to ""blend up to 10 per cent renewable hydrogen"" into the state's gas mix. Hydrogen is highly flammable, with airships switching to the much more stable helium gas after the Hindenburg disaster. But Professor Mackinnon said it was important to point out that natural gas used in homes also carries risks which are managed on a daily basis. ""Not all pipelines can carry high levels of hydrogen,"" he said. ""[Hydrogen] is a bit more risky, in the sense that there are different burning properties. If hydrogen inflames, it's pretty hard to see it, whereas if you see methane or natural gas burning, you can see black smoke. ""But you would rarely come across that … because the safety conditions for both gases nowadays are pretty strong."" The Federal Government's National COVID Coordination Commission has a lot of gas industry players involved, and it appears to be showing in its policy recommendations. The company behind the project, the Australian Gas Infrastructure Group (AGIG), said the Tonsley electrolyser would prove just how safe hydrogen could be. ""It is safe and it is achievable. What we need to be focused on going forward is increasing those blends into the gas distribution network,"" AGIG strategy manager Craig de Laine said. ""Our network is hydrogen-ready … the ultimate objective is whole-of-network conversion to hydrogen."" Mr de Laine said the pilot would have no impact on consumers' gas bills, but could lead to gains if further developed. ""There will be no difference to the supply of gas that [consumers] receive or the price that they pay,"" he said. Renewable energy advocate Giles Parkinson said the industry had been looking into the economic value of hydrogen for decades. ""It has enormous potential — they've been talking about the hydrogen economy for the last 30 or 40 or 50 years,"" he said. He said there were several reasons why hydrogen had finally ""arrived"" as a potential energy source. ""One is the low cost of wind and solar, two is the growing need to accelerate reductions in emissions,"" he said. While admitting some may still be cautious of using hydrogen as a fuel source, he said the industry had well and truly moved on since the Hindenburg went down. ""Certainly hydrogen for use in airships like the Hindenburg — I don't think anyone is going to be doing that anytime soon,"" he said. ""We've got a lot of controls over the fuel now and we've got greater-advanced technology.""

168,Backyard fire danger brought home for Breen family by little Eleanor's firepit 'hug',house-and-home,"  Like many Queensland families, the Breens swapped weekend outings for marshmallows and campfire stories during the height of COVID-19 restrictions. WARNING: This article contains a graphic photo. But the Mackay family's Easter camp-out was cut short when 22-month-old Eleanor suffered serious burns, that will need ongoing care for the next 18 months. ""An injured child is any parent's worst nightmare,"" her mum, Leigh Breen, said. ""While sitting right next to her dad, Eleanor jumped up out of her chair and ran up and touched the firepit. ""[Her dad] Matty grabbed her back in time to protect her chest, but she had hugged it and burnt the inside of both arms."" Injuries from backyard campfires are not uncommon. The Mackay Base Hospital said there had been a rise in the number of people presenting with burns from camp fires. Assistant clinical director in the emergency department, Bauke Hovinga, said about six people presented in the weeks leading up to the end of June, which he said was slightly higher than usual. ""Every winter we do see burns due to campfires,"" Dr Hovinga said. ""A lot of them do recover fully after that, but it can take quite some time."" After running the burns under cool water for 20 minutes, Eleanor received initial treatment at the Mackay Base Hospital. Her family then travelled to Townsville for skin graft surgery, and continued their stay there for three weeks for occupational therapy and wound dressings. ""COVID restrictions made things even more difficult and lonely,"" Ms Breen said. ""[We were put] in contact with Ronald McDonald House Charity. They were amazing."" The accident will have an impact on the Breens' lives for months to come. ""[Eleanor] has to wear compression garments to reduce scarring for approximately the next 18 months,"" Ms Breen said. ""I wish I could go back in time and change that. Honestly, we haven't had a fire since, and I'm not sure if we ever will."" Ms Breen said her family was very conscious of fire safety and her children were always supervised, so she hoped other families could learn from their ordeal. ""We wish we had a physical barrier or fire guard in hindsight,"" she said. The Queensland Fire and Emergency Service advises people to consider the size and positioning of campfires, and says they must be monitored and extinguished when finished with. Doctor Hovinga said the use of petrol was one of the most common causes for burns. He said it was important for people to understand first aid for fires. ""You have to remove them from the danger... stop the burning process, so if there's any clothes on fire you will want to remove them,"" he said. ""And then you will have to cool down the burn using a lot of running water for at least 20 minutes.""

169,"Redgum in short supply due to cold snap, coronavirus stockpiling",house-and-home,"  Woodyards are reporting a shortage of redgum as more people are working from home and cold weather puts pressure on the supply chain of the favoured firewood. The owner of Adelaide's Stirling Woodyard, Angela Papageorge, said it had faced ""unprecedented demand"" since March when people started stockpiling firewood in anticipation of staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We probably serviced delivery to more than 600 homes and March is traditionally not an excessively busy time in the firewood season,"" she told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""It's also been compounded by the fact we've had a colder snap of weather coming through a lot sooner than normal. ""We have very limited supply and were actually in a situation last week where we had to close the doors because we literally couldn't get redgum in."" Ms Papageorge said it was a similar situation across other Adelaide Hills and city woodyards, with seasoned redgum supplies from the New South Wales Balranald region slowed by high demand. ""They are forestries that are grown specifically for firewood,"" she said. ""With this increased demand the mills are not able to split the wood quick enough to meet the demand that everybody needs. ""Customers will have to accept the fact they will have to look at alternative wood for their firewood for the rest of the season."" Commonly available alternatives include blue gum, mixed gums and Mallee wood, with most yards stocking up even if they did not burn for as long, or as hot, as redgum. But Paul, a wood carter from Penola in the state's south-east, said it was a ""misconception that redgum was the only wood you should buy"". ""There are four or five more gums that are harder and burn hotter than redgum,"" he said. Paul said manna gum, rough-barked manna gum, white box and red box were better alternatives. Bruce from Ashbourne also believed redgum to be ""overrated and overpriced"" and said other woods were ""just as good to burn, if not better"". ""And then we have the issue of too much roadside vegetation being cleared and stolen by people just deciding they want to make a buck out of firewood,"" he said. ""They'll go and scab it, even in the middle of the night, take a trailer around and pilfer as much wood as they can get. ""It's very detrimental to what's left of the remnant vegetation on the side of the roads."" A Department for Environment and Water spokesperson warns people it is illegal to take wood from national parks and reserves. She said the same rules applied to all public land, including reservoirs and forest reserves, and it could result in fines of up to $1,000 and equipment like chainsaws being seized. ""Dead trees and fallen branches provide vital habitat for a range of native species, including birds, possums, reptiles, insects and even other plants and fungi,"" the spokesperson said. ""The reduction in the number of old trees in the landscape has had a serious impact on their numbers. ""Tree holes, and hollows in particular, are extremely important but they can take many years to form."" The spokesperson said wood could only be collected by agreement from private land or Forestry SA plantation forests, or from some road verges provided the local council granted a permit.

170,'Buyers came back in force': The city boasting 'astounding' house sales amid pandemic,house-and-home,"  Lachlan Ramm did not expect to become a homeowner at the age of 22, but it turned out the pandemic was the ""perfect time"" to put down roots in regional Queensland. ""I was pretty adamant I would never live in Townsville my whole life, and then about month ago I realised it was a pretty good opportunity, so I might as well invest now,"" he said. Federal and State Government home building grants — valued at up to $45,000 — provided him with the ultimate push to settle in the affordable north Queensland city. ""The grants are really the difference between owning a home and not owning a home for someone my age,"" he said. ""So I guess I'll be living here for a while."" It is not just first homeowners looking to build from scratch who are propping up Townsville's property market in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. Activity plummeted during March and April, but some real estate agents are now recording their strongest sales on record as confidence is restored to the region. Darren Robins, from property valuer Herron Todd White, said it was surprise comeback after a promising start to the year. ""We hit the COVID period — which I refer to as the Chicken Little period — and quite simply the sky fell in and everything stopped,"" he said. ""We've come out of that COVID period really hitting the ground running. ""It's probably astounded most of us — we thought maybe there might be little pockets of it, but it seems to be across the board."" Townsville's housing market has been in the doldrums for more than a decade amid the mining downturn, high unemployment rates and natural disasters like the 2019 floods. The Real Estate Institute of Queensland's (REIQ) Townsville zone chair, Ben Kingsberry said the market was insulated from the worst of the pandemic and was now the strongest he had seen in years. ""We've been quite fortunate that the industries that Townsville really relies on to underpin its economy, haven't been as heavily impacted,"" Mr Kingsberry said. ""Demand is increasing, interest rates are incredibly low, the investment returns on a property in Townsville are still excellent."" Real estate agent, Damien Keyes, said his agency broke its eight-year company sales record in May, and the value of transactions was continuing to grow. ""The floodgates opened and buyers came back to the market in force and we sold a lot of property,"" he said. ""Second and third home buyers really stepped out through June in particular and that speaks to confidence — people that are secure in their job or their business hasn't been affected by COVID.

171,Regional SA home sales skyrocket on back of government grants,house-and-home,"  Record upswing for Mount Gambier housing market thanks to government grants New housing allotments, land packages and home sales are experiencing a record rise across South Australia's south-east as buyers enter the market on the back of government incentives. In Mount Gambier, real estate agent Damian Venn said 22 allotments in the newly developed Springview Estate sold in the two weeks after the Commonwealth's HomeBuilder announcement, with agents saying sales activity like it hasn't been seen in the city in years. ""There's been a massive upturn in land sales,"" Mr Venn said. ""Even outside of land, and even going back to existing properties that are on the market, houses are selling like hotcakes at the moment."" It is in contrast to the coronavirus-induced slide in housing values nationally which accelerated last month, led by a drop in capital city prices. Mr Venn said other agents were telling the same story. ""Everyone's in the same boat; there will be a shortfall of homes in Mount Gambier very soon, and that's purely off the back of state and federal government grants,"" he said. First new home buyers in South Australia are eligible for $40,000 in total grants towards new home builds, as the HomeBuilder stimulus package boosts by $25,000 the existing $15,000 state government incentive. The Federal Government said its $680 million scheme would help turbo-charge the building and construction sector and support thousands of jobs. It estimates the initiative will lead to about 2,000 new home builds in SA. As Mount Gambier experiences record sales activity, other towns across the region, including Naracoorte and the seaside community of Robe, are also registering strong sales, with supply outstripping demand. Mr Venn said some vendors might be holding off until spring to list their properties. ""I don't know if people are confident enough to list yet, but there's not a lot of properties being listed ... there's a massive amount of properties being sold, properties simply aren't lasting."" He said many properties were also being sold before hitting the market. ""If they do hit the market, they're being sold in the space of a week or two … which is highly unusual for Mount Gambier."" Parallel to the climbing housing market, he said the city's rental market was also at near capacity. ""Our rental market is a bit protected down here because although it's started to grow in the last few years, it's not exorbitant like it is in the city markets, it's still reasonably affordable for most people. ""Who knows what will happen once JobSeeker and JobKeeper wind up, but out of our whole rental roll, there'd be only one or two people that have sought rent relief.""

172,Bowls out of bread tags: How Brad Scott turns unwanted plastic into sought-after homewares,house-and-home,"  Brad Scott's Precious Plastic creations are turning heads, as he turns trash into homewares While most people are looking to get rid of their plastic waste, Brad Scott cannot get enough of the stuff. ""We want as many bread tags and polystyrene as you can give us… that's our limiting thing at the moment,"" he said. It takes Mr Scott roughly two hours and 1,870 bread tags to make one bowl. On a good day he will make 18 bowls. In a week, that is upward of 150,000 used bread tags going into homeware, not the landscape. From humble beginnings, experimenting in his studio in the South Australian seaside town of Robe, the former corporate boss from Queensland is now being targeted by major companies around the country looking to repurpose their waste. ""I can't make enough, demand's so high,"" Mr Scott said. ""We're in that space now where the customer will come to us and say, here's a shape that I would like you to make. Can you make that out of bread tags?"" He said the first to come calling was Country Road, at the end of 2019. Then it was a major coffee company. ""If it goes ahead the idea is that they have all the pods they've made out of plastic collected, send them to me, I recycle and make them into a box, and they send them back out to customers or cafes to put their pods in,"" Mr Scott said. While melting down plastic waste and recycling it into everyday items may seem like common sense, Mr Scott is one of few in the country actually doing it. The machine Mr Scott uses is inspired by the Precious Plastic project, the brainchild of Dutch industrial design student Dave Hakkens. Mr Hakkens started the open-source project in 2012 with the mission of giving people around the world the tools and resources to reduce plastic on a local scale. ""He basically wants everyone to make their own plastic recycling machines and start recycling plastic,"" Mr Scott said. ""If you see the plastic as a resource and not a waste and a problem then it's a completely different thing."" Mr Scott used the free information, codes and drawings to build his own recycling station in 2018. ""Since then I've taken it to a different place, and that's really what (Precious Plastic) want you to do — they want you to get the general gist of your recycling and go whatever way you want,"" he said. Mr Scott said it was worth remembering he was one man in a shed operating home-modified machines made of donated kitchen ovens and car jacks. ""If you want something where you push a button and get a thousand, that's not me, that's not what I do,"" Mr Scott said. He said it was something he'd had to be very open about with the major companies wanting to collaborate. That he knew of, he said, he was the first to build a machine in Australia, and the first to make a business out of one. There are now 10 or so that he knows of in the country, including this Maragaret River start-up turning bottle lids into surfboard fins. While Mr Scott built a bigger shed and hired an extra employee (his wife) last year to help keep up with business, there was only so much he could do with the technology available, he said. While it is easy to use a lot of plastic quickly, it takes time to create safe, quality products. At the same time Mr Scott was getting started in his shed, Monash University was establishing its Precious Plastic program. Project leader David Butler said until recently the machines could not take the volume of plastic required to establish a sustainable business. ""If it takes so much time to produce a small product it doesn't really seem overly cost effective to use the machines for that,"" Mr Butler said. ""As far as people developing these machines into something that works for their business…(it's) not something we've seen an awful lot, but we have seen a lot of people express interest in wanting to implement it."" Before melting down the plastic, it has to be cleaned and sorted by colour. ""If you start with a very large batch of unsorted, uncleaned plastic, then most of your work would come in at the sorting and cleaning stage,"" Mr Butler said. Another thing stopping businesses from jumping onboard could be the country's dependency on offshore recycling, Mr Butler said, although he added this was changing as Australia limited the amount of plastic waste it processed overseas. ""That has really motivated us nationally to really think about the fact that we need to invest a bit more energy into our own recycled plastic manufacturing here,"" Mr Butler said. Mr Scott believes it is a matter of time before more start-ups take the leap. ""We can actually start small-scale manufacturing, we can de-centralise a lot of our industries out of cities and make them into small country towns and provide small businesses for country towns, revive the whole place,"" Mr Scott said. ""All these things can happen, we've just got to do it."" As far as the technology went, Mr Butler said, the capacity for recycling was developing. ""The machines that are coming out (now) have a great capacity so that means we're able to process more of the plastic that's getting dropped off,"" Mr Butler said. Mr Butler can imagine a future where Australians drop off their waste at local recycling hubs, from where it is transformed into products. ""It empowers the community to use those machines and take it into their own community to act as a hub that different people can come to,"" Mr Butler said. ""Instead of having to put their waste in their bins they can take it (to a hub) and kind of see a newly realised product there and then."" He said the next challenge and opportunity was creating food-safe products with the recycled plastics, finding ways to ensure the quality of the plastic. ""Currently we can't really say exactly where the plastic is coming from, so we can't make a new product and say that it's food safe,"" Mr Butler said. ""I think that would unlock a new range of potential."" Mr Scott said his products have been food-safe tested and certified, taking the guess work out for consumers.

173,Solar boom puts South Australia 'at risk' of another statewide blackout,house-and-home,"  Power granted to switch off household solar in SA to prevent statewide blackout Electricity grid operators will seize the power to remotely switch off new solar panels in South Australia amid warnings the state's solar boom is putting the grid at risk of another statewide blackout. The State Government will also underwrite an urgent $10 million investment to manage voltage in the state's power grid, after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) warned that a voltage disturbance near Adelaide could see up to half South Australia's photovoltaic cells simultaneously switch off. A similar mass switch-off event involving wind farms during a storm was identified as a root cause of the 2016 statewide blackout. The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) is taking legal action against the owners of those wind farms for allegedly failing to notify regulators of the possibility that could happen. Releasing a report from AEMO outlining the challenges it faces in managing solar, Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan said SA had come close to another statewide blackout during February this year. The state became separated from the rest of the national electricity network when storms damaged transmission lines in Victoria. ""Full credit to everybody for working together in partnership with the Government to avoid that blackout, but I tell you — it was close. It was close,"" he said. ""We are still at risk of another statewide blackout. We have identified the problem, we've asked for the expert advice and we have the solution."" The AEMO report outlines the challenge that SA's world-leading penetration of solar energy is now posing for the grid. About 278,000 households — 35 per cent — have solar installed. AEMO says South Australia is ""the first large-scale power system in the world to approach zero net operational energy demand — even for very short time periods — due to high proportions of demand being met by solar PV."" ""We're not very far away from the electricity going into the grid being more than the electricity being drawn out. That would create a statewide blackout,"" Mr van Holst Pellekaan said. ""The largest combined generator in our state is also actually an unmanaged generator in our state. And that puts us at very real risk."" AEMO makes dozens of recommendations to address the problems, including backing the push for a new interconnector between SA and New South Wales to reduce the risk of SA being cut off from the rest of the grid. The market operator also recommends that by spring, it be given the power to ""shed"" some solar being fed into the grid. Almost three years after a statewide blackout plunged South Australia into darkness, the fallout is continuing. Here's a look at how it unfolded and what impact new court action could have. ""We will also need, for a few hours at a time, for a few times a year, to curtail some of the solar energy that goes into the grid,"" Mr van Holst Pellekaan said. ""But the reason to do that is so the whole state doesn't have a blackout."" AEMO also warns it may have to limit the amount of power being imported into SA from Victoria at times, to limit the risk to the grid in the event of a mass solar panel switch-off. ""Up to a third of all of the inverters being used in SA have actually already been cutting themselves off in response to voltage changes,"" Mr van Holst Pellekaan said. ""Now, we weren't aware of that, others weren't aware of it, and I'll bet the householders weren't aware of that as well. So we're going to fix that."" The Grattan Institute's Energy Program Director Tony Wood said the changes were a result of South Australia's ""enormous success"" with renewable energy. ""We rushed ahead so quickly in a sense that we didn't stop and think what might happen when we get the sort of levels of uptake of solar we're seeing,"" he said. Mr Wood said the decision to allow authorities to curtail solar panel output would further encourage households to install batteries. ""If you had a battery you'd be able to store your electricity in a battery when it's not worth very much and at the end of the day when it's worth a lot more you can sell it back to the grid or use it yourself,"" he said. SA Power Networks welcomed the initiative, saying the change would address ""very specific challenges"" the state is facing. ""While we see our state's energy transformation as an exciting opportunity, South Australia has some very specific challenges in managing our electricity system due to high levels of rooftop solar generation and comparatively low levels of energy demand,"" SA Power Networks spokesman Paul Roberts said. ""No-one minds stopping at a red light to help regulate traffic. It's the same concept with power."" However, the Opposition's energy spokesman Tom Koutsantonis said the change would be blatantly unfair. ""It's the biggest attack on renewable energy since the election of the Abbott government. This is a declaration of war on every South Australian who has spent thousands of dollars putting solar panels on their roof,"" he said. ""This is a complete failure by the Government to manage South Australia's electricity system, punishing households who have spent thousands of dollars putting solar arrays on their roof just to be turned off when they need it.""

174,"analysis: With $25,000 HomeBuilder grants and house prices falling, how do you decide between renovating and moving?",house-and-home,"  With $25,000 HomeBuilder grants and house prices falling, how do you decide between renovating and moving? The Government's HomeBuilder scheme allows certain home owners to apply for a tax-free grant of $25,000 if they are spending between $150,000 and $750,000 renovating a home or building a new home. Eligibility criteria are strict. The scheme has boosted renovation talk in some circles (although, as CoreLogic has pointed out, it may merely bring forward works that were already planned). Here are some questions to ask yourself when trying to decide between renovating and moving — and how to add value to your existing home. Property market observers advise updating or renewing bathrooms or kitchens — even small fixes such as replacing a cracked or dated splashback, replacing a bath or adding skylights — can go a long way. Think about easy repairs that create an invaluable good first impression — a fixed-up fence, a new carpet or resurfaced flooring or even good old decluttering. But remember you'll only qualify for HomeBuilder if you plan to spend at least $150,000 on an owner-occupied home worth no more than $1.5 million (CoreLogic has listed which suburbs have the most owner-occupied properties under $1.5 million). How long till you retire? How secure is your employment? Thinking carefully about your earning potential between now and retirement will help you understand how what you can borrow and afford. If you are planning to stay, you will get the benefit and enjoyment of the renovations. Do you need to stay close to school or work? If that's a consideration, renovating may be worth more to you than buying further out. The Federal Government has unveiled its HomeBuilder package, offering $25,000 for people to upgrade or build their homes — but access to the scheme's free money won't come cheap. Look closely at what your property is worth (there are plenty of online calculators) and keep track of how much similar local properties with one extra bedroom or bathroom sell for. That will give you a sense of the value-add to your home equity that a renovation might represent. Be honest with yourself about the total cost of renovation. There are myriad expenses not always initially apparent. These may include: Consider the possible long-term savings of retrofitting your home to be more energy-efficient. Proper insulation, secondary glazing, draught excluders and solar PV energy are expensive upfront but will save on long term running costs. It's likely, as energy costs increase, homes that are at least partially off grid will be more attractive and valuable over time. And remember that for some, even with help from HomeBuilder, renovation won't stack up economically. Some older people may eschew home renovation to put money aside to help children get a foot on the property ladder. Others may decide potentially expensive renovation is worth it to hold onto a family home to which children return as they get older. It might sound sentimental but the idea of Christmas in the family homestead is worth it, for some. Find out what tax breaks, if any, you might be eligible for if you renovate to divide the family home into a smaller space (if you're keen to downsize, or enhance the accessibility of your home, for example) and adding a self-contained granny flat. However, if the granny flat is leased out, this section of the home would be considered income-producing. Your ""main residence"" is generally exempt from capital gains tax when it comes time to sell, but you may not qualify entirely for this exemption if a section of the property is income-producing. You may also consider remodelling the family home into a duplex and, depending on council planning laws, convert the title into dual occupancy. However, these suggestions may complicate eligibility for the HomeBuilder grant (which seems to exclude property investors, although there's no mention of partly converting the main place into a dual occupancy). The best option here is to seek advice from a tax specialist. Use a stamp-duty calculator and cost-of-selling calculator to get a rough idea of those costs. How important is proximity to work? Particularly if the coronavirus pandemic has opened your (or your employer's) eyes to working remotely, would you consider a move to a more remote area where you can afford a bigger house?

175,'A very nice surprise' as Central Qld real estate weathers the storm in style,house-and-home,"  Rental vacancy rates in Central Queensland buck the trend of coronavirus gloom Central Queensland's real estate market largely is unaffected by the pandemic thanks to infrastructure projects and industrial jobs, the state's peak body says. Capricornia Chamber of Commerce said major projects and the mining sector have kept people in jobs and the market tight The rental vacancy rate in Rockhampton and the Capricorn Coast is currently sitting at about one per cent, with rental properties being snapped up in days. In 2019 the vacancy rate sat at more than three per cent, and three years ago it hit its highest peak of 8.6 per cent. ""I have never in my long real estate career seen a figure like that before,"" Real Estate Institute of Queensland (REIQ) zone chairman Noel Livingstone said. ""We are hovering around the one per cent region so it's been a dramatic change. ""Certainly up here in CQ everything is really tight."" Mr Livingstone said it was a far cry from what he first expected from the pandemic. ""There was a period there of two or three weeks where we all thought the world was going to end,"" he said. ""Then all of a sudden we woke up to the fact that it wasn't, and Rockhampton just doesn't seem to be as affected in the area of real estate anywhere near as much as other areas. ""There's jobs that have been created, and I think you can put a lot of it down to the mining sector. ""It's certainly something I didn't expect to see during this period, but it's been a very nice surprise."" Capricornia Chamber of Commerce President Phil Henry said the tight rental market is being driven by major projects in the region. ""You've got the stuff up at Shoalwater bay, the road projects, there's the wind farm, Rookwood weir starting to kick off,"" he said. ""I'm hearing from people in the construction and engineering industry that they can't recruit for jobs they've got because of the shortage in rental accommodation."" Mr Henry said the pandemic had brought the community closer together and that the importance of shopping local had been highlighted. ""I think what we're seeing is the value of locally owned businesses,"" he said. ""Everybody has got back to that idea of community and supporting local. ""For well-run locally owned business I think there's a window of opportunity there for them to do quite well.

176,"Northern Territory homebuyers could save $80,000 — but it won't last",house-and-home,"  For new Territory homebuyers Tom Petersen and Kim Backman, it was the difference between buying a small unit or a proper suburban ""home"". The couple are among the first in the Territory to sign up to a new federal stimulus scheme which, if approved, will see $25,000 knocked off the cost of their new house build in Palmerston. ""We've been talking about it for a little while, just trying to scrape together enough cash for a deposit,"" Mr Petersen said. ""But that's been made a little bit easier now."" Together with existing NT Government stamp duty concessions, grants and building bonuses — dubbed by Chief Minister Michael Gunner last year as ""the most generous"" in the nation — the pair said they're looking at around $80,000 worth of government incentives to fund their new house. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic ""We figured we'll get a new build if we can, and with all the incentives around, that's made it possible,"" Mr Petersen said. But this taxpayer-funded windfall looks likely to be short-lived. The federal scheme only runs until December, and the Northern Territory Government won't yet commit to continuing its suite of homebuyer schemes, which expire at the end of 2020. ""Their renewal will be considered as part of the budget process in November,"" said an NT Treasury spokeswoman. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Builders are lauding the new federal scheme's instant impact, with some saying it pulled them out of the economic doldrums of COVID-19 almost immediately. Karinda Gill, the co-founder of Adobe New Builds, said her firm had seen a surge since last week's announcement. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. ""I would say there would have had to have been at least a 300 per cent increase in our enquiries,"" Ms Gill said. Another builder, Phillip Hoare of Multibuild Homes, said the change was ""massive"". ""We've been closed down for eight weeks … [now we've had] over 40 applicants this week already, and three people that have now signed contracts,"" Mr Hoare said. Prior to the scheme's announcement, newly released Master Builders NT figures show building approvals were down 39 per cent on the year prior in May. Master Builders NT's Dave Malone has cautioned against celebrating the new scheme too quickly. ""Last week we saw an announcement, now we need to see the detail,"" Mr Malone said. ""We haven't seen that yet. We want to make sure the Commonwealth scheme and the NT scheme complement each other and home buyers have a seamless mechanism to get into their new home."" Federal Housing Minister Michael Sukkar said the aim was to deliver the ""program as seamlessly as possible"" and pledged the Commonwealth was working through the details with state and territory departments. So far, there have been more than 15,000 registrations of interest in the scheme from around Australia, including nearly 70 in the NT.

177,"Brazilians lining up at Gold Coast soup kitchens, too scared to go home",house-and-home,"  International students on Gold Coast facing hardship but too scared to return home An international student on the Gold Coast says he is on the brink of poverty because coronavirus job losses have forced too many competitors into his regular occupation as a food delivery driver. International students are not eligible for the Government's JobKeeper or JobSeeker programs Until two months ago, Brazilian Joao Castro was self-sufficient, earning enough delivering app-based food orders to support himself through his English language studies. He now needs food and rental assistance to stay afloat. ""So many people lost their jobs so they're doing delivery now. It is very crowded,"" Mr Castro said. ""Sometimes I would do it for 12 hours and earn maybe $30."" Mr Castro's situation is complicated by the fact his student visa will expire next week. It is expensive to renew and he is worried he will be forced to return to his home in Sao Paulo state, the coronavirus epicentre of Brazil. ""It is not a good idea to go there because it is a very bad situation. People cannot work and they cannot study,"" he said. ""At the moment my family are safe, but I am very scared about them there. ""I am in a very difficult situation now — I have to renew my visa, and after that I will pay for school again. It is huge money. ""I wish that I will be able to stay here, keep studying, working to earn money so I can help my family in Brazil."" Mr Castro is one of hundreds of people who access the soup kitchen, grocery provision and advocacy services offered by St John's Crisis Centre in Surfers Paradise each week. Manager Di Kozic says a combination of job losses as a result of coronavirus and government funding has caused a shift in the demographic of people accessing services. ""We are not seeing our regular clients because they have got enough money to feed themselves and pay their utility bills and all that (through federal funding),"" she said. ""What we are seeing is a massive increase in young Brazilians, especially, who have all lost their jobs due to the hospitality closing down. ""I have had so many of them say to me, 'our parents have told us not to come home, that is it safer in Australia, we might be a little bit hungry but at least we are safe'. ""So many people in their 20s who were self-sufficient and have never had to access these types of services before.""

178,"Ben Dufall thought HomeBuilder would help his dream come true, but instead he's at a dead end",house-and-home,"  When single father Ben Dufall heard about the Federal Government's $25,000 HomeBuilder subsidy, he thought it could be the makings of a dream come true. ""Getting my own place where my daughters can have their own rooms would be just perfect for me,"" he said. ""Wouldn't have to be big, just something I could call my own."" Mr Dufall works on a gold mine at Bandya, more than 1,000 kilometres north-east of Perth, on a one-week-on, one-week-off roster. Despite being on a mining wage, the 42-year-old's divorce seven years ago has left him with few savings, so he has been trying to find out if the money on offer from the Government could go towards a deposit for a new home. ""I might work up north, but after child support's paid, you're paying nearly 50 cents in the dollar in tax. There's not a lot left over and particularly in regard to saving up for a deposit for a house,"" he said. ""I was scouring the papers and I was scouring the internet, couldn't find any information as to whether or not it could be used as a deposit. ""I've called brokers, I've called the banks and no-one seems to know what's going on with it."" He said the lack of clarity was frustrating. ""It just seems ludicrous to me — let people know what's going on or allow us to be using that as a deposit and you'll actually probably drive another building boom,"" he said. Resolve Finance managing director Don Crellin said his mortgage brokers, who often worked with clients in the outer suburbs of Perth and Melbourne, had been fielding a huge number of calls from prospective homebuyers. ""It is generating a great deal of inquiry. I think it's great, particularly for first homebuyers coming into the market, it's certainly something we haven't seen before and it certainly does give first homebuyers a real kick forward,"" he said. But he said a lack of detail from the Federal Government meant his brokers did not have all the answers would-be clients were seeking. ""A lot of the questions that they have is around how they can use the grants … can they use it in terms of deposit, when will it be paid?"" he said. ""The sooner we are able to get to that, the better advice we're able to provide our clients in terms of financing options."" Mark Wilkins, a Mortgage Choice broker in the inner Perth suburb of Wembley, agreed. ""You can sign them [clients] up, but you've also got to warn them we don't know, we don't know when the money is going to be available,"" he said. ""We would like to see that the money's available at settlement."" On the question of whether the $25,000 could go towards a deposit, Mr Wilkins believed the answer was ""yes"" and ""no"". ""Someone like [WA Government-owned mortgage lender] Keystart would allow you to do it, but they'll still want some genuine savings. Most other banks will insist on a minimum of 5 per cent genuine savings,"" he said. When the ABC approached the big four banks for comment, they provided varying levels of detail. But the unanimous sentiment was they were not keen to allow people with next-to-no personal savings to use the Government cash towards a deposit. The ABC understands NAB customers will be able to put HomeBuilder grants towards a deposit, but the total deposit required will not change. A spokeswoman said the bank's standard lending policies would continue to apply. ""[This is] to ensure our customers are able to appropriately manage their home loan commitments both today and in the future,"" she said. ""The HomeBuilder grants will contribute to the customer's savings in the same way as the first homeowner grant does today."" An ANZ spokesman said the $25,000 could be used as part of the equity a customer contributed to building costs, as long as a loan was not subject to lenders mortgage insurance (LMI). LMI is insurance borrowers have to take out if they have not saved a 20 per cent deposit for their home. It protects banks in the event a borrower defaults on their loan and the proceeds from the sale of the property cannot cover what the bank is owed. The ANZ spokesman said for loans subject to LMI, the $25,000 could be used as equity, but ""applicants must meet the genuine savings policy of 5 per cent of the purchase price over a three-month period"". ""There are no changes to our existing policy or credit criteria as a result of this initiative,"" the spokesman said. The Commonwealth Bank said it was still working through the details of the scheme, but a spokesman indicated normal construction loan lending conditions would apply. Westpac's acting chief executive for its consumer division, Richard Burton, responded to the ABC's questions with a statement, but did not address questions about lending criteria. ""Helping Australians into their next home is a core part of our business strategy and we look forward to supporting our customers with accessing the Government's new HomeBuilder grants,"" he said. ""Westpac has established a $10 billion home lending fund to assist with Australia's economic recovery through helping more customers into home ownership."" Federal Housing Minister and Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar said the Commonwealth was working through the implementation of the scheme with state and territory governments and it would be delivered through yet-to-be signed national partnership agreements. ""The agreements will be designed to complement existing state and territory first home owner grant programs, stamp duty concessions and other grant schemes,"" he said. ""It is the Government's intention that the delivery of grants will be similar to each state's own property grant programs."" In the wake of the Federal Government's HomeBuilder announcement, the WA and Tasmanian state governments announced increased housing subsidies. The WA Government is offering an extra $20,000 to eligible people building or renovating and first homebuyers remain entitled to the local $10,000 first homebuyer scheme. Its publicly available advice said people building a home on vacant land could apply for the $20,000 once construction had started, for example a concrete slab being laid, or for villas and townhouses when the person or couple was the owner of the property. In Tasmania, the State Government announced any owner-occupier signing a building contract this year would get the $20,000 usually reserved for first home buyers. The Tasmanian Government is expected to provide more information about how its expanded scheme will work in coming days. As of Tuesday night, more than 208,000 people had visited the Federal Government's HomeBuilder webpage and more than 15,600 Australians had registered an interest.

179,History of $3.5m heritage-listed property shrouded in mystery as home hits market,house-and-home,"  Launceston's most expensive property Glenfruin up for sale again It has been owned by at least two prominent Tasmanian families, a hotel owner and a Sydney-sider, and now Launceston's most expensive property is back on the market for more than $3.5 million. Sitting above Launceston's City Park, Glenfruin is one of the regional centre's most notable heritage-listed properties due to its location, size and unique architecture — yet not many of its historical details are in the public domain. Many believe the property was built sometime in the 1880s, but according to Heritage Tasmania, Glenfruin was designed by Launceston architect, Thomas Tandy, in the early 1900s. The house was constructed around an earlier structure that was built in the mid-19th century. Eric Ratcliff's book A Far Microcosm: Building and Architecture in Van Diemen's Land and Tasmania states the ostentatious mansion was built in 1905 for Launceston draper and clothier George Colville McKinlay. The signage of Launceston's McKinlay's department store still remains in the city's Brisbane Street Mall. One thing that is certain is Mr McKinlay - who was the director of McKinlay's Pty Limited — and his wife Susan Henty McKay lived in Glenfruin from 1916 and extended and altered the property over the years, including around 1922 when new floor plans were drawn up. Marion Sargent from the Launceston Historical Society said the couple and their two children lived in the house for decades. ""The McKinlay family was a well-known, well-to-do family in Launceston and they lived there for many years from 1916 probably right through until when he [Mr McKinlay] died in 1961,"" Ms Sargent said. Mr McKinlay established Glenfruin's gardens, which previously stretched to what is now a car park at the northern end of the property. It's understood seedlings from his garden were used to establish date palm trees along Launceston's High Street. Records show that Glenfruin sold at auction for $144,000 in late 1981 — it's unclear who owned the property at that time of sale. An old Examiner newspaper clipping kept by Libraries Tasmania reveals at one stage in the 1980s, Launceston developer Ross Ambrose wanted to turn the home into a four-star hotel. Real estate agent Rodney Rawlings is now selling the property for the second time in two years. He said the first time he visited Glenfruin was in the late 1980s when it was owned by Beth Sandors, who also owned the then neighbouring hotel. ""I was involved in the Hillwood Football Club and they used the Sandors on the Park, which is now the Mercure, as our home base when we were playing games in the city,"" Mr Rawlings said. ""Mrs Sandors actually owned Glenfruin and we were at the hotel one evening and she asked us if we would like to have a look through the house."" He said it was quite different back then but the bay windows, the verandas, the ""exterior grandeur"" and the ""breathtaking views"" still remain. ""My memory was it was big and old,"" Mr Rawlings said. ""When I went back there 18 months ago, it was still old, but it was like stepping into something out of a Vogue magazine."" The house was renovated by its former owners the Youl family, before it sold for $3.25 million in late 2018. That sale broke Launceston's residential price record and Mr Rawlings is hoping he can topple that record again with the property now on the market for $3,540,000. ""We're very confident it's going to be sold somewhere around that price bracket,"" Mr Rawlings said. ""It's created so much interest with people wanting to know what's behind that wall. ""It most likely is going to be someone looking for a lifestyle change and coming here from one of our mainland states."" Current owner Bronwyn Shakespear, who formerly lived in Sydney, said she had decided to sell the property so she could travel more to see her four adult children who live in different places around the world. ""It needs to be a family home, it's so beautiful, it's built for a family,"" she said. ""Everything about it says family so hopefully a family comes along and buys it."" Another historic Launceston property was also recently put on the market for $3.2 million.

180,'Get off the grass': Scott Morrison's press conference interrupted as man urges media off his lawn,house-and-home,"  Scott Morrison's HomeBuilder announcement interrupted as NSW man urges media off his grass The great Australian dream has long included a house, a picket fence and a healthy patch of lawn. But as the Prime Minister was encouraging Australians to invest in their homes, the great source of pride was forgotten by some. On Thursday morning Scott Morrison was mid-sentence at the launch of his Government's HomeBuilder scheme — designed to stimulate the construction industry and keep builders employed — when an irritated voice interrupted. ""Can everyone get off the grass, please? Come on,"" a homeowner yelled from his front steps. ""Hey guys I've just reseeded that,"" he added. There was some momentary awkward shuffling and mumbling, but the man's frustration was short-lived, acknowledging his thanks to the moving press pack with a thumbs-up, which was returned by Mr Morrison, who then continued. Mr Morrison was announcing grants of up to $25,000 for eligible Australians to build or substantially renovate their homes, in an attempt to boost new construction projects between now and the end of the year. ""This is about targeted taxpayer support for a limited time using existing systems to ensure the money gets used how it should by families looking for that bit of extra help to make significant investments themselves,"" he said. ""If you've been putting off that renovation or new build, the extra $25,000 we're putting on the table, along with record-low interest rates, means now's the time to get started."" The Federal Government has unveiled its HomeBuilder package, offering $25,000 for people to upgrade or build their homes — but access to the scheme's free money won't come cheap. The announcement took place at the major redevelopment site of Googong, New South Wales, just across the border from the ACT. It is the kind of development Mr Morrison's scheme is seeking to replicate. The township promises the suburban dream, with green grass central to its marketing scheme: ""A life where your family grows, your neighbours are neighbourly and your children are practically free range.""' Googong is slated to have more than 6,000 homes by the time it reaches completion, and has been under construction for more than a decade. As the press conference wrapped up, Mr Morrison joked to reporters: ""Make sure you get off that bloke's lawn!"" ""Nothing wrong with a proud homeowner,"" commented a Government official. ""He's put a lot of time and effort into that,"" another added.

182,Canberrans looking to buy an apartment could save on stamp duty from July,house-and-home,"  Stamp duty on new land and off-the-plan apartments in Canberra will be waived or reduced for 12 months, the ACT Government has announced. From today, Canberrans looking to buy single residential blocks of new land or off-the-plan apartments and townhouses up to the value of $500,000 will not have to pay stamp duty. For off-the-plan apartments or townhouses that cost between $500,000 and $750,000, the stamp duty will be slashed by $11,400. The scheme will run until June 30, 2021. The spread of coronavirus across Australia could see unemployment reach about 10 per cent and house prices drop 20 per cent, says one economist. Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the scheme was designed to boost the local construction industry, which has already seen about 1,500 workers lose their jobs, according to employment figures. Yesterday the Federal Government announced it would give eligible Australians $25,000 to build or substantially renovate their homes, also in an effort to keep builders employed. ""This is important to put downward pressure on house prices and to see more houses built in the ACT,"" Mr Barr said. The scheme targets people in the middle of the housing market, those looking to downsize or those looking for a bigger place, according to Mr Barr. ""[It] will suit downsizers. It will also suit young families who need a bigger house because they've got a new baby,"" he said. ""I think there is some pent-up demand from people who own units and townhouses who might want to move into a freestanding home and to buy a block of land and build their own house."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The Master Builders Association of the ACT said renovations and new home builds had dropped sharply at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""This is going to add a whole lot of confidence into the ACT housing sector right when it needs it,"" chief executive Michael Hopkins said. ""Modelling undertaken by the MBA shows that measures such as this ... will increase jobs, housing starts and inject up to $660 million into the ACT economy."" The Government's massively costly JobKeeper and JobSeeker programs are keeping millions either in work or at a decent income level. But what happens to the economy if they stop suddenly, as planned, by the end of September? Mr Barr said work on future projects had dried up. ""So while projects currently under construction are continuing, it's the pipeline beyond that that is of concern."" The new incentives will run alongside existing stamp duty concessions for first-home buyers purchasing new and existing homes. Amidst the economic downturn caused by coronavirus, house prices in Canberra gained 0.5 per cent in May.

183,"'Help, my firewood is crawling with termites'",house-and-home,"  How to safely store firewood for woodfire heaters to minimise the threat of termites With temperatures across the Sunshine Coast set to plummet to single digits, and people preparing their woodfire heaters, what should you do if you see termites in your firewood? Is it safe to store the wood around your property, or do you run the risk of bringing termites into the walls of your home? The national architect's advisory service, Archicentre Australia, has advised that termites ""can occur anywhere and anytime at any home in the country"". It published the findings of an Industry Study, commissioned by the Australian Environmental Pest Managers Association in 2012, which said: ""the average cost of termites to the housing industry is almost $4 billion a year"". The good news is those termites you see crawling in the timber you bought at a local service station are likely only the soldier termites. Col Henschell runs pest control business, Man versus Pests, on the Sunshine Coast and says chopping wood and creating firewood stacks around your property carries a minimal termite threat to homes. He says once infected timbers are removed from a termite colony, you are ""breaking the cycle of them being a social insect"". ""It is very unlikely they will reform a nest,"" Mr Henschell said. ""They need to be in continual contact with the nest and the queen — when you take that away, you take away the purpose of their life. ""They need to feed other termites in a colony, or they will wander aimlessly and eventually die."" However, while soldier termites without a nest or queen are no concern, Mr Henschell says to watch out for the queen. He said a queen termite could become part of your firewood and lay ""multiple thousands"" of eggs each day. The queen could also fly and relocate to where an ideal home was available. Mr Henschell said the queen termite was quite distinct from the soldiers and was about 25 millimetres in length. ""You would recognise her in relation to the size of a normal working termite,"" he said. Mr Henschell's advice for those who planned on storing their firewood was to be careful with putting it around the house. ""I wouldn't be having any wood stacked up on my house, and, if you have a designated woodpile, you can treat the areas around it [with a termite-control product].""

184,The luxury item Gold Coast millionaires are upgrading to in a coronavirus recovery,house-and-home,"  Could boat sales in the lavish Gold Coast playground of the rich be an indicator of a change in fortunes during the coronavirus crisis? When the pandemic hit, it had an immediate impact on a local boat dealer and stayed that way for seven weeks. Pre-pandemic monthly turnover could reach $5 million, but that nosedived. Dealer and principal owner of AMT Luxury Boat Brokerage at Sovereign Island, Andy Taylor, said there has been a turning point in the past fortnight. Now there are green shoots of a change in fortunes. ""We should be economic forecasters,"" Mr Taylor said. ""With boats, they're a toy and they're expensive toys. The first thing to go and the last thing to come back for any potential boat owner."" The fortunes of Mr Taylor's clients come and go. The six islands in the gated Sovereign Islands community on the northern end of the Gold Coast is connected to Paradise Point by a bridge. Boasting luxurious homes with deep-water moorings and direct ocean access, you would be lucky to find a property with a starting price of $2 million. One mega-mansion built on five north-facing blocks is currently for sale with an eye-watering $45 million price tag. This is where Clive Palmer calls home. Well, one of them anyway. One of Mr Taylor's clients in the hotel industry paid $2.8 million for a 101-foot motor yacht, but days ago was forced to quickly offload it for just $1.5 million. The buyer is from Canberra, and with the Queensland border still closed he bought it sight unseen. The flipside is a customer whose data business is booming. ""There's a lot of businesses that have actually thrived through this pandemic,"" he said. Just seven months ago Mr Taylor sold the client a $3 million luxury vessel. ""He's now looking for a $5 million boat, and that decision was made four weeks ago — right in the middle of the worst part of the pandemic,"" he said. Mitchell Stronge has businesses in New Zealand but is living at Sovereign Islands. He admits it has been a tough time financially with some of his tenants unable to pay even half their rent. But none the less, he is wanting to upgrade his boat and is prepared to pay up to $3.5 million. ""Life's great. We'll spend the next five to six years here,"" he said. Head of the School of Economics at The University of Queensland, Professor Daniel Zizzo, is not surprised by the sales boost because of pent up demand in the context of a lockdown. He cautions it does not represent a broader economic recovery, but adds the luxury boats are a safe holiday option in the current environment for those who can afford them. When the global financial crisis hit in 2007 some property owners on Sovereign Islands had to sell at a big loss. But it is a different story with coronavirus. ""House prices have not dropped as dramatically as we were expecting,"" Professor Zizzo said. Ali Mian's real estate business covers not only the high end Sovereign Islands stretch, but mid and entry point suburbs as well. ""In April we couldn't do inspections, auctions were cancelled, open homes were cancelled,"" he said. But come the start of May, he said it was like someone turned on the revenue tap. ""We had some record sales come through. A property with a $6 million price tag, another worth $3.5 million,"" he said. The real estate owner has identified three large differences now to the GFC. Banks are not immediately moving on those with mortgage stress, interest rates are a lot lower, and there are Government stimulation packages. ""Since April, pretty much to the end of May, our office did nearly six sales on Sovereign,"" Mr Mien said. The Chinese interest in the Sovereign Islands market has died down. But those who do buy into this rich romper ground like it so much it is quite common, if they do sell, they will do so to buy another mansion around the corner.

185,Breakfast and blackmail: What happened when my landlord decided to sell our home during a pandemic,house-and-home," Updated 
    
      May 27, 2020 13:45:27 The last thing I needed during this global pandemic was for the owner of our Melbourne rental home to sell up. In the rollercoaster weeks that followed, I was juggling — and balls were falling. But this crisis ended up having a pretty big silver lining. (To read a transcript of this comic, jump to here.)                The laws referred to in this comic are relevant to Victoria.  Dr Darren C Fisher is a lecturer in film and animation at Swinburne University of Technology. He was one of the ABC Top 5 humanities researchers for 2019. You can see more of his work on his website. Tuesday March 24: The beginning of it all. On my first day of teaching. I'm a bit tense; online teaching is new territory, added to a deepening awareness of the seriousness of this coronavirus. A phone rings. A brief discussion. ""Hey Darren, the owner is selling our house."" Wednesday March 25: Meeting the sales agent. He is sweet, and polite, and cold, so we let him in. He films a video tour inside and promises to work with us in this ""not ideal"" time. An inspection is booked for the weekend. Thursday March 26: Calls and demands. ""Hello Bill."" (He's the property manager.) ""They want gardeners to come here. Professional photographer. Now cleaners!"" Dusting ... deadly virus ... maybe it's worth it. 9:00am. We make calls to negotiate common ground and to minimise people coming through the house. Little did we know, we were heading towards the newly-discovered state of ... Friday March 27: Negotiation breakdown. 5:00pm. ""You've been sent a notice to vacate. At the end of the day, the owner's mind is made. End of story."" We are going around in circles. ""Goodbye, have a good weekend. Try to behave like a human!"" The next hour is frantic calls to agents. Everyone plays innocent. Not one of them knows anything. It is impossible to speak with the owner to clear the story. An agent lies blatantly about a discussion we'd had. We are in shock and disbelief. Our lives had flipped in the space of one week. We had to leave. But with a global pandemic — could we? To our surprise, two hours later we emerge with a plan. The Good Weekend: Realestate.com and Tenants' Rights. Late night drives to check out streets and 'vibe'. Lots of cuddles. Lots of talking. Monday kommt. Monday March 30: Breakfast and blackmail. It starts out OK. The property manager calls. Him: ""I had just wanted to give you a call ... had a few conversations with the owner ... gotten him to the point where he said if we can work together, he's willing to hold off on the eviction."" Us: ""We were under the impression that we were working together, and talking about how this can work."" Him: ""So if we can get access to the property, photos and tenants to tidy up, he's happy to hold off."" Us: ""Look, because of the issues we've had with communication, we'd prefer to do things by email. We'll just need to get everything you just said in writing. Thanks! It's super much appreciated that you've gone back and had the conversation. You gave the impression as real estate agents that you were willing to talk about our rights and concerns about health impacts in this situation."" Him: ""Yep, I understand. OK, I'll get back to you. Thank you guys, talk soon*."" *We never hear from him again. Tuesday March 31: A team of gardeners descend with whipper snippers and leafblowers. They are here for exactly the time I'm teaching and asked not to be disturbed. The long grass populated with insects is now gone. Most of the small plants we put in have been hacked down or buried in mulch. A shredded plastic flower pot is strewn over the remains. We take a late night drive, check out a promising unit. We recharge and prepare for whatever's next.  Wednesday April 1: Fun facts for fools! Did you know the most recent and relevant legislation (in my state of Victoria) is the Residential Tenancies Act of 1997? There is somewhere between zero and SFA to cover the lockdown. You must accept private inspections if proper notice is given, but can voice concerns and offer a virtual tour instead (*this may see you issued a Notice to Vacate.) You can refuse a photographer entry. You have the right to the quiet enjoyment of your home. Are there legal ways to avoid eviction during lockdown? Just because you receive a Notice to Vacate, you don't have to move out. The landlord must apply to VCAT and gain a possession order, and you can also postpone the purchase of a warrant. Thursday April 2: We're stepping up our efforts. The law as it is can't help us. We call, email, leave messages. Everyone from local councillors to federal Members of Parliament. A local politician is sympathetic and outraged for us. We speak for 10 minutes. He has the idea to get a letter of support from the doctor. During all this I'm still working full-time and adjusting to online teaching. The students are an inspiration in their good spirits and resilience. I am stressing though. Chain smoking. Not sleeping or eating properly. There's a constant weight in my chest and throat. I'm juggling, and balls are falling. The experience is revealing reserves of strength we hadn't needed before, but it's draining. I feel we are making progress. We are almost through it all. Friday April 3: Three house inspections with an agent in trackies. He seems nice, but we have our guard up. The whole situation has made us keen to get out of renting. A mortgage broker, Jodie, is another member of Team Darren and Jutta. Saturday April 4: We have a new property manager. ""Now don't get emotional about this."" Yes, she said that. The doctor's letter saves the day. No-one tries pushing their way in. We smile and wave. Our first offer to buy is too low, but it starts a process. We have entered 'the game'. Saturday April 5: ""Hey mate, bit of a long shot, but do you know any builders or chippies?"" ""Sure thing Daz."" ""Hi Matt, I think Cozzie told you about me?"" Monday April 6: ""Hi, Matt right?"" I've never met him before, yet he's taken his morning to help us with a building inspection. With calculated knowing he touches. He feels. Understands. He's the house whisperer. Every part of it an open book. The house confesses its secrets. He leaves us informed. Reassured. Some people restore your faith. ""Alright, let's go buy that house."" Later that day: the offer exit plan. ""Go higher with your bid! An unconditional offer is favourable! And watch his facial expressions, very important!""  At the real estate office. ""Stuart! Didn't dress up for us?"" ""Bit rough today, good day for trackies!"" ""Should we talk about the offer? We're prepared to offer (insert ridiculous sum of money here)... ""OK, that's something we can work with. Few other interested parties. We'll present the offers tomorrow."" We sign many different forms. No idea what most of it means. At the end we make small talk about bikes. And just like that, it's done. Now we wait. ""This is surreal."" May 20: Closing thoughts. It's hard to believe that it's been less than two months since we found out our rental was being sold. Since then we've steeled ourselves against callous property managers and aggressive real estate agents, and had to look for, organise, buy and move into a house. I wouldn't want to live in that state of stress and uncertainty for too long.  We've learned a lot about tenancy rights, which is a fast changing landscape. We've found that real estate agents, in our experience, will not be the ones to inform you of your rights. We have managed to come out well, using the situation as motivation to finally pull the trigger on a mortgage. In a weird way, everything actually went kind of smoothly for us. But it could have gone differently. Worse. We've escaped the rental trap. It's totally worth it — if you can afford it. We've reclaimed our agency, and freedom from landlords. But what happens to those people who have no choice but to rent? This is just our story, complete with inciting incident and a happy ending. Many of these stories end in homelessness, suicide and hardship. ""Make sure you put a link to Tenants Victoria. They have helped us a lot. Now come on, we have more unpacking to do!"" Oh man...

186,Couple surprised to find newly bought property advertised for sale online,house-and-home,"  Canberra couple surprised to find their newly bought property advertised for sale For many young couples, buying a first home is a massive milestone that comes with the exciting prospect of creating memories in a place they can call their own. Canberra couple Kara Martin and Angus Slarke, both aged in their 20s, chased down that dream. They had been diligently saving before they took the leap in December, purchasing a block of land in Canberra's south for over $400,000. ""Denman Prospect is a beautiful area. We're going through the plans with architects right now and we're just really excited,"" Ms Martin said. But, amid the COVID-19 economic downturn, Kara and Angus were curious about the state of the market in the area where they had bought. Just months after purchasing their own slice of the great Australian dream, the last thing they expected to find was their block of land listed for sale. ""We were just having a browse on the website to see what was going on in the area and we stumbled across our block,"" Ms Martin said. ""We had a second of panic, going 'oh no, has something gone wrong with our purchase?' ""And that led us to follow up with Denman Prospect [the developer who sold the couple the house and land package] who quickly assured us that we actually did own the block."" At that point, the couple suspected that the real estate agency Trusted Realtors — who they had never dealt with previously — had advertised their property for sale by mistake. But, to be sure, they used an alias and expressed interest in the Trusted Realtors advertisement via an enquiry form. Do you want to share your story? Email roy.tahlia@abc.net.au Under the alias of 'Sam', Ms Martin and Mr Slarke asked a number of questions about the house and land package — making sure they were discussing just their own block of land. ""I was specifically asking about this block (no others) as it is one of the biggest blocks on the street and the others are too small — do you have a sales contract for this home and land package [property address]?"" 'Sam' asked. Trusted Realtors replied saying there was not yet a contract for the home since it had not been built, asking 'Sam' what kind of home they were hoping to build so that they could calculate ""the exact amount of the package"" and provide them with a quote. ""Thanks for confirming, we are looking for a 4-bed, 2-bath and 2-garage double-storey home,"" the couple replied. ""However, we contacted the sales office at Denman Prospect [the developer] to confirm the land price and it seems to be privately owned. Can you please confirm this, and if you have this block for sale [property address]?"" The couple then discovered the advertisement had been taken down. In April, Ms Martin and Mr Slarke lodged a complaint with Access Canberra — the ACT Government department responsible for registration of Canberra real estate agents. An Access Canberra spokesperson confirmed they were investigating the allegations against Trusted Realtors, but the regulatory authority declined to specify the nature of the investigation. In a statement, the director of Trusted Realtors, Serene Teoh, said the listing was an ""honest mistake"" by a new staff member. The spread of coronavirus across Australia could see unemployment reach about 10 per cent and house prices drop 20 per cent, says one economist. Ms Teoh said she was ""in the midst of the chaos [COVID-19], trying to appease tenants who have lost their job and asking for rent reductions, landlords who have lost their jobs and refusing the rent reductions"". ""I failed to check before the ads were live. I was trying my best to do the best I could, but I overlooked this part,"" Ms Teoh said. She said when she was contacted by Access Canberra, she apologised and took the advertisement down immediately. ""I have taken the right steps to make sure that this doesn't happen again. We are not about doing untrustworthy practices,"" she said. ""I have many clients that have had very good experiences with us. ""I would also like to say, she [the employee] genuinely took the steps to do her job, it just so happens to be with the wrong address. ""She was not well trained, and that is my oversight, of which I am taking full responsibility, because that is what a decent person would do."" President of the Real Estate Institute of the ACT Michael Kumm said real estate agents were legally required to obtain authorised listing agreements from property owners before they took a property to market. ""You can't start marketing or putting a photograph on Allhomes or in the newspaper without a signed agreement,"" Mr Kumm said. ""There are also certain documents ... one of those is a contract for sale that has been prepared by the vendor's solicitor, as well as reports which are the building, pest and energy efficiency rating and a compliance report."" He said the laws governing property sales were vital because selling a property ""is and always will be — for 95 per cent of people — the largest investment they have and the biggest decision they make when they go to sell"".

187,"Fast furniture is in our homes, but not our hearts. Here's why that's a problem",house-and-home,"  From heirlooms to Ikea — why we need to understand our furniture for a sustainable future When Nicola Pitt and her husband Jorge Basave wanted to furnish their two-bedroom unit in Alice Springs, they didn't go to the local furniture shop and pick out what they wanted. Instead, they bought flat-pack furniture from Adelaide, 1,500 kilometres away, and paid to have it brought up on the Ghan. ""All of that ended up still being cheaper than buying whatever it was in Harvey Norman or through garage sales,"" Nicola says. ""We move around a lot so we don't really want to accumulate furniture that is going to weigh us down and that we will have to ship from one place to another."" We all know we should aim to buy less, buy things that will last, and try to resist the glow that comes with something new and shiny if it's not sustainable. But the convenience and affordability of fast furniture has made it a feature of many homes — and many of us are now locked in a cycle of consuming, disposing and replacing. That comes with a big environmental price tag — and experts say we need to change how we value what we own. ""We've really created a one-directional supply chain which is pretty much straight to waste, and once you've wasted it you've got to go find something else to fill that void in your house,"" designer and sociologist Leyla Acaroglu tells ABC RN's Life Matters. Life Matters is here to help you get a handle on all the important stuff: love, sex, health, fitness, parenting, career, finances and family. She says our love of fast furniture is also partly aspirational: like with clothes, we want the latest trends, and we can ""afford to buy more but at the cheaper cost upfront"". ""So we've seen the transition away from more durable materials ... to a kind of cheaper, light-weighted and often more convenient product that makes it easier for us to just go and buy something, pop it in our houses and then, when we're moving or when we've accidentally damaged it, it ends up out on the street,"" Dr Acaroglu says. While landfill is a big problem, it's not the only one. ""I think the bigger issue is the supply chain. We have a rough rule in sustainability, which is that weight equals impact,"" Dr Acaroglu says. ""So the heavier and the bigger something is, it tends to have a higher impact on the natural environment, because more materials mean more resources."" To start to break the cycle, she says, we need to discover an emotional connection to the things we own. Greg Hall knows how furniture can tell the story of a place. He moved into his house in Newcastle 12 years ago, and inherited a precious piece of local history: a sideboard unit from his neighbours, who have since died. The ""superb example"" of an early 1950s sideboard cabinet was rescued from their home after the 1955 Maitland flood. Greg admires ""the warm colours, the texture, the patina and echoes of fingers and the loving care that Jack and his wife would have looked after with great care"". ""[They were] working-class people who took great pride in the small number of treasured pieces of furniture that would have been a part of their lives,"" he says. This image is in stark contrast to the piles of water-damaged or smashed-up furniture that litter the verge in many suburbs. Furniture used to be made to last a lifetime, imbued with memories and passed down from generation to generation. Liam Fennessy, a senior lecturer in industrial design at RMIT University, says seeing furniture discarded on the side of the road should make us stop and think. ""The fact that we put it on the side of the road is something that we've constructed as an option,"" he says. ""And it's something that we think is a normal practice."" After five years of living in Alice Springs, Nicola and her husband packed up quickly to make it to new jobs in Jorge's native Mexico. Instead of selling or putting their furniture into storage, they decided to rent their unit furnished — complete with a bright pink couch. ""For us it was just really liberating to not have to not have to go: 'Oh, what are we going to do with this furniture? What are we going to do with that precious, precious heirloom?'"" Nicola says. Dr Acaroglu says it's important to remember that sustainable doesn't have to mean expensive: you could take advantage of local garage sales, online exchange or swap sites. If you do have lots of fast furniture, she recommends trying to give it away before you throw it out. That's something Greg has done over the years. ""We have either adapted it or moved it on responsibly by handing it over to our children,"" he says. Dr Fennessy says there's also a ""growing repair culture"". ""Which is something that we used to have that we have maybe forgotten we did have, and that is growing and building up again,"" he says. So you're interested in sustainable shopping? Here's how to reduce your fashion footprint Dr Acaroglu says you don't have to have spent a lot of money on something to feel an emotional connection to it. It may be as simple as helping to build an item from a flat-pack. ""I think in general at the moment you see the complexity that goes into any products, your mind is blown and it changes your value towards it for sure,"" she says. ""Quality and value are quite significantly related, and it doesn't have to be that it's the most expensive product to produce, but that there's been care taken in the production."" Ultimately, Dr Fennessy says consumers, manufacturers and marketers all share responsibility for the negative effects of fast furniture. He says some of the large brands that are stocked around the world are ""actually doing an enormous amount"" to ensure that their materials and design processes are as sustainable as they can be — at their particular price point. ""I think most manufacturers and most designers don't design things with the primary intention of it being thrown away almost instantly,"" he says. But he warns we have to keep making strides towards change. ""The implications are quite clear. [If we keep] consuming at the rate we are consuming and disposing at the rate we are disposing at, without systems to reclaim that material or repair that material or to enter into different kind of ownership relationships where we are leasing as opposed to owning and buying, we are in deep trouble,"" he says, ""I don't think that goes just for furniture, I think that's across the board.""

188,Canberra developers ordered to pay compensation over 'deceptive' apartment GST charges,house-and-home,"  Canberra developers to pay compensation over 'misleading and deceptive' apartment GST charges Three of Canberra's biggest property developers will pay compensation for misleading and deceptive conduct in charging homebuyers GST on apartments. The Federal Court last week ordered Belconnen Lakeview — a company in the Hindmarsh Group — to pay a Canberra woman $29,914. The finding comes as a class action against the 136-unit Governor Place in Barton — a joint venture between the Morris Property Group and Doma Group — is awaiting the court to approve a $2.5 million settlement. The separate legal tussles were sparked by a NSW Federal Court finding in 2010 that GST was not payable on new units built on leasehold land because they were not considered new. All land in the ACT is leasehold and the decision was valid at the time of an apartment boom in the territory, meaning GST could have been incorrectly charged to buyers in more than 20 projects. The legal loophole was closed after changes were made to GST laws in 2011. Last year, buyers of apartments in the Altitude Apartments complex in Belconnen and Governor Place in Barton filed class actions in the Federal Court, accusing the developers of charging them GST when it was taxable and pocketing millions of dollars in proceeds. Belconnen Lakeview developed the 352-unit Altitude Apartments complex, while the 136-unit Governor Place project was by Barton Nine and 13.9 Barton. The case alleged the developers entered into contracts with buyers that specified GST was payable, but, prior to settlement, the developers obtained a private ruling from the Australian Tax Office, changing the tax status from taxable supply to input taxed. The developers allegedly then failed to tell buyers GST was no longer payable, and kept the windfall for themselves. In response, the developers argued the buyers agreed to pay the sale price for the units, irrespective of whether GST was payable, and the timeframe in which to make a claim had expired. In December, Justice Michael Lee gave the buyers a partial win by finding the developers guilty of misleading and deceptive conduct. But the judge found the buyers failed in their claims for statutory compensation, unconscionability, and breach of contract. Justice Lee found some of the owners were eligible for ""restitutionary relief"" while others were not. He then considered further submissions for each claimant, depending on their individual circumstances. Last week, the judge ordered Belconnen Lakeview pay an owner $29,914.50, which comprised $23,379.50 plus interest of $6,535. It is not known how many others in the 352 residential apartment complex may also benefit from the decision. The case, however, could continue, with Justice Lee noting the developer had raised the prospect of an appeal in submissions filed to the court earlier this month. Meanwhile, the parties in the Governor Place class action have agreed to settle the case for $2,571,492. After costs and fees, the buyers will get a share of about $715,000. The court will be asked to give the settlement the green light in June. A third case against developer Graham Potts by 38 Akuna Pty Ltd, which built Manhattan on the Park, is currently before the Federal Court. Justice Lee last year ordered the registration of 38 Akuna Pty Ltd, a deregistered subsidiary of Amalgamated Property Group, be reinstated. The judge also appointed new liquidators to the company. The case is listed to next appear in court in October.

189,Why does your house always become messy? Blame physics,house-and-home," Science House always messy? Just blame it on the second law of thermodynamics You swear you tidied things up half an hour ago, but then you turned your back and somehow the mess and clutter returned. It's a perennial problem, one made more acute by all the extra time we're spending at home at the moment. But what if it wasn't only you (and the recalcitrant members of your family who refuse to put anything away) that was causing the problem? What if it was the universe? The reason our homes always become messy can be thought of as analogous to the second law of thermodynamics, says chemist and science communicator Alice Motion of the University of Sydney. You know, the one that says the chaos or disorder of our universe always tends to increase. ""All of the laws of thermodynamics are really important because they describe what drives our universe,"" Dr Motion says. Basically, the laws neatly summarise the properties of energy, and the way it changes from one form to another. Even the most organised amongst us might have noticed over the course of a day or a week that our desk or our rooms get more and more disordered, she says. And this is quite logical when you think about it. ""There are so many more ways in which your bedroom, or whatever room in your house, could be messy and disordered, than there are ways that they can be ordered,"" Dr Motion says. In thermodynamics we can measure this chaos using a property called entropy, which is basically a measure of the disorder of the system we're looking at. But what's the entire universe and everything in it got to do with the state of your home? ""The higher the entropy, the more disorder we have,"" Dr Motion says. ""So basically disorder in our universe is always increasing."" To continue the analogy, picture an idyllic bedroom that's neat and tidy, Dr Motion says. ""We've got a bed in there, we have some books on a bookshelf, and we have a wardrobe and a chest of drawers that has some clothes in it,"" she says. If we open up the sock drawer, all of the socks could be neatly folded, Marie Kondo-ed in a beautiful fashion, like they are in Dr Motion's drawer. ""It's my one true exception,"" she laughs. ""The place of lowest entropy in my life is my sock drawer."" But in a less idyllic bedroom, those same socks could be all over the floor, they might not be in pairs, they might be mixed up, or in a complete jumble in a basket at the bottom of the bed. ""An excuse perhaps for a messy bedroom is that it's simply obeying the second law of thermodynamics,"" Dr Motion says. The problem is when we consider how many things we have in our homes and the number of ways we could arrange them, that number gets really big really quickly, says statistician Jonathan Tuke of the University of Adelaide. This field of maths is called counting arguments or combinatorics. It's used a lot in probability — for example, if you wanted to calculate the probability of getting three aces in five cards from a standard 52-card deck. Or applying it to the bedroom example above, the probability of your socks being arranged in an orderly fashion versus contributing to the overall chaos of your surroundings. Does this suggest there might be some maths behind Marie Kondo's exhortation that we only keep the things that ""spark joy"" for us? For if we own fewer things, surely there are mathematically fewer ways to arrange them? ""Absolutely,"" Dr Tuke says. Consider a simple example. Let's assume in your house you just had 10 things and you'd arranged them in a straight line on a shelf. If you were to add an 11th thing to that line, there would be 11 places you could put it, at either end of the line or between any two objects already in the line. But add another item and the number of places you could put it on the shelf has gone up to 12. And that's just arranging one shelf, Dr Tuke says, ""never mind that your house is going to be all the shelves, all the rooms"". While in the example above adding an extra item didn't make much difference, in some situations adding an extra item can dramatically increase the number of possible arrangements. If you consider Sudoku puzzles, the number of possible 1x1 Sudoku puzzles is 1. But by the time you get to a 9x9 grid, the number of different ways you can arrange the numbers in the grid without breaking the rules of Sudoku is 5,472,730,538. This is called a combinatorial explosion. In this way we can see that reducing the number of things you own even by one, can have a much greater effect on reducing the number of ways you can arrange all the remaining items. Well, maths might be able to give us a helping hand if we're trying to figure out how much stuff we should own, Dr Tuke says. Let's say you're trying to declutter your wardrobe. ""You could do it probabilistically, or you could do the classic argument of how many changes of clothes do you need?"" he says. Let's say you only want to do laundry once a week. A back-of-the-envelope calculation says you'll need seven items in each clothing category: tops, bottoms, shoes etc. But if you don't want to look exactly the same every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on, then counting arguments can also help you figure out how many possible outfits you have. Multiply the number of choices you have in each category together to get your answer. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. So if you have seven tops, seven bottoms and seven different pairs of shoes, that means you have 343 possible outfits. And if you wore each outfit it would be almost a year before anyone saw another match. ""The other thing to remember is that there's definitely psychological evidence that too much choice paralyses people,"" Dr Tuke says. ""I think it's about seven or less you cope quite happily … If you have a huge amount of choice, it really just knocks you over."" So reducing the number of choices you make can also be good for your psychological wellbeing. However, once you've decluttered and hence reduced the number of ways you can arrange what remains, you will inevitably reach the point where you need to tidy up. ""All of us at some point, do tidy up our bedroom or tidy up our house,"" Dr Motion says. But isn't that pitting little old us up against the might of the universe and its increasing chaos? Well no, Dr Motion says, because even though we might have increased the order or reduced the entropy in that particular room, by tidying up we've still increased the disorder of the universe. Confused? Us too. Dr Motion explains one way it could work. ""We can't do work on our room — which is another way of describing thermodynamics — unless we have energy. And the way that we get our energy as humans is by eating,"" she says. While the food you eat may be fairly ordered, when you digest it, it becomes a lot more disordered. ""It breaks down into carbohydrates, it breaks down into lipids or fats, it breaks down into proteins,"" Dr Motion says, until it gives us energy in the form of other biochemical reactions. ""So essentially what's happened is your room has got more ordered, but in order for that to happen ... we probably had to use some energy."" And to produce that energy in the first place, we increased the disorder in the universe. So overall the disorder in the universe is always increasing, that's just the way that these things work.

190,"In 1958, one couple let a camera crew film their first days as new parents",house-and-home,"  Baby in the House: What to expect when you’re expecting, 1950s style A young couple prepare to leave hospital with their newborn daughter. The mother waves goodbye to the other new mums sitting up in bed and the nurses in starched uniforms. Excited and nervous, the family snuggle together in the back of a Melbourne taxi for their trip home. There's no baby capsule, they're not wearing seatbelts. A clean house and hot dinner await them, courtesy of a housekeeper provided by their local council's home help scheme. It's July 1958 and new parents Gwen and Les Schumer have agreed to let an ABC camera crew capture the first days of their life as new parents as they bring their daughter Wendy home for the first time. The resulting program, Baby in the House, recently rediscovered and digitised by RetroFocus, was a ground-breaking episode of the ABC series Woman's World, a daytime magazine-style program made for (and in many cases by) women that ran from 1958 to 1962. Woman's World delved not only into the predictable subjects of interest to mid-century Australian women — cooking, fashion and craft — it also covered music, art, travel and topical discussions such as the fascinating Is Education a Waste of Time for Married Women? debate. Baby in the House was a departure from the usual format of the program, taking what now would be considered a reality TV approach by following an actual family through the first few days of new parenthood to produce an informative program aimed at young wives. Made at a time when post-war suburban sprawl saw many young couples isolated from extended family, first-hand child-rearing experience and practical advice about what to expect and how to adapt to the new reality of parenthood was often hard to come by. Baby in the House attempted to fill this gap by providing a gentle, reassuring glimpse into a real family's experience. Presenter Joy Wren's soothing narration guides viewers through Gwen and Leslie's first anxious nights and days as parents. We join Les returning to work, endeavouring to quit smoking and forego pub lunches to help save money, and lying awake at night worrying his daughter's hungry cry might be something more serious. Meanwhile, Gwen confidently settles into a day and night routine, learning to bathe, breastfeed and burp baby Wendy. After a reassuring visit to the nearby baby health clinic, she parks the pram outside a phone booth to call Les. Exhausted and distracted at work, the ""silly man"" — as he's described in the voiceover — is relieved when Gwen tells him Wendy is doing just fine. It's a fascinating glimpse back at the past, but how accurately did it portray new parenthood, and has much really changed since? We talked to Gwen, the young mother in the program and now a great-grandmother, and her baby Wendy, now a grandmother herself, to find out how Baby in the House compares to their experiences of motherhood, and how things have — and haven't — shifted over the decades. Casting her mind back 62 years, when Australian TV was still in its own infancy, Gwen remembers being told by her sister-in-law that the ABC was looking to film a woman about to have a baby. She readily volunteered. However, the producers did take some licence with the truth in portraying her as a first-time mother, as she already had a young son, Leslie (named after his dad). The cameramen ensured he stayed out of frame by letting him pretend he was part of the film crew, she recalls. There's another reason Gwen appears so confident and calm handling a newborn in front of a camera crew. As the eldest daughter in a large family, she often looked after her younger siblings when her parents went out — including a time she was left in charge for six months, while they were overseas. ""I didn't mind that at all,"" she says. ""I was about 14 at the time. That certainly gave me the experience."" Wendy says she became quite emotional while watching the film as an adult. ""My dad died when he was young. He didn't ever get to meet my children, so it was so beautiful to see him with me as a baby,"" she says. Gwen insists Les was a ""lovely"" father. ""He certainly adored Wendy. Right from the very beginning she was his girl."" However, she's keen to set the record straight on one aspect of the way her late husband was depicted: ""He didn't actually smoke. They made that bit up, to our disgust. He would never have smoked."" Yet the role of the father is quite different today than it was back then, Wendy says. ""They shared the joy of bringing [home] the baby, but the financial pressure was all his and I think he was portrayed as a little bit silly and useless ... with the newborn and it was fully the woman's role."" Today's dads are more hands-on, she says, and get to enjoy parenting. ""I know my son was a completely full-on, hands-on, nappy-changing dad right from the get-go."" Still, the joy a new baby brings to a family hasn't changed, Wendy says — nor has the accompanying financial pressure. ""I know when I had my first child, I went from working full-time to suddenly not working, so we went from a two-income family to a one-income, and that puts stress on the family. Same with my children when they had their first babies, my first grandchildren. They were both working and then it's one income. I think that's still real today."" Having recently re-watched the program with friends, Gwen says they were amazed at the difference in the way mothers back then dressed just to take the baby out for a walk in the pram. ""I was in my high heels and coat,"" she says. ""Mum was so glamorous in it,"" adds Wendy. ""She still is glamorous. She looked like Grace Kelly."" Then there are Wendy's baby clothes. ""They were not snap-lock bodysuits. They were knitted booties with ribbons, embroidered cardigans, and a little dress. That would not be wash and wear!"" Wendy laughs. She also marvels at the way her parents just hopped in a taxi without seatbelts, and she travelled on her mother's lap. ""That certainly wouldn't happen today, we'd need to have a capsule. You wouldn't be allowed to leave hospital without one."" So how did Gwen feel when Baby in the House was finally broadcast on January 29, 1959? ""There were very few people who had TVs in our street,"" she says. ""I know that a few friends actually bought TVs so they could see it. We had a TV but only just, and a few friends came to our place to watch it when it was on, so it was pretty exciting. At the time TV was very new to Australia."" Unsurprisingly, Wendy has no memory of any of it, but says she's grateful to have a ""beautiful little time capsule"" that preserves her first few days of life in such detail. ""I feel very lucky to have that to share with my grandchildren so they can see what life was like in Melbourne back in the late 50s. It's quite remarkable to have.

191,Is now the time to buy a house? Four experts weigh in,house-and-home,"  House prices are just one of the many things upended by the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. Those looking to break into the housing market have been teased with predictions that property prices will drop in the foreseeable future. This doesn't automatically mean it will be easier to buy, or that now is the right time to do it, but there are some good cases for taking the plunge sooner rather than later if your circumstances allow. Four experts have weighed in on what the coronavirus pandemic means for the housing market. Here's what they say. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Depending on your specific circumstances, there could be — but there's really no guarantee. CoreLogic Head of Research Eliza Owen says declines in property values so far have been mild, but that's not the only factor that's up for consideration. ""I don't think the downturn is a time to be celebrating affordability unless your income is steady and you're confident about your future earnings,"" she says. ""Over the next one to two years, we would expect that property prices will see a decline, probably of no more than 10 per cent nationally."" SQM Research founder Louis Christopher says even with detailed projections estimating where the housing market could go next, it could impact different people in drastically different ways. ""Potentially it's good for those who have the ability to buy a home, because potentially we may see more affordable housing by way of house price falls but, if we look at the reason why prices may fall, that's for bad reasons,"" he says. ""If I was potentially looking to buy a home right now, I would be waiting. There's a lot of uncertainty, and I don't believe the uncertainty that's out there has been priced into the markets yet. ""It just depends on your own personal financial circumstances."" But Professor Steven Rowley from Curtin University's School of Economics, Finance and Property says there's no rule that prospective buyers can't make a move now rather than later. ""I would suggest if you are in that position with a stable job and a good income, it's probably not the worst time to go out and look,"" he says. ""If you do find somewhere that you're really keen on, see if there's the potential for a deal to be done. ""There was a lot of demand out there before the crisis hit and unless you've been dramatically affected, there's still a lot of people out there who are thinking about buying and probably haven't changed their mind."" During uncertain times, there are even more aspects to think about when making a decision on buying property. University of Adelaide Professor of Housing Research Emma Baker says recent property sales data showing prices holding steady may not have factored in huge unemployment hits caused by coronavirus shutdowns. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. ""What we’ve seen over the last four or five weeks has been the last hurrah of sales,"" she says. ""If you're a young person forming a new household and you would normally get your first home, you might delay that until you know what's happening. ""Or, you might delay it because you can't get a loan from the bank, because banks will probably get more strict on their lending."" Ms Owen says transaction volumes, listings and consumer sentiment index numbers have all dropped but the ""new normal"" of low transaction activity is starting to stabilise. ""People are being very cautious about property right now because it's a high-cost, high-commitment purchase and people are uncertain about their jobs,"" she says. ""The key is incomes really, that's half of affordability and at the moment we're seeing pretty dramatic losses in wages paid compared to what we're seeing in property values. ""I would expect that property prices would continue to decline over the next few months, at least until we start to see a recovery in jobs and wages growth."" Mr Christopher has been faced with the tough task of predicting what could happen to property prices over the next few months and even years. ""It all rests with what's going to happen with coronavirus and I'm not a medical expert,"" he says. ""So, it's extraordinarily challenging as an analyst and a forecaster to really predict what's going to happen, other than saying 'if coronavirus does this, this is what we can expect. If coronavirus does that, this is what we can expect'."" He says despite most forecasts predicting that prices will fall, there's no 100 per cent guarantee. ""Right now there're actually no bargains. Vendors are holding their ground, that's what the data is showing us. There might be bargains later in the year, we don't know,"" he says. ""With all the cuts in interest rates and quantitative easing, which is effectively money printing, we may well see dwelling price rises as a result of just those two factors."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Professor Rowley also says the impact of low population growth, a weaker rental market connected to limited overseas migration, consumer confidence and people who were previously in a position to buy losing their jobs will all have an impact. ""There are an awful lot of factors which mean demand to buy housing has fallen, so that will feed through into what happens in the next few months,"" he says. ""Different areas will recover quicker, those areas with your traditionally strong levels of demand, good schools and so forth. ""There are still plenty of people that are still in the same position they were in before, with secure jobs and good incomes, so they may wait a little bit and see."" There may be no guarantee of cheap houses, but the price of rentals has already taken a hit as a result of coronavirus. Mr Christopher said closing international borders had a huge impact on rental demand from holiday accommodation like Airbnbs right through to long-term. ""Last year we had net migration of 240,000 people,"" he says. ""Generally speaking, the first thing most of those people do is rent a property when they come to Australia, they don't buy straight away. We're not getting any of that underlying demand for rental properties right now."" Newly-built dwellings that are likely to increase vacancy numbers and young people waiting out the uncertainty at home are other factors influencing the rental market. ""The fact that overseas migration to Australia has virtually stopped means that's quite a significant shock to rental demand, so that's where we're expecting to see a lot of pain in the property market,"" Ms Owen says. ""But if your incomes are steady, that means there could be much cheaper rental opportunities in more desirable areas as well."" Everyone's circumstances are different, so there's no one-size-fits-all answer on whether now is a good time to buy a home. But our experts have shared their tips to consider if you're trying to make the big decision for yourself right now. ""How secure is your job, how secure is your income? If it is secure, think carefully about where it is you want to live in light of the experience over the last few months, and do research. Get out there and see what's available."" - Steven Rowley ""If I was trying to get into the housing market, in the list of priorities, number one is getting in. In a way, all the surrounding things are secondary so you would go ahead and make the best of it."" - Emma Baker ""In the current environment, it's really hard to know what employment is going to look like over the next few months. I'd imagine people would want to be very confident in their finances before making such a big purchasing decision."" - Eliza Owen ""There is no rush. Buying your first home is a major life event. It's very difficult to time those life events, and they shouldn't be timed necessarily to market conditions."" - Louis Christopher DISCLAIMER: This is general advice only.

192,"The city exodus may just be beginning, say real estate agents seeing surge in regional demand",house-and-home,"  Real estate agents say COVID-19 has sparked a new wave of enquiries from Australians interested in moving from capital cities to regional areas, as research shows a ""worst-case scenario"" of a 30 per cent plunge in national house prices is possible if there is a second wave of coronavirus infections. As social distancing restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 ease and auction activity resumes, some are looking at the option of selling in Sydney and Melbourne to move further out. Agents say people have become used to working from home because of the coronavirus shutdowns and distant suburbs and regional towns offer better affordability and more alluring lifestyles. This was exactly why Tom and Angelique Godfrey moved in March from their four-bedroom house with a pool in Sydney's Botany, to a 25-acre farm in the Kanimbla Valley. Mr Godfrey said the family had long considered moving to the property, which he and his brother Sandy inherited from their father in the early 1990s. With the Federal Budget expected to be hundreds of billions of dollars in the red following COVID-19, experts say now is the time for long overdue tax reforms. ""We always had one foot in the country,"" Mr Godfrey said. ""When COVID-19 hit, it was an opportunity to reassess."" The family had already been contemplating the move as Angelique was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and they wanted a less stressful lifestyle. ""We previously had had a gelato cart business in the city — and that required me to be there,"" Mr Godfrey said. ""But with COVID that business stopped, so there was no reason for us to be in the city. We could come to the country."" The Godfreys are not the only ones opting for a lifestyle change. Former journalist Nancia Guivarra has put her heritage-listed one-bedroom flat in Sydney's Balmain East on the market and is now living in the Adelaide Hills with her 12-year-old daughter Jasmine. As job losses continue to rise because of shutdowns, the number of Australians struggling to repay their mortgages is expected to lift to higher levels than seen during the global financial crisis. She is currently living in a temporary housing arrangement but would consider buying in the Adelaide Hills if her Sydney property — which is currently worth about twice as much — sells. Ms Guivarra is from Queensland but had been living in Sydney since 1996 and has worked during that time as a journalist for ABC, SBS and later in communications roles for government. She now runs her own marketing and communications business from home. ""It [COVID-19] was the catalyst [for the move],"" Ms Guivarra said. Affordability was another reason. ""Having a massive mortgage as a single parent is ridiculous,"" she said. ""You downsize your mortgage when you move to a regional area — it's fantastic."" Some agents have seen enquiries about sea change translate into sales, but most say because of lower auction activity during late March and early April, higher regional sales could eventuate in the coming weeks and months. James Kirkland, from Upside Realty, thinks the city exodus is just starting. The national real estate agency has seen an uptick in buyer interest in Sydney's outer suburbs as well as regional areas such as the Southern Highlands and Macarthur in NSW, Geelong on the outskirts of Melbourne and the Gold Coast in Queensland. Mr Kirkland told ABC News a number of homes had gone under contract in regional locations in the past three weeks, with the majority of buyers and interest from families coming from metropolitan areas. ""Since the emergence of COVID-19, I've seen a tangible shift in the nature of conversations with buyers looking to escape high-density living in favour of the lifestyle benefits and housing affordability in Geelong,"" he said. Ray White managing director Dan White also reports more enquiries from buyers about regional homes. ""Vendors are looking at the market and are not sure whether to take the step now or whether to wait,"" Mr White said. But he said Ray White's regional agents in the Central Coast, South Coast and Blue Mountains were all reporting higher enquiries. ""They're saying our digital traffic has increased from out of town people wanting to know about the area and what the options are,"" Mr White said. In his economic update on Tuesday, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Treasury expects household consumption to be 16 per cent lower in the June quarter and dwelling investment to fall 18 per cent. Property analysts and economists have tipped national house prices could fall anywhere from 10 per cent to 30 per cent in the coming months. The spread of coronavirus across Australia could see unemployment reach about 10 per cent and house prices drop 20 per cent, says one economist. SQM Research thinks the house price fall will be as high as 30 per cent if there is a second wave of COVID-19 infections and the unemployment rate falls more sharply than expected. ""Much depends on whether we get a second wave of coronavirus cases and how long that wave would be,"" SQM Research chief executive Louis Christopher told ABC News. ""In a scenario where we get a second wave of viruses it is likely that we would see such falls [of 30 per cent] occur."" But he said the more likely scenario the nation was edging towards is a V-shaped scenario. This would mean house prices fall in the June quarter but a rebound in the September quarter. ""If the recovery was to be V-shaped, we could see price rises for 2020, although they would be in single digits,"" Mr Christopher said. Cheap money as a result of Reserve Bank interest rate cuts and Federal Government spending should help stimulate the housing market. ""The other issues that the market has to deal with is the deteriorating rental market and the international border being closed to overseas migration,"" Mr Christopher said, noting it might be up to another year before international borders are opened. SQM Research shows the national residential rental vacancy rate recorded a large one-month jump from 2 per cent in March to 2.6 per cent in April 2020, with the total number of vacancies Australia-wide now at 88,668 vacant residential properties. Holiday and CBD locations have been the hardest hit. The Sydney CBD now records a 13.8 per cent rental vacancy rate. Melbourne Southbank vacancy rate has risen to 13 per cent, while the Melbourne CBD rate rose to 7.6 per cent. For those renters who still have their jobs, thousands of former Airbnbs hitting the long-term rental market mean bargains can be had in top locations. ""The blowout in rental vacancy rates for the major CBDs suggests a mass exodus of tenants occurred over the course of March and April,"" Mr Christopher said. ""This might be attributed to the significant loss in employment in our CBDs plus the drop off in international students,"" he added, noting that if migration levels do not lift this may worsen. But Mr White said he thinks a 20 to 30 per cent plunge in prices is unlikely. ""I don't think it'll be as drastic as that,"" he said, noting it was only possible in a worst-case unemployment scenario. Even throughout the COVID-19 crisis to date, capital city house price gains had only marginally dropped off. ""My sense is that there is downward pressure on pricing that may come over the next six to 12 months,"" Mr White said. ""But at the moment is the market is functioning quite rationally. Buyer depth is still really strong."" Mr White said last week was one of the ""best weeks all year"" in terms of buyers searching and bidding for properties. The group posted $2.2 billion in sales in Australia for the month of April, down about 13 per cent year-on-year. Settlements were down about 5 per cent year on year, at $3 billion. With the ban on on-site auctions and inspections as a result of COVID-19 now lifted in most states, along with a broader relaxation of social distancing policies, there could be a slight lift in confidence and volumes over the coming weeks. Last weekend's combined capital city preliminary auction clearance rate bounced back above 60 per cent for the first time since late March, CoreLogic data shows. It found 64.5 per cent of homes sold last week and the clearance rate bounced up as fewer homes were withdrawn from the market. While sales of existing homes could bounce back, Housing Industry Association data shows sales of new homes in Australia have fallen to their lowest levels on record. The body reported a 22.8 per cent drop in new home sales since the introduction on COVID-19 restrictions. The construction sector took a bit hit as consumers cancelled sales at a rate four times higher than during the 2008 global financial crisis. Whatever happens to the housing market, COVID-19 has shifted the way people think about where they live and work. Some businesses have not just survived the biggest health and economic catastrophe of the century, but are booming. ""People do feel that they have less attachments to their jobs,""  Mr White said. ""Whether they will stay in their current careers or deliver services digitally, there's no doubt workplaces are changing, and people can communicate quickly."" He said that may mean people no longer live near the work office. Mr White also noted that when property markets go through difficult times, migration to interstate and regional areas often increases due to better affordability. ""People want to take some equity out of their property and leave it for a rainy day,"" he said. Mr Godfrey does media consulting work, which is possible to do remotely. ""There's never been an easier time to work online from a nice location,"" Mr Godfrey said. They have recently started a small wine business from the property called Godfrey Wines and, overall, the family's pace of life had positively changed. Mr Godfrey said it was pleasing to watch his daughters, Jemima, 9, and Poppy, 11, become more active, building chicken coops, planting veggies in the garden and stomping on the grapes in the old Italian basket press. ""The girls started looking up from their screens and venturing outside,"" Mr Godfrey said.

194,'My husband has stepped up': How coronavirus lockdown is changing household duties,house-and-home,"  Coronavirus restrictions mean many of us are spending a lot more time at home with our families and although many have found the positives, we're not all on holiday. This week, we asked our readers how they're splitting the household duties with other family members. There are certainly some challenges — but also some changes to the normal routine for the better. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Between widespread job losses and many people working from home, some families are finding themselves all in the house a lot more. That means fewer excuses not to help with chores, and some families say their schedules have gone through quite a change. My partner and I have taken a new approach. I'm working full-time from home and he's lost his job. So now all of the domestic duties are his while I work during the day! I do most of the cooking still. But he does the dishes. A winner for me! - Jema B As a health worker and a small business owner, I have been at the office full-time while my husband has taken on a huge shift — working, studying and schooling our daughter from home. We have had a complete role reversal and while the change has definitely had its perks for me (and has highlighted many inequities in our division of domestic duties), the shift in having to carry the mental load in particular has been tough on him. - Kate B Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. My husband has stepped up around the house as I'm working plus studying. He has a better understanding now of why the dishwasher gets run every day — two teenagers at home create a lot of dishes! Our focus is on our son in year 12, making sure he's keeping positive. All in all, we're a pretty happy household and very thankful for our health. - Bec S Not everyone is working from home, and some households have barely had a shift in their routines despite the pandemic. Some essential workers might even find themselves busier at work than they were before. The good news for these families is that they're still sharing the load. Our household was pretty much 50/50 already, with me taking on a little more of the duties with our baby because I'm part-time.Now my husband is working from home, he has a little more time to do a bit more cleaning but we're still pretty equal. - Scarlett W It’s been 50/50 in general, with clear functions in between us both now. However, our four-year-old has learned to pitch in more and more. He’s grown a lot in the last few weeks because of COVID and we hope this can make him more empathetic about the future and be able to clean up after himself more and more. - Glaucia C It's no secret that food brings people together. With restaurants and cafes largely closed, that means a lot more cooking at home — and it's been a defining feature of how people are navigating lockdowns together. One of the benefits of the lockdown and working from home is that a greater preparation time is now available for dinner. I tend to be the more extravagant cook and usually do the cooking on the weekend (when I have more time). But during lockdown we have been cooking more expansive meals — home-cooked pasta, more roasts, slow-cooked meals, with the whole family again pitching in to assist. This experience has been very positive for our family — especially timely close before the kids gain their independence. - David M We have made a two-week planner with dinner plans, which allows us to keep track of food we have and build our shopping list without having to make multiple trips to the shop. It also lists the food prep that can happen before we get home from work so it gives mum something to do and makes preparing dinner simpler when we get home. Our planner also means that we take turns in preparing dinner. I'm loving that. Our first few weeks of iso were very tense but thanks to some reorganisation and a discussion about sharing of tasks in the family things are working better. I think we've come a long way as a team. - Janet For many families, with coronavirus restrictions comes learning from home. Particularly for younger children, that requires some support from parents and carers. Here's how some families have been managing adding school to the list of household duties. I've worked full-time from home, my husband who is a stay-at-home dad has done all the homeschooling duties and he's been amazing at it. Kids are loving 'dad's school' and don't want to go back to school next week! - Emily C Both kids have been happily homeschooling. My eight-year-old son perhaps finds it more difficult in that he is very literal. He loses the nuance around the teaching and the supporting info a teacher would provide. It's also way too easy for him, especially math.My 10-year-old daughter is thriving. She is very organised and conscientious; she loves the structure. Both are finishing not long after lunchtime. Our kids break up their questions between myself and my wife. She gets the IT support questions, and I get the schoolwork ones.We both love it as it's given us a window into what they are doing. I think we will miss it when it's gone. - Ivan B Household duties haven't changed but we're splitting the homeschooling between us and neither of us are getting much work on his part, or study on mine, done when we're trying to get the year 2 student to do her work. It's been an eye-opener to say the least. - Jodie V I deal mostly with the at-home learning as I only work part-time and can manage to do some of my work while helping my kids. Hubby has taken on some of the grunt work (laundry etc) so I can manage the learning stuff. - Renee W Some families are finding it easy to split home duties down the middle — but the single-parent households are working hard around restrictions too. I'm a single dad. If I don't do it, it doesn't get done. - Andrew M I'm mum and dad. Doing it all. Working, schooling, child taxi driver, cooking, mowing, whipper snippering, gardening, general house cleaning, washing clothes and linen, shopping, even the leaves (out of) gutters.Just happy to be alive, to have a job and have no abusive or lazy partners in my world. So no complaints here. - Annie M Single parent. Nothing has changed! - Cindy S See our full coverage of coronavirus We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

195,Lockdown chores have taught Daniel about the mental load his wife bears before the cooking and cleaning even start,house-and-home,"  For Daniel Boardman and Kate Sindrey, the COVID-19 crisis has meant a change of roles. And that's been an eye-opener. ""I think I was aware that she did a lot more, but I didn't engage with what that really meant,"" Mr Boardman said. ""It's the mental load. You're just tired because you're having to think about everything and that's where I've really started to appreciate what Kate does."" Mr Boardman is a Victorian public servant who usually works in the city. However, since the crisis began he has been working from home, looking after his two primary-school-aged daughters while two-year-old son Henry goes to childcare. Ms Sindrey is a physiotherapist who is still going to work four days a week. This has resulted in a huge shift in their pre-coronavirus domestic workload. Prior to coronavirus, Ms Sindrey says she would do as much as 80 per cent of the housework. However, now that he is home all day, Mr Boardman said he has become suddenly aware of how much needs doing. ""Kate's the one who's out there having to focus on her work and I'm at home so the roles have flipped but it doesn't mean Kate comes home and doesn't do anything,"" he said. ""She still does the things she normally does, it's just we're both doing it."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic But it is enough for Ms Sindrey to acknowledge the bulk of the work is no longer done by her. ""I think the ratio's flipped. I don't think it's 70-30 per cent anymore, it's probably 60-40,"" she said. Mr Boardman laughs that he is hardly a ""remade man"". He is also still doing a full day's work from home. However, both research and anecdotal evidence are showing that in many cases, women are still picking up the bulk of the extra load. Famed author of the book Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg, has referred to the ""double, double shift"" that some women are now doing. Others refer to ""the third shift"" of extra cooking, cleaning and homeschooling during the pandemic. The latest ABC/Vox Pop Labs survey tracking the community impact of the virus shows the extent that women are picking up the extra workload. ""Now people are arguing that there's actually a third shift with all that domesticated labour and homeschooling, and anecdotally we're hearing in Australia that it's women that are picking up that slack and research overseas in the UK and the US shows that it's most definitely women that are picking up that slack,"" said writer and women's advocate Kristine Ziwica. A New York Times survey found that 80 per cent of women said they were picking up most of the responsibility for homeschooling. Only 3 per cent of women said that men were doing more. Later this year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will launch an electronic diary system to capture data for the long-awaited return of its Time Use Survey. Face-to-face surveying is suspended for the moment. The aim of the survey is to get an accurate picture of who is doing domestic chores. The ABS survey has not been run since 2006 and advocates say that it is even more critical amid concern about the impact on women, who have also been disproportionately affected by job losses in some of the worst-hit industries like tourism and hospitality. It is at the centre of a raft of research which various organisations are kicking off into how household duties are being divided up in Australia, and the impact of the virus. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. The amount of extra work that women are taking on in the home is coupled with fears about a drastic step backwards for women in the workforce due to the effects of the virus. Some of the issues are structural, including more women than men work part-time and overall, women's wages are 14 per cent lower. ""If you're a family and you're making an economically rational decision in the current circumstances, when we're all feeling the pressure to hang onto our jobs and to hang onto our income if we still have one, the temptation would be very, very strong to prioritise the male partner's job in a heterosexual relationship over the female partner's job because he would be more likely to be in full-time work,"" Ms Ziwica said. ""He would be more likely to be earning more and in that regard, I think a lot of people have expressed the concern that the pandemic will send a lot of families back to the 1950s."" The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted further differences between the genders. The latest ABC/Vox Pop Labs survey on the effects of COVID-19 on communities shows that overall, men are more confident than women about the relaxation of distancing restrictions. Although general caution remains among both men and women, men would be more comfortable going to a bar, a gym or getting on a flight than women. Ms Ziwica says this probably reflects the fact that men generally have a higher propensity for risk-taking. Find out more Back on the home front, Mr Boardman and Ms Sindrey are both hopeful that their newfound roles will stick. ""I don't think you can change things unless you know about it or see it,"" Ms Sindrey said. ""I would like to think that we can't go back to what we were and I would like to think that he can't switch off from the knowledge of that again."" Mr Boardman laughs. ""I'll cook tonight because I like cooking. I don't like vacuuming, but I have to vacuum,"" he said. Ms Ziwica said she was hopeful that there could be an upside. ""It's about making the invisible visible, so I think it's going to be an eye-opening experience for men who now are at home working from home,"" she said. ""There is a theory that while in the short term this will exacerbate the problem and increase the carer's gap, that there will be an ongoing shift. ""For some families, men have had their eyes opened and they'll prove more willing to take up some of that slack.""

196,Thousands of swimming pools in north-west Victoria remain unregistered,house-and-home,"  Thousands of swimming pools in north-west Victoria remain unregistered The Mildura and Swan Hill councils estimate about 93 per cent of residential swimming pools and spas in their municipalities still haven't been registered, with new state legislation making it mandatory just weeks from taking effect. One council is even turning to aerial imaging to identify properties with swimming pools, as it urges people to lodge their registration paperwork by the June 1 deadline. Swan Hill council's director of development and planning, Heather Green, said there were believed to be more than 1,000 pools in its council area. To date though, only 48 have been registered and the council is investigating the installation dates of another 19 pools. Mildura Rural City Council said it had processed 242 registration applications, but a spokesman said the council was aware of an estimated 3,500 pools in its municipality. ""We have looked at aerial photos of people of the municipality to identify properties with swimming pools so we will catch up with people over time,"" Ms Green said. ""It's a lengthy process to do that though, so we are really trying to encourage people to come forward straight away and register their pool."" She said the registration was a ""fairly simple process"". Property owners, including landlords, are required to register their existing pool or spa with councils by June 1. The rules apply to in-ground and above ground pools, indoor pools, jacuzzis, hot tubs and swim spas, and children's wading pools, but indoor spas used for personal hygiene, inflatable children's pools that contain less than 30cm of water, and other structures like bird baths and fish ponds are exempt. Any new pools or spas built after June 1 must be registered within 30 days after a certificate of final inspection or occupancy permit is issued. The Victorian Government made registration mandatory because drownings and near drownings are the most common cause of preventable death or disability, and many safety barriers remain non-compliant with the state's Building Act. Anyone found not to have registered their pool or spa in the required time frame can be fined $330. Under the new legislation, which was passed by the Victorian Parliament late last year, private pools and spas must also have a registered building surveyor or inspector certify that their safety barrier is compliant every four years, and undertake any repairs as directed. Ms Green said having enough qualified inspectors available to do that work ""is going to be an issue"". ""Hence the state has a staggered approach for the inspections to occur, so we're hoping there will be trained people available by the time the first lot of inspections need to take place, which is not until 2021,"" Ms Green said. She urged pool owners to use the winter to ensure their pools were safe. ""It's a really important thing that we stop and reduce the number of drownings, primarily by children, and annual maintenance is a really good thing to do,"" Ms Green said. ""Now is the time to have a look at your fence [and] get it registered.""

197,'My life has changed forever': Victorians look to a different future when lockdown ends,house-and-home,"  During the second week of lockdown, mother of two Jessica Delle-vergini was at breaking point. ""I just completely lost it,"" she said. She said at one point she closed herself up in the bathroom just to get some ""space"". Alone at home during the day with her young children, the days stretched on endlessly for the 30-year-old of Castlemaine, in Central Victoria. ""We'd just be sitting at the window watching people walk by,"" Ms Delle-vergini said. Pre-existing depression exacerbated her feelings of hopelessness — until survival kicked in. ""There was something in me saying, 'You need to do something. You'll hit rock-bottom if you don't find something [to do]',"" Ms Delle-vergini said. So, she turned to the idea of starting a veggie garden, something she had wanted to do for years, and it ultimately saved her. Ms Delle-vergini said her backyard was now filled with vegetable plots that provided a new purpose and goal. ""It's gives me a reason to do something — to get up and be excited by the day,"" she said. More than a hobby, gardening became a passion for Ms Delle-vergini and she has joined various local gardening and permaculture groups and has enrolled in a horticultural course at TAFE. ""This was not on my mind pre-COVID,"" she said. Ms Delle-vergini would agree with global business futurist Morris Miselowski, who says the way we live and love will change once life beyond lockdown resumes. He has described it as entering a blackhole with the possibility of emerging differently. ""No one knows what it looks like outside of a window anymore,"" Mr Miselowski said. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Another Victorian who knows he will ""emerge differently"" from lockdown is Dan Cucinelli. For the first few weeks of lockdown, he could not get enough sleep. Out of work and living alone under the uncertainty of coronavirus was a struggle for the 46-year-old IT consultant from Carlton in Melbourne. ""It got increasingly hard,"" Mr Cucinelli said. While he has been accustomed to living alone he has been tested through the shutdown period. ""It has been difficult from a psychological point of view,"" he said. After 8 years of living in a small apartment he has had enough. ""I have enjoyed my inner-city life, but that chapter will be closing,"" Mr Cucinelli said. He said he believed city life would not return to the way it was before the pandemic for quite some time and that the confines of inner-city living was less desirable. ""It seems obvious to me to go to a bigger place — the sense of space is important,"" Mr Cucinelli said. ""If I go to the local supermarket [in the city] I feel more exposed [to infection] than I would in a less densely populated part of Victoria."" Having always planned to move to the country, albeit in about 10 years' time, and with the flexibility to work from home he said coronavirus had fast-tracked his plans: ""Why wait?"". It has been 15 years since Micheline Trigg has had a bath in the middle of the day. The 49-year-old manager has been out of work for the past month but has never felt better. ""Before this pandemic it was all KPIs, GSIs, CSIs WIPs and P&Ls,"" Ms Trigg said. Grateful for the ""zen time"", she has bunkered down in St Kilda East with her partner and his two kids part of the week. Ms Trigg said she had been spending most of the days alone cooking, gardening or homeschooling. Her plan is to quit her job once the coronavirus restrictions ease. ""I've had a case of 'people fatigue' and am exhausted just thinking about life,"" Ms Trigg said. ""I feel like I've been running a marathon for the last 20 years and I've just stopped. ""In my mind that chapter has closed — my life has changed forever."" Ms Trigg said not being at work had allowed her to be more present and has fostered a deeper connection to her partner, who has also been working less. Prior to the pandemic both were attending couple's therapy sessions, but Ms Trigg said time spent together has improved their relationship ""out of sight"". ""You're forced to spend more time together,"" she said. ""For a couple that was going through therapy, and avoiding each other at times, it could have gone the other way, [especially] when you hear stories about domestic violence increasing and couples arguing more.

198,Chooks have been panic-bought and solar panel sales are up — what's happening in Canberra?,house-and-home,"  The Australian economy may be tanking due to the coronavirus pandemic, but for businesses promoting self-sustainability the sun is still shining. When COVID-19 restrictions were announced by the Federal Government in March, like many businesses, solar installation company Solar Hub were dreading the impact. ""We were worried like everyone else about our ability to survive — whether or not we were going to have to make job cuts"" chief executive Benn Masters said. But surprisingly, the business is planning to put on more staff. ""Our leads have probably increased by about 20 to 30 per cent,"" Mr Masters said. ""Which is quite substantial for a business like ours."" Steven Napier, owner of Territory Tanks and Plumbing, said his business had seen a similar increase in customers looking to install water tanks. ""It has increased — the phone has definitely been ringing a lot more,"" he said. Mr Napier believes people are looking at ways they can become more self-reliant in these strange and uncertain times. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic ""They're wanting to be self-sufficient,"" he said. ""We sell a raised metal corrugated garden bed, and they've all sold out. People are trying to grow their own veggies. ""It's that permaculture attitude where you grow your own, you're self-sufficient, and rainwater falls under that as well. ""People are probably setting up for the worst."" Double glazing, which allows households to preserve heat and save on power bills by adding an extra layer of window glass, has also been in high demand. Michael Westra, director of Magnetite Double Glazing, said his April sales total was up by about 10 per cent. ""We've gotten busy … it's affected people's spending, in my opinion, and people are looking to do home improvements,"" he said. But, they said, it is possible this trend only exists in one part of Australia — Canberra. Both Mr Masters and Mr Westra said arms of their solar and double glazing businesses elsewhere around the country were not faring as well. ""In Canberra, we don't tend to get as affected by downturns in the economy as other areas of the country. So, you'll find a lot of people still have their jobs, fortunately,"" Mr Masters said. Perhaps one of the most telling events since the pandemic started has been the panic buying of backyard chickens in Canberra. Rodney Bellchambers, who has been working at his rural supplies business in Fyshwick since the 1970s, said panic buying started as soon as the Federal Government announced restrictions. ""We got inundated on the Monday,"" he said. ""It was everything, it was all our seeds to grow vegetables, even dog food. ""People just panicked and were buying anything and everything."" In particular there has been an overwhelming demand for chickens, which Mr Bellchambers said ran out quickly, and were not likely to be available for some time. ""We're fielding anything from 20 to 50 calls a day, 'have you got chickens, have you got chickens?'"" he said. Lauren Kalkman has just complemented her solar panels and tanks with double glazing — but she said she was definitely not a prepper. ""I would say I am an urban farmer — or trying to be one,"" Ms Kalkman said. She agreed though that there was a growing group of people working to be more self-sufficient, which extended beyond the territory. ""There's a really great community I think, in Canberra and a lot of other areas, that are really interested in being more sustainable for a variety of reasons,"" she said. In the long term, Ms Kalkman said it could be be one of the benefits wrought by the world-wide crisis. ""I think we should look for silver linings as much as we can through a really difficult couple of months,"" she said. ""So, if people can enjoy being at home a little bit more and doing a few more things for themselves — I think that's a fabulous outcome.""

199,Looking to buy a new home? This could be the time,house-and-home,"  Why COVID-19 could be a rare opportunity for first time home buyers to enter the WA property market The prospect of buying a home may seem laughable to some amid the economic fallout of COVID-19, but real estate experts in WA’s South West are expecting just that. Real Estate Industry of WA Bunbury branch president Drew Cary said when coronavirus took hold in WA, the property market forecast was initially dire. However WA's response to the coronavirus, which has involved tight travel restrictions, has resulted in the state's curve flattening quickly. Mr Cary said this, coupled with the quick economic response by all levels of government, meant the pandemic had less of an effect on the market, than was initially forecasted. Not only did he expect housing prices to remain stable, and gradually rise over the next six months, Mr Cary said more people would be able to enter the market. ""We have a lot of people who are at home at the moment, their discretionary spend has decreased, and consequently they're probably going to find themselves financially better off, than they expected to be three months ago,"" Mr Cary said. ""Now that they're saving more than expected - if they're going to be home buyers - they're going to have that deposit ready. ""There’s also been a lot of cash splashed around recently, that has to flow through the economy as well, and the impact of that is only just being felt."" Mass closures of businesses and entire industries during the coronavirus outbreak has left about one million Australians without jobs and the unemployment rate has soared. Accommodation and hospitality businesses are among the industries hardest hit, which according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics employs the most people aged between 20 and 29. The most recent CoreLogic property market outlook said on average people in regional WA were less likely to work in the accommodation, food services and arts sectors, compared to people in metropolitan areas. Mr Cary said youth in the South West and other regional areas were more likely to be employed in such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, meaning their income was more secure. ""Compared to inner Sydney and Melbourne… I think young people are probably more likely to be resilient here [in WA's South West] than other parts of the country,"" he said. Mr Cary said the economic impact of COVID-19 could present an opportunity for young buyers to enter the property market. ""Previously young buyers were most comfortable spending most of their discretionary spend on lifestyle, and that opportunity has been largely restricted,"" he said. ""They [young people] might suddenly find themselves in a position to be able to purchase because they've got a deposit saved way sooner than they previously expected.""

200,Historic burnt-out cottage and house overlooking gorge attract $3.2 million price tag,house-and-home,"  Iconic 125-year-old Tasmanian cottages on the market for $3.2 million It is not like your usual residential property that hits the market in Tasmania. With a price tag of $3.2 million, which includes a cottage without a roof, it is going to be hard to attract a buyer. But there has been significant interest in the piece of Launceston history that is up for grabs. Shane Dennington from the Duck Reach Historic Society said it was a significant site. ""It was built in 1895 and that was to house the manager of the power station until about 1955 when they decommissioned the power station,"" he said. The power station was the first publicly owned hydroelectric plant in the Southern Hemisphere, with Launceston being the first city in Australia to have public-generated hydroelectricity. In 1955, the cottages were given to the Launceston City Council and fell into disrepair before they were privately bought. The cottages have played a role in Launceston's history. ""It was a very successful period for the Launceston city, busy port, cheap electricity and historically, it was a monumental area at the time,"" Mr Dennington said. ""We were one of the richest cities in Australia at that time."" The property is perched on 2.99 hectares of land on a hilltop overlooking the South Esk River and built of bluestone. The sale includes two cottages. One has been renovated but the former manager's residence was extensively damaged by fire in 2011. It will need to be rebuilt. It is estimated a new roof will cost up to $30,000. The property has been owned for the past 30 years by Peter Morton. ""It was an amazing adventure and a great privilege to live here for 30 years almost,"" he said. ""I knew about the property before it came onto the market and I always fantasised about owning it. I thought what a wonderful place to live in. ""Low and behold, finally it came onto the market. ""I couldn't attend the auction. I had my father bid on my behalf and I said to him: 'Get that property for me, Dad, if you don't get it, I'm leaving home and I'm changing my name'."" Real estate agent Chris Huxtable said there had been interest in the property. ""It's the most fascinating property with a fascinating history that goes back to the early days of Launceston,"" she said. ""It would be a perfect property for a tourism type development. It really has that commercial edge to it or it could just be a wonderful private property or that somebody uses as an art precinct. ""You can't find a property like this in Australia.""

201,Donated desks made by prisoners make 'huge difference' for homeschooling families,house-and-home,"  Prison inmates in Western Australia's south made 100 school desks in less than two weeks to donate to families that don't have workstations for children homeschooling during the coronavirus pandemic Finding enough space for her children to study away from the kitchen table, was what got Superintendent Jodi Miller, boss of a state prison, thinking how other households might also be struggling to manage. It was a thought that triggered a community project that saw an influx of donations from people across the region. Within a month, Superintendent Miller had assembled 100 computers, school desks, chairs and student stationery packs to be distributed to school kids in the Mount Barker district. ""I thought there would be many families who don't have separate study spaces for their children,"" Superintendent Miller said. ""I thought it would be really good for families to have a workstation for students who are studying at home. ""I thought it would be great for each child to have a desk, their own space."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Superintendent Miller asked her staff, and inmates at the Pardelup Prison Farm wood workshop, to design and make simple school desks. They made 100 in less than two weeks. The minimum-security prison is unique to the region and has a focus of providing constructive work for prisoners reintegrating into the community. ""I thought okay, I could do with 100 chairs, and then I thought we could do with some stationery packs."" She put a call into the Mount Barker Co-Operative, which runs the town's supermarket and hardware store. Co-Op CEO, Gary Tempany, came good with a $3,000 donation of chairs, and individual bags of school stationery. ""It's very important at this point that kids are having to study from home that they've got the right equipment, and they've got the right wherewithal to be able to do their best their best from home,"" Mr Tempany said. But Superintendent Miller did not stop there. ""There are about 50 per cent of children in the Plantagenet Shire around Mount Barker who don't even have access to the internet,"" she said. ""There are a lot of students, a lot of the learning at the moment is online, and there are not many families who have more than one computer — if they do have a computer … so I also put a call out to get 100 computers and to get some internet service."" Sergeant Dave Johnson, who was earlier this year awarded the prestigious Australian Police Medal for his community engagement, reached out to ABC listeners who responded to the call. More than 100 computers and laptops were pledged to the project in less than a week. ""It's been a magnificent community effort,"" Sergeant Johnson said. ""I think that's indicative of Mount Barker in general, through the whole COVID-19 pandemic we've been able to pull together different areas of town to assist the wider community."" The Holt family from Kendenup was the first to receive the home study packs. Imogen and Khyran Holt both study at home with their mother Jenna. ""This is really important to us,"" Jenna said. ""The past few weeks we've been homeschooling, and it was getting a little bit difficult trying to juggle all three of us working at the kitchen table together. ""It was messy and trying to focus on one kid and then jump to the other it was getting a little bit difficult, so to have their own space for work areas it's going to make a huge difference."" Khyran Holt, who is in Year 7 at the Mount Barker Community College, had a message for the prisoners who made his desk, and for the Superintendent who pulled the project together. ""Thank you, It's very generous,"" he said. ""It's going to help us a lot.""

202,'You can't change the nappies from 2m away': The reality for those left behind in the working-from-home experiment,house-and-home,"  On a dark, chilly morning on Melbourne's urban fringe, Dani McFarlane is getting ready to leave for work at a busy childcare centre. And she's feeling scared. ""Obviously, social distancing doesn't happen there,"" she said. ""You can't change the nappies from 2 metres away. You can't hug them from 2 metres away. They're going to cry, they're going to be upset — you need to comfort them."" Ms McFarlane is one of the millions of Australian workers in essential industries who don't have the option of working from home. Instead, she spends her days caring for the children of other essential workers — including staff from the large hospital nearby. ""I don't think we get enough recognition for the things that we do, and the risk that we put ourselves in every single day,"" she said. ""I think the community has done little bits, mainly for emergency services. But I also think they don't see the little people — like the supermarket workers, and in the takeaway places that have lost so much money. And us."" Six weeks into the biggest shakeup of the Australian workplace since World War II, a divide is emerging. It's between people who can work from home, who are more likely to be safer and better off, and those who can't — like cleaners, security guards and supermarket staff. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Alison Pennington, a senior economist at The Australia Institute's Centre for Future Work, said it was easy to see how the pandemic work regime could compound inequality in Australia. 'Working from Home in a Pandemic: Opportunities and Risks' — Centre for Future Work, April 13 ""We estimate people who can work from home are earning around 24 per cent more than those who can't,"" she said. ""They're also more likely to have paid sick leave benefits — while essential workers who are turning out every day, are more likely to work for lower pay, but also less likely to have sick leave."" Ms Pennington said those differences were creating a greater inequality, not only in incomes, but also health outcomes, as essential workers faced the higher risk of infection without the income safety net of sick leave. ""So coming through this regime, what we're going to find is that the pandemic is going to require a universal entitlement to sick leave if we're going to be able to work through the virus and keep everyone safe,"" she said. Only around 15 per cent of Australian workers currently have the option of working remotely full time, according to Centre for Future Work estimates, but that's expected to double as companies quickly adapt to allow more of their employees to stay away from the office. Clare Harding, who heads up the post-COVID-19 transition at consulting firm Deloitte, said her company did not want workplace practices to revert to the way things were done in January 2020 once the pandemic passes. ""It [working from home] can be a really, really beneficial thing — for people who need to care for others, or who look after children, or need different working patterns,"" she said. ""We've shown in the last six weeks it's completely possible to do that, and we'd love to be able to do more of it."" Women are significantly more likely to have the option of working remotely — an estimated 36 per cent, compared to 27 per cent of men, who are more strongly represented in trades and manual work. But Alison Pennington said that also risked widening the already huge gap between men and women when it came to caring duties. Last week, the Washington Post reported that since the shutdown in the US, male academics appeared to be submitting more academic papers than usual, while women were submitting fewer. ""If caring demands ratchet up, women are more likely to suffer income losses,"" Ms Pennington said. ""Without doubt, there is potential for the gains women have made with access to paid work, incomes and career advancement to go backwards."" Nor should women — or anyone — be forced to work from home if it presents a risk to their physical or mental health, according to Paul Guerra from the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VECCI). ""One of the strongest indicators of a mental health issue is behaviour change, which is really easy to hide on a video call, but much harder to hide in the office,"" he said. ""Likewise, there are people who are offered the opportunity to work from home who won't take it because the home environment is not conducive."" On the other hand, he said remote working offered opportunities for workers in regional areas and with disabilities to access better-paying jobs. As states begin to gradually lift restrictions, and companies begin to phase their employees back into offices and factories, the risk to those who have no choice but to be out in public increases. Deloitte's Clare Harding said it was something she was acutely aware of. ""As office workers, we're very, very grateful to those people,"" she said. Find out more 'The things that we can do is be considerate about how we bring our workers back to work. ""For example, using public transport. If there is a request by the Government that requires fewer people to be traveling at any one time, our workers should be at the back of the queue, and essential workers should be at the front of the queue."" But Ms McFarlane simply wants governments to do more to keep her and her fellow workers safe. ""We shouldn't have to go out and buy thermometers for the pre-screen health check, or the masks, or whatever that we need,"" she said. ""I think the Government should have — for essential workers — provided that to every single workplace.""

203,What's the best way to get and stay toasty this cold snap?,house-and-home,"  What's the best way to get and stay toasty this cold snap? As temperatures plunge it is possible you are reviewing your home's heating and thinking 'could I be snugger?'"" There are many ways to warm, depending on what most sets you alight. For some people, it is all about the ambience of a log fire, for others economy comes first. ABC Central West caught up with Chris Barnes, product head at consumer advocacy group Choice about our modern-day options. ""If you really want maximum bang for buck, reverse cycle air conditioning is the most cost effective,"" Mr Barnes said. The engineering principles of air conditioning means it needs less electricity to convert cold air into hot air, making it optimal for heating large spaces, and quickly. ""Air conditioning can deliver a lot more heating power for each kilowatt of electricity used, compared to a portable electric heater, where you basically get kilowatt-in equals kilowatt-out."" Yet many of us are still in thrall of our most historic comfort — fire. ""Reverse cycle air conditioning is great but it doesn't provide the cosy glow,"" Mr Barnes said. ""That's why woodfired heaters are still popular. People do like the old-fashioned feel of heat radiating onto them."" But where there is smoke there is fire, wood chopping, and soot. Mr Barnes said the range of 'visual effect' gas and electric heaters have come a long way since their debut some years ago with more convincing effects and interfaces. If you are a real fire aficionado who wants to wean yourself off the wood, Mr Barnes advises you will get the most satisfaction out of a gas log fire. ""With a gas log fire it might be a fake log, but it's still a real flame. So they can get a little bit closer to achieving the look of the of an actual woodfire,"" he said. Gas models are significantly more expensive than electric flame-effect heaters, with professional installation being a must. Mr Barnes strongly recommends purchasing a carbon monoxide alarm from your local hardware shop as part of any gas heater purchase, should the heater ever become faulty. But in terms of efficiency, neither electric nor gas flame effect heaters come close to reverse cycle air conditioning. However it would save money and labour over time if you are considering converting your traditional wood fire. ""They still are, at their core, an electric heater or a gas heater. But if you want to save yourself the job of chopping wood [it's worthwhile],"" he said. ""I think it was Henry Ford who said 'cutting your own firewood warms you twice.'""

204,Can you move house during coronavirus? And can anyone help you?,house-and-home,"  Coronavirus restrictions are going to be affecting our lives for some time — the impact is not exactly limited to a couple of weeks of inconvenience. While some aspects of day-to-day life have come to a grinding halt, others keep ticking away in the background. For many people, that means needing to move house for a variety of reasons. While the broad advice is to stay put, for some of us it's just not practical or possible to stay where we are, particularly in the medium to long-term. Here's what we know about moving house mid-pandemic. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic If you're staying within your state or territory, the majority of the advice at the moment does permit Australians to move house. In Victoria, it's specified that you can leave home for the purposes of relocation; New South Wales also says it's permitted to move to a new place of residence. The Tasmanian Government says ""a common sense approach will be applied to you leaving your current home for the purpose of moving your belongings to your new home"" — but once you've moved your stuff, your new residence becomes your primary residence and you need to stay there. There's no rule in the Northern Territory at this stage to say that you can't move house, however strict area closures remain in place in some remote areas for biosecurity reasons. If you are moving, it's important to maintain social distancing, avoid large groups of people assisting at a residence and keep up good personal hygiene. Some states have limited direct advice about restrictions on moving house at this stage. The ACT Government's website says there's ""no restrictions on travel within the ACT"" while urging everyone to maintain social distancing and hygiene measures. South Australia says the same — that there's no restrictions on travel within SA right now, but general travel is discouraged. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Queensland Health's website doesn't specifically list moving house as an essential reason to travel, but it doesn't classify it as non-essential either. ""While we've only listed a few activities as examples, we're asking Queenslanders to practise social distancing with common sense,"" Queensland Health's website says. Western Australia also doesn't specify ""moving house"" as being banned, and their latest round of restriction relaxations allows for up to 10 people at open homes and display village inspections, which is helpful if you're looking for a new place. Don't forget WA has restrictions on travel within the state, so be aware of those before attempting to move to certain locations. You don't have to perform a magic one-person show if you're trying to move house, but you also probably can't recruit an army of friends and neighbours to help right now. Each state's social distancing and gathering rules still apply when you're relocating — however in some states workers don't count as visitors, so a removalist will be able to help you without counting as part of the gathering limit. Transport and logistics is classified as an essential service, so many removal companies are still operating. However, some may be working under different circumstances than normal, so check in with your company to see how they're operating during the pandemic and what it means for you. Tasmania has specified that helping someone move house is a valid reason to leave home. ""The number of people helping should be kept to a minimum and, as far as practical, you should observe social distancing while helping them,"" the Tasmanian Government's website says. ""You should also consider good hygiene practices, like wiping down any regularly touched surfaces and regular hand washing."" The two-person rule also doesn't apply in New South Wales to people gathering ""to move into a new home or business premises"". Western Australia has also relaxed their rules so groups of 10 people can gather. Social distancing must be maintained, but that's still a big help when you've got a house to pack! Here's where it can get complicated. Most Australian states and territories have various border control measures in place, with some enforcing mandatory quarantine periods or turning people back if they don't have a good enough reason to be entering the state. Unless you're classified as an essential traveller (and you'll need documents to back that up), people entering the Northern Territory at the moment must enter a two-week forced quarantine. You can apply for exemptions — but if you don't have an exemption, your application is denied or your home isn't organised, you'll have to enter quarantine at a location decided by the NT Government at your own expense. All travellers arriving in Tasmania will be required to enter 14 days of quarantine in government-managed accommodation too. Again, you can apply for an exemption that classifies you as an essential traveller, but there are conditions attached to that. Those heading to South Australia can expect border checkpoints, and have been warned that they'll be questioned about their reason for entering the state. Non-essential travellers can still go to South Australia, but they'll have to identify where they're staying, go straight there and self-quarantine for two weeks (police might drop in to check on you). If you're trying to enter Queensland you'll need an entry pass, and if you don't have one you might be turned back (people who are moving to Queensland are listed as being permitted to enter the state, provided all the relevant passes are in order). Even if you can enter the state, if you're travelling from a 'COVID-19 hotspot' or overseas, slip on your isolation pants because you'll be off to self-quarantine. Western Australia's border is closed, so if you try and enter without an exemption you'll be turned away. WA has also established intrastate travel restrictions, so be aware that you may need an exemption to move within the state at the moment. Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT's borders remain open, but each state's various public health directions and rules apply, so if you're moving there, be aware of those before you go. Because transport services are classified as essential, removal services may be exempt from quarantine or isolation orders when crossing state borders. But because each state, territory and company's conditions vary, talk to your removalist to establish where they can go and when, as well as when you'll be out of quarantine to collect or sign for your goods. Overseas travel is banned right now, with pretty limited exemptions — so there's a good chance the answer is no. Smartraveller's first recommended step before going overseas to live or work is to read and subscribe to the current travel advice for your destination, and right now, the advice for every single destination is ""do not travel"". There's no confirmed date that this advice is expected to relax, but Prime Minister Scott Morrison said this week that he ""can't see international travel occurring anytime soon"". ""The risks there are obvious,"" he said. Flights are extremely limited both in and out of Australia and because of this, even if you were to leave, moving your belongings might be more complicated at the moment.

205,"About 750,000 customers could pay thousands extra after bank cuts home loan repayments",house-and-home,"  A financial expert has warned bank customers could end up paying tens of thousands of dollars more on their home loans because of a change to repayment levels by the Commonwealth Bank. From tomorrow, the Commonwealth Bank (CBA) will automatically drop about 750,000 customers' home loan repayments to the minimum amount. The bank sent an email last week advising of the change and said customers must opt out if they wanted to continue to make repayments over the minimum amount, but told them they could not do so until May 6. Meanwhile the National Australia Bank (NAB) has reduced its minimum repayment levels for credit cards, dropping them to 0.5 per cent of a customer's closing balance or just $5 — whichever is greater — on Monday. Do you know more about this story? Contact Rebecca Trigger The bank later clarified this would only affect those already paying the minimum and those paying above that amount would have their repayments unchanged. The bank said this was a temporary measure that recognised there were many customers facing challenges who still needed access to credit. ""We want to make it as easy as possible for customers to receive cashflow relief,"" a statement from the bank said. Financial Counselling Australia chief executive Fiona Guthrie said the moves would see people who were ahead on their debt end up paying far more interest and be locked in for longer. ""Some people are going to miss that [CBA] email … they might just dismiss it as another piece of marketing from a bank, and they won't know what's happened until it's too late,"" Ms Guthrie said. ""By the time they do find out, which could be couple of weeks, a couple of months or even later, it means that you'll end up paying more and the loan will take longer to pay off. ""It can be substantial, it could be tens of thousands of dollars for some people."" ""Some of the messaging that we're hearing at the moment is 'defer, don't worry about it'. ""It [the debt] will come back. Those debts don't go away. Your bank loans, your personal loans, loans with finance companies with credit cards — pay what you can afford, make the best decision for yourself in the longer term."" Ms Guthrie said the banks should not be taking a ""one size fits all"" approach. ""I don't actually want to be critical of the Commonwealth Bank or the banking industry because they're doing a lot of really good things here, and they're trying to be helpful,"" she said. ""[But] this may not have been the right decision. ""Your house of course is your biggest asset and it's often really sensible, if you can afford to pay more than minimum repayments, to do that."" Commonwealth Bank customer Brooke O'Donnell said she was disappointed by the move. ""I have two children and I have already a really extensively laid out budget, everything's already organised to a T,"" she said. ""The money that I have left over is money that I spend on things that I need. ""I don't think it's about the customers, it's about the shareholders and their profits and trying to continue their loans and to try to decrease the amount of people that are taking advantage of the low interest rates now. It's really sad."" A Commonwealth Bank spokesman said the move would release an average of $400 a month for customers and inject up to $3.6 billion cash into the economy over a 12-month period. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The move was initially flagged by CBA on March 19 as one of a number of measures introduced in response to the declaration of a global pandemic. It was also and a week and a half before the Federal Government unveiled its JobKeeper package on March 30. The spokesman said the move would affect about 748,000 customers out of its 1.7 million home loan borrowers. According to the bank's December half-year results, the latest comprehensive data available, 34 per cent of borrowers were less than one month ahead on their repayments. Some 52.7 per cent were up to six months ahead, while 32.3 per cent had a more than a two-year buffer. ""Over the past couple of months, and in particular since the coronavirus pandemic was declared, we have been contacted by hundreds of thousands of our customers seeking help and financial relief, particularly from those people who have been stood down by their employers or have lost their jobs,"" a statement from CBA said. ""This has had a significant and substantial effect on their income. ""As a consequence, we have announced several measures to support our customers including moving nearly three-quarters of a million of home loan borrowers to the monthly minimum repayment amount. It's close to 30 years since Australia's last recession, which saw vast numbers of people lose their jobs or struggle to break into the workforce, as another recession looms, writes Stephen Long. The statement said the bank had received about 2,600 complaints about the move, representing about 0.35 per cent of affected customers. People who wish to change their repayments back can do so via the CommBank app or Netbank from May 6, or by contacting a Commonwealth Bank call centre, the statement said. ""Based on the volume of responses we have received to date at 0.35 per cent, it is fair to interpret that the vast majority of our customers understand the proposed change, and that it is a one-off change that is in place due to the unprecedented circumstances from the coronavirus,"" the bank said.

206,Data shows how COVID-19 shutdown transformed life in Australia's most isolated city,house-and-home,"  Not even being one of the most isolated cities in the world could protect Perth from being almost completely shut down by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Safeguarded almost 2,700 kilometres from the nearest Australian capital city, Perth is operating at just a fraction of its usual pace. Businesses are closed, jobs have been axed, the city's streets are deserted. However, there are some promising signs life will soon begin reverting to a more normal pace. Only five new cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in Western Australia over the past week, and just 63 people in a population of almost 2.6 million remain sick with the illness. The encouraging results have spurred WA's Premier, Mark McGowan, to investigate lifting some of the state's harsh restrictions on social and commercial activity by as early as Friday. Mr McGowan capitalised on Perth's unique seclusion from the rest of the world, moving quick to close state borders and set up road blocks preventing travel around WA. ""In effect, we will be turning Western Australia into an island within an island. Our own country,"" he said when announcing the hard border closures on April 2. ""These are drastic steps … but it will give us the best chance of combatting the virus and minimising the spread throughout our community."" The impact of those measures — and of the pandemic itself — can be felt around the city. The City of Perth has reported a steady decline in people visiting the CBD over the past two months. Using wi-fi sensors to gauge people's movements around densely populated areas, the city has recorded an almost 80 per cent drop in CBD activity on Friday evenings — usually the busiest night of the week. In Northbridge, the city's entertainment district, the situation is even more grim. With pubs, clubs and restaurants shut, activity levels have fallen 93 per cent compared to a typical Saturday night. Across the entire Perth CBD, human activity is down 57 per cent compared to an average day in April 2019. However, there are green shoots. According to movement data collected by Google, visits to Perth grocery stores and pharmacies have almost returned to normal levels after dropping off by 40 per cent in mid-March. Visits to retail and recreation precincts have rebounded to 33 per cent below usual activity levels, after plunging to 80 per cent over the Easter long weekend. More people are spending time at home, with activity in residential areas increasing by 18 per cent. During the Easter break, typically a time when families holiday away together, that figure was much higher. This City of Perth said its wi-fi sensors had reported a slight increase in overall vehicle traffic and people movement since the Easter break. The city said construction activity in the CBD remained strong and there was a noticeable increase in food delivery and couriers. ""That shows a 'new normal' rhythm of activity, albeit at reduced levels compared to pre-COVID-19 timeframes,"" said the city's chair commissioner, Andrew Hammond. ""Traditional business hours activity in the CBD and Perth malls are reduced but shows a daily rhythm as workers still deliver essential services and come into the city for various needs. ""That reflects core services and various organisations adapting to a new way of doing business."" While visits to the city's malls are down, Mr Hammond said workers and shoppers were still visiting them, but for shorter durations, before returning home. Interestingly, environmental sensors located at schools across the district have found there had been some reduction in dust particles in the air. Public transport use and vehicle traffic nosedived across Perth in the wake of the COVID-19 shutdown, but there are small indications that may be starting to change. Main Roads WA began logging ""COVID-era"" traffic data on Perth's three main freeways from the week of March 16. Weekday freeway traffic bottomed out during the first week of April, with Wednesday April 1 the quietest day on the freeway, recording 33.7 per cent less traffic than usual. The Easter long weekend was eerily quiet, with almost half the amount of traffic using the freeways compared to Easter in 2019. And while it was too early to say for sure, April 20 appeared to be the busiest Monday commute on the freeways in four weeks. The number of people using buses, trains and ferries in Perth plunged by 89 per cent in the week beginning April 5. While that number retracted slightly the following week to 83.9 per cent, the Public Transport Authority suggested that could have reflected the beginning of school holidays. Google has reported activity around Perth train and bus stations was down 57 per cent on usual levels. Apple has also released data based on the requests people lodged for directions in their maps app. The tech company reported a 79 per cent drop in public transport use in Perth, driving had dropped 47 per cent and even walking journeys were down 37 per cent. Perth Airport has seen passenger movements decline by 26 per cent in March compared to 2019, with international passengers declining 45 per cent. Those numbers are expected to fall drastically further when data for April becomes available. Transport Minister Rita Saffiotti said the WA Government would continue to press on with its flagship Metronet public transport projects ahead of a resumption of services in the medium term. ""Our massive pipeline of major road works, cycling projects and Metronet is allowing work to continue through this crisis, and will also be part of a wider economic recovery plan for the state,"" she said. ""At this stage it's too early to be able to assess the wider impacts of COVID-19 on project timeframes.""

207,Would you buy a house during the coronavirus pandemic?,house-and-home,"  Kim Hendy and Ken Maynard had not stepped foot inside their new house before they packed up and drove 15 hours to pick up the keys. ""The pandemic wasn't on when we decided to move — it just all happened within three weeks,"" Ms Hendy said. The couple could not find flights from Brisbane to Townsville to inspect the property in person, so they organised a virtual inspection with their real estate agent via video call. ""She spent half an hour walking around opening up cupboards and doors and showing us around the yard — there were no surprises when we came here,"" Mr Maynard said. ""Don't let the virus stop you from buying a house — you can do it all online, you can do it on your phone."" But the prospect of purchasing a home in the middle of the pandemic is scaring off many buyers in north Queensland. Townsville real estate agent Todd Pearce said house sales had halved and new listings had plummeted by 60 per cent. ""You grab every enquiry you get — it's like gold,"" Mr Pearce said. ""Since 2014, we've been through the mining downturn, and then we had the closure of Yabulu [nickel refinery], we've had the floods, and now we have COVID-19."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Many Townsville residents and businesses had pinned their hopes on 2020 being a year of prosperity for the region. Projects like the $293 million Townsville stadium promised to bring new activity to a city plagued by economic downturn, high unemployment, and natural disasters such as the 2019 floods. ""We were starting to see green shoots, and what I mean by that is the quarter that we've just had has been our best quarter for sales volume for 16 years in business,"" Mr Pearce said. Coronavirus social-distancing restrictions have brought an end to crowded open house inspections and on-site auctions. Real estate agent Wayne Nicholson said that had contributed to a dramatic 70 per cent drop in sales through his Townsville office. ""One day they were there and the next day they weren't,"" Mr Nicholson said. ""We had some good momentum in sales in Townsville and then April came along and it just fell off a cliff. ""We've got videos of each of our vacant properties online … but if I'm going to spend $350,000, I would want to see it, touch it, smell it, before I enter any agreement."" The Real Estate Institute of Queensland is confident the market will bounce back stronger. ""Townsville was really poised for a pretty good recovery this year — we still think that's going to happen, it might just be a little bit delayed,"" Townsville zone chair Ben Kingsberry said. Mr Kingsberry said house prices in Townsville were already so low that it was unlikely they would take a further hit. ""We have had a pretty tough 10 years or more and the fact we're coming off that low base, I think we're actually seeing less impact from coronavirus,"" he said. ""In north Queensland I think we'll recover quite quickly. ""Across Australia and the world, who knows?""

208,"To help her kids cope at home, this mum came up with a colourful idea",house-and-home,"  It's not just toilet paper that Australians have been hoarding. As coronavirus restrictions took shape, art supplies were suddenly very hard to come by. There's the obvious factor of more time on our hands for creative pursuits, but perhaps it also reflects an understanding that creativity can help in tough times. ""We are losing a lot of touch at the moment. We're not hugging people, we're not shaking hands,"" Sydney art teacher Pamela Woods tells ABC RN's Life Matters. Making stuff can help us get some of that touch back. The outlet could be embroidery, fixing up an old car or making bread from scratch. Or, as these creative folk prove, it could be something much quirkier. University humanities lecturer Tony Chalkley has decided to take his passion for tinkering to the next level. ""It's a bit of a hobby on steroids,"" he says of the building project he started in March. He's making a tiny house, which sits by the back door of his Geelong home, between the chook run, some fruit trees and a Hills Hoist. ""[It's] very tall, but very small. Think Howl's Moving Castle meets cubby,"" Dr Chalkley says. He chips away at the project for a couple of hours in the morning and the afternoon — a dependable routine that helps him cope with a ""bizarre unhinging of time"". ""You don't know what day it is. You don't know what time it is, but if it's dark it must be night,"" he says. ""It's really good for dealing with that, because if you are at a bit of a loose end you go, 'Oh, I'll just go and hang a sheet of something or carve something,' and it is really nice."" Life Matters is here to help you get a handle on all the important stuff: love, sex, health, fitness, parenting, career, finances and family. He describes the build as a bit of a game; a satisfying challenge. ""It's a puzzle. I've got all these materials that I got from swapping, scavenging, getting from Gumtree, stopping on the side of the road ... I'm trying to make the materials drive the design,"" he says. ""It's not architectural beauty. It's arts and crafts."" He's utilising his extra time, a shed full of materials and something else: his community. ""That's the other element to it: the barter, swap, exchange,"" he says. Social distancing doesn't hamper things. A friend recently left surplus timber on Dr Chalkley's lawn, and in return he left eggs in their letterbox. ""Then we just use a digital thanks and I send a photo. It's lovely that element of making sure you tell people how they've contributed."" Mother of four Lexie Abel was already home-schooling her children when Australia began closing its schools because of coronavirus. She became her friends' go-to for advice, fielding questions like, ""What do I do? What do I buy? How do I make sure that we're having fun?"" The former art teacher, from Redcliffe north of Brisbane, came up with an idea that didn't involve spending money or going to a lot of effort: #covidcolourchallenge. ""I just hashtagged it to be silly, as we do these days, and then heaps of people got on board,"" Ms Abel says. The challenge involves going on a themed treasure hunt to find anything of a particular colour around your home. Toy box, wardrobe, linen cupboard, pantry and fridge are all fair game. Her family is loving it — even her dog's in on the game — and the kids have taken over creative direction. ""We did the first one, the green one, and then they flew out of bed the next day telling me what colour we were doing next and they started setting up for it,"" Ms Abel says. It's also filling a void that even her already home-schooled children are feeling. ""We're also missing all of our activities and our friends, and getting to go to the library and the museum and all those regular meet-ups that we look forward to weekly,"" Ms Abel says. The colour challenge is providing an enriching way of engaging again. ""The kids are FaceTime-ing their friends and showing them what we've been up to, and then their friends go off and give it a go and send us something that they've done,"" Ms Abel says. ""It's encouraging them to still share with their friends, in a different way."" Ms Woods, who runs art classes — now online — through her business Class Bunny, says there is ""a watercolour shortage in Sydney now"". ""People have gone mad. Just like toilet rolls, people are hoarding watercolours,"" she says. Undeterred, she decided to make her own, and is now creating vibrant artworks with the colours of spinach, turmeric and even old dried up markers. ""I'm not going to let it stop me. What's in the outside world can also be found around the house if you look hard enough and be creative,"" she says. ""It's amazing what you can make and what you can do."" She says blended and strained spinach, wine, instant coffee, squid ink, turmeric, paprika, brown onion skins and roots from the garden can all yield colourful results. ""It's a bit of trial and error,"" she says. She's even making watercolours out of old Textas lying around the house. ""You can snap them open, pull out the filament and then drop it into a little bit of water and let it sit for about an hour. Then you've got pretty intense watercolour,"" Ms Woods says. ""These pigments may not last to get to your grandchildren in 50 years. But in the circumstances we're in — or if you're on a budget — then you can use these pigments to do pretty passable colours."" Plus, Ms Woods says it's not necessarily about what's on the page, but the process of putting it there. Watercolour painting is ""kind of meditative, something you need to sit down and give yourself to,"" she says. ""You can get lost in the zone when you're painting watercolours. It's mesmerising because the water does what it wants to do so, to a degree, with watercolour you have to go with the flow."" And what better time to get comfortable with a concept like that.

209,Bubble-wrapped windows and foam-taped doors: How to keep warm for less this winter,house-and-home,"  Save energy and keep warm this winter with these home insulation tricks As we all snuggle into isolation for the winter we may notice the drafts and cold leakage more than we have in previous years. So, how can we make our houses warmer without pumping out more electricity, gas or wood smoke? Alex Floury is a builder who specialises in helping the home builder. He said that up to 25 per cent of the heat lost from homes is from air leakage. So if you want to make your home warm, the first thing to do is block up the holes. ""Look for gaps, listen for air whistling and feel for air moving,"" Mr Floury said. Lish Fejer is an ABC green-DIY expert who knows how to stabilise home temperatures without spending thousands. She says cold air seeps in through more holes than we might think. ""It even comes through plumbing outlets and through electrical plugs,"" she said. If you move through the house and feel for drafts, find ways to block them up. You can use a silicone seal around a plumbing gap or stick an old sock in a hole in the floor. Not only can this home withstand bushfire attack, but its innovative design means powering it costs as little as a daily cup of coffee. Gaps in the sides and bottom of doors lead to massive heat loss, according to Ms Fejer. She suggested getting foam tape to stick around the door edge. ""When the door closes it sounds like you are going into a hermetically sealed space ship,"" she said. She then suggested sealing the bottom of the door with a door snake or door strip. ""The technology has improved, you can get a double-sided door snake that moves with the door,"" she said. ""You will be as snug as a bug."" While drafts are bad for heat loss, Mr Floury said windows are the worst insulators in our houses. ""A single pane of glass can lose almost 10 times as much heat as the same area of insulated wall,"" he said. Double or triple glazing is an effective fix because it traps air between panes of glass, but it is expensive. ""Bubble wrap works extraordinarily well for something so cheap and a little bit nasty,"" Ms Fejer said. If you spray a bit of water on the window you can stick the flat side of the bubble wrap to the window and the tiny bubbles will act as an insulator to keep the air out. Ms Fejer said window coverings are also important because they will also insulate the glass from the inside. Curtains work better than wood or plastic blinds to keep the heat in, according to Mr Floury. If trying to keep the cool in and the hot summer heat out, though, Ms Fejer said you are better off putting a blind on the outside of the window to stop the heat from hitting the glass at all. ""It could be a simple as putting a bamboo blind on a pulley system on the outside of the window and just dropping it down over the summer,"" she said. How to heat your home in winter and cool it in summer without a power-sucking air conditioner. Ideally, to keep a house sealed, we should have the whole area insulated. Every gap of insulation makes a difference according to Ms Fejer — a 5 per cent gap in insulation will mean a 50 per cent reduction in its effectiveness. ""A bit like if you've got a wooly jumper with a big hole in it, you get cold just through that one hole,"" she said. If you do not have the time or energy to insulate the whole house, she says the priority is the ceiling first, then the walls, then the floors. ""The difference is remarkable in the heat you can keep in the house,"" Ms Fejer said. She said, overall, wool batts are the best because they are a natural fibre but different products work better for hot or cold areas. If you cannot afford to do the floor, Ms Fejer said to just invest in a really good pair of slippers. ""If you've insulated yourself first that's a really good start, then you will stay warm,"" she said. ""The technology has improved, you can get a double-sided door snake that moves with the door. ""You will be snug as a bug."" Once a room is fully sealed, the risk of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning from heaters increases dramatically. NSW Health recommends purchasing a flued gas heater or an electric heater to avoid CO build up, and to get that heater serviced regularly to ensure it does not off-gas. If you have an unflued gas heater you will need to keep some form of ventilation for oxygen flow and check the advice for your heater with an accredited technician. If you have a wood heater, ensure it complies with the Australian Standard (AS/NZA 4013:1999).

210,'The chefs were all chasing it': How one garnish supplier came back from the brink,house-and-home,"  The garnish on top of your meal at a restaurant may seem small — especially when made of micro herbs — but until recently, for Bendigo farmer George Bobin, it proved to be a decent source of income. Before COVID-19 measures hit the restaurant industry he was sending about 30,000 pots of micro herbs across Australia and overseas. Pandemic-driven restrictions which banned dining out have brought his business to the brink of collapse. ""We were making about $50,000 a week gross income and that virtually dropped to zero — we had to throw all of the produce out,"" Mr Bobin said. ""Most of our product is sent around Australia, but some is sent to Hong Kong and Singapore. ""I just received a phonecall from an agent, that supplies overseas, with a cancellation of order because Singapore has closed their borders."" Mr Bobin started the business in 2000 with his wife and daughter after noticing a lack of locally grown herbs in the market. ""It started to give my daughter a job after she finished her cake-decorating job that she had — and she didn't want to go home and watch TV,"" he said. Mr Bobin says that while the micro herbs are popular with restaurants, they are often considered too specialist a product to appeal to the broader consumer market of home cooks. ""We are in a niche industry and the chefs were all chasing it because they are looking for that little bit to set them apart,"" he said. ""If the community markets are any indication of local people that buy our product, it's only going to be a couple of hundred dollars of product that we'll be selling — it's not a huge market."" Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Added to this, micro herbs are very young and tender — the process from planting to sale is usually between 15 to 20 days, making them difficult to store for supermarket sales. To diversify, Mr Bobin decided to take things back to where the business all began before the niche micro herb market emerged. He has started growing larger pots of herbs, like coriander and basil, to sell to local supermarkets, allowing him to get by on a small profit. ""We hope by the end of the month to have some larger product — it's what we started off doing 20 years ago,"" Mr Bobin said. Mr Bobin says they are taking the opportunity to look forward to where the business might strengthen in future. ""We also looked at the business to see where we could improve,"" he said. ""I'm spending roughly about $50,000 of my own money so we can be more efficient when we get back into it [smaller herbs] again."" AusVEG, a peak industry body for Australian vegetable and potato industries, said there have been a number of reports of Victorian vegetable producers that have had their markets severely disrupted. National communications manager, Shaun Lindhe, says it is important to support local fruit and vegetable growers while the pandemic rolls on. ""The best way for consumers to support local growers during this time is to buy plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables,"" Mr Linde said. ""Many regional and rural communities rely on a strong agriculture industry to survive to ensure that locals, seasonal workers and backpackers alike are able to keep their jobs, work and live safely, and keep the economy running. ""It is important that we all work together to lift the demand of fresh Australian fruits and vegetables so that they can continue doing what they do best: growing high-quality, healthy and nutritious fruits and vegetables for Australian families."" In the meantime, Mr Bobin will continue to pay heavy overhead costs to keep his business running. ""We spend about $60,000 on heating alone, and our wage bill runs at about $24,000 a week,"" he said. ""We've got water and rates — they amount to a fair bit of money. ""We're just waiting to see what happens.""

211,'Dinner on the driveway' events help people feel connected  despite COVID-19 isolation,house-and-home,"  In a bid to lift people's spirits and help them still feel connected despite advice to 'stay home', a pastor in regional New South Wales has started 'dinner on the driveway' events. It is among a range of ways people have started creatively using their driveways since COVID-19 social distancing regulations began. Others have been creatively utilising their front entranceway as the backdrop for fun photo shoots, the stage for costume-themed bin outings, and as a place for remembrance as RSLs encourage their use as locations for Anzac Day commemorations. David Morgan, a pastor at Port Macquarie's Grace Church, said driveway dinner parties were another way to create a much-needed sense of fun and togetherness. ""Dinner on the driveway means we can remain with our families, on our driveway, and follow social distancing protocols, but visually see our neighbours and interact with them and assist with the mental health of each one of us,"" Mr Morgan said. ""I'm noticing that around town people are quite sombre at the moment. ""We are not doing much in the way of celebrating things like sporting victories, baby showers, christenings, birthdays, weddings, anniversaries. ""This impacts on our connectedness and inner joy so it's good having something to look forward to. ""Now is a time for us to be here for one another. Dinner on the driveway assists a little to bring in joy and hope. ""Get picnic rugs out, or camping chairs and a table. Decorate your driveway with chalk, make it colourful instead of a sombre atmosphere. Let's have a joyful atmosphere."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Mr Morgan said neighbourhood connections were growing in importance as many people were currently unable to visit their families, which was difficult at times like Easter. ""It's sad we can't have the greater sense of family during this time which is where, importantly, the neighbourhood reach out can help,"" he said. ""I think there is more interaction and connection between neighbours now. It's drawing people back together."" During Port Macquarie's first official driveway dinner event, held at the start of the Easter break, Mr Morgan said there was a bright atmosphere. ""You can hear noise, children speaking, laughter, and conversation. It's been really silent around the streets and in the neighbourhoods, so just to lift that out a bit is really good,"" he said. ""It's important for kids, they are seeing friends and they are out playing. They have the chalk on the street, they're doing hopscotch."" Port Macquarie resident Jessica Fussell has two children aged four and six, and said dinner on the driveway was a great way to break up the weekly routine. ""It's nice to have a conversation with people, even if they are at a distance, and the kids can see other kids outside even if they can't play in the way they normally would,"" she said. ""I think it's very important to have a bigger, more potent sense of community at this time to remind us that we aren't alone. Even though we are feeling quite lonely."" Lake Cathie resident Jason Knight has been helping promote the concept. ""Part of it is to give hope, and also to appear before your neighbours and let people know there is still life going on behind those closed doors,"" he said. On the driveway dinner nights people are also encouraged to order their meal from a local food outlet to support businesses struggling to stay afloat during COVID-19. Many restaurants have adapted, now offering takeaway or home delivery services. Port Macquarie resident Steve McGregor said he was keen to support locals. ""It's all about supporting local businesses to ensure as many as possible come out of this COVID-19 [slump],"" he said. Burger Urge Port Macquarie franchisee Shane Joyce said he appreciated the backing of local residents and was doing his best to keep his staff employed, now offering a delivery service. ""I think it's tough times for everyone — for people who are isolated, the 24 staff who work here, and us, being a local business,"" he said. ""Events like this connect us with the local community and we can then support each other,"" he said. The next dinner on the driveway event in Port Macquarie is on Friday, April 17. People are, however, encouraged to embrace the concept at other times and in other towns around Australia. Mr Morgan said a driveway dinner night was also held in a Newcastle neighbourhood this weekend. ""It would be fantastic if people did this on other nights, encouraging other neighbours, and seeing that people are okay,"" he said. ""Building stronger communities is going to help us all now and into the future.""

213,The decade ahead may be 'the era of massive change' for our cities and suburbs after COVID-19,house-and-home,"  In just a matter of weeks, the coronavirus pandemic has turned our vibrant modern cities into virtual ghost towns. Tens of thousands of Australians are without jobs and 24.6 million people have been told to stay home unless they absolutely have to go outside. The economic downturn and social distancing measures are changing the way we interact with others and the places we frequent in our community. Some of those changes are noticeable — playgrounds taped off, empty highways, even automated pedestrian crosswalk lights so people don't need to touch a button. But what lasting change will COVID-19 have on the ways our cities, suburbs and towns operate? ""Take a deep breath and get ready for the 2020s being the era of massive change,"" predicts Curtin University sustainability Professor Peter Newman. ""There's going to be a huge number of things which will facilitate that."" Across Australia, thousands of people used to commuting to bustling city business districts each day are now working from their suburban homes. Julian Bolleter, co-director of the Australian Urban Design Research Centre, said he expected a sustained cultural shift towards working from home even after the pandemic had passed. ""I think it's forced a lot of organisations to work online, even though the technology has been around for some time,"" he said. ""I think we won't be the same again and people will adapt to this new way of working. ""Now, of course, normality will return to some degree, but I think a shift will have occurred."" Peter Ciemitis, from planning and design firm RobertsDay, said he believed that shift could revive the neighbourhood high street. ""It means the local place, the local neighbourhood, becomes all important,"" he said. ""You still need to try to avoid cabin fever. You still need to try to get out and perhaps go for a walk, try to grab a takeaway coffee if you can, or something of that nature."" He said while many high streets were struggling economically before COVID-19, they remained essential pillars of suburban life. ""The power of the high street is that even in the darkest of hours, you can't switch it off,"" Mr Ciemitis said. ""You're not going to close down the high street, it's still going to operate, at least if nothing else, as a street with some businesses closed, some still trading but it's still going to be there. ""That's one of its strengths, its resilience to get through the hardest of times."" Mr Bolleter said there would still be an important role for the CBD. ""Despite everything, by far the greatest employer in Western Australia is the central business district of Perth,"" he said. ""Something like 80 per cent of Australia's GDP goes through the centre of Melbourne and Sydney. ""I wouldn't be selling your downtown office just yet. I think that will come back, I just think it might be nuanced or moderated a bit more with the experience of working remotely. ""But I do think people are going to be forced to spend more time in their neighbourhood, that much is certain."" The need for every Australian to practice safe social distancing to limit the spread of COVID-19 has had several noticeable impacts on the urban environment. Main Roads WA said weekday traffic on arterial roads had fallen by up to 50 per cent compared to normal. Public transport usage across our cities has dropped by 60 per cent, forcing the cancellation of bus, train and ferry services. Mr Bolleter said he believed it would take years for the public to become comfortable with public transport again. ""I don't think this will do public transport any favours,"" he said. ""Even if the fear is not rational, if there is still a perception of the risk that lingers after this — which I can only imagine it will — that's not good news. ""I think this works against public transport, people being confined in buses and railway carriages where people cough on you. ""It might help to fuel some of those alternative private transport modes, like electric bikes, electric scooters, skateboards, cycling — I think all that is going to grow."" Mr Ciemitis said in the long term, public transport would still be viable and necessary. ""That psychological scarring might be one of the things that takes a while to get beyond,"" he said. ""But despite the rate at which we might return back to normal, public transport is not only here to stay, but it will be the thing that makes our city work better into the future. ""Dyed-in-the-wool motorists might actually start experiencing the joy of riding bike. ""They might then suddenly get it in terms of understanding how the street works for cyclists and what we do need to do to make our streets safer for cycling."" Mr Ciemitis said COVID-19 could also trigger a rethink of how communal facilities were designed. ""I think there will be some nervousness about touch,"" he said. ""We might see a need to be even more conscious with how we design outside features. ""For example, the local park across the street could have a fence and a gate that you use to enter because it's on a busy street. ""A gate like that may need to be elbow-operated rather than operated by hand in the future. ""We might see a little details like that change, but I don't think there's going to be anything that's incredibly ground-shatteringly different."" Mr Bolleter said he saw a shift back to suburban living as another unintended consequence of COVID-19. ""I think from this will emerge a greater appreciation of suburban living,"" he said. ""If you're living in an apartment in say, the middle of Paris, your apartment is just like a bed you go to sleep in. ""Life is more about living in the parks, living in cafes and bars and it's a very much more communal existence. ""My sense is if this period of lockdown goes for as long as people are expecting, there's going to be a kind of withdrawal where people will want to have everything they need within their own block of land. ""It's not to say apartments won't have their place, but I think just generally this will see an emphasis back on suburban living and the virtues that can offer."" Mr Ciemitis said there was still a place for density, so long as it was planned correctly. ""It's been really interesting seeing in fairly compact cities people actually coming out onto their balconies singing and there is that connectedness that's starting to happen between communities,"" he said. ""The way we've designed many of our suburbs, you go into your home and you can't see your neighbours. ""The pendulum has maybe swung a little bit too far in terms of preserving privacy. ""With density, there has to be a lot of attention paid to good design so there is a balance between privacy but also the capacity to engage as a community."" But he said he could understand suburban life would be appealing at this time because of the emphasis on parks and recreation. ""We're seeing the large park complexes with great walking tracks and cycling tracks becoming very busy,"" he said. ""I think this is the time when we're really realising that importance. ""Also, many people are electing to put the biggest house on the smallest block because they are getting the most bang for the buck. ""But often so many people have been regarding the backyard spaces as wasted space. They don't really have a purpose for it, they perhaps just put some alfresco there. ""I think this is a time when it's a great reminder of how important it is to have a garden area."" You only need to look to the past to find evidence of when massive world events have triggered changes to the urban form. ""After the Spanish Flu, there was a significant change of pushing in garden suburbs, creating gardens, so that you would have that wonderful bucolic experience of a healthy countryside environment in the place where you live,"" Mr Ciemitis said. ""So we've now got the legacy of that — most of our suburbs are designed that way."" Mr Newman said with a global emphasis on climate change and emissions reduction, he predicted COVID-19's legacy being one of a green revolution. ""There is a massive change in technology which has been building up,"" he said. ""Cars were the number one priority as we came out of the last depression and war and across the world, we built our cities around the car. ""Along with oil, this was the technology that was going to transform us. ""Well, we're going to transform in our cities yet again, but not with that technology. ""They're going to be transformed with renewables and electric vehicles, and trackless trams. ""2020 has started with a bang as far as COVID and it's going to be an era of significant change as we begin a new economy that's much more regenerative for the environment. ""It's killed off the old economy. Let's start again. Let's do it better.""

214,How the coronavirus lockdown will drive up electricity costs for households,house-and-home,"  The Schroeder residence has become a little crowded since the coronavirus lockdown. Normally Katinga Schroeder shares the house with her husband and daughter, but her son has been forced home from the United States where he was attending college in Lexington, Kentucky. ""He is still on Kentucky time, so up in the early hours of the morning, lights on, computer on, connecting to classes via Zoom, charging his phone and his laptop, watching Netflix in downtime and cooking at odd hours,"" Ms Schroeder said. Her daughter, Rachael, is studying for her HSC as best she can from home. ""She is charging devices and connecting to classes via Canvas, watching Netflix in downtime or Facetiming with friends,"" her mother said. Ms Schroeder used to go to choir every week. Now she's joining it online, as well as working from home, charging a laptop and a phone, and spending more time on the landline due to ""patchy"" mobile coverage. Now she is waiting for the bill shock. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Her back-of-the-envelope calculation is sobering. ""With people at home 24/7, cooking a lot more, using the dishwasher a lot more, the coffee machine more, watching more TV, doing everything we would normally do face-to-face via Skype or Zoom, it will cost each household potentially up to 50 per cent more during this pandemic,"" she said. Recently, she wrote to the New South Wales Energy Ombudsman outlining her concerns. ""My point is, with all of us expected to do everything from home for the next three months, the burden on households will be noticeable, especially through their energy bills,"" she wrote. ""Will there be any relief?"" It is a concern shared by a coalition of consumer, community, church and welfare organisations, including the Australian Council of Social Service, The Brotherhood of Saint Laurence, the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association, Consumer Action Law Centre, the Ethnic Communities Council, the Physical Disability Council of NSW, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, Uniting Communities and the St Vincent de Paul Society. ""Without better support, this winter many families [will] face a choice between heating their homes and having enough money for food and rent,"" said Craig Memery, head of energy policy at the Public Interest Advocacy Centre. This coalition wants Federal Government funding and stronger commitments from energy businesses to help people afford their energy bills during the COVID-19 crisis. Cassandra Goldie, chief executive of peak welfare lobby group the Australian Council of Social Service, said it was ""incumbent on companies who are providing essential services to put people first [and] to provide relief and a level of comfort during this uncertain and unprecedented period"". The industry has already put in place a range of measures to assist customers in hardship. It's the biggest financial lifeline package in Australia's history. So who's eligible and when will the money reach people's pockets? Energy retailers AGL, Origin and Energy Australia have committed to suspending disconnections and debt recovery. Energy networks across New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia have also announced they will defer network charges for some small business and residential customers enduring hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Australian Energy Regulator and governments have taken a number of steps to soften the bill shock, such as a commitment by the NSW Government to boost an Energy Accounts Payment Assistance Scheme. And the Australian Parliament has legislated the biggest emergency support package in the nation's history to support employment and boost assistance to the jobless. But the community and welfare groups say more needs to be done. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. ""These are welcome and necessary steps,"" Mr Memery said. ""But temporarily suspending disconnections and debt collection won't stop winter energy bills for many households jumping by $200 a month."" According to welfare groups, energy retailers have had to close call centres in Australia and overseas because of coronavirus-related health and safety risks. They want the Government to consider supporting energy businesses to increase their customer support  — a measure they maintain will create local jobs at a time of rising unemployment — in return for commitments from energy retailers to give further assistance to customers. Tim Newman, 28, is now working from home as an audio visual technician from Dulwich Hill in Sydney — and awaiting the next energy bill. ""I am expecting at least a degree of bill shock,"" he said. Mr Newman was working at the University of Sydney and his housemate was also on campus studying before the lockdown. ""Now each of us is using two 24-inch, 40-watt monitors, going all the workday,"" he said. ""And the workday bleeds into the evening when you are home."" And ""tonnes"" of tea and coffee means the kettle is getting a hefty workout. ""There is no zip tap at home, that's for sure,"" he said. ""I can't quantify the increased use of power in my house."" But he still counts himself lucky. ""A whole lot of people in my team were working casually on events and the events have been suspended. They are all out of work,"" he said. ""There are a bunch of people on fixed-term contracts; they will end and may not be renewed."" Mark Henley from Uniting Communities said the newly unemployed are among his organisation's biggest concerns, along with low-income private sector renters, people with disabilities and casual workers, many of whom will not qualify for the JobKeeper wage subsidy.

215,opinion: I have a dilemma that has added a strange layer to self-isolation: adult kids,house-and-home,"  A lot of us are in lockdown with kids in the house. But what do you do when those kids are university students who haven't lived at home for months? In a city where rents are expensive, and the interstate university colleges where they used to live are closed, my family finds itself in self-isolation with two university students who are studying online. Suddenly, we are a family of four again. I was delighted to have our beautiful young adults back with us. We were hoping to take advantage of reassimilating and getting to know each other again, doing the quality-time thing. But it's a different landscape to raising school-age children. For one, the hours are different. As I write this it's about 2.30 in the afternoon.  I've been up with my husband since before 7am and Uni Student One, who is 20, has just got out of bed. The younger one is still asleep. We don't expect him to grace us with his presence before 5pm. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Living with uni students is like living with perpetual jetlag except that it is not your own. We aren't operating on the same time zones. Now let me qualify this: they haven't been out disobeying the Government's directions to not socialise in groups of more than two. They haven't had any mates to the house — we are self-isolating after all. They haven't even left the house in over a week. So far, so legally good. Yet neither of them were in bed until after 5am so they are catching up on their eight hours. Like the possums and bats that frequent the nightscape around where we live, I've discovered my sons are nocturnal: their natural hours of wakefulness barely coincide with mine. I'm used to a little coming and going during the night (okay sometimes more than a little) but it's an adjustment having them back, and for them too after the freedoms of living away. It's not just the time zones that are different. The culture shock is real too. While in lockdown, one son has decided to take up a hobby: he's learning guitar. And while it might be lovely to be strummed to sleep it's far less enjoyable being awoken in the middle of the night to the sound of someone attempting to learn a Jimmy Hendrix riff. (And I stress that's not ""playing"", just ""learning"", which means repeating the same series of chords over and over and over again, and singing the same lyrics on repeat). Uni Student 2, traditionally the more sporty of the two, has set up a home gym out the back of the house and in the garage using whatever he can cobble together. This means some old weights, some kitchen items, the broom, a back pack with what I think must be dirt inside. Frankly, I don't want to know. I was so looking forward to life with my children again. But instead, life with the uni students means every four bars of Hendrix's Foxy Lady is punctuated with the great thud of a dropped weight on the concrete or a loud grunt of exertion. My sons' body clocks make it impossible for us to time meals together (so much for that quality time). Hubby and I eat regularly at 7.30pm and the meal we choose at that time is called dinner. Not breakfast. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Dinner for the nocturnal members of the household occurs around 3am and involves microwaving the prepared family meal that they couldn't eat at their ""breakfast"" time. If they are still hungry, I can look forward to a cacophony of banging. It's not weights or music this time, but pots and pans, kitchen drawers, microwave oven doors and fridge doors, over and over again. It finishes not long before my day to begins again, at 6am, with the aftermath from this 3am banquet they didn't quite manage to clean up. So what to do with people who are vibrantly alive in the middle of the night while us parents are trying to sleep in order to be ready to work from home in the morning? There's plenty of advice for home schooling or entertaining 10-year-olds with online trips to the zoo or recycled craft projects. But what do you do with young people who are a little too old to be sent to bed or the naughty corner? In this household, it's a dilemma that has added a strange new layer to self-isolation. And even though they're young adults it reminds of a time when we used to be awoken to the cries of hunger or the dirty nappy and the argument about who had to get up earlier for work tomorrow and who could do without sleep and get up and change the baby! We'll be thankful they toilet themselves now and feed themselves at whatever time. Because for the first time in a while we're all back together, in the one nest, with time to laugh about who was the loudest baby, who was the most terrible two year old and who made Mum angry. Best of all we get to enjoy those Dad jokes all over again! Who would have thought that there was a silver lining to coronavirus lockdown but it's nice to have time to be ""us four"" again. So we continue to be patient, as much as we can, for as long as this time lasts.

216,How the coronavirus lockdown has transformed our lives in a couple of weeks,house-and-home,"  It might feel like months since Queensland was put into lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus but in reality the strict social-distancing measures have only been in force since late March. That's a little over two weeks. But a lot has changed in that time — and the new normal is vastly different. Many streets are deserted as the majority of people try to work from home. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The most popular Gold Coast beaches will be closed today following the shutdown of other tourist hotspots and national parks. Airports are empty and planes are grounded. Very few people are flying domestically as states limit cross-border travel, international travel is banned and the arrival of Australians from overseas is slowing day by day. All international visitors are banned from entering Australia. You even have to pack your own groceries at major supermarkets. To get into the aisles, you need to wait for the shop to be empty enough before being allowed to enter. The lockdown started on March 22, with non-essential services including pubs, clubs and restaurants closed. Later that week, Queensland shut its borders to non-essential travellers. By March 30, more severe restrictions were put in place, including the two-person rule and a law banning people from being outside their homes except for four essential reasons (work, groceries, exercise and medical reasons). Ruth Moores barely remembers life pre-COVID-19. Active cases: 38 Latest information from Queensland Health. The past few weeks have been a blur, with so many changes it's like time is playing a trick on her. Just a couple of weeks ago it was situation normal, ferrying her four active daughters around for school drop-offs and pick-ups and after-school activities. Her eldest daughters had been looking forward to a choir trip to Europe in June and July. A respiratory nurse herself, Ms Moores said she knew COVID-19 was a worry, but she was still coming to terms with how the pandemic had left the world reeling. Ms Moores' husband is a specialist working in intensive care. For her, staying home is a no-brainer. ""Particularly as I have a family member looking after patients with COVID-19, these patients potentially could die from the virus and there is a small risk that the health worker could also die,"" she said. ""It may not be a risk to you personally, but we have to look at what we are doing as a community and look after the community as a whole instead of thinking only of ourselves."" Hygiene has been the key in their home to ensure they all stay well and her husband can keep working. When she leaves the house, it's alone on short trips to get essentials. ""When I go shopping, I have been washing my shopping bags prior so I am using fresh ones each time,"" she said. ""Only touching what is necessary. Don't stop and talk to people. ""The main take-home thing is wash your hands with soap and water."" While acknowledging all this upheaval could be distressing, she insisted it was the only choice. Publicist Ella Petite, 33, said the restrictions had forced her to embrace a ""more simple way of living"". ""It feels like time has slowed down, but I'm trying hard to not look at things in a negative light,"" she said. ""Instead of filling my time with going out and going to the pub, I've focused on reconnecting with things in my home. ""I'm doing a lot more cooking, I've started a compost heap, reading a lot more books."" Like many Queenslanders, Ms Petite's income took a hit when a number of her clients cancelled work. But she has tried to remain positive by increasing her ""virtual connections"" with friends and family. ""Not physically seeing people and my family has been the biggest adjustment and it's been quite hard,"" she said. ""But we've been doing lots of online chats. ""We had a Mexican family dinner over Zoom last week where we all cooked Mexican food and ate it together — and that was lovely, but it's the only way we can connect now."" Queensland Health authorities have indicated the lockdown measures could remain in place for up to six months. That's a bit over five months to go.

217,"Spend $2,000, receive $6,000: Top End home renovation scheme keeping tradies at work",house-and-home,"  It's tough work building homes in the tropical heat of the Top End. But amid the economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, builder Peter MacFarlane still has a smile on his face. ""The last couple of weeks, we would have had at least 20, maybe 30, different enquiries of jobs of all different shapes and sizes,"" the owner of Darwin-based company PMAC Construction said. The increased demand can be attributed to a NT Government offer that seems almost too good to be true. Territory homeowners who spend $2,000 of their own money on renovations are being given up to $6,000 from the government. The main requirement is that the work be done by a registered business in the Territory, to ensure local tradies are given a chance to survive the COVID-19 crisis. Workers and property owners also have to abide by social distancing regulations. So far, almost 1,000 businesses have signed up to scheme, with some reporting a significant boost in work. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Get the latest information from the SecureNT website. ""There's people out there that possibly wouldn't have taken on these jobs previously,"" Mr MacFarlane said. ""But now, with such a generous grant from the government, there's definitely a lot of people wanting to take advantage of it."" For Adrian Moscheni, owner of Straitline Blinds in Darwin, the Home Improvement Scheme has been a lifeline. Like many other businesses, he's had to endure tough trading conditions over recent years because of the Territory's sluggish economy. The pandemic was the last thing he needed. ""Two years of hard yakka, and now compiled with this coronavirus, is a real bitter pill to swallow,"" Mr Moscheni said. Ever since the Government announced its scheme, customers have been coming back, he said. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. ""People [with] quotes going back as far as August last year [who] had been sitting on their quote and not sure what to do, have rung and said: 'Let's go'."" The Home Improvement Scheme — one of several COVID-19 stimulus packages launched in the NT — will cost the cash-strapped Gunner Government $30 million. Treasurer Nicole Manison said the NT Government needed to do all it could to prevent job losses. ""We are telling Territorians now, if you go out and use the Home Improvement Scheme, you are actually helping save a Territorians job,"" Ms Manison said. Economist Rolf Gerritsen said the Territory Government, which had overseen ballooning debt levels during its reign, was in a bind. ""If they do nothing, unemployment will go up, and you will increase your social costs,"" the professorial research fellow from Charles Darwin University said. ""So they have to do something and worry about the budget [later], assuming they get re-elected in August."" But Mr Gerritsen said the $30 million handout was not free money for recipients. ""The taxpayer ultimately has to pay that back,"" he said. ""So for the individuals who have the money … it's good. But for the generality of taxpayers, it's not good."" Mr Gerritsen also warned the sudden increase in demand could lead to a surge in prices. ""Subsidy schemes artificially inflate demand,"" he said. ""And [when] you have a fixed supply of tradesmen or builders, the tendency is for the builders and tradies to up their prices slightly.""

218,'It's so quiet here': Coronavirus in Australia's suburban bubble,house-and-home,"  It is the picture of suburban Australia. The lawnmower, freshly cut grass, brick house in the background. But Nathan Clissold wasn't supposed to be mowing the lawn this week. In fact, he wasn't even supposed to be at home. He was supposed to be getting married, in Wollongong. ""I remember watching the news two weeks ago and seeing those updates come in,"" he told the ABC. ""I looked at my partner Alice and said: 'I don't think we're going to able to do this'."" It soon became much clearer. After months of planning they were forced to cancel their original plans. Instead, his home — which he was sprucing up this week — is set to be the wedding venue. And because of social-distancing measures, the wedding will look very, very different. ""It'll be me and Alice, our two mothers and the celebrant,"" he said. ""It is what it is. But it was bloody hard telling both our dads they couldn't come to our wedding."" Like millions of Australians, Nathan's life has been turned upside down. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The concept of going to a wedding, going on holiday, visiting friends or even just venturing outside is of a different time — a time before coronavirus. As a nation, most of us are confined in the suburban bubbles we call home — so what is happening out there, beyond your four walls? ABC photographer Brendan Esposito drove around a section of Sydney's suburbia to see how some Australians are adapting to this new way of life. And it seems some are taking the pandemic more seriously than others. In Mount Druitt in Sydney's west, a group of three young men — two wearing makeshift facemasks — questioned whether coronavirus was ""real"" and said they wouldn't be doing social distancing. The shops were shuttered up. Only a few people were around But chores, like the washing, still needed to be done. At his home garage barbershop in a nearby suburb, 18-year-old Hadi Ghadban was hanging out with his brothers, smoking shisha. ""It's a tough time right now,"" he said. ""I have to go to work [as a barber] at the Parramatta Westfield. It's been cut back from five days to two. ""But I'm scared about it — I'm scared I'm going to bring the virus back home and give it to my mum and dad, or niece."" Down the road, Farah Ballah was sitting on his balcony, checking his phone. He's an on-call handyman. But his phone hasn't rung for a long time. ""I came back after visiting family in Sudan on March 11,"" he said. ""People are scared. They don't want anyone in their homes. ""I have two children. I don't know what's going to happen."" For Margaret Mossakowska, the scenario of social distancing is eerily familiar. Originally from Poland, the former statistician said in the early 1980s her country of birth banned large social gatherings during a period of martial law. ""But the communists did that,"" she said. ""This is different."" For her, the little things are the hardest. ""It's the silence,"" she said. ""It's so quiet here at the moment. I had a talk with my neighbour from across the street and my whole suburb could hear me. ""And touch, I just want to touch and to hug people."" Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. But like many reaching out across the digital world, Margaret is finding new ways for human connection. Margaret, now a sustainability and permaculture expert, is going online to teach people in the suburbs how to grow their own produce. ""I hope people will go back to basics, and see how simple the world can be,"" she said. This week she gave an online class about keeping chickens in suburban backyards. Margaret was joined on the stream by Bridget Kennedy. The two became friends online after an edible garden tour they were working on was cancelled because of COVID-19, and the project went digital instead. ""We've built a whole new community online,"" she said. Bridget runs a contemporary jewellery business in North Sydney which had to shut because of the coronavirus threat. She said her anxieties — both financial and personal — were ""skyrocketing"" when she closed the doors. But she said she had since found solace in her suburban garden. ""These are crazy times,"" she said. ""But I've been spending a lot of time in our garden — we've been eating the food from it. ""I've come to terms with it now. The universe has said you have to sit back for a while, so we're doing that."" For Nathan, the weirdest thing during this period — apart from having his wedding being moved to his backyard — is not being able to shake hands. ""It's just what we do isn't it?"" he said. He and his fiancee are making new plans for a big party to celebrate their wedding when the travel restrictions are over. They'll also be booking a new honeymoon due to their planned celebration in Fiji being cancelled. Having had COVID-19 derail the biggest day of his life, Nathan had some sage advice. ""We've just got to take it day-by-day,"" he said. ""Just try to live our lives and be there for each other.""

219,"Coronavirus curbs house price growth, with worse around the corner",house-and-home,"  National house prices hold up in March, but it's just a matter of time before coronavirus reduces property gains The impact of coronavirus is starting to trickle through to house prices, but it is early days yet with price rises across most capital cities still driving national dwelling prices up 0.7 per cent last month. The bad news for those who own a home or investment property is the March reading was the lowest monthly gain since the market lifted in July last year, property data analysts CoreLogic said. But this weakening in the growth trend in the second half of the month, as consumer confidence slumped and social distancing policies took hold, is expected to worsen. CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless said a period of ""unprecedented uncertainty"" could drag Australia's economy into a recession for the first time in almost 30 years, which would see activity, and eventually house prices, plunge. He said the global financial crisis was short and sharp, but coronavirus had already hurt consumer confidence more than it had during the 2008 crisis, and its overall impact could be more damaging. ""It's the sheer uncertainty of a health-related crisis, rather than an economic one, or a financial catalyst, that's the big difference here,"" he said. ""There's a lot more uncertainty, particularly when you're seeing several parts of the economy shutting down for an extended period of time."" Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. One economist, AMP's Shane Oliver has already forecast the unemployment rate could double to 10 per cent or more, and that could dent national house prices by 20 per cent. Mr Lawless said that was a possibility. ""It does seem extreme at the moment, but the wildcard here is we don't know how long this shutdown will last,"" Mr Lawless said. ""We don't know how long the economy is going to be in hibernation."" Mr Lawless said the Federal Government's $130 billion stimulus announced this week to protect jobs, while welcome, would still not prevent the unemployment rate surging. Mr Lawless also noted a substantial reduction in listing activity ahead. About 40 per cent of the country's real estate auctions were withdrawn over the weekend as stricter social-distancing rules introduced by the Federal Government last week — including a ban on auction gatherings and open homes — forced agents to instead undertake online auctions and private sales mostly negotiated by phone. Mr Lawless said real estate agent reports generated across CoreLogic platforms, used by about 70 per cent of real estate agents for their research and pre-listing reports, have more than halved over recent weeks. This implied a substantial drop in listings activity over coming weeks. ""Similarly, recent polling of real estate agency enquiry levels indicated that more than 60 per cent of Australian real estate agents have seen buyer and seller enquiries fall by more than 50 per cent over recent weeks, with the larger majority expecting a further drop in enquiry over coming weeks,"" he said. Over the month, housing values rose across every capital city apart from Hobart, which declined 0.2 per cent. Over the March quarter, every capital city recorded a rise in housing values. The spread of coronavirus across Australia could see unemployment reach about 10 per cent and house prices drop 20 per cent, says one economist. Sydney had the highest growth over the quarter with values up 3.9 per cent, followed by Melbourne at 2.9 per cent and Canberra at 1.7 per cent. But some of the best performing capital city sub-regions recorded a month-on-month decline. Melbourne's inner east, where values were previously rising rapidly, recorded a 0.2 per cent drop over the month. Dwelling values across Melbourne's inner south and the Sutherland region of Sydney also edged lower over the month, along with the Brisbane sub-regions of Ipswich and Logan/Beaudesert. Nationally, the lowest capital city quarterly gain was in Darwin and Adelaide, each increasing 0.6 per cent, and a similar story occurred across the regional areas of each state, with values higher over the month and quarter. However, Mr Lawless noted that recent trends in the market would become irrelevant as coronavirus continued to affect people's jobs and dent household confidence. He said bans on open homes and on-site auctions would compound the slowdown in buyer activity, as would any future policy announcements restricting services such as building and pest inspections, conveyancing and furniture removals. But he said the crisis was temporary, and along with hundreds of billions of dollars of government stimulus, leniency from lenders for distressed borrowers and record low interest rates, house prices would eventually rebound again. It would all depend on the duration of the crisis, he said. ""We've seen total stimulus measures now getting close to 16 per cent of GDP … so it is an enormous amount of capital flowing into the market."" ""With interest rates as low as they are for at least the next three years, that should help support the market as we see the economy improving — whenever that is."" Premium value properties led the pace of capital gains through the quarter, but this segment of the market also appears to have the most rapid deceleration in growth rate. At the high end of the market, the quarterly growth rate fell from 6.6 per cent over the December 2019 quarter, to 3.6 per cent over the March 2020 quarter. Mr Lawless said the recent deceleration in the growth rate of this segment could be a signal that growth would start to slow more broadly in the coming months. ""The coronavirus impact is likely to be broad-based across the different value segments of the property market,"" he said. ""A large proportion of jobs losses have been in lower-paid sectors, such as hospitality, travel or tourism. However, equity values have also been hard hit, which could contribute to weaker demand across the higher value segments of the market."" He said rental pressures had remained modest across most areas of Australia, with the national rental index up 0.3 per cent over the month and 1.2 per cent higher over the March quarter, but expected downwards pressure on rents going forward. Economists fear indebted households are more at risk during a recession. Australia's total debt to household income is at a record high of 186.5 per cent. ""No doubt there is a rising level of downside risk to housing values, which is compounded by the fragile state of household balance sheets, which on average, are heavily leveraged,"" Mr Lawless said. CommSec senior economist Ryan Felsman said the housing market was in good shape until the coronavirus disruptions began to take their toll on home prices from mid-March. He said house prices were up 9.1 per cent on a year ago and prices of apartments had increased by 8.3 per cent — the strongest annual growth rate in over four years. ""The housing market has been a bright spot for the Aussie economy,"" he said. ""But with the onset of coronavirus pandemic and the restrictive measures put in place to try and contain the virus, budding Aussie property buyers have become increasingly cautious about upgrading or purchasing their first new home."" On Wednesday the ABS also released its February building approval figures. These were stronger than expected with total dwellings rebounding off the fall in January in seasonally adjusted terms. ""Up 20 per cent on the previous month, this was the largest month on month gain since 2013,"" BIS Oxford economist Maree Kilroy said. ""All of the growth came from attached dwellings, with high-density approvals in Victoria once again surpassing expectation."" But houses softened 2 per cent, despite New South Wales and Queensland recording monthly growth. ""The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to cause a second leg down in the residential construction downturn,"" she said. ""Extreme economic anxiety and the banning of public auctions and open house inspections will see the demand for new dwellings take a big hit over the remainder of 2020.""

220,'I'm going nuts right now': Our tiny house dream has soured in lockdown,house-and-home,"  Four months ago, I moved into a 29-square-metre studio apartment with my girlfriend, Sarah. Please don't ask how much rent we're paying. Our thinking when we signed the lease — call it ""wishful millennial"" — was based on the location. Our new neighbourhood in Toronto, Canada, was so full of hip bars, trendy cafes and stores selling handmade ceramic mugs, we figured we'd be too busy going out, drinking coffee and buying ceramic mugs to spend any time at home. The front door of our place opens into the living area underneath a loft bed. The kitchen, with a bar fridge, is in the same space. At the back, a short passage to the bathroom contains two storage niches. That's it. The assumptions underpinning our move to this shoebox started to look a little shaky when our city's bars and restaurants closed as part of the effort to contain COVID-19. They teetered when Sarah was sent home from work and claimed half the home office (which also happens to be the home gym, bedroom, kitchen and living room). And they collapsed in a heap when I developed flu-like symptoms. As I write, we haven't left in six days. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic I know that in the broad scheme of coronavirus-related problems, this is small beans. I'm not in a high-risk group, I don't have children to worry about, my elderly relatives aren't sick, my partner isn't abusive and I haven't lost my job (yet). I'm lucky. On the other hand, in ways both concrete and abstract, all our lives are likely to change for the worse in the coming months, so we may as well whinge about it. We're not going to have much else to do, are we? The process might even be therapeutic. I'll start us off. I'm going nuts right now. What's the opposite of social distancing? Because that's what Sarah and I are currently practising. The furthest we're ever apart is when one of us goes to the bathroom. Even then, the gap is only four metres and a door. Jokes about coronavirus causing a surge in divorces aside, the crisis may be a pressure test many couples are unprepared for, with experts warning relationships could sustain ""irreversible"" damage in coming months. The biggest problem is getting work done. As a freelancer I'm used to being self-starting. The challenges many workers are experiencing for the first time (finding the motivation to shower every day etc) aren't issues for me (humble brag, I know). The issue is that our current home workspace features all the well-known drawbacks of open-plan offices, concentrated into a miniscule area. Neither of us has a desk to call our own, nor any privacy. The ""breakout"" space is the bathroom. When I'm writing on the couch, Sarah is doing yoga on the floor. When Sarah is on a conference call, I'm making lunch. It's some consolation that we're not alone. Plenty of other people who live in cramped quarters suddenly need to optimise their home lives right now. So to get some advice on how we might do this, I spoke to an expert: Elle Paton, who lives in a 20-square-metre house in St Kilda, Melbourne, and works for Tiny Non-profit, an NGO that lobbies councils to include tiny houses in their planning. Paton's off-grid home features an all-in-one living space with a couch that converts to a bed when it's time to go to sleep. She advises that adjusting to a small space is as much a mental change as a physical one. ""Sometimes it can be harder to psyche yourself up for work when you're still in your living room,"" she says. ""You have to stay connected to why you do what you do. It's less about how and more about why."" Paton doesn't dismiss the importance of ergonomics, however. I don't disagree: my couch desk isn't doing much good for my neck. ""When this house was designed, we thought about the ergonomics of the workspace,"" she says of her little home. ""The height of my desk was important, so that I could sit or stand for longer."" Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. ""I also use the kitchen bench as a standing desk to make sure I'm not in one position for an extended period of time. Sometimes I work outside with the deck as my standing desk. Variety and movement are key."" Paton admits to feeling some trepidation at the possibility of a lockdown, but is trying to remain cheerful. ""One of the things a tiny house forces you to do is think about what's important to you,"" she says. ""At the start of this, I sat down and wrote myself a long list of things I've wanted to do for a long time but haven't been able to do because I've been so busy. I'm good: I've got a lot to get on with."" From now on, I'll try to take a leaf out of her book and look on the bright side. For starters, us shoebox dwellers can proudly say we played no part in the toilet paper panic, if only because we had nowhere to put the stuff.

221,"Two lost jobs, three working from home: my share house is a like a warped test case",house-and-home,"  ""Well, what else are we gonna do?"" The message went around my share house group message chain on Thursday. A Friday night barbeque inside the protected (hopefully germ-free) realm of our yellow terrace house in inner-city Sydney was the plan. That is, if we could find something to cook. Before coronavirus, trying to organise a Friday night barbeque with five late-20s/early-30-something housemates was pretty much impossible. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic We'd all have Friday night drinks, dates, individual plans — you wouldn't bother trying. But like a lot of things over the past week, those days are gone. As coronavirus changes our lives forever, new realities have emerged. And my house is like a warped test case of the virus's impact on young professionals — pretty much a demographer's dream. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Two of my housemates, both freelance TV producers, lost their jobs overnight. Gone. Done. No more income. Just brutal. One of them sent a text through to the house group chain on Wednesday: ""House fam,"" it read. ""What's your age and how long you been living in the house again? I need it for Centrelink. Cool"" At the start of the month, my housemate sending a text like that was simply implausible. She was travelling overseas to start a three-month contract on a very successful reality TV show (well, as successful as you can in today's TV land). She was saving to buy a house. Not anymore. She baked cupcakes instead this week and completed a puzzle. Both are unsure what they're going to do — their previous experience in retail and making coffee is redundant as well. Scott Morrison's call for people to man the phones at Centrelink is something one of them is seriously considering, while the other worked on a live entertainment streaming event last night. ""We're just trying to remain busy and creative in this time,"" she told me. ""We don't know if it'll make any money but we have to give it it a try."" The other two housemates — it's a big house — kept their jobs. They both work in the digital space, one of the few areas — outside of toilet paper manufacturing — that appears to be safe from drastic cuts. In the meantime, for us still lucky enough to work, our house has turned into a makeshift co-working space, with Zoom meetings and emails pinging around like Tom Cruise on that computer in Minority Report. It's utterly surreal. But we're lucky; we're all healthy. We've all been very mindful of physical distancing measures and basic hygiene (I think I've washed my hands more over the past two weeks than the previous two months put together). We know how important it is to stay home (I made the house watch Foreign Correspondent on Tuesday night — we do not want to turn into Italy). We've been exercising (one housemate bought one of those ""you got a door, you got a gym"" things and has been doing five chin-ups every time he needs to go to the ""lunchroom"" — our kitchen). And we've been looking out for each other's mental health. But none of us have been immune from the craziness of this time. At midday on Wednesday one of my housemates was seriously contemplating driving up to his family home on the Gold Coast to beat the border shutdown. Just repeating that: the border from NSW to Queensland is now closed. Closed. He knocked on my door and asked me the pros and cons of doing it. First con: he doesn't have a car. Pro: He wanted to get back home to spend what could end up being a couple months with his family, whilst working remotely. I suggested he sleep on it. In the morning he realised it was silly. I mean, he didn't have a bloody car for starters. Reporting on this crisis from my bedroom has been just as surreal. Like millions of Australians I've had to change how I work and communicate — my phone battery is going dead twice in a day. I went into the ABC offices on Thursday to pick up my computer monitors (yes, two) to get my home office really crankin', and frankly it was just weird. I almost hissed at anyone that got near me to ""get back"". I sprayed so much Glen 20 on my desk that it was glowing. But working from home looks like the new reality for the time being. And a lot more is going to change. The reason I write this is Friday night is my last night in this lovely house. As a *ahem* 30-something ABC journalist, it was time to jump headfirst into the frankly terrifying Sydney rental market on my own (no, I can't afford to buy in Sydney). And I'm going to miss this house. Especially now. But one positive that has come out of this whole experience is the camaraderie I've experienced with my housemates and my friends, family and workmates. We've had Zoom social events (a disaster), friends dropping off dinners to others in isolation and workmates calling for daily welfare-checks. Being away from home myself the messages of support help a lot — so do the memes and brilliant videos people are making whilst under quarantine. ""No Australian should have to go through this alone,"" the Prime Minister said on Friday. And he's right. In this house, our Friday night social lives are gone for the time being. But in the greater scheme of things, it's a tiny, tiny sacrifice. For more than a million Australians their income is gone. And I've made a pact to myself that if I ever get selfish during this time I'll think of those people in the Centrelink queue. I don't have to look far — there are two in my house. Or I'll think of the health workers on the frontline treating the unfortunate ones who have contracted this horrible virus. As we've been told, people will die — they are already dying — and it's going to be hard. But, as the medical experts tell us, if we do the right thing now eventually, at some point, our normal lives will come back. Eventually it'll happen. In meantime I'm going to enjoy my last supper with my temporary family — and then go do a few chin-ups in a doorway.

222,"Nigel's riverfront property dream turned into a nightmare, he says he just wants 'fair' compensation",house-and-home,"  Tamar River landslip compensation 'not fair', property owners say Nigel Lazenby had always dreamed of owning a house with a river frontage. He and his partner Clare had just finished building that dream house along the Tamar River at Deviot in Tasmania's north, when landslips they were never warned about started wreaking havoc on their home, cracking walls and making the house fall apart. The family is one of a small group of Deviot residents now threatening class action against the Tasmanian Government and West Tamar Council, if a bill offering to pay them out for their affected properties is passed in its current form. Tasmania's Lower House yesterday passed The Brickmakers Point Landslip Act 2020, which would allow the five affected landowners to sell their Deviot Road, Deviot properties to the Crown for 75 per cent of the value price before a major landslip in May 2016. Mr Lazenby described the 75 per cent payment offer as ""ridiculous"". ""Nobody in their right mind would accept it. I have spoken to a couple of neighbours, and each one of them can't afford to accept that, it's far too low,"" he said. ""I had it from a real estate agent that if we were to sell it, we'd be looking at some figure within the $800,000 mark, and what the government is offering is far less than half of that."" Nick Daking, who owns another property that's been deemed uninhabitable, said he was frustrated that the Lower House passed the bill in its current form. ""We had to move in with parents, we had to pull the kids out of school, we then had to go find another property,"" he said. ""We've been renting for four years since, plus had the costs associated with trying to leave the house and save it. ""It would actually put our family in a worst position today to accept a 75 per cent valuation of four years ago, so why would we accept it?"" Both Mr Daking and Mr Lazenby said the only consultation they'd had with the Government was a short meeting late last year. They said they would have ""no other option"" but to take class action against the Government and council if the bill wasn't amended. ""We're not trying to be greedy here, we're just trying to say 'hey, this is not fair',"" Mr Daking said. It has previously been suggested the risk of landslips was known by some, but building and development applications were approved anyway. The bill was introduced to the Upper House late yesterday, but debate was adjourned after Rosevears MLC Kerry Finch labelled it ""inadequate"" and called for it to be amended. ""I strongly urge the Government to revise upwards the land valuations from 75 per cent to closer to 100 per cent, while at the same time using today's real estate values, not four-year-old values,"" Mr Finch said. He said the subdivision should have never been allowed in the first place. ""There was evidence of serious errors by the state in its geological categorisation of the landslip-prone clay soils of the Brickmakers point area, plus the West Tamar Council had failed to acknowledge local knowledge about the [area],"" he said. Environment and Parks Minister Roger Jaensch said the bill was not about providing ""compensation"" to landowners and was ""opt-in"", meaning affected landowners didn't need to sell to the Government if they didn't want to. He said the bill was put out of ""compassion"", and would ensure the Crown and the West Tamar Council were ""indemnified against any future action for damages"". ""The intent is to prevent a person who accepts financial assistance under the legislation from then subsequently suing the crown and the council for damages in relation to the landslide,"" Mr Jaensch said. The five property owners sought financial compensation from the Tasmanian Government and the West Tamar Council last August, claiming they were not warned the area was prone to landslips before purchasing their properties and that the landslips had cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars in repairs. Opposition parties in the Lower House supported the bill, but were concerned it could set a precedent for other homeowners affected by similar natural processes, like coastal erosion. Tasmanian Greens leader Cassy O'Connor said the Government needed to be careful given the increasing impacts of sea level rises and storm surges. ""It does establish a precedent for government to step in when property owners are affected by natural events or events that are related to global heating,"" Ms O'Connor said. Mr Jaensch said the bill came from a precedent that already existed and said hazard mapping was improving. ""With regards to events like this, one would hope that there is less of a need for these sorts of responses in the future because there is better information,"" he said. If the bill passes the Upper House, ownership of properties that are purchased by the Crown would be transferred to the West Tamar Council following acquisition. The Government would fund demolition and remediation works for all acquired properties.

223,Backyard chickens in demand as coronavirus buying frenzy empties supermarkets,house-and-home,"  First they came for the toilet paper, then the pasta. Now chicken breeders are being inundated as more householders turn to backyard chooks for egg supplies while supermarket shelves empty of staple food products. Bond Enterprises in Queensland's Lockyer Valley has had a 30 per cent spike in sales of egg layers since the weekend as people look to become more self-sufficient during the coronavirus pandemic. They supply retailers such as rural and produce supply stores and pet shops, as well as small commercial pastured farmers from far north Queensland through to South Australia. ""It's mainly just people wanting to be self sufficient,"" said Bond Enterprises operations manager Travis Bond. ""Having birds in their backyard being able to produce a product, a table egg, that they know where it's coming from. And it's fresh."" While Bond Enterprises usually sell chickens at point-of-lay age — around 16-18 weeks — they are looking at having to sell younger birds not yet producing eggs to meet consumer demands. ""If needs be, we may have to [sell] 13 or 14-week-old birds as the demand keeps on spiralling,"" he said. ""[We would] discount the birds accordingly so that people aren't losing out with the additional feed that they'll have to have to feed the birds before they produce an egg."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic It is a welcome boon for an industry which has felt the impact of increased grain sales during Australia's drought. ""Sales for retail backyard chooks have declined over the last five to six years quite considerably,"" Mr Bond said. ""This is a welcome little bonus for us with the virus that's floating around and the general public being so wary of it at the moment."" Mr Bond warns people will still have a wait before their chickens start laying eggs. ""Usually the point-of-lay chook will start laying within two to six weeks,"" he said. But, he said, the wait will pay off — even with the current increased cost of grain. ""It still comes out fairly equitable and fairly even with what you'd be paying for a medium-priced egg in the supermarket, as well as having the benefit of knowing where the eggs come from,"" Mr Bond said. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. While commercial egg layer breeders are flat out supplying the retail market, smaller poultry suppliers dedicated to heritage breeds are also seeing a surge of interest in backyard chickens and more sustainable lifestyles. Kate Grealy, who runs the Sunshine Coast-based Perma-Poultry Market, said a heritage bird can take much longer to produce their first egg — up to seven months in some breeds — but are worth the investment in the longer term. ""They don't lay as many eggs over a year, but they live for many more years,"" she said. ""A commercial layer breed may lay eggs for around 14 months, whereas some of the larger heritage breeds may be laying for five to eight years.""

224,"Today we're in a toilet paper panic, but for thousands of years we went without",house-and-home,"  Modern technology has paved the way for the widespread availability of three-ply toilet paper, but that hasn't always been the case. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. From newspaper squares and torn phone book pages hanging on a bail in the outhouse, to tracing paper in the school toilet block, to even waxed apple wrappers — the world has been flush with innovative alternatives to toilet paper for centuries. ""We consider it indispensable,"" said UK writer Richard Smyth, author of Bum Fodder: An Absorbing History of Toilet Paper. ""But obviously for thousands of years, people have lived happily without it. ""Now we use it and we panic when we can't get hold of it."" Although the invention of paper for hygiene has been recorded in China as early as the 6th century AD, Smyth said the origin of modern-day toilet roll could be attributed to one man — an American named Joseph Gayetty. He sold packages of flat sheets infused with aloe as Gayetty's Medicated Paper back in 1857, in a market that was already full of newspapers, almanacs and magazines. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic ""He came up with the idea that printers ink caused haemorrhoids, which was nonsense, but enabled him to launch this product on the world and it's still with us today,"" he said. Before newspapers, rocks, grass, moss, shells and even broken pottery was used as an instrument to wipe. It all depended on what a person had to hand. The mechanism of wiping one's bottom took on a decidedly different shape in ancient Rome. One text by Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger in the 1st century AD documented the use of a sea sponge attached to a stick, used for posterior hygiene in latrines. Evidence for using the sponge stick is scarcely recorded, but is detailed in Seneca the Younger's story of the plight of a German gladiator in Rome before he fought against a wild animal. ""He said he needed to go to the loo, and so they let him go off to the loo — Seneca says it was the only chance he could get to be on his own,"" said Professor Tim Parkin, The Elizabeth and James Tatoulis Chair of Classics at the University of Melbourne. ""He committed suicide by stuffing the sponge on a stick down his throat, so that he would die rather than have to go into the arena and fight a wild animal. ""It is horrific, but clearly the toilets had these sponges in them."" Professor Parkin said it was almost certain that most Roman people had their own sponge sticks. Although modern-day toilet paper was invented in the United States in 1857, the introduction of toilet paper to Australia came decades later and coincided with the building of city sewers. Adelaide had a drainage system by 1885, while Sydney's was only partially complete by 1876. Melbourne did not gain a sewage system until 1890. Before sewers were built, just about anything was thrown in a system of cesspits, which would overflow when it rained and seep into groundwater. ""It was when we started flushing that you couldn't necessarily throw rags, leaves and newspaper down the toilet anymore,"" said Dr Sarah Hayes, senior research fellow at the Alfred Deakin Institute for Citizenship and Globalisation at Deakin University. Dr Hayes has researched the transition from cesspits, to night-pans, to sewers in Melbourne and said toilet paper and hygiene is an area that was seldom documented. ""The Melbourne City Council was debating the health hazards of cesspits and the different options that were available, there was lots of campaigning, lots of media press about this, but we haven't found a single mention about how people were wiping."" Dr Hayes said toilet paper used to be sold from behind the counter at chemists — although it was advertised as an improvement in hygiene, there was an element of embarrassment over being seen purchasing it. ""It's not something we really worry about anymore, but I think there probably was a social stigma about  [toilet paper]  at the time, but it is a funny one because it would only be rich people who would have been able to afford it,"" she said.

226,How a neighbourhood with back-to-front houses became a world-class suburban utopia,house-and-home,"  Crestwood defies odds to celebrate 50 years as the first 'perfect' Radburn neighbourhood in the world A ""catastrophe"", ""total disaster"", a ""crazy, ludicrous living hell"" — that's how politicians described some of Australia's most radically designed neighbourhoods. The design of the nation's capital itself was based in part on the US town of Radburn, New Jersey, where back-to-front homes have front doors opening on public parks rather than the street. In addition, fences are non-existent and circular streets twist around the neighbourhood, never intersecting with a winding network of footpaths. The Radburn concept was visionary when it was used in Canberra and dozens of other neighbourhoods across the country in the 1960s and 70s. But things didn't quite work as planned, and many areas were transformed into crime-infested slums. Many of those neighbourhoods were later bulldozed and rebuilt, but one shining example of a Radburn success story remains in the unpretentious southern Perth suburb of Thornlie and its residents are proud to have bucked the trend. Original Radburn architect Clarence Stein reportedly described the community of Crestwood, 18 kilometres south-east of Perth's CBD, as the ""first perfect Radburn scheme in the world"". ""The people, the residents, the atmosphere — there's no threats, you're safe no matter what, I was happy here all the time,"" said Rita Bernadette Fisher, one of the community's first homeowners. The residents of Crestwood — who this month celebrated 50 years as a village — said their strong community spirit spared them from the crime and privacy issues typical of shared living. ""I will come home from work and there will be either two, three or four of our neighbours — they'll end up on someone's driveway and they're having a good old yack,"" said resident of 38 years Maria van der Linden. ""When we go on holiday, they'll look after our garden. We do that for each other, that's really nice."" ""We just loved the layout of the place,"" added Ms van der Linden's husband, Emile. ""The kids can get to school without crossing any roads, you just go [through] underpasses all the way to school. ""After work you'd go and play with your kids out in the park — it's just a marvellous place to bring kids up in."" A 1978 resident survey found 60 per cent of homeowners were attracted to Crestwood by its aesthetics and 88 per cent were happier having moved there. Most agreed there was more social interaction in Crestwood than standard suburban estates and said coming home at the end of the day was like entering a separate world. There were also some negatives to the shared spaces. Some remarked living in Crestwood was ""a bit like having to dress for dinner and always be watching your manners"", while several people commented on the implied social pretence in the area and the ""existence of petty squabbles amongst residents"". Dan McDonald and his family moved from rural Queensland to a home in Crestwood late last year. ""Something that has been surprising or not expected, and we really enjoy it, is that everyone knows each other,"" he said. ""Because we both came from rural backgrounds, well that's a given for me that people talk to each other and that neighbours work together. ""But in the city, that's unheard of or it seems strange, it seems unusual. ""It seems so far that people here have mastered the art of living together, helping each other out without being too close."" There was also an unexpected, deeper benefit Mr McDonald and his family discovered. ""I felt lost in the city — I felt very detached and lonely even though I was surrounded by people,"" he said. ""It doesn't seem to be like that here — obviously it's not a beer over the back of a ute, but people will stop and have a chat over the back fence, look at the dog, have a yarn about the garden. ""Our oldest has some learning difficulties and she has very bad anxiety. The surroundings almost fixed that. ""She's a different child."" As for living back to front: ""No one can figure out how to get in our house … and we really like that!"" The innovative Radburn design underpinning Crestwood was enthusiastically received by the governments of the day, which saw it as a progressive solution to public housing issues. WA suburbs with high concentrations of state housing, such as Withers, Bentley, Karawara and South Hedland, were constructed using the Radburn blueprint, but this triggered huge social problems including burglaries, drug use and assaults. Some of those suburbs were completely bulldozed and rebuilt in a more conventional style, while others are still pressing ahead with a so-called ""de-Radburnisation"" effort. Planning Institute of Australia WA committee member Vicki Lummer said Karawara was an excellent case study in the flaws of the concept. ""There was a high percentage of state housing properties which then set the tone for the socio-economic mix in that area and I think from the start that was the problem for Karawara,"" she said. ""As time went by all the design provisions were slowly eroded, so people weren't doing low fences, and then the crime rates started to escalate because [the parks] then became unsafe areas to walk through."" Peter Ciemitis, principal at urban planning specialists RobertsDay, said passive surveillance proved effective in reducing crime rates. ""With the inclusion of the high fences that people were starting to put in at Karawara, it actually made it a golden opportunity for crime because … the worst crimes happen behind a high fence."" The neighbourhood watch mentality is something Crestwood does well. ""When we moved in here hardly anyone had a back fence, but times change and gradually fences went up, but to me it just spoils the whole concept of it,"" resident of 44 years Wendy Curtis said. ""We like to keep our fence open. I don't care if everyone looks in at us, I like looking out at everyone else."" Liz Griggs grew up in Crestwood and moved back as an adult with her own children. ""It wasn't until I got older that I really appreciated what I had as a child,"" she said. ""There was children everywhere — we would have games and there would be 30, 40, 50 kids all participating from different parks, different age groups. ""The beauty of here is you look through your fence and out into the parks. It defeats the purpose, I think, having the big fence. ""I understand from a security point of view that that's how some people feel, but then you may as well live anywhere."" Crestwood was intended to be five times bigger than it is, with the addition of high-density apartment buildings and larger community facilities. But the collapse of land values in the late 1970s and a drop in demand for lots meant that never eventuated and the surrounding land was developed in a more conventional style. Crestwood Homeowners Association secretary Kathrina Oakland said she wondered if expansion would have seen Crestwood implode. ""It would have just got out of hand,"" she said. ""Whereas there's only 295 of us and we all live here because we want to live here."" Crestwood was initially marketed towards higher income earners, with royalty-themed brochures bragging about blocks chosen by doctors, chemists, dentists, school principals and ""a host of other discerning people"". It was also the first suburb in Perth to have underground power. Mr Ciemitis suggested that niche appeal was why Crestwood never took off as a concept elsewhere. ""It's not for everybody. They always seem to work as little gems, but it's hard to just shift the whole marketplace into accepting that as a new living model,"" he said. Some urban planners still believe the Radburn concept has its best days ahead. ""I think we have to learn from the successful parts of the Radburn design,"" Ms Lummer said. ""All of the factors of climate change and people wanting to be more sustainable and having more green space, more tree cover — all of those things are coming together."" Julian Bolleter, co-director of the Australian Urban Design Research Centre, said he believed Radburn neighbourhoods would come back in style in Australia. ""We need to be able to design suburbs that can funnel biodiversity,"" he said. ""Radburn planning is very good in that front because you have uninterrupted spines of open space. ""I think our suburbs will have to get denser and they are getting denser, so we do need public open space and I think Radburn is a model that still remains valid in the right context."" Mr Ciemitis said inner city suburbs that incorporated Radburn principles, such as the Perth suburb of Menora, would prove valuable in the future. ""It might have in 50 years' time a completely different life. That might be its golden year when it really works well,"" he said. ""Just to get rid of these ideas sometimes is not the right approach — we might have the bones of something really quite spectacular.""

227,'The grass is growing an inch overnight' Queensland gripped by mower madness after rains,house-and-home,"  Mowing madness after rain brings lush, green grass to south-east Queensland yards It's hot and steamy with the strong smell of two-stroke fuel and grass clippings in the air, while a long line of customers wait to be served at Chris Walden's Bundaberg mower shop in south-east Queensland. Customers are struggling to find room in a store taken over by hundreds of mowers waiting to be picked up or ready for repair. It's a sign the rain has finally come, and it has saved Mr Walden's business from going bust. He simply cannot keep up with demand for sales, services, and repairs. ""After 25 years, I haven't seen anything like it,"" Mr Walden said with a smile. ""We have about 120 repair and service jobs in front of us and we're trying to get them out in a week, so we've been working day and night."" From the lowest of lows at the end of 2019 when drought in Bundaberg slashed demand for sales and repairs, Mr Walden said he could hardly pay the bills and was in contact with the bank in fear his business was about to collapse. ""It's so hard to believe, after being in the industry so long,"" he said. ""I'm 41 and have been in a mower shop since I was two years old, but the past 12 months was the toughest of tough and quite emotional to go through."" Mr Walden said some businesses like his have had to close their doors but he's relieved he survived. Every space in his business is filled with lawn care equipment including the show room, and family members have been called in to assist him with the constant calls and customers dropping in. ""We're going home at 9:30 each night and we just can't stay in front, at the counter we will have three or four staff on and a line-up of eight people waiting to be served,"" he said. ""We've run out of room out the back and we've never had that problem before."" A few kilometres away, over the Burnett River in Bundaberg North, it's a very similar story for mower mechanic Harry Sanderson. The rain has been a long time coming and the sound of mowers in suburban Bundaberg hasn't been heard for nearly a year. With no lawns being mowed, no garden equipment needing repairs or blades changed, recent rain finally means the grass is green and the mowers are back in business. Mr Sanderson has worked on mowers for more than 35 years and says the turnaround has been breathtaking. ""In the past month we've gone from wondering why we are here to absolutely stupid,"" he said. ""Start early and knock off late is all we can do."" The hot and wet weather in south-east Queensland has seen lawns transformed from dirt to lush grass in just a few weeks. Social media has been filled with before-and-after photos of suddenly green paddocks and yards. It's perfect conditions for grass according to Mr Sanderson who said you could almost watch the grass grow and just asked for people to be patient. ""We are all in the same boat,"" he tiredly explains. ""The grass is growing an inch overnight."" With mowers sitting in sheds for months unused, Mr Walden said he was mainly attending to the same few issues. Fuel left in the tank of mowers goes stale and that can cause problems for mowers. ""90 per cent of the issues is with stale fuel, from sitting around for so long,"" he said. ""Two-stroke will go off after about 30 days and often we just flush the fuel and our customers are right to go."" Mr Walden also advised not to use fuel that had been left in jerry cans for long periods of time.

229,Grand Designs host Kevin McCloud answers the one question everyone asks,house-and-home,"  Grand Designs host Kevin McCloud on toilets, drinking games and selfies Kevin McCloud is the charming and urbane host of the wildly popular British lifestyle show Grand Designs. For more than 20 years, he has documented people's attempts to build their own perfect — dare we say ""bespoke"" — home, and audiences have revelled in the success and budget blowouts. Now, McCloud is touring Australia with a new stage show, The World According to Kevin McCloud. He sat down with the ABC to talk drinking games, the best-designed Australian city, and his pick for ""one of the greatest inventions of all time"". This Q&A has been lightly edited for length and clarity. The punter question people always ask me is: 'What's your favourite home from the show?"" They say this: ""What's your favourite one? Mine is …"" and they immediately launch into their own. [Laughs] And I've learnt over the years just to nod and say, ""Yeah, that's a really good one, wasn't it? That one, I think."" Yeah. It's great though, isn't it? A lot of very beautiful women in their 30s come up to me with cameras and say, ""Can I have a photo, my mum really loves your show!"" [Laughs] I don't, no. I mean, I don't have a favourite colour or favourite record or favourite book? I do sort of have a favourite film. You know, you've got your favourites, the things you love that are your favourites until something new comes along. The thing is that I'm old, so I kind of have my favourites that have changed over the years. Psychologists call it place attachment, place connection — the idea that we want to feel safe and we need to feel safe and secure in order to grow the crops outside the front door and keep the lion away from the cave and look after our own, our loved ones. We do it with other people. That is the interesting thing about human beings. You walk out the door in the morning and you say to your neighbour, ""Hello, how are you? Are you alright?"" And if they actually tell you how they are, you're not that interested. But it's that idea that as a community we are all cementing our belief that this is a safe, good place to live. That is really at the heart of it. [Laughs] Yes, ""Can you look at my kitchen"" and ""Can I show you photographs of my insulation?"" I find other things to talk about. There are several versions of the drinking game. If I utter the word ""bespoke"" or somebody gets pregnant halfway through the show — it is nothing to do with me — [you drink]. Students do 24-hour stints, which you can do now with the back-to-back episodes. That is good fun for them. Yes, plenty of those. But it's also the risk, isn't it? This terrible thing that human beings both overreach because that has got us out of the cave, and also it leads us into trouble. It's that idea that hope springs eternal. It drags us and pulls us and eventually pushes us over a cliff if we're not careful. That is so hard. There has been a traditional rivalry forever between Sydney and Melbourne. I could say Brisbane. It's interesting because I was in Adelaide a couple of days ago and it is really navigable. In the thick of winter, Ben and Victoria lived without water and electricity in a tool shed to dodge hefty rental prices — 18 months later, they've bought their first home. What it is, is it's a big square, it's a grid, and it is surrounded by parks. So in a sense you can't get lost, right. It is a beautiful city. I really love Perth. I enjoyed Perth because it is open, big and there is a sense of space about that place. I love Melbourne, right? I adore the street cafes and the big Italian culture here and all of that, love it. But I can't find my way around it. My problem with Melbourne is I don't understand the geography of it. I am sorry, it is just a problem I have. I have to use my phone to navigate me through it. Because it is the city of government and it was designed and laid out and so many of the modernist greats of the mid-20th century designed and worked there. There is layering and there is older stuff too, and it is a big statement and it is spread out like a campus, the entire city. You know, I've got a good, good, good stint ahead of me. But if I were doing this job, and I was half my age, I'd be worried about whether or not it was going to be a sustainable activity. I'm not sure about television. I think where we go is that we carry on making it as long as we get commissioned. And that seems to be currently where we're at. So I think what, maybe in five years time, is our position? Who knows. Long may it last, and when it doesn't, I'll completely understand. Because as one director of television said to me once: ""Kevin, we love you. We love you. Absolutely right until the moment that we stop commissioning the program."" And that's how television works. It's a brutal world. The last time I was in Australia, I did a tour, and a big part of the tour was about sewerage, drainage and toilets, not because I have a morbid fascination for them, but because they're underrated. Without sanitation, there is no civilisation. Without drains, there are no cities. Without clean water, half of us die. A third of the people on the planet — about two and a half billion — do not have access to clean water. And we should appreciate and value the fact that we flush 120 litres a day of potable water down the toilet and that there are alternatives which we should consider. And that it does seem to be bonkers at the same time that people build a house for four occupants and put six toilets in it. You can't use two toilets at the same time, I challenge anyone, and it just seems to me to be enormously wasteful. Having said that, you know, the soft-close toilet seat is one of the greatest inventions of all time.

230,"Early uptake of first home loan deposit scheme favours single buyers, people under 30",house-and-home,"  Latest data on the uptake of first home loan deposit scheme released Nearly half the applicants using a new Federal Government scheme to purchase a property with a deposit of as little as 5 per cent are planning to buy outside Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane. But new figures show many younger buyers in Sydney are still struggling to get a leg-up on the housing ladder. The Government today released the latest data on the uptake of its First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, which launched at the beginning of this year. Under the scheme, the Government offers loan guarantees for properties worth up to $700,000 in Sydney or other New South Wales regional centres. Prices are capped at $450,000 for the rest of New South Wales. Melbourne buyers can spend up to $600,000 on a home while the limit is $375,000 across other parts of Victoria. The figures showed more than half the scheme's applicants so far were under the age of 30, except in Sydney. These are the suburbs across Australia the banks deem the most risky when assessing home loans. Housing Minister Michael Sukkar acknowledged helping those younger city buyers was an ongoing challenge. ""There's no scheme, including this one, that is a silver bullet to the difficulties that particularly younger people face in our major capital cities, where their jobs are,"" Mr Sukkar said. However, he said this deposit scheme was partially designed to encourage people to look beyond the capitals, by capping the property prices and including smaller and regional lenders. ""One of the things the Prime Minister and I wanted to do was make sure this didn't just become a Sydney-, Melbourne-, Brisbane-centric scheme,"" Mr Sukkar said. ""And if we didn't pay such close attention to the way we designed it, it could easily have gone that way."" Just a month and a half into the program, the figures showed about 6,500 loans were being processed. Some of those had been approved for financing for a loan while others were at a much earlier stage. That has left another 3,500 places in the scheme this financial year. Another 10,000 spots will become available from July. The figures showed the average income of participants was $67,126 for single buyers or $111,534 for a couple. The cap on an applicant's income was $125,000 for a single buyer or $200,000 for a couple. Most of the buyers have been single. ""We've certainly put in place modest price caps around the country — this is designed for people who are purchasing a modest first home,"" Mr Sukkar said. ""Of course, if you're on a single income, you're … going to be more likely to be someone who fits within those price caps. ""If you've got a double income, perhaps your capacity is higher than a single, and my view is it probably pushes some people to looking at homes outside the house-price caps."" The data also showed 70 per cent of the certificates issued so far had been for houses. Apartments made up 25 per cent and townhouses made up 5 per cent. Mortgage delinquencies are on the rise, house prices are still tumbling and borrowers are falling into the quicksand of negative equity in their property. It's bad. Kristin Brookfield from the Housing Industry Association said the early data was encouraging and seemed to indicate many young buyers were willing to look beyond the east coast capitals. ""Young people are wanting to get into the market, they're seeing the sense in getting into the market, and they're going to those regional [areas] and getting houses which are more in the $400,000 mark rather than that Sydney $700,000 mark,"" she said. ""Newcastle and the Illawarra have the same price cap as Sydney, which is $700,000 for the homes. ""But you would imagine that in those regional areas there's a bigger choice in terms of houses, there is apartment building going on in those areas, unlike some of the more regional towns where you're likely to see just houses and not very much in the apartment stock. ""So I think it really just reflects where people think they can afford to buy a house."" However, Ms Brookfield worried the price caps under the scheme were still too restrictive for those wishing to buy a new home in Darwin ($375,000) or Perth ($400,000). ""We would like to talk to the Government about how we can stimulate new building in those regions,"" she said. The deposit scheme was first announced in the lead-up to the federal election.

231,"Smouldering paper towels lit by glasses on windowsill almost caused fire, firies say",house-and-home,"  Refracted sunlight, reading glasses, paper towels almost  leads to house fire say firies The South Australia Metropolitan Fire Service is urging people to be careful after a bathroom in the state's mid-north almost caught alight. Port Pirie resident Vicki Heydon came home to find the roll of paper towels she had left on her bathroom vanity was smouldering. She had placed a pair of glasses on the windowsill which she said had focussed the sun's rays coming through the frosted window onto the paper towels, almost causing a fire. ""It was on one of the really hot days and I'd gone into the bathroom and I could smell a slight scorching, something really hot,"" Ms Heydon said. ""It wasn't till later in the evening, when I went in again that I worked out what it was. ""Why it would have happened was because I'd put a pair of glasses up on the window ledge earlier in the morning when I was tidying up. ""I'm definitely not putting my glasses up on the window ledge again and with the hot days, I'll just move the paper towel to the other side of the washbasin."" South Australia Metropolitan Fire Service community engagement officer, Phil Evans, said incidents like this were rare, but did occur, even during cooler months. ""It's not a common occurrence because it needs the sunlight at just the right angle and the glasses in just the right position and some sort of combustible material nearby,"" Mr Evans said. ""It's an unusual occurrence, but it's certainly not unheard of."" Mr Evans said he had been approached before by people with similar stories. ""I've spoken to an occupant of an Adelaide home where a similar incident started with a large fish-shaped glass ornament on a coffee table,"" he said. ""The sunlight was magnified as it passed through the glass ornament and it resulted in scorching on the coffee table. ""There's certainly a possibility that enough heat would be generated with this light being magnified that a light and easily combustible piece of material may go on to become a flaming fire."" Mr Evans has cautioned people to be aware of potential fire risks around their homes. ""An ornament which may magnify the light, a heater, an iron, a toaster — all of those things that are common everyday items can introduce a level of fire risk within the home,"" he said. ""Always make sure you have working smoke alarms in your home so, if an unusual event like this unfolded, at least you'd be alerted and everyone in the house would be alerted.""

232,'You baby boomers': How retirees can own a multi-million-dollar house and still get the pension,house-and-home,"  'Biased' government policies blamed for growing divide between housing haves and have-nots Chris Harpur understands better than most the advantages of owning property in retirement. Like many people of his generation, the 72-year-old has reaped the benefits of booming property prices. He said his terrace home in the inner-Sydney suburb of Alexandria had doubled in value since he bought it in 2008. And he is well aware many young people would kill to own a place like his. ""I get the flak,"" he said. ""'You baby boomers', and all that sort of stuff. But, you know, I have worked quite hard in my life. ""Nobody knew that house values would go skyrocketing."" As a self-funded retiree, Mr Harpur now receives a part pension while still owing $300,000 on his mortgage. ""Having a mortgage in retirement was a bad decision, there's absolutely no doubt about that,"" he said. ""There's that old saying about being asset rich and cash poor, and I think that affects a hell of a lot of people."" Mr Harpur decided to access the equity in his home through the newly expanded Pension Loans Scheme — a reverse mortgage backed by the Federal Government. The scheme allows people to access a government-funded loan, paid in regular fortnightly instalments, for either a short or indefinite period. Repayment of the loan is secured against property you own and compound interest is charged each fortnight. The outstanding balance of the loan is recovered when the property is sold or from the estate after the owner's death. ""I have more cash on a monthly basis,"" he said. ""It's going to be amazing in the sense of having flexibility with the mortgage."" Grattan Institute economist Brendan Coates said the Pension Loans Scheme was one of the best government policy initiatives he had seen in the past 15 years. ""There is a clear need to get older Australians to use the equity in their home to have a higher retirement income,"" he said. ""We can't continue to have such a large asset as housing sitting on retirees' balance sheets and then not touch it at all."" Once a person is retired, their house — if they own one — is treated differently to other assets. The primary place of residence is exempt from the age pension assets test, no matter what that property is worth. While Mr Coates supports the Pension Loans Scheme, he questions the fairness of other housing policies. ""The fact that you can own a $2 million house and still get the pension is probably unfair in a world when there are so many Australians who don't own their own homes and an increasing number who won't own their own homes in retirement,"" Mr Coates said. Older Australians who own their home are more than 20 times better off than those who rent, data shows. A review of Australia's retirement income system that is currently underway has already ruled out any changes to how the family home is treated in the pension assets test. Former Productivity Commission chairman Peter Harris said there was a ""tremendous reluctance to touch this issue"". ""A government should be asking that question: Are we now at the stage of public policy delivery where we should consider this question of how reasonable it is to have people who have a very, very valuable asset, not have that taken into account,"" he said. ""In supporting people investing in housing, we're ignoring this growing trend for people to not invest in housing and to need rental accommodation. And the tax system is biased against that."" Earlier this week, 7.30 revealed older households which owned their home were, on average, more than 20 times wealthier than similar households which rented. Experts say the tax system and government policies strongly favour property owners and discriminate against renters. 7.30 has identified at least 40 separate grants and subsidies available to property owners across the nation. ""We've got all these supports for people to buy housing,"" Mr Harris said. ""If we alter one, we're probably going to have to alter a lot of them."" Last year, with property prices falling, the Labor Party went to the federal election pledging to wind back two of the most contentious tax perks for property owners: negative gearing and discounts on capital gains tax. Deloitte Access Economics' Nicki Hutley believes if Labor's housing policies were put to the people when ""the market was still screaming ahead"", the election outcome may have been different. But now the policies are dead. ""I think they've been well and truly put to bed,"" she said. ""It would be a very brave party that tried to put those [policies] forward now."" Former economic adviser to the Gillard government, Stephen Koukoulas, said the rejection of Labor's planned changes at the last election would make it harder for all political parties to propose tax reform in the future. Flat wages and soaring house prices will force more Australians into a lifetime of renting, the former chairman of the Productivity Commission has warned. ""It's very easy to create a scare campaign when people are looking to either withdraw very, very favourable tax treatment on particular investments, or they propose ideas that are going to make housing more affordable,"" he said. He said there was ""absolutely no doubt at all"" the tax system favoured home owners and discriminated against renters. ""For owner-occupiers, any gains they have in their property are tax free. So this incredible lift in house prices, the 'OK Boomer' set who bought their houses 30, 40, 50 years ago, had multiple increases in the value of their property. It's all tax free."" Mr Coates said the need for state and federal governments to address housing affordability was more urgent than ever. ""Three decades ago, your chances of owning your own home were roughly the same, whether you're wealthy or poor in Australia,"" he said. ""Fast forward to today, and home ownership is really dependent upon your income. ""Home ownership is crashing amongst the bottom 40 per cent. ""It does mean that increasingly your ability to own your own home depends as much on who your parents are, as whatever endeavours that you go about in your own life.""

233,"analysis: 'Rightsizing' is taking off, and more Australians are jumping on board",house-and-home,"  Half of over-55s are open to downsizing — if they can find homes that suit them More than half of Australians over the age of 55 are open to downsizing, according to a new report based on a survey of 2,400 households. The main barrier to moving to a smaller home is a lack of housing that matches their needs and preferences. The rapid growth in the number of older Australians adds to the major challenge housing markets face in meeting their diverse housing needs. Downsizing, or rightsizing, is considered an essential component of meeting the housing aspirations of older Australians. At the same time, downsizing creates housing opportunities for younger households by freeing up family homes. The ageing population also creates fiscal challenges for government, in terms of delivering services to the home and providing residential care. Gerry and Rosemary Franklin made the tough decision to move into retirement accommodation after living in their family home for almost half a century. Downsizing can enable older Australians to age well and age in place rather than potentially move prematurely into residential care. The report released today by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI), for which 2,400 households over 55 were surveyed, found 26 per cent of such households had downsized. Another third had thought about it. Overall, the findings point to a strong appetite among older Australians to downsize their dwellings. With about 6.5 million Australians aged 55 or older, living in about 4.3 million households, our findings suggest downsizing could be relevant to 2.5 million households. We know older Australians downsize in response to life events such as changes in health and relationship status, or children leaving the parental home. Lifestyle preferences and difficulties maintaining their garden or house also shape downsizing behaviour. Mum's decision to finally sell came suddenly. ""Now I've decided, let's just get it done quickly,"" she said to me one day. If only it were that easy, writes Tracey Kirkland. Barriers to downsizing include a lack of suitable housing and a lack of financial incentives. There are also emotional and physical barriers to moving. Financial factors, however, do not greatly impact the decision to move, nor does perceived financial well-being increase once they have downsized. Where those who had downsized were dissatisfied, this was most commonly related to the new dwelling, particularly its size, and the neighbourhood. One of the policy rationales for downsizing is to reduce the underutilisation of dwellings. However, this is at odds with the attitude of many older Australians. They consider ""spare"" bedrooms necessary for use as permanent guest rooms (58 per cent), studies (50 per cent), or dedicated rooms for children or grandchildren (31 per cent). Space remains important to Australian downsizers. Over half of them move to a dwelling with three or more bedrooms. A third move to an apartment. However, two-thirds of downsizers surveyed did move to a dwelling with fewer bedrooms. Three bedrooms was the preferred dwelling size for older Australians. Downsizing the garden was essential for most. Older Australians aspire to attain or retain home ownership. Their preferred neighbourhood has shopping, medical, recreational and public transport services all within walking distance. Downsizers appear mobile. While under a quarter downsized within their original neighbourhood, 42 per cent moved to a neighbourhood completely new to them. The survey finding of a lack of suitable housing options matching would-be downsizers' preferences may explain why so few were able to downsize in their original neighbourhood. If the local market does not have enough options available to meet the needs of older households, it is very difficult to downsize within an existing community. Moving to another desired location can also be problematic. Tiny houses aren't for everyone, but most people who live in them are positive about the experience. Meeting the needs of older Australians generally means an increase in medium-density housing. Developers are likely to require incentives to produce these medium-density products rather than potentially more profitable high-density development — although there is, of course, a downsizing market for well-located apartments. The retirement industry has begun responding to the aspirations of older Australians. It is developing larger dwellings and offering a growing range of options, from high-end to affordable — all of which are accessible and suitable for ageing in place. Equity-rich older Australians may wish to build a new dwelling in which to downsize. But they are often unable to borrow for this unless they have considerable capital available. To support this avenue, new development finance models could be created to allow older Australians to develop without first having to sell the primary home. This shift would allow more collaborative forms of development, such as a group of like-minded individuals developing a site as housing for a small community. For those vulnerable private renters moving into retirement, more secure rental accommodation through the social housing sector and delivered privately is essential. The community housing sector has a key role to play. The Australian housing landscape must shift towards a model of dwelling diversity with secure tenures — ownership and rental — in neighbourhoods where residents can walk easily to weekly services and recreation facilities, participate socially and be close to public transport options. Design is equally important. Australians need adaptable dwellings that can change to meet housing needs. Such a landscape will provide effective downsizing options in which households can age well in the places that best meet their needs and aspirations.

234,'We're half a pay away from being homeless': Rent chews up 65 per cent of Kate's income,house-and-home,"  Flat wages and soaring house prices are condemning Australians to a lifetime of renting Flat wages and soaring house prices will force more Australians into a lifetime of renting, the former chairman of the Productivity Commission has warned. One in four Australians now live in a privately rented home, and since the mid-1990s, the number of renters has increased by about 20 per cent. Peter Harris, who was Productivity Commission chairman from 2012 to 2018, believes the number of Australians who rent will continue rising while incomes remain flat. ""I think it's quite probable that many more Australians will be renting for the whole of their lives,"" Mr Harris told 7.30. Kate Reeves has struggled to pay the rent for the apartment she shares with her son Will in south-east Melbourne. At times, rent has chewed up 65 per cent of her income. ""That was really hard,"" she said. ""We were half a pay away, Will and I, from being homeless."" For 13-year-old Will, not knowing when he and his mother ""might get kicked out for no particular reason"" has been the hardest part of renting their small unit in Parkdale. ""I can't ensure that my landlords here are not going to send me a letter tomorrow and say, we want the property vacated,"" Ms Reeves said. ""Six months ago, I wouldn't have been able to have the finances to afford to actually move and the cost of that, so that's a really scary place to be."" The rights of a renter partly depend on where they live. Generally speaking, fixed-term leases cannot be broken by landlords without cause. But once the fixed term ends, the period of notice ranges from as little as two weeks in the Northern Territory, to six months in the ACT. Governments in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria are in the process of strengthening renters' rights. Compared with house prices, the cost of renting has remained relatively stable over the past two decades. ""Rents have not grown nearly as strongly as house prices,"" Melbourne University Professor Roger Wilkins said. The real estate industry and tenant organisations may disagree on whether or not there is a rental crisis, but there are some points where they do agree. Despite that, recent research suggests that Australia's rental market is not a level playing field. A paper published late last year by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI) found that 80 per cent of the lowest income earners are paying more rent than they can afford. More low income earners are renting and in the last two decades the number of people who spend more than a third of their income on rent has doubled. The AHURI research found that poorer people were increasingly being squeezed out of the rental market by wealthier tenants. As a result, low income earners now face an ""acute and increasing shortage"" of affordable rental properties. ""If you are on those relatively low incomes, it is difficult for you to find a place in a capital city,"" Mr Harris said. According to Brendan Coates of the Grattan Institute, there is a close relationship between renting and poverty. ""Renting is just about the best predictor of financial hardship in Australia today,"" he told 7.30. ""There's a really clear link between rates of financial stress and poverty, and the fact that people are renters rather than homeowners."" Over the past two years, Arou Akot and his seven children have shared a two-bedroom apartment in a rundown block of units in Sydney's west. He moved to St Marys after arriving in Australia from South Sudan as a refugee in 2005. He and his eldest son would sleep on the floor of the apartment, while his other children shared two bedrooms. ""I told them, look, we are not homeless, we are better [off] than others,"" he told 7.30. ""I'm happy and I have a job."" Severe crowding is classified as homelessness by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the proportion of Australians living in severely crowded dwellings increased by more than 50 per cent between 2001 and 2016. ""We now have over a quarter of single-parent families living in housing stress, they have extremely high rates of poverty,"" said Professor Wilkins, who produces the annual Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey. With financial help from his children, Arou Akot has now found a house nearby that can comfortably accommodate his family. But he hasn't given up hope of one day owning a home. ""I can't afford to buy a house until these children grow up,"" he said. Watch part two of 7.30's four-part housing special tonight.

235,analysis: 'I wouldn't want to buy even if I had the money': The rise of renters by choice,house-and-home,"  Welcome to the world of renters by choice — the tenants turning their back on home ownership The private rental sector has expanded at more than twice the rate of the increase in Australian households in the last two decades. This increasingly diverse form of tenure now houses about one in four of us. Australia's lightly regulated private rental sector means the insecurity of tenants is a key factor in why most Australians aspire to own their home. However, despite this insecurity, our research suggests an increase in people choosing to rent for a long time — 10 years or more — accounts for a small part of the growth in private renters. Much of this growth is attributable to middle and high-income tenants. Especially in Melbourne and Sydney, high housing prices mean saving for a deposit takes much longer than in the 1990s. In the meantime these households are renting for a long time. In our survey of 600 private renters in different areas of Sydney and Melbourne, we asked: ""Many people are renting privately for longer periods (10+ years). Do you think this is a positive trend?"" If we want renting to become a truly viable, long-term alternative to home ownership, greater rental affordability and security is needed, writes research fellow Emma Power. About a third responded in mainly positive terms. Their main reasons were: Some questioned the norm of home ownership in Australia. For a more in-depth understanding, we interviewed 60 long-term private renters in low, medium and high-rent areas in Melbourne and Sydney. Almost all who chose to rent mentioned flexibility as a key advantage. ""Choosers"" highly valued the freedom to move or travel at will. Zygmunt Bauman's concept of liquid modernity highlights the increasing desire for transience. As he explains: ""Transience has replaced durability at the top of the value table. What is valued today (by choice as much as by unchosen necessity) is the ability to be on the move, to travel light and at short notice. Power is measured by the speed with which responsibilities can be escaped. Who accelerates, wins; who stays put, loses."" Patricia*, who lives in a high-rent part of Melbourne, has always rented. ""Well since I came to Australia in 1977, I rented. I didn't want to buy. Got close [to buying] a couple of times, but changed my mind. ""I just travel anywhere and everywhere. I thought […] if you've got a house you're stuck there, and I thought, no. I work hard for my money, so that money that I work hard for is for me, not to have a [permanent] roof over my head. […] Renting has been good for me because I can still do what I want."" Myra lives in a studio apartment in a high-rent area in Sydney and has no desire to own a home. She is single, in her mid to late 30s, and earns well. The possibility of being asked to vacate did not bother her. ""Maybe I've been lucky, but every situation has always sorted itself out. You know a lot of people would have freaked out if they had to move out […] It didn't concern me in the slightest, yeah. I mean not at all. There's always somewhere to stay. So it suits my lifestyle. I wouldn't want to buy [a property], even if I had the money."" Leanne inherited a third of a house. Rather than using the proceeds to buy a property, she decided to move to Melbourne's inner city (a high-rent area) and continue renting. ""So I thought rather than put money into a house […] I would invest it and I could travel and go to concerts and live the life I wanted to lead, so that's basically what I did and I'm still renting."" Pam was renting in a low-rent area in outer Sydney. She felt her situation required the flexibility of renting: ""The relationship was rocky and you can't predict the future, but I knew it wasn't going to end up in marriage and kids and all that kind of crap […] We were both working, both earning good money and we could have afforded to buy a house between us […] But for me it was like, no. I don't know where this [her relationship] is going, so no way, I'm not going to put myself in that predicament [having a joint mortgage] and then have to go through court to go, 'This is mine, this is yours', all that crap. But so it was my choice to rent and to stick to it […] I'm not going to rely on anybody else for anything, no way."" Her renter status allowed Pam to make a rapid, clean break. ""I just got up one day and walked cos I knew he was going to ask me to marry him the next day, so I said: 'I'm just going to go to the shops to get a packet of cigarettes'. I left everything behind. I went for a walk, never went home."" For the families with children who choose to rent long-term, the key reason is it allows them to live in highly desirable areas where they cannot afford to buy. Gabrielle and her partner earn well and live in a high-rent area in Sydney: ""Sure it [home ownership] provides you with security and you don't have that stress of […] having to move. I get that, but at the same time, you know for us, for example, if we wanted to buy we'd be paying four times what we pay at the moment in a mortgage […] It doesn't really make financial sense to go and do that […] You'd have to live somewhere. So I choose to live in a nice area where my children are [at school]."" They also did not want the burden of a large mortgage: ""[…] I have no desire to put myself in a position where I have a $2 million mortgage and have to work for the rest of my short life to pay for it […]"" For a growing number of Australians who don't want to compromise on their living arrangements, rentvesting allows them to experience the best of both worlds. Although probably only a small proportion of people choose to rent long-term, this option may be gaining ground. Young, well-paid professionals in particular see the flexibility of private renting as attractive. Location also seems to be a critical factor. Most of the choosers rented in desirable inner suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, which would otherwise be inaccessible. An estimated one-in-eight private renters are ""rentvestors"" who rent where they want to live and buy elsewhere to get a foothold in the housing market. *All names used are pseudonyms.

236,From almost $1 million down to $40k — the difference between owning and renting,house-and-home,"  Older Australians who own their home more than 20 times better off than those who rent, data shows Exclusive Australian Bureau of Statistics data has revealed the staggering difference in wealth of older Australians in owner-occupied households compared to those that rent. In 2017-18, the ABS found that property-owning households — where at least one of the occupants was 65 and over — had a median net worth of $960,000. Similar households that were still paying off a mortgage had a median net worth of $934,900. In stark contrast, the median net worth of similar households that rent was just $40,800. ""People who are not in the housing market will find it more difficult over time,"" ANZ economist Felicity Emmett told 7.30. ""I think we will see a situation where wealth inequality and particularly intergenerational inequality rises."" Nicki Hutley, partner at Deloitte Access Economics, believes Australia is in danger of creating a separate class of Australians who will not reap the many benefits that come with home ownership. ""Are we allowing one class of Australians to build for their retirement more easily than another class of Australians? The answer to that is unequivocally yes,"" she said. Ms Hutley has warned that Australia is in the grip of a housing affordability crisis that will lock a growing number of people out of the property market. Analysis provided to 7.30 by the Reserve Bank of Australia confirms rates of home ownership fell among every age group between 2011 and 2016. ""When house prices are growing strongly, you see a big drop-off in the number of people moving into home ownership,"" Melbourne University professor Roger Wilkins said. Saving a 20 per cent deposit for a house in any Australian capital city now takes nine years for a typical household, while a median-priced property in Sydney now costs more than eight times the average household income, according to CoreLogic. That is despite the recent correction wiping almost 15 per cent from Sydney property values. Nationally, property prices are rising again and are predicted to recoup their recent losses by May. ""What's happening now is real, but it's not sustainable,"" Ms Hutley said. ""We can't keep having our house prices rise to these sorts of levels. ""We certainly have a housing affordability crisis in Australia."" The Grattan Institute's household finances program director Brendan Coates points to sharply declining rates of home ownership among younger Australians. One of Australia's leading forecasters is tipping Australia's property price rebound to continue through 2020 … unless the economy rolls over. The number of homeowners aged 18 to 39 in Sydney and Melbourne has plummeted since 2002, picking up only slightly during the recent downturn. In 2002, 34 per cent of 18 to 39-year-olds in Melbourne were home owners. By 2018 that figure had dropped to 22 per cent, according to the HILDA Survey. ""It's hard to see that that's anything other than worsening affordability that's driving that trend,"" Mr Coates said. ""It is a crisis where, over the course of the next couple of decades, we're likely to see fewer and fewer Australians — particularly poorer Australians — own their own home, and that will have enormous consequences for all aspects of Australian life."" In a typical year, Dominic and Trudie Harris earn about $120,000 between them. They are hoping to achieve what their parents never could — buying a property that their eight-year-old son Liam can call home. But the odds are stacked against them. In the Queensland suburb of Newport, where they currently rent, it takes, on average, 11 years to save a 20 per cent deposit for a house. ""Thinking it's another 11 years to save to get into the market is crazy,"" Ms Harris said. ""I'll be 52 and Liam will be a teenager,"" Mr Harris said. The couple hopes to cut the deposit to 5 per cent by being one of the 10,000 Australians to qualify for the Federal Government's new first home deposit scheme. ""It would be nice to get a hand up, not a handout,"" Mr Harris told 7.30. ""I think the 5 per cent is a lot more achievable than 20 per cent."" Economists who 7.30 spoke to questioned whether the Government's home deposit scheme would make housing more affordable. Housing market experts generally agree that supporting low-deposit loans for first home buyers is at best a ""bandaid"" fix for the deeper problem of housing affordability. ""I think the first home deposit scheme is another example of a policy that sounds good,"" the Grattan Institute's Mr Coates said. ""It ends up being a policy that really benefits vendors of the kinds of homes that are attractive to first-time buyers, and that's exactly what we've seen with stamp duty concessions for first home buyers in Victoria, and with first-time buyers grants in the past."" Deloitte Access Economics' Ms Hutley likened the scheme to previously tried ""bandaid measures"" that had not made housing more affordable overall. ""What I'd see as the underlying solution for housing affordability is to build more houses in the places where people want to live,"" she said.

237,The messy reality of tiny homes,house-and-home,"  Tiny homes are adorable and cool, but how does the reality of living in one compare with the image? They look beautiful online, seem to offer a way to escape the mortgage trap and present an opportunity to downsize your possessions, but how simple is real life in a tiny house? Fay (not her real name) and her partner live in a tiny house that they built themselves in the Perth metropolitan area. She told Jessica Strutt on ABC Radio Perth that their tiny house is comfortable but that ""the first thing you notice is that it gets messy really quickly"". ""The same surface has multiple uses so if you have something on that surface and you want to use it for something else you have to clear it up. ""You have to be more organised. ""If you are planning to do something you think, 'I will have to do this first before I can do that' — it's a Tetris game."" The biggest attraction of the tiny house for Fay, is in her mid-30s, was home ownership without a heavy mortgage. ""The main reason why I went to tiny was the financial side of things,"" she said. ""There is satisfaction in having built this ourselves, and actually living this ideal … of not having to get a loan … to have a roof over our heads."" Fay's tiny home is slightly more spacious than most, thanks to her partner. ""My partner is over two metres tall so I get to enjoy the extra height that we had to design into the tiny house so that he could be happy living in it,"" she said. ""There is a certain lightness about it I suppose, because we do have fewer things."" Other talkback callers had differing opinions about the rise of the tiny home: Anon: ""[I'm] 60, divorced [and] can't access suitable accommodation. It is degrading, abusive and soul-destroying. A tiny home gives privacy, safety and security."" Steve: ""To me tiny homes are a waste of money. [People are] better off buying a good large caravan and at least the resale is really good. They have everything a tiny home has and a lot easier to be mobile on and off road."" Luke: ""I like the idea of tiny houses but where and how do you put the house? Do you rent a small place at a caravan park or can you just put it anywhere for free like you can do with camping in some locations?"" For talkback caller Wade, who spent about $30,000 building a tiny home on the back of an old fire truck, the financial freedom has also been a big plus. ""We have been living in it for 10 months now and we are not paying anyone rent anymore,"" he said. ""It's just water and lights until we get solar and some water collection set up."" Although he and his partner have had to become accustomed to living in very close quarters and having fewer possessions, they have also become ""very good at communicating"", Wade explained. Despite not owning the ground his home has been parked on, Wade's tiny house on the back of a truck feels more secure than a traditional home. ""A big thing for me is, looking at the fires around the country, our home is now catastrophe and fire proof,"" he said. ""If there is a big fire coming our way, we could pick up sticks and go."" For Kim Connolly, president of the Australian Tiny House Association, tiny homes represent an answer to the urgent problem of older women facing homelessness, which no other housing type addresses. ""In my area we have a situation where especially older single women are ending up homeless, despite the fact that they have worked all their life … they have been productive members of society,"" Ms Connolly said. ""In my area [Coffs Harbour], if you are on Newstart, 0.03 per cent of the rentals are affordable for you. ""The waiting list for public housing is 10–13 years long. What does that woman do? She's living in her car."" Ms Connolly does not live in a tiny house herself, but she has started building them and hopes to start a village offering the affordable homes for people in need to live in. Ms Connolly said she was often asked why she supported tiny houses over granny flats and traditional caravans, and part of the reason was that with their higher ceilings and pitched rooves, tiny homes could feel more spacious, and were more secure than a granny flat. ""That's the difference that I find with the older single women and men that I am talking to,"" she said. ""They want to feel like they are in a home. They don't want to feel like they are in a caravan. ""I have been hearing stories of people who have paid into their children's yards and got a granny flat built. ""Then the children get divorced and the money from the granny flat goes into the sale of the house and they lose their relationship with their children and their home."" While tiny houses could be built on the back of trailers to get around building regulations, they weigh several tonnes and often need connection to services including electricity, water and sewerage, and can be onerous to move. Their mobility can be an advantage, but can also leave many tiny home dwellers in a legal grey area, renting space in backyards or rural properties without council knowledge or approval, and under the threat of discovery. ""Currently we are renting a property,"" Fay said, but like many tiny house dwellers the construction was went without local council approval. ""The owner is totally cool with us having our trailer house on it. ""There is a concern about eventually at some point in the future we might get thrown out."" Ms Connolly has been hoping that councils would eventually develop regulations that allowed tiny houses to park legally, long-term, because the older people she has wanted to help need secure ground as well as a roof over their head. ""Those people tend to be a bit more cautious about investing $60,000 or $70,000 in a tiny house if they are worried that they are going to be told to move on, or [that] the neighbours will complain and then they won't have anywhere to put their tiny house,"" she said. ""So we really want to make tiny houses an accepted part of development and of course to have controls over it."" But Fay has been wary of regulation and the burden it may impose on her dream of living lighter. ""I do feel like when things get regulated then they might impose conditions that make it more complicated and more difficult or cause adverse outcomes,"" she said. ""At the moment I'm enjoying being in this grey area.""

238,What is in your household dust?,house-and-home,"  Household dust is being put under the microscope as scientists seek to better understand it If dust is one of those household issues you sweep under the carpet, you may want to pause and think about where it all came from. More than just dirt and soot trekked in from outside, dust is filled with all kinds of broken-down particles — and, depending on where you live, toxic trace elements. Professor Mark Taylor from the School of Earth and Environmental Science at Macquarie University has dedicated much of his career to dust research. In fact, he is part of a global analysis program, designed to get to the bottom of what is in the average person's household dust. ""A lot of dust is skin,"" Professor Taylor said. ""Skin, hair, carpet fluff, clothing fibres, pet hair, soil from outside [which] is rich in organic matter, leaves."" But Professor Taylor explained that one of the key things in dust — and something often overlooked — is faecal coliforms, or faeces. ""One study has shown that 96 per cent of all shoes contain faeces. If you're living in the city, that's probably dog poo,"" he said. ""So walking shoes into your house not only tramps in all the other contaminants from outside, it also is likely to tramp in faeces from various animals — possums and kangaroos and goodness known what else. ""That breaks down into dust."" Faeces aside, household dust also contains elements Professor Taylor described as ""contaminated"" by ""inorganic external sources"". ""What's most concerning is when dust becomes contaminated by toxic trace elements, like lead, zinc, copper and arsenic,"" he said. ""It really depends on where you live. In Sydney in particular, or in places with industrial history, you will find lead or arsenic or mercury can get in your dust."" Professor Taylor added that if you live in the city ""adjacent to a main road, you'll be getting particles coming out of the tail end of vehicles"". ""Diesel particulates can be particularly problematic — they contain trace elements and very fine particles … which cause asthma, wheeze and respiratory problems."" Professor Taylor's dust analysis program, which is a Macquarie University and Australian Government joint project, has been established to analyse and better understand ""contaminants of concern"" in household dust. ""People now spend about 90 percent of their time indoors,"" Professor Taylor said. ""If they're going to have any environmental exposures from environmental contaminants, it's likely to be from dust."" The dust analysis program has scientists around the world who study trace elements found in vacuum dust. Eight hundred samples have been submitted in Australia so far, with lead and zinc found to be the two main contaminants in indoor dust. While the impact varying concentrations of these elements have on a person's health is still being researched, what is known is that the finer the dust is, the more problematic it becomes for people with respiratory problems. Advice from the Government of Western Australia indicates that ""breathing low levels of household or urban dust does not cause health problems in most individuals"". ""In contrast, people with existing respiratory and heart conditions, including smokers, are at greater risk of developing long-term health problems,"" the advice said. ""For people with respiratory conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD) or emphysema, even small increases in dust concentration can make their symptoms worse."" Symptoms of asthma include chest tightness and wheezing, which can also happen when asthmatics are exposed to irritants such as smoke, aerosol sprays and fumes. ""The most problematic dust in terms of lung function and respiratory health, is a very fine dust,"" Professor Taylor explained. ""Ultrafine dust particles are less than 2.5 microns. You can't really see that with the naked eye, but you can inhale it and ingest it … into the lungs and straight into the bloodstream."" Young children are also susceptible to the impacts of dust ""because they are exposed to indoor dust accumulated on floors, in soft furnishings and on other hard surfaces,"" further research from Professor Taylor and PhD Research Fellow Israel Doyi found. Dust from dust storms likely comes from the desert and ""contains natural dust, uncontaminated by anthropogenic pollutants like trace elements or organic elements,"" Professor Taylor said. ""That's what might make your dust red. ""The concentrations are not particularly toxic, but it's more of a nuisance — it can get on your washing and in your house, it discolours things, and you want to clean it up,"" he said. Dust storms do vary in their severity, and if the conditions are right, dust storms ""can move across the country for hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometres"". Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Jonathan How explained that ""for dust storms to form, the soil needs to be dry and exposed. ""Then you need strong winds that can pick up the soil and carry it across long distances,"" he said. ""Just how powerful the wind needs to be depends on the size of the dust particles, but the minimum speed is about 30 kilometres per hour."" Drought, of course, makes dust conditions worse, as do bushfires. Simply put, ""what goes up must come down,"" said Professor Taylor. ""Smoke contains organic matter from the trees, a huge amount of soil, and that's all gone up in the air. ""That affects the air quality, and creates particles in the air, which contributes to dust."" Professor Taylor points to the smoke haze reaching as far as New Zealand as an example of how far these particles can travel. ""Locally it's probably quite concentrated, particularly in somewhere like Canberra with poor air quality, but it gets dispersed as far as New Zealand,"" he said. ""You would have heard stories of New Zealand glaciers being doused with pollutants; that smoke will come down. ""When it's in the air to that degree, it's hard to manage when it enters your home. But you can put your air conditioner on recirculation mode, buy a high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filter, and keep your windows sealed."" ""The main game when cleaning up your dust, is not to recirculate it,"" said Professor Taylor. ""The recommendation is to use a HEPA vacuum cleaner, or to wet mop. ""Keep an outdoor and an indoor door mat at your door. Wash the indoor one regularly, and vacuum your outdoor one — keep them clean."" Professor Taylor also recommends trading your feather duster for a microfibre one, because feather dusters spread the particles around, which is the last thing you want to do. ""Keeping pets outside will reduce the amount of dust that gets in your home,"" Professor Taylor said. ""And ornaments are dust magnets; less clutter, cleaner house."" Professor Taylor's final tip? Don't empty your vacuum cleaner dirt into the compost. ""The contaminants in your household dust are higher than what they are in the garden, they concentrate and accumulate in homes,"" Professor Taylor said. ""If you then dump that on your veggie patch and start growing your veggies in there, you're not being smart with producing clean green vegetables. It smothers them. ""Put it in the waste bin, outside. And empty it carefully, especially if you're an asthmatic.""

239,How to get through this heatwave without an air conditioner,house-and-home,"  How to survive a heatwave: Tips on how to stay cool and why sleeping naked won't help during those sweaty nights A heatwave that brewed up over inland Western Australia is making its way south and east, meaning much of Australia is about to experience sweltering temperatures. The Bureau of Meteorology forecast heatwave conditions in parts of: It's going to get hot. So here are 10 ways for your to beat the heat (that don't involve picking up the air conditioner remote). Closing the curtains to block out the sunlight seems like a no-brainer, right? But this only really makes a difference if you have a light-coloured backing on your curtains. Energy auditor and sustainability educator Matt Ruffin told us that while curtains can block sunlight, they don't effectively block the heat. ""If the outward-facing side of the curtain is light in colour, some of the sun will be reflected out, but the curtain absorbs the heat, changing its form to long-wave infrared,"" he said. ""That heat doesn't pass through glass so it can't be reflected back out [and] the curtain then becomes a heater."" Mr Ruffin said awnings or external window coverings are best as they'll stop direct sunlight from the outside, meaning it won't hit the glass. But if cladding your house in awnings isn't an option for you, get a cheap shade cloth and temporarily fix it to the outside of the window. Bonus tip: Close up the house early in the day before the sun has a chance to warm it up. Do: Close off the room if you're running an air conditioner to keep the cool air inside. Don't: Close off the room if you're sleeping in a room with a fan. Keep the door open to allow for airflow. Mr Ruffin recommends using a spray bottle in the same room as the fan to spray mist over your skin. ""The outcome is a rush of cool that evaporates off your skin that can be repeated again and again,"" he said. Our ABC Messenger audience also had some handy recommendations: ""Soak sheets in chilled water and hang them up over windows where there are no curtains,"" Z Tulip said. ""Then fill a spray bottle with water and keep it in the fridge to re-spray the sheets once they dry out."" Bonus tip: Try putting a bowl of ice in front of a pedestal fan to blow the cool air across the room, creating an air conditioner effect. It sounds counterintuitive, but the Tasmanian Government advises covering up if you want to sleep through a hot night. Sleeping naked can actually make you feel even hotter than wearing pyjamas. Being nude doesn't allow moisture to evaporate between your body and your mattress, the State Government says. Bonus tip: Opt for cotton pyjamas. Guy Leschziner, a doctor who presents a series on sleep, told BBC radio natural fabrics act like a sponge for your sweat. ""It can increase the surface area for the sweat to evaporate, thus may make you feel much cooler."" We're not trying to destroy your love life, but this one's pretty obvious. Sleep expert David Hillman told ABC Radio Sydney that on hot nights, those who share a bed should stick to separate sides. ""A hot night is not a time for cuddles,"" Mr Hillman said. ""Give your partner a bit of room."" Bonus tip: This also means giving your pets some space if they sleep with you (sorry). The Tasmanian Government advises finding them somewhere else to sleep. Can't sleep without a sheet on you? The Tasmanian Government says sticking a foot out could make you more comfortable. The thinking here is that your body heat will escape through your feet. Bonus tip: Flipping on your back and stretching out might make things cooler. Localise the cooling power to your wrists. The Tasmanian Government says to run your wrists or the inside of your arms under cold water for about 30 seconds, because the blood flows closest to the surface of your skin. Bonus tip: If you don't want to spend all your time at the sink, wristbands soaked in cold water will have the same effect. Run your head under cold water, as per the Tasmanian Government's advice. If you're washing your hair, have the shower as cold as you can stand. Towel dry your hair just enough so it isn't dripping but it's still damp. Bonus tip: Instead using of a hair drier, stand in front of a fan — ""that way you've effectively turned your head into an evaporative cooler,"" Mr Ruffin says. The South Australian Government's advice is to put wet cloths around your neck and soak your feet in a cold bucket of water. But some ABC readers suggest taking it a step further, soaking your entire outfit in water, ringing it out and wearing damp clothes around the house. Bonus tip: Avoid drips by running your wet clothes through the spin cycle on your washing machine. This is no time for black skinny jeans or leggings. If you have to brave the outdoors, the advice is to wear light-coloured clothing to reflect the heat and sunlight. And it goes without saying that opting for loose, lightweight fabrics is by far a better option than close-fitting clothes. Stick to natural fibres like cotton, linen and silk, which allow the skin to breathe. Bonus tips: Polyester may feel light, but it won't do you any favours. It will trap heat and raise your body temperature. Steer clear. The last thing you want to be doing is turning on the oven at a time like this. The advice across the board is to eat cool foods, such as salads and fruits — watermelon was a favourite among the ABC Messenger audience. This not only cools you from the inside but also eliminates the extra heat that ovens and stovetops generate. Don't have big meals, go for smaller meals spread out across the day. But, we're sorry to say this doesn't mean grazing on platters of meat and cheese all day — the Queensland Government factsheet specifically singles out meat and dairy products as foods to steer clear of. Heavy-protein food can raise your body heat and increase fluid loss. Bonus tip: If you must cook, the WA Government says it's best to fire up the barbecue outside rather than cooking in the kitchen. The advice across the board is to keep your fluids up, but stick to water where you can. Fruit juice is another good option. Alcohol is out, as it increases dehydration. Caffeinated drinks should also be avoided so avoid coffee and tea intake (or, if that's impossible, at least try to cut back).

240,How your home colour choices could be costing you more than you realise,house-and-home,"  Home energy efficiency could be improved significantly through simple tweaks like roof colour For most of us, our home is the most expensive purchase of our lives, but are we ignoring the true cost of home ownership? For Perth architect Kate Fitzgerald, the lack of attention paid to home energy efficiency is baffling. ""We seem to expect that design standard for our cars and in all sorts of things and it still baffles me that we test cars for safety and emissions, but we are not really asking that of our biggest investment,"" Ms Fitzgerald told Damian Smith on ABC Radio Perth. International research also shows that energy-efficient homes can also fetch a higher price. All new home buildings in Australia must be assessed under the nationwide house energy rating scheme (NatHERS), which uses software developed by the CSIRO to evaluate the design to estimate the amount of energy it will need for heating and cooling, and gives it a star rating out of 10. Simple choices like a dark colour roof instead of a lighter one can make a huge difference, as a recent simulation showed. ""We took a project that we have recently designed, which has a 7.5 star [rating] and we changed the cladding to a dark cladding and re-ran the scenarios and it turns out that you will lose almost half a star by changing the colour to a dark colour,"" Ms Fitzgerald explained. ""Your cooling loads increase by about 10 megajoules per square metre in the summertime. ""Putting a dark cladding on your roof, in this day and age, I think you're highly likely to be paying much more money for your AC bill."" New builds are required to be at least six stars, but there are loopholes that mean there are some new homes that Ms Fitzgerald believes may only be two stars. ""Where it becomes difficult is that there are loopholes for situations where things aren't quite standard,"" she said. Maybe you have a block of land where the only option for you is to have your long side facing west and it's actually really hard to design something that achieves a really high star rating. ""In that situation you might actually need to use an alternative method [of energy rating],"" Ms Fitzgerald said. ""The alternative method is designed for one-off projects."" The other big impacts are in building material and insulation. ""You do want to insulate — you want a fluffy doona that covers your house. Double brick isn't great for that,"" Ms Fitzgerald said. ""Timber frame is terrific, reverse brick veneer is even better because you get the fluffy doona on the outside and then you get the still inert mass of the brick and the concrete floors on the inside. ""What that does is help maintain a constant temperature by taking out that heat from the air or releasing that heat into the air when its colder."" Above all, she recommends that prospective home builders ask questions of the people designing and building their home, and demand energy efficient design. ""You are going to keep getting the same product unless you ask for a different one,"" she said. For Peter Newman, professor of sustainability at Perth's Curtin University, there also needs to be a focus what can be done to retrofit buildings, as most people buy existing homes rather than building. While replacing a roof or changing its colour may be prohibitively expensive, there are other things that can be done. He has recently gone through the process with his own home, a 170-year-old stone house in Fremantle, which was solidly built but lacked natural light, meaning he had to have lights on continually during the day. ""That was the first thing, doing clever things with windows, and sky lights,"" Professor Newman said. ""The second thing was to seal it off in ways that we hadn't been doing — doors and windows didn't fit very well. ""And then we put a lot more insulation in, into the walls and roof. It's so much better now and it really works. ""It really is extraordinary how you can shut the doors and windows and walk into a cool house on hot days or a warm house on cool days."" Professor Newman said the energy efficiency of houses, and the ongoing costs of powering them, was becoming more important to consumers. ""The need for having a redeveloped city that has medium-density, zero-carbon housing, is very critical,"" he said. ""We surveyed 20-odd developments in Perth and found that location was the number one thing [buyers were concerned with]. ""The second thing was the price and the third thing was sustainability, and that came even before how it looked. They really wanted to know a lot about the energy efficiency. ""This comes as a surprise to most real estate agents who are very stuck on the idea that people aren't interested in that."" In Canberra, energy ratings are a key selling point in real estate and have to be disclosed to potential buyers, and Professor Newman said it is something the rest of the country needs to catch up on. ""People respond to that because they say 'well, if I can get an eight star house for the same price as a six star house then I'll get it, because I'm going to pay less every day',"" he said. ""It is a way of showing that being green is good economics. ""It's an integration that is fundamental to the transition we are going through.""

241,analysis: There's a risky way to supercharge your savings that some Australians are embracing,house-and-home,"  Margin lending could help you supercharge your savings, but it's not without risk Talking about the property market is fast becoming as unpalatable as discussing politics or religion at the dinner table. That is because, despite a mini housing market correction over the past couple of years, a recent revival means buying a home in some of Australia's capital cities remains out of reach for many. According to the latest annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Study, Sydney is the third most expensive city in the eight countries studied, while Melbourne is not far behind. Record-low interest rates and rising property prices have created a dream run for homeowners, but those trying to get onto the property ladder, perhaps by saving up for a deposit through a bank account, do not stand a chance. So that is the end of the story, right? Actually no. It turns out there is one way to supercharge your savings. It is called margin lending. Put simply, margin lending involves borrowing money (taking out a personal loan) and using that cash to buy shares. One of Australia's leading forecasters is tipping Australia's property price rebound to continue through 2020 … unless the economy rolls over. The harsh reality is that even with $1,000 invested in the share market, it will take you a very long time to turn that into thousands of dollars, let alone tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, if you borrowed $50,000, and invested most of that money in shares, the bigger starting investment could mean larger returns — potentially reaching hundreds of thousands of dollars within a few years. It is a financial concept known as leveraging. That is, borrowing money to make more money than you otherwise would on an investment. When it is applied to buying shares, it is known as margin lending. Research from the Reserve Bank shows there has been a big jump in the number of Australians doing this. Figures from the Commonwealth Bank show, in the three months to September, the amount of money tied up in margin lending shot up from roughly $11 billion — where it had been for several years — to $17 billion. That is an increase of more than 50 per cent. It is easy to understand why someone would choose to take out a margin loan right now: interest rates have never been this low (making a personal loan relatively cheap) and saving for a home, retirement or any other long-term goal using bank deposits has become an agonisingly slow process. But there is another reason why margin lending is back in vogue: the stock market itself is on an absolute tear. ABC business reporter Michael Janda explains why housing industry claims that most negative gearers are average income earners are not supported by the available data. The benchmark S&P 500 index — which tracks the value of a broad range of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange — is now very close to reaching a point that would signal the longest and biggest ever run-up in stock prices without a crash (or a fall of more than 20 per cent). The Australian share market is also pushing records highs on a weekly basis. The ASX 200 closed above 7,000 index points for the first time just last week. In many cases, low interest rates are driving stocks higher. That is partly because it is easier for firms to borrow to invest and grow their businesses, but also because more savers are turning to the stock market in a desperate attempt to boost, or even just maintain, their wealth. With reward comes risk, though. You can see a dangerous feedback loop developing here: low interest rates are pushing share markets higher, and those higher share markets are luring in more people to borrow more money at those low rates to buy more shares. In 2012, the Reserve Bank decided to spark a housing boom (or bubble) to offset the mining bust, argues Michael Janda. A rise in interest rates, even just a small one, could shatter the positive loop and turn it into a downward spiral. That is one reason analysts warn global share markets are rising too high, too fast. There are other major risks too, like a deterioration in global economic growth perhaps caused by climate change; an escalation in the US-China trade war, or conflict in the Middle East to name just a few. Here at home, there is still the persistent problem of low levels of both business and consumer confidence. The latest read from Westpac on consumer confidence shows shoppers are still reluctant to part with their cash. ""This low level of confidence is consistent with the generally lacklustre reports on consumer spending,"" Westpac chief economist Bill Evans recently wrote. Economists say the biggest risk to rising share markets is the economy, and the risks to economic growth remain ever present. If economic growth slows significantly and business profits are further squeezed, share prices will fall. In most margin loans, you might borrow $30,000, for example, to help buy $50,000 worth of shares. And similar to a home loan, you would also need to provide some cash. However, if the value of your shares falls below a pre-determined level, your stockbroker will ask you to provide more cash. That is known as a margin call. In an extreme example, if your shares became worthless, you would obviously need to stump up $30,000. In that case, you may have used up all your cash, own worthless shares and, depending on who you have your margin loan with, could still owe the bank thousands of dollars. Many Australians have successfully used margin lending to turbocharge their savings. And the top economist at Australia's biggest home loan provider says, if you've got the investment experience and you can stomach the risks, it is likely the quickest way to build up a home deposit. Australia's housing downturn appears to be over … for now. But huge household debts leave the nation vulnerable to a shock. ""It's certainly a way of increasing your savings,"" the CBA's chief economist Michael Blythe said. ""Leverage improves your rate of return and if you want to use that and if you want to use that to save up for your home loan deposit, then clearly that can help speed up the process there. ""But I stress again, you need to think about the fact that shares can go down just as easily as they can go up."" Independent financial analyst Andrew Page used to help run a margin lending department at a major Australian bank. He said, based on his experience, most clients' experience with margin lending was not a positive one. He said that was because most clients took on too much leverage or debt. They borrowed too much. In recent months the amount of money being thrown at this highly risky investment vehicle has spiked. Assuming market conditions stay as they are, it may put some Australians in a home faster than they dreamed. However, it appears to highlight how desperate some Australians have become to obtain that dream, or just to simply get ahead. This article contains general information only.

242,"A year ago Marie Kondo sparked a decluttering phenomenon. For some, it was life-changing",house-and-home,"  Marie Kondo's Tidying Up taught us to let go of stuff. A year on, has the philosophy stuck? Stuff doesn't overpower Judy Kim anymore. She's stopped hoarding her daughter's schoolbooks and artwork, and she's used to people laughing about how she ""Marie Kondo-ed"" her house. ""I've been the best I've been in my whole entire life,"" she says. Ms Kim's decluttering was inspired by Kondo's philosophy — which became a craze when the guru's television series Tidying Up hit Netflix about a year ago. But has the philosophy stuck with us? In 2020, are we still asking ""does this spark joy?"" Ms Kim was motivated to clean up by the memory of the weeks of throwing out ""everything of everything"" following the death of her grandparents. ""I thought, 'I don't want to be giving this to my child, this kind of burden when I'm dead,'"" she says. Kondo's words made her realise ""it's OK to let it go"". ""I've got a few memories but it's not overpowering me like it used to,"" the Adelaide mum says. Ms Kim wasn't the only one cleaning up. Kondo's TV series, which followed a best-selling book, was released on January 1, 2019 — just in time for the New Year. Phil Coyte, Vinnies NSW director of retail and logistics, says that time of the year is traditionally the ""biggest time for both quantity of donations and also dumping"". At the height of the craze, Australians were parting with truckloads of unwanted items. Some charities and thrift shops even asked people to stop leaving donations while they sorted through the backlog. Mr Coyte says the Kondo effect is still present, but has ""plateaued down a bit towards a bit more of a manageable level"". Google searches for ""Marie Kondo"" have also slipped away from the peak in mid-January last year. And while Kondo's Facebook page still boasts almost 840,000 likes, a far smaller number of people are engaging with the page. One recent post, for example, attracted 200 comments — compared to 5,000 on a post a year ago. Consumer behaviour expert Eloise Zoppos believes the Kondo trend ""passed relatively quickly"" but says for many people, the principles of the show have stuck. ""It wasn't surprising that Australians jumped on the trend and really wanted to apply those principles to their everyday life,"" says Dr Zoppos, from the Australian Consumer and Retail Services (ACRS) research unit at Monash University. ""Sustainability and the importance placed on it by consumers will only continue to grow."" The decluttering craze has plateaued, but it hasn't disappeared. For people like Miri Collis, it's even become a job. Ms Collis, who helps people in eastern Sydney declutter and style their homes, has seen everything from hoarding shopping receipts to saving hundreds of children's books and owning wardrobes of never worn designer dresses. ""There's a lot of emotion, therapy, talking. Sometimes I'm very gentle, sometimes I'm not,"" Ms Collis says. ""Sometimes we have a truck that comes and takes away all the rubbish. A truck full of stuff that people have been collecting and unable to let go of. ""I think a lot of it is sentimental, or there is a fear that if you let go that something might happen, so there is a bit of insecurity."" Ms Collis believes the trend of ""living more simply"" will continue to grow. ""It's a much bigger picture,"" she says. ""It's not just about let me organise your house, it's about consuming. The less you consume the better it is for the environment."" What goes into manufacturing the various textiles we wear and how do the environmental impacts of each compare? Ms Kim says she now thinks ""very long and hard"" about buying things, and has started to prioritise experiences over physical possessions. ""It's actually a gift to my daughter, teaching her to simplify your life instead of the 'greed is good', the excess of the 80s of when I was growing up,"" she says. Dr Zoppos predicts that going forward, consumers will be ""really mindful"" about a brand's values, and look for ethical, sustainable items. And while she believes that in years to come people might question why they folded their clothes by the KonMari method, Dr Zoppos says some of the lessons will stay with people. She says they'll always remember that ""tidying, organising and only buying and keeping items that spark joy can lead to a more positive and happy lifestyle overall"". ""They may just try to do it in new and different ways,"" she says. Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.

243,analysis: 'Spreadsheet towers' populate every major city — and they're becoming a major problem,house-and-home,"  As high-rises reach their use-by date, we need to find safe ways to 'unbuild' our cities We are entering a new world where skyscrapers and other huge buildings are becoming redundant and need significant overhaul or replacement. The process is called unbuilding or, if you're a bit highfalutin, deconstruction. These so-called spreadsheet towers populate every major city. They signalled modernity and provided huge profits for those who built them. But these buildings are profligate users of fuels for light, power and services. Most developed world cities started building skyscrapers after World War II. These buildings were International Style architecture, unrecognisable in terms of a particular locale, universal in terms of their ubiquitous metal, concrete, glass — and fully air-conditioned. Now they are ageing, their use-by date is up and their balance sheet profitability no longer attracts. The question is: how do we safely dismantle these high-rise structures, which are generally located in busy cities? Reminders of the dangers of explosive demolition are tragedies such as the death of 12-year-old Katie Bender. She was struck by flying debris when the Royal Canberra Hospital was razed in 1997 to make way for the new National Museum of Australia. A recent demolition, and the tallest ever to be unbuilt, is 270 Park Avenue, New York City. Its 52 floors were built in 1960 for the Union Carbide chemical company. The building was for 50 years the tallest ever designed by a female architect (Natalie de Bios of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. Is that another low hit for gender equality?). Its replacement by architects Norman Foster will be twice as high. The business of disassembling these skyscrapers is just now developing, but it will gain pace as more become obsolete. Some still get imploded, but usually, in a busy city, demolition techniques must be unobtrusive, as quiet and clean as possible. The techniques used for cleaning up the World Trade Centre testify to the wastefulness of a more destructive approach. Plenty of clever techniques to demolish exist. Some start at the base and work up, others in reverse. The 40-storey Akasaka Prince Hotel in Tokyo was slowly demolished in 2012-13 using a technique where a cap was built on top of the building. It was stripped floor by floor as the cap was lowered, so all the dust, mess and debris was contained and removed with no effect on the environment. Buildings are wrapped in scaffold and protective fabric then literally dismantled in the reverse order to which they were built. In the process building waste can be recycled and reused rather than dumped. Reverse building involves removing the glass, then the frames, taking off the wall cladding, then scraping away at the concrete and steel frames bit by bit. Concrete is removed to expose the steel reinforcing bars, which are then separately removed and recycled. In the process unwanted material can be uncovered, like asbestos, which needs particular care in handling. Welcome to Ryde, where the new realities of inner-city living are colliding with locals who remember life before the rush. Interiors are unbuilt the same way — remove floor coverings, cupboards, doors and lightweight walls, strip the electrical wiring and pipes, take out air conditioning and lifts, remove stairs and escalators. These removalists act smartly, as materials and fabric are recycled and often reused for another building. It is a sustainable way of dealing with the issue. Things that might normally have been reduced to dust and mud by destruction are instead usefully salvaged and recovered for an extended life cycle. As part of the benefits of this procedure, unbuilding provides large numbers of construction jobs and associated employment in transportation, waste management and recycling. It also provides new construction sites. This means cities need not expand beyond existing boundaries and the infrastructure of services, roads and public transport need not be extended. What has interested those involved with this work is the capacity of building designers (let's call them architects) to creatively improve their buildings in terms of life after use-by date. Techniques are being developed that assist in unbuilding and salvaging materials, even down to basic principles such as ease of access to pipes and wires, modular components and simplified connection practices. The logic is that clarity of building structure and services makes retrieval simpler. Less complexity of materials and components means a building can be untangled more efficiently. Fastening devices can be simplified and mechanical (rather than using glues and sealants), toxic materials avoided, materials selected with an afterlife in mind and structures designed for simplicity and accessibility. Also important is a clear set of as-built documents that map the original building so it can be disassembled. Clear design thinking will have value for unbuilding and recycling in the future. The construction industry is a main consumer of fuels, timber, steel and other metals, concrete and plastics. That demand drives the logging of forests, mining and extraction, leading to material production and transport that contributes to emissions and pollution. The UK Green Building Council estimates the construction industry generates about 22 per cent of UK carbon emissions, uses 40 per cent of drinking water, contributes 50 per cent to climate change and over half our landfill waste, and accounts for 39 per cent of global energy use. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also reports that the industry contributes to asthma and lung cancer by producing radon via contaminated applied finishes (paint). Driving the need for much greater reuse of old building materials is an awareness of the fragility of our resources and the energy we use to consume them.

244,"So, you want to live in a tiny house? Here's what you need to know",house-and-home,"  So, you want to live in a tiny house? Here's what to consider when choosing a house, van or caravan The reasons for choosing to go tiny range from reducing debt, inability to afford a conventional home, the search for sustainability, a life crisis, or even preparing for an uncertain future in the face of climate change by going off-grid. Or perhaps a combination of these. An important first step is to decide what type of tiny house you want. To many, the phrase ""tiny house"" brings to mind an archetypal tiny house on wheels, a miniature cottage on a trailer, often made of wood, with a pitched roof and dormer windows. Indeed, most tiny housers prefer some degree of mobility, whether a ready-made or DIY tiny house, converted caravan or bus/van. A survey by the Australian Tiny House Association found most (78 per cent of 109 respondents) lived in tiny houses on wheels, but a small but growing proportion live in converted caravans, vans or buses. First you need to evaluate your motives, which may differ according to your situation or stage of life. The most important question here is, how often do you want to move? Do you want to be ultra-mobile, and live like a digital nomad, perhaps in a ""stealth van"" in the city, changing parking spaces every night? Or do you want to travel around Australia like a ""grey nomad"", staying in caravan parks or roadside camps for a week or so before moving on? Alternatively, do you want to be more settled, perhaps moving occasionally, to be closer to work, medical facilities or schools for children? (Yes, some tiny housers have children). Or do you want to travel between the houses of adult children or do petsitting, staying from weeks to months? Many off-the-shelf caravans are extremely well designed and are accepted everywhere, at caravan parks or roadside parking areas. On the other hand, a tiny house on wheels is less mobile, and not suited to frequent moving (they are also extremely heavy, not aerodynamic and large tow vehicles are costly). They're also less accepted in caravan parks, and most local councils consider them caravans, with restricted periods of occupancy and often onerous conditions. Vans and buses are the most flexible (in the ""stealth van"" or vanlife movement, people live rent-free by parking, mostly illegally, often in industrial estates, and using public or work/gym bathrooms). They are, however, extremely small and while it may seem glamorous to live in a van like celebrity rock climber Alex Honnold, the reality may not be practical. Cost will likely be the next factor to consider. Ready-built tiny houses range from around $50,000 - $120,000; DIY are cheaper, especially if self-built, with some costing under $2,000. The higher end, architect-designed ones are more expensive. Converted caravans can be affordable, even under $10,000, but prices vary markedly, with some ultra-luxurious five-wheelers costing more than a typical suburban house (>$600,000). Converting old buses and vans is much cheaper, with the cost of the vehicle tending to be under $20,000. Of note, unless you are living under the radar or free camping, you are going to have to factor in the ongoing cost of renting someone's backyard or caravan park space. Sustainability is a more nuanced aspect of tiny house living; living small means less energy needed for heating and less room for superfluous stuff, encouraging or enforcing a minimalist lifestyle. Most tiny houses on wheels are off-grid to some extent, relying on solar power, rainwater and composting toilets. They are often built entirely out of sustainable or reclaimed materials. On the other hand, most caravans and vans are not particularly sustainable — they're often built out of mass-produced material and may produce outgassing from carpets and paints. Vans and busses are generally no more or less sustainable than any similar vehicle. Tiny houses, whatever the type, are just that: tiny. Space is at a premium and living tiny requires reducing stuff, such as clothes, sporting and hobby equipment. Tiny houses on wheels, where parked more permanently, allow for decks and even sheds, but caravans and vans are self contained, unless in a permanent caravan park. If you are used to living in a very large space, it may take time to adapt to the practicalities of tiny living; people often complain about cooking smells and composting toilets. Despite the popularity of tiny houses however, very few people actually live in them. Nonetheless, the vast majority of people who live or have lived tiny, view their experience positively, and feel it has greatly enriched their lives, and helped them re-evaluate their life choices, especially consumerism even after moving to more conventional dwellings.

245,Homeowners in 'disbelief' as drought drives rise in cracked buildings,house-and-home,"  Drought causes buildings to crack, leaving homeowners facing hefty repair bills The drought is causing a growing number of buildings across the Hunter to crack, making busy work for tradespeople and untold expenses for homeowners. Building experts say clay soils, common across New South Wales and beyond, are becoming increasingly dry, causing them to contract and foundations to subside. Far from the state's dusty, drought-stricken farms, it is a side of the drought showing up in inner-city homes and building sites. When Trudy Grahame bought her home in the Newcastle suburb of Broadmeadow last year, she said inspectors gave it the all clear. But in the past couple of weeks, cracks nearly a centimetre wide have appeared on several walls. ""We only moved here in September. There was no sign of this cracking at all,"" she said. ""We had it inspected before we purchased it and they said there were no issues, so it's come as a surprise. ""I opened the cupboard and I was just like, 'Oh, my gosh'. It was frightening."" Ms Grahame fought back tears when she examined fresh cracks in her spare room. ""It's definitely bigger than what it was yesterday,"" she said. ""It's just … half the wall is cracked."" Cracks also covered corners of her bedroom, wardrobe, and cornices in the living room on the other side of the house. She said she was ""in disbelief"" at how quickly the cracks had grown. Ms Grahame had planned to install air conditioning in the 90-year-old brick home to make the summer ahead more bearable, but said she would now have to rethink the budget. ""We're going to get an engineer in to do a structural assessment and from their report see what they can do,"" she said. ""We contacted a few other people and they've said there's an extraordinary amount of cracking in the Newcastle region due to the drying of the soil."" One of those Ms Grahame consulted was Resinject managing director Andy Evans, who said her case was not unique. ""It's certainly worse than it is traditionally,"" Mr Evans said of cracking in homes and buildings. ""It's in the reactive clay scenarios, which is basically statewide, aside from sandy soils on the coastal fringe. ""The clays are drying out, which means the clays are shrinking, forming voidage around the footings and foundations of your house. ""We're getting called out to a lot of it because it's leading to movement in houses, because of the loss of load-bearing capacity of the ground."" Mr Evans described his work as ""like Botox for houses"" — injecting polyurethane, which rapidly expands, into ground that has contracted, filling voids and re-levelling foundations that have subsided. Other foundation repairers favour the more traditional underpinning method, using concrete to jack up a house. Jeff Brick maintains buildings around Newcastle and said he has also seen more cracking in recent months — a trend he had not seen since the Millennium drought. He said it was happening particularly in older, double-brick homes. ""A lot of people don't know what's in their yard,"" he said. ""With the ground drying out, there's not much you can do about it — apart from maybe keeping a garden hose on it, which is not practical with the current water restrictions. ""So we're going to get a lot more houses that are cracking and moving, even new houses."" Mr Evans warned against homeowners taking preventative measures or treatment into their own hands. ""You do hear of people irrigating their footings but you have got to know what you're doing because you don't want to overdose it or you'll exacerbate your problem,"" he said. The drought is not only causing cracks in older houses, it is also influencing the design and construction of new buildings. Mr Evans said engineers had told him they have had to place foundations deeper in the ground to find the right moisture level. ""Traditionally they'd be looking at a couple of metres; now they're looking at up to 6 metres,"" he said. Developer Luke Berry has overseen the construction of major developments around the Hunter as director of Thirdi group. He said his builders worked closely with architects and engineers to ensure building materials could expand and contract ""in response to Australia's extreme weather patterns"". ""We are constantly monitoring and reviewing the best ways possible to construct and deliver our buildings that minimise thermal expansion, one of the key causes of cracking,"" Mr Berry said. Trudy Grahame said subsidence was not covered by her insurer and she did not yet know how much her home's repairs would cost. ""There are so many people worse off at the moment with fires, losing their lives, their whole properties, their possessions,"" she said. ""It doesn't make me angry, because the previous owner couldn't have known. How can you know? ""It's just something that's started happening because of the drought.""

246,"Earn more than $50,000 a year? You're not an 'average' Aussie",house-and-home,"  Are you one of the 'everyday Australians' politicians refer to? Are you one of the ""everyday Australians"" we hear politicians talking about? If you earn any more than $50,000 per year, you have already stepped out of the ""average Aussie"" bracket. The median income in Australia is $48,360 before tax, according to a report released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics this month that analysed data from the 2016/2017 financial year. In regional areas, that figure is far lower. The most marked difference is in the Northern Territory, where Darwin city dwellers' median income is $61,375, compared to $52,420 for the rest of the territory. The highest median income is found in the Australian Capital Territory, at $63,038. Tasmanian workers have the lowest median income, at $44,437. Georgia* earns slightly less than the average worker in western Victoria, where the median wage is about $40,000. She has $491 per week to cover rent, electricity bills, car repayments, insurance, registration, home contents insurance, petrol and groceries. It is a reality that Georgia does not see portrayed in the media or considered by politicians. ""It's easier to see it from the bottom than it is from the top,"" she said. ""You're always looking up, but the top doesn't always look down."" Georgia has worked for the same large retail store in Horsham for 18 years but is unable to secure any more than 25 hours per week. ""The whole retail environment has moved toward casualising the workforce and if you don't already have a contract in place, you're probably never going to get one,"" she said. ""If I keep my hours, I'm happy; the casuals don't have that guarantee."" Before locking in her part-time contract, Georgia did one month of unpaid work experience and years of casual work at the same retail outlet. ""When you're casual you can't get a car loan perhaps … or they might not look at you for a rental [house],"" she said. ""It's harder in rural areas because you don't have options. ""I think there are a lot more older people in the same job for a long time because that's their security."" Georgia was born deaf and requires regular specialist appointments. She recently had to find $3,000 for new hearing aids, but earns $50 per week too much to qualify for a healthcare card, making her ineligible for government subsidies. ""If I dropped the five hours a week to be eligible, I'd never got those hours back again,"" she said. ""I'm right in the middle — it could always be better, but it could be worse."" She has no prospect of getting into the housing market. ""I can't even think about it,"" she said. ""I did at one point go to the bank and get a bit of an assessment done [and] the loan repayments would have worked out cheaper [than renting], but I can't get the deposit. ""I've got to the point now where I've realised it's not going to happen."" At the age of 73, Sonia Matthews has just taken up a casual job at Mitre 10. Forced to retire when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, Ms Matthews used her superannuation to pay off her house in Horsham. Take our quiz to find out how your salary compares to your neighbours — and how well you know your place on Australia's income ladder. She is now dependent on the single pension, which is $466.70 per week. ""Out of that money I have to pay my [council] rates, my water rates, house insurance, car insurance, electricity and gas and car registration as well,"" she said. ""This month I've had to pay about $1,300 and there's still the electricity bill to come."" Ms Matthews grows her own vegetables and freezes them for use throughout the year. She gets to the supermarket early, for first pick of the half-priced meat. ""I have a good diet because of my vegies and fruit trees, but it's very difficult,"" she said. ""This year it's been a lot more difficult to make that money go around because everything's gone up; the last pension rise we got was about $7 a week."" Any unexpected costs, like another health scare, could unravel Ms Matthews' careful budgeting. ""I can't ever afford to buy another car, so I have to look after my car,"" she said. ""It's no good lying in bed and worrying, so I just go with the flow."" Connie* knows how easy it is for low income earners to slip into debt. She and her husband were employed at the same Horsham supermarket when a difficult pregnancy prevented her from working. Australia has one of the world's biggest household debt burdens, and analysts warn it may weigh our economy down for years to come. The couple, who already had two children, had been carefully synchronising shifts to ensure one parent could be at home. ""We would juggle that, so we could both work and have children without being in day care,"" she said. ""While childcare's great, you're sort of going to work to pay someone else."" Then Connie had to stop work and make regular four-hour trips to Melbourne for specialist appointments — an ""impossible"" situation on a single supermarket income. ""We had no healthcare card and no cover, because we couldn't afford private insurance,"" she said. ""So you know, you've grabbed your credit card to survive and then all of a sudden you're in debt and then you're struggling; it's that constant cycle that is hard to get out of."" Throughout December, the retail store Georgia works at is abuzz with families loading trolleys with toys and decorations. It is a pervasive reminder of all the material things she cannot afford herself. ""It's just crazy what people can — and do — spend on Christmas,"" she said. Georgia's colleagues organised a work party but she, as she does every year, politely declined. ""You don't want to say you can't afford it, but they know you can't,"" she said. ""I don't want to seem like I'm envious … it's more that you don't want to make them feel sorry for you. ""There are lots of things missing from my life but I don't aim for a lot of things because there's no point."" Ms Matthews has created her own Christmas trap, in the form of beloved baked goods that her grandchildren now expect every year. This year dried fruit seemed to be more expensive than usual, but it was a non-negotiable. ""Sometimes the credit card comes in handy, right at Christmas,"" she said. ""I do like to see my family at Christmas — it's worth it."" * Names have been changed to maintain privacy.

247,"Owner-builder creates sustainable, luxury beach 'shack'",house-and-home,"  Weekend surf 'shack' takes off-grid eco-living to next level luxury There is nothing quite as aspirational to the Australian psyche as an ocean-front getaway. But gazing at the sea from a quaint coastal surf shack on a remote stretch of coastline in the sanctuary of the Australian bush is a dream most of us will never attain. For lucky owner-builder Richard Taylor however, the dream is a reality. His off-grid beach weekender, located on Victoria's rugged South Gippsland coastline, not only boasts panoramic views of Bass Strait, but takes sustainable, state-of-the-art eco-living to next level luxury. The 330-square-metre home comprises of four bedrooms, three ensuites, a laundry, garage, rumpus room, and swimming pool. The 'shack's' open plan kitchen, living, and dining area hinge around a spiral staircase tower leading to an observation deck with a 360-degree view. Modernist American architect Frank Lloyd Wright's Hemicycle House was the inspiration for the home's design. ""It appealed to me because it was made of stone, it was very solid and had a very big glass frontage — and it was also an owner-built house,"" Mr Taylor said. ""I took the designs of that house and modified them extensively. ""We still have the tower looking out and the big glass frontage, but I added wings on to it and put a courtyard in the back."" Constructed from pre-fabricated concrete tilt panels, Mr Taylor's house components were delicately brought in along the curvy, sandy three-kilometre driveway by a convoy of semitrailers. ""I put 140 truckloads of gravel on the driveway to keep the semitrailers from sinking,"" he said. ""It took a lot of preparation as we needed to wire the house, plumb the house, put all the heating in, do everything before the slab was poured."" Mr Taylor said that despite the ferocious weather the concrete house experiences, it was ""amazingly quiet"". ""Because there is so much concrete in the house, its amazingly solid and amazingly quiet,"" he said. ""There is so much thermal mass that the house is incredibly stable in terms of temperature."" This reduces the need for air conditioning during the summer and heating during the winter. A solar setup comprising three kilowatts of solar panels stores energy in a 75kw battery bank of 48 volts which supports the entire house, lights, electronics, and pool pump. Mr Taylor designed his own heating system too — a fireplace configuration which heats water, then pumps the hot water to a network of hydronic panels lodged in the walls. Water is collected from the roof and stored in a 100,000-litre water tank, while grey water, sewerage, and food scraps are composted in a giant underground worm farm tank below the house. South Gippsland is the forgotten cousin to more fashionable coastal stretches along Victoria's coastline, such as the Morning Peninsula and Great Ocean Road. The area might once have been described as a 'daggy dairy farming backwater' beyond the penguins of Phillip Island. But over the last 10 years, the lush rolling hills have emerged as a convenient hamlet for foodies, artists, campers, boutique farmers, and Melbourne housing market refugees. The region has now been cultivated by artisanal wine and cheese makers, bakers, fishers, fresh food producers, and beekeepers, united by a quest for cleaner, greener, better living. For Mr Taylor, who has had a successful yet stressful international career in the banking sector, the move towards a more simple lifestyle centred around health, wellbeing, and the environment. He has even been inspired by the property's unique heritage as a beekeeper's farm to set up his own beehives and learn how to cultivate honey. Mr Taylor describes his 259-hectare property of virgin bush as ""a national park"". He plans to keep the natural landscape intact to protect the significant and biodiverse species, organisms, and eco systems unique to the Wilson Promontory coastline. Besides contending with the wind and weather of Bass Strait, the occasional wild bird or animals pecking away at silicone and cables, Mr Taylor enjoys observing the seasonal changes and spectacular sunsets. ""It's amazing to see the wildlife operating around you and going about their own lives,"" Mr Taylor said. ""It's amazingly busy out there on the ocean. If you just passed by you might not get to see it, but being able to live here you become immersed in the environment.""

Now she has a new tiny house",house-and-home,"  Bushfire victim wins brand new tiny house, with Christmas tree, after friend enters her in competition A woman who lost her home in a ferocious bushfire that tore through the northern New South Wales town of Nymboida has won a brand new tiny house after her friend entered her into a competition. The blaze in November destroyed 85 houses in the small Northern Rivers town, including Nina Jongen's. A few weeks later, Ms Jongen's friend Linda Giuliano noticed an online competition inviting entrants to write, in 25 words or less, why they or someone they knew needed a little extra festive cheer this year. ""I was just devastated by Nina losing her house,"" Ms Giuliano said. ""Nina had put a message out on Facebook asking if anyone had a caravan she could live in and I thought I'd go next level and pop her name into [the competition] and nominate her. ""She's one of those people that always helps everyone in the community. She really deserves a break and she's just such a special person."" The competition by online streaming service Amazon Prime received more than 20,000 entries. Ms Jongen said she was speechless when she received a phone call saying she had won a new tiny house. ""I was just in so much shock I didn't know what to say,"" she said. ""It means so much. I love Linda, I'm so grateful."" The house arrived in Nymboida in time for Christmas and will remain at a local campground until Ms Jongen can move back onto her property. She named the house 'Little Linda' in honour of her friend. ""This house has got everything you can imagine and more,"" Ms Jongen said. ""The kitchen's fully set up with a microwave, coffee machine, toaster, kettle, a little vacuum, all the way down to toothbrushes, a boardgame, a Playstation 4, a TV, a fancy sound system, a beautiful single bed that pulls out into king. ""I slept very comfortably with my daughter, my sister, and my niece — all of us with this beautiful, big window overlooking the sky and the bush. The patch that we're looking at isn't burnt, thankfully."" The community faces a long recovery with many bushfire-affected properties still yet to be cleared of hazards such as asbestos before rebuilding can begin. ""Huge areas of it are just unrecognisable,"" Ms Jongen said. ""Getting in to rebuild, and even just processing and helping and working with the community, has been really hard.

249,Why Cate's had 40 housemates for eight years,house-and-home,"  Would you live permanently with friends, family or total strangers to save money on housing? When most people enter the housing market, they do so to get away from the idea of sharing with someone other than their partners and children. But in the Melbourne suburb of Heidelberg Heights, about 40 strangers have banded together and live in a close-knit community, sealed with 99-year rental leases. It's an affordable long-term renting solution for people on lower incomes — residents contribute 25 per cent of their earnings. Cate Grant is one of the original tenants of the Murundaka co-housing development, which was founded eight years ago. After a relationship breakdown, renting in Melbourne became untenable for the mother of three so she applied for an apartment at Murundaka. ""I'd been quite low income and it was a way of getting out of the private rental market,"" she said. ""Joining a co-op meant I could be more empowered about my own housing, more in control of it."" Applicants have to go through interview stages to become members of the co-housing cooperative. At Murundaka, they are simultaneously tenants and landlords, as each resident is expected to contribute time cleaning the housing complex, gardening, cooking meals for everyone and recycling. Tenants who find this sort of living unsuitable or whose income increases and enables them to afford their own property are asked to leave. Another early bird tenant, Rachel Lowe, said it was the shared meals, responsibilities and sense of family that attracted her more than low rent. ""There is a safety with knowing who's around you and the sense of camaraderie that I haven't felt anywhere else,"" she said. But living with strangers does have its challenges. ""[In every household] you might have people who have unfinished projects, [who say] 'Oh, I'm just going to put it here, I'm just going to put it on the breakfast bar',"" Ms Lowe said. ""Well, imagine that with 20 adults. ""You've got to be realistic. ""Everyone has their moments of needing space. Everyone gets grumpy, confused."" For sisters Lynne Sugden and Julie Newby, co-habiting provided the perfect path to home ownership in retirement. The pair had lived separately in Sydney, and said retiring in the expensive city would be ""out of question"". ""We thought that it would be feasible to try and buy something together, and that's how we ended up arriving where we are now,"" Ms Sudgen said. Finding the right block of land proved key for Ms Newby and Ms Sugden, who searched for a year before finding the perfect spot in Tea Gardens, north of Newcastle. They bought a 475-square-metre block that already had two cottages on site. The purchase set them back $300,000. But their main saver has been how they set up their homes to reduce their costs for the rest of their lives. The sisters have connected their two cottages using a narrow corridor. They both still have separate living spaces, but joined by a ""tunnel"", their homes classify as one dwelling, which will save them on council rates. ""It was more financially viable for us to keep the two old dwellings and renovate them and add on new additions at the back. This makes it cheaper,"" Ms Sugden said. The siblings save more money by using just one electricity reader and one set of bins. They also cut costs by hiring Ms Newby's son to carry out renovations for a ""family price"" and lived with their children during the construction process so they weren't paying additional rent. Each sister agreed to contribute $300,000 towards the project. They estimate the renovation, which will be completed by March, will cost them $250,000. ""In the end, we don't want to go over $600,000. That includes the land and building,"" Ms Sugden said. ""We've got to watch our money and we've got a very strict budget."" While their friends have admired their savviness, the siblings acknowledge this sort of living might not work for all families. ""We think that we'll go OK. We both like the same things, luckily, and have been agreeing well with the type of building that we want, paint colours,"" Ms Sugden said. ""[It's about] blended families these days. Or friends."" Michael Fotheringham, the executive director of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, said both home ownership and renting had become severely unaffordable for many Australians, forcing them to get creative. ""Over the last 30 years since the early 1980s, house prices have risen much more sharply than wages have risen,"" he said. ""Governments are doing what they can, at federal and state level and increasingly at local government level, but at the same time we're seeing really creative approaches from individuals responding to a challenging system."" He said cooperative living was a tenable renting option that should be rolled out on a larger scale. ""There are cooperative providers within the community housing sector, but as this stage it's a fairly small segment of the sector,"" he said. ""Whereas in North America, for example, cooperative housing is a much larger movement."" He said buying a property with family members was ""becoming a means of getting into home ownership"". ""That's a pattern that was rare 10 or 15 years ago but is increasingly common now,"" he said. ""People are forming relationships later in life, living with their parents for longer, and rather than wait until they're at the family formation stage and having kids, they're often purchasing with friends or colleagues earlier on."" Ms Newby said entering the housing market didn't need to be conventional. ""Whoever out there wants to do this, I think they should just get together, work it out and just go for it,"" she said.

250,Is keeping a rental cool in the heat a landlord's responsibility?,house-and-home,"  Is keeping a rental cool in the heat a landlord's responsibility? As parts of Australia are sweltering through an intensifying heatwave, many people are taking steps to ensure their homes are cool enough. And for those in rentals, it can be tough knowing what you can and can't ask your landlord to help cool down your living arrangements. Several renters have told the ABC about their experiences in asking for upgrades to beat the heat, so we've taken a look at what you're entitled to do. Olivia* spent almost 12 months renting an apartment in Brisbane that was ""like living in a sauna"". She and her partner signed the lease with an understanding the landlord would install an air-conditioning unit. Without it, she said the heat and humidity was oppressive. ""We weren't sleeping at night. Through the day, we were just sitting on the couch sweating. It was having an impact on both our work and personal lives,"" she said. Olivia said persistent emails to the property manager proved unsuccessful. ""It was becoming really tedious and difficult and we felt very awkward trying to broach the topic,"" she said. The couple sought quotes and even offered to cover the cost of the unit, which was finally installed after they broke the lease. ""If we'd known [the landlord would] install an air conditioner at no stage while we were there, then we'd probably have looked to go somewhere else,"" she said. Real Estate Institute of South Australia (REISA) policy advisor Paul Edwards said it wasn't up to your landlord to do anything. ""There is a bit of a perception out there for tenants that it is a landlord's obligation to provide air conditioning or shutters,"" he said. ""All I can say is that it isn't the obligation."" However, some landlords have told the ABC they went out of their way to ensure a property was well equipped for heat. ""We rented for years and never had luck with that kind of request,"" one said. ""As a landlord I have ensured my property has dishwasher, washer, dryer, air conditioning, ceiling fans, and blinds installed. It's my tenant's home."" But, again, there are no obligations. ""Just because landlords have a house to rent, they may not have much spare cash,"" she said. If you have been a reliable tenant, it could be as simple as putting a request to your landlord. Mr Edwards said they might be more receptive if a tenant offered to shoulder some of the cost or pay higher rent. ""If you had a tenant who went to a landlord and said, 'I'd like to put up some blinds, I'm happy to pay for them', then you would be a stupid landlord if you didn't agree,"" Mr Edwards said. ""We encourage landlords to listen to a tenant who wants it, you actually do want a good tenant and you want the tenant to renew the lease."" But, it's important to remember landlords might not have the means to cover upgrades to a rental property. ""I have great tenants and try to keep them happy. Unfortunately, if they asked for aircon to be installed — luckily the house already has it — I would probably have to just do one room,"" one landlord told the ABC. ""I couldn't afford anything else."" And if a landlord or agent says air conditioning or fans will be installed when looking at a rental property, make sure to get the assurance in writing before signing a lease. In SA, current legislation only requires landlords to maintain fittings and ensure they are in working order. Mr Edwards said interstate reforms allowed tenants to have pets and make minor modifications to properties — like installing blinds. While there are differences between states, it seems most operate with broadly similar principles, without legislative requirements for landlords to install cooling devices in homes. In a 2017 consumer advice notice, the WA Government said it was the job of landlords to ensure property maintenance — but only on ""contents already provided"". ""You are responsible for the upkeep of the property, for example plumbing and the maintenance of contents already provided such as the stove, hot water system, or air conditioner,"" it said. According to state peak body Tenants Victoria, ""anything provided by the landlord must be maintained and repaired if necessary"". That is not the case if the air conditioner was damaged due to a tenant's lack of care. If the unit breaks down on its own, however, tenants and landlords can both have obligations. Fair Trading NSW states that if urgent repairs are required, the tenant should immediately contact the landlord or agent: ""If urgent repairs are not done within a reasonable time, you can arrange for the work to be completed and be reimbursed, up to $1,000 by the landlord."" Rachel Pogson told the ABC her landlord refused a request to install ceiling fans and fly screens. But in a tough Sydney rental environment, she can't afford to move anywhere else. ""I can't open a window at night and have to shut the house up so it's dark during the day,"" she said. ""Pedestal fans don't cut it … if there's a stretch of days over 30, it's stifling."" Ms Pogson said during the heat this summer she will stay with family in Newcastle as much as possible, to escape the heat. But there are other ways to cool down your property and modify your living arrangements to keep cool when the weather becomes unbearable. For example, during the current heatwave outback publicans have resorted to wetting their roofs by switching their rooftop sprinklers on to bring down the temperature inside. SA's State Emergency Service had advised people to sleep in the coolest part of the property, adding ice cubes to drinking water and filling a spray bottle with water. However, wider scale relief might need action from councils, who have been urged to plant more trees to reduce heat in urban areas. And at a national level, there are calls for minimum energy efficiency standards to be introduced for rentals, which could reduce the need to heat or cool properties as much, reducing the cost for tenants. Ross Womersley from the South Australian Council of Social Service (SACOSS) said he was concerned about the welfare of people on low incomes and those who rent modest homes. ""[Those tenants] are likely to be in properties that simply don't have the environmental protections that many of the top end properties would have,"" he said. Heatwaves kill far more people than other natural disasters. ABC Emergency has a checklist of things you can do to be ready. ""With climate change and its impacts, it's highly likely that we will see many more instances where we experience climate events that are really, really uncomfortable."" Mr Womersley said there are not regulatory structures to compel landlords to build properties that protect tenants in hot weather conditions or have older properties retrofitted. ""We've repeatedly been calling on both government — at a state and a federal level — to be making these provisions,"" he said. ""We should be ensuring that all properties that are being built are up to a very high environmental standard, in order to ensure that in the long term, we're protecting everybody in our community from these events.""

251,"Emma's timeline was 12 weeks, her budget was $100k. Here's how she built a home for her family",house-and-home,"  Emma and Andrew built their homes for $100,000. Here's how they did it When Emma Hohnen found herself in a housing bind, she wasn't like most people trying to enter the market. Ms Hohnen already owned her own home, but a relationship breakdown meant she could no longer afford to live in the house and make her repayments. ""Three months was the longest I had to financially be able to cover the mortgage,"" she said. Faced with the task of finding a new living situation for herself and her two young children, she decided to rent out her existing home, and use her equity to build a second, smaller dwelling at the back of her property. Her budget was just $100,000, and her timeline was 12 weeks. Because Ms Hohnen had to build behind her existing house, she was limited in size. ""It had to be within 60 square metres and it had to only have one bedroom,"" she said. But it was that very restriction that helped her get things moving fast. ""I just started thinking about what I needed, and got really clear on that, but also really thinking about what I didn't need,"" she said. Ms Hohnen, who had some previous renovation experience, sketched her own simple designs and found almost all of her materials — including hardwood timber, bearers and joists, floorboards, weatherboards and windows — from a demolition site. ""That was about $15,000 worth of materials that we got in the end for $3,000,"" she said. ""There's a lot of recycle centres in most small cities and in most small towns, and the local council tips will have recycled doors and windows. ""I think a lot of people are doing that now. ""It adds character to your build as well as making it more affordable and more responsible."" Ms Hohnen hired a builder to work on more complex designs, but got involved with simpler tasks, such as de-nailing and stripping off paint. ""I loved being around the build, watching what they were doing, asking a million questions, driving them nuts,"" she said. She said she had made ""a few mistakes that I would do differently"" — namely putting wooden floorboards in the bathroom, which she said turned out to be impractical for a wet space. ""Overall I'm really happy, it's a great space,"" she said. While the idea of building a home for $100,000 might seem out of reach, in southern Tasmania Andrew Kerr has pulled off a similar feat. Mr Kerr, an architect, had spent $75,000 on a block of land a few years earlier, but with an end to the first home builders' grant looming, he decided to build his own house. ""Because I was an emerging architect and a part-time tour guide, that prompted me to build something I could afford and also that would allow me to continue to travel and not have the encumbrance of a large mortgage,"" Mr Kerr said. Young and single, Mr Kerr didn't want or need a large house, so he settled on a design of 61 square metres. ""I mainly just focused on my immediate needs, so that meant keeping the footprint small,"" he said. ""Every square-metre costs money — so if you can save building space you don't need, that saves money as well."" Mr Kerr set himself a goal: to build an efficient, well-designed house for ""60-something-thousand dollars"", or less than $70,000. He hired a local builder and paid for trades and services, but did a lot of the unskilled labour himself. Most of the cost-cutting came from the home's small size, and Mr Kerr's use of locally sourced and recycled materials. He saved about $500 by using seconds and offcuts for a multi-coloured roof, and managed to get four large, double-glazed window units free. Mr Kerr used timber milled on site, which slowed down the construction timeline, but saved a lot of money. ""Using some of the recycled materials like the bricks inside also adds an extra texture or warmth to the building that you wouldn't get with new products,"" he said. ""I quite enjoyed looking for some things that would make it distinctly Tasmanian as well, like the Huon pine duckboards in the shower."" In the end, Andrew Kerr made some design decisions that pushed up the cost. ""I realised it was going to be quite a nice house and I'd be spending more time here than just a weekend shack."" His total build price ended up at $103,000, plus about $30,000 to build a driveway and connect services including power, a septic system and water tank. The total cost, including land, came in under $210,000. He said one of the biggest challenges was getting the bank on board. ""Banks generally like three or four bedrooms because they're more re-sellable if you come under finance stress, so it was actually difficult to borrow a small amount of money,"" Mr Kerr said. While Mr Kerr is an architect, he believes a cheap build could be within reach for plenty of Australians. ""I think something like this — a similar size, similar design — would be appropriate for many singles or couples, and likewise could be used as an ancillary unit or a granny flat,"" he said. ""I think a lot of people get carried away, where they try to build something not just for now but for all the various possibilities of the future. ""You can't design and factor in every possibility you should focus on the now, or at least the immediate future.""

252,The Australian community who live like the 1970s never ended,house-and-home,"  Bodhi Farm and other countercultural communities live like the 1970s never ended It's just after sunset and someone has blown the conch shell to summon residents to the weekly Sunday community dinner. Painted by moonlight, silhouetted figures begin to appear in the door frames of houses and strolling up the gravel road. Soon we're sharing a meal — vegetarian — with around 20 others in a large, hand-built, hexagonal building that serves as the community centre. Later, as dishes are dutifully washed and dried, a guitar and mandolin are picked up and folk songs begin to reverberate around the room. Voices break into familiar harmonies as the words of Neil Young and Joni Mitchell resonate around the hall. You'd be forgiven for thinking this was a scene from the 1970s, save for the lyrics being read from a smart phone screen held by Michael Pawson, whose son and grandchildren are joining in the sing-along. How the world has changed. This is Bodhi Farm, an intentional community in northern NSW. And if it seems straight out of the '70s, that's because it is. The community started in 1977 with aspirations to share land in what long-term resident and community archivist Gai Longmuir terms ""voluntary simplicity"" — a ""thoughtful and reflective way to live collectively"" in harmony with the natural environment. It was also founded on an adoption of the five Buddhist precepts: do no harm, do not steal, do not lie, do not misuse sex and do not consume alcohol or drugs. The residents sometimes joke that they were ""farmers of enlightenment"". Communities like this were once dismissively labelled as ""hippy communes"", yet we are currently facing twin challenges of environmental destruction and unaffordable housing. Could these surviving countercultural communities hold important lessons? Bodhi Farm is not typical of Australia's '70s countercultural communities in its longevity (or its spiritual foundations). But neither is it the only one to flourish and endure. While utopian '70s communities were widely regarded as failures, they've gone on to inform and influence the design of modern eco-villages, the tiny house movement, urban intentional communities and myriad minor movements in between. Now, in 2019, Bodhi Farm residents have a handsome communal building where meals and meetings are regularly hosted. Decisions are made through a communal consensus process. The community produces its own power via a solar and micro-hydro system and is proudly off the grid. It has its own spring-fed water supply. The houses have been mostly hand-built with recycled materials, usually over a long period of time, and are set in a beautiful regenerated forest. And they tend to have cost hundreds, rather than hundreds of thousands, to build. Multiple generations live together, and the kids have free run of a beautiful rainforest ""backyard"". At first glance, Bodhi Farm's lifestyle seems idyllic. Its effort to escape from the housing market seems especially attractive with the OECD's dwelling-price-to-income ratio index for Australia recording a 78 per cent increase between 1980 and 2015. Many Australians who feel squeezed out of the current housing market are looking to cooperative models as a way of obtaining affordable housing. There is great interest in simpler, low-impact lifestyles as seen in the tiny house phenomenon, though it is fraught with red tape. The environmental costs of conventional urban housing construction are also becoming clearer. And contemporary eco-villages can sometimes be no less expensive than their urban counterparts. So, Bodhi Farm's eco-village-type qualities have a lot of appeal. But it was hard work for the community to get to this position. For one, what the young dreamers at Bodhi were doing in 1977 was not quite legal. Neighbouring Tuntable Falls intentional community residents recall that their application for multiple occupancy (or MO, as it is colloquially termed) hinged on a working toilet. Their innovative installation of a composting toilet swayed a weary government inspector in their favour. The land itself was, as Gai describes it, ""ravaged"". It was logged and had at some point been used to grow bananas. Where rainforest now stands, was once a barren hill, full of ""bladey grass"". ""It was very marginal land,"" says Gai. ""It was cheap."" While experiments in communal living blossomed in 1970s Australia, they were by no means mainstream. Often dismissed as drop-out hippies, communities like Bodhi Farm found their desires to live a different kind of life were not always understood or tolerated by locals. ""Have they told you about the baby stealing,"" quipped one Bodhi original resident, referring to one of the many rumours that were circulated about the community. Many locals thought their new and sometimes-naked neighbours were dirty and uneducated. It was far from the truth. University educated and widely travelled, they may not have been trained architects or gardeners, but they brought with them philosophies of community — many had returned from experiences in India — that were foreign to rural Australians, and they were determined for their buildings to enable the kind of society they wanted to create. ""When I first went travelling as a 21 year-old,"" says Gai, ""I vividly remember flying over what was then Portuguese Timor and looking down at what would have been the approaches to Dili."" The simple thatched houses amidst the bougainvillaea, replete with children running among the structures, resonated with her. ""I had a visceral sense of it being a pattern I really liked — the pattern of village and community,"" she says. ""I had done a long Buddhist meditation retreat, and that made me look for a spiritual community — not just an ordinary lefty [community]"", adds Michael, who joined Bodhi Farm in 1978 and is the current resident caretaker of the community garden (and a doting grandfather). With no electricity and no real houses, the community started out in tents, trailers, a converted bus, and then built more-robust dwellings when amenities and supplies were available — hence the recycled materials. Michael's own home resembles a castle. ""I wanted to have an interesting house because I wanted to have an interesting life,"" says Michael. What started out as a lean-to in 1978 (""We just put up four poles on a floor and a roof and didn't really have walls,"" he says) was added on when children began arriving. But when a large tree branch took out a corner of the house during roofing repairs, Michael spotted water damage. ""Timber's too tasty to termites,"" he says. And so, he decided to build out of cement. In the 1970s a group of determined women set out to put the theory of women's liberation into practice. Based on a design he sketched out, the building began to take shape. ""Brick by brick, barrow by barrow,"" was the way to go, says Michael, who built the house himself as he could afford materials. ""I didn't really have plans,"" he admits, ""I just sort of launched into it and problem-solved as I went along."" Building stopped when Michael suffered a ruptured aneurysm. By that time, the place needed lifting and restumping — a task Michael was no longer able to do himself. But ingenuity seems to be Michael's forte; he simply excavated underneath the structure and restumped it that way. ""I didn't quite finish it,"" says Michael of the house. Though he hopes to get back to it in the future, he is realistic about it: ""The arthritis is kicking in now"". The threat of building inspections weighed heavily on residents' minds. Not much was built to code in the early days and they relied on the goodwill of council inspectors to continue. Most of the early residents didn't have jobs. They pooled their money to buy materials for the community. Cars were shared and maintained by a self-taught mechanic. ""We were quite young,"" says Gai of the sparseness of Bodhi's early days. ""I think we were very undemanding of what life might serve us, and grateful for what we got."" It's a sentiment that, with 21st century hindsight, ""almost makes me want to cry"", she says. Then came the children. The challenges of a growing community were exhausting. Though the socio-economic conditions at the time made it possible to establish the settlements — through allowing some residents to remain on the dole — raising families was incredibly difficult. A commitment to extended forms of kinship often helped. The adage that ""it takes a village to raise a child"" was almost literally applied as kids roamed the community, looked after by whichever adult was present. People also began to go outside to find work to support their growing families, and facilities such as electricity and water. Relationships were strained, but the community endured. Gai treasures that sense of community. ""In our increasingly fragmented society, the bonding and continuity that we have been able to create for ourselves, the sense of place and mutual protection, is, for me, like a deep anchor to life,"" she says. The challenges facing Bodhi Farm today are a far cry from those faced in '77. They have safe, comfortable homes (""Don't forget to unlock the door on your way out"" is the motto here). And they even have wi-fi (how else to share the lyrics for a song written nearly 50 years ago?). Tiny houses aren't for everyone, but most people who live in them are positive about the experience. Bush trails have been tamed into level roads. It is quaint, it is comfortable and yet, its future is uncertain. The original founders — those who have stayed on — are ageing. This is no Shangri-La. At the monthly community meeting we attended, attracting new people was a top item on their talking board. The cost to join the community is well-below current market trends, though repairs and maintenance will be expected to be footed by new community members. But it's not an easy entry into the community. There is a two-year trying-out period to settle into Bodhi Farm. They are careful about who they welcome as a permanent resident. Someone will be needed to maintain the electricity grid, powered by the sun and creek flows. The system still needs maintenance, and a brilliant mind to upgrade its performance as technologies change. Climate change is on their minds as well. Shifting weather patterns are making the once-abundant creek-water supply more tenuous. No rain means no water. There are other challenges, such as ongoing needs for carpentry, mechanics and child care that the community must solve together. But they know from more than 40 years of living experience at Bodhi Farm, that change is inevitable, but not new. They will adapt.

253,Farmland prices remain firm despite dry times,house-and-home,"  Drought not denting NSW farmland values as buyers scout property with promise of rain and water Farmland values across drought-ravaged New South Wales are managing to remain strong as farmers search the state to buy property with guaranteed water supply and the promise of elusive rainfall. Despite dry seasonal conditions leaving paddocks bone-dry and dams empty, real estate agents were surprised the property market still remained strong, with farms being snapped up. Despite the central west town of Forbes suffering like so many others from the drought, real estate agent Ainslee Toole has never been busier. ""Most people would assume that it is hard to sell farms at the moment, but our sales are up 30 per cent for what we would normally sell at this time of year,"" Ms Toole said. ""The values for farms going on the market have actually increased from where they were three years ago, before the drought,"" she said. Ms Toole said there was a range of interest, including corporate buyers and those from northern and western NSW keen to move to properties closer to larger regional towns with better facilities and the potential for reliable irrigation when the drought breaks. ""While listings are down, what is going on the market is selling better than in a normal year,"" she said. ""Properties with underground water supplies are proving particularly popular and when a farm goes up for auction, most of them sell immediately or shortly after. ""Most vendors are achieving the asking price or very close to it, it is surprising how well the market has held up."" In northern New South Wales, properties with good water infrastructure were also proving particularly popular with buyers. Agent Daniel McCulloch from Tamworth said he was fielding a lot of inquiries for farmland, with the majority of interest from family farmers looking to expand their operations, as well as superannuation companies wanting to invest in land or those waiting to pick up a bargain. Subscribe to Rural RoundUp: Stories from rural and regional Australia, every Friday. ""A lot of the big-ticket items is rainfall and water, they have never been so sought after,"" Mr McCulloch said. ""When we are inspecting properties, the dams are dry so they're wanting to know if the property has got bores and if it has the capacity, depths and how long they've been in use. ""When the dams are full, people do not really pay too much attention to the bores,"" he said. Mr McCulloch said one upside to buying in a drought was purchasers can see farmland at its absolute worst. But there were also downsides. ""A general term we use is that you are seeing it nude, which is quite true because you are seeing every rock, every bone, every fence that's bad,"" he said. ""The disadvantage is that you can't compare how good or bad it is to another place, when it is bare like it is now, you can't pick out the good from the bad."" In the north-west of the state, agents describe the market as ""look but don't touch just yet"". While transactions were down by about 20 per cent, Narrabri-based agent Michael Guest said inquiries were still strong. ""Values are holding to slightly dearer, but it all hinges on rain,"" he said. ""There's inquiries for all types of property but people are waiting for a break in the season and people need an income to borrow money."" Drought, fires and major water issues had failed to dampen buyers' enthusiasm for agricultural land across the Hunter region. Enquiries had been steadily rolling in to property agents despite the raft of drought-related issues. Interest ranged from farmers wanting to expand, corporate investors and others keen for a lifestyle block — including those looking for hunting blocks. Scone agent Gavin Beard said most of these had been for small holdings, and said the region was not having the larger holdings that would suit the corporate world. ""Of the larger holdings sold off over the past few years, the Chinese have been a major player, buying mostly cattle properties in the upper Hunter,"" he said. ""Buyers that are showing an interest are more concerning wanting information on how much water is available and what the flow rate is for any bores on the properties."" Agent David Carter noticed farmers had adopted a conservative approach and were waiting for the drought to end and for a recovery period before considering their options to sell or to expand. ""That is unless they are forced out of agriculture through economic pressures rather than leaving at a more favourable time of their own choosing,"" Mr Carter said. ""This forms the basis of the ongoing realignment process underway in Australian agriculture with the necessary and continuing process of assimilating smaller farms into increasingly larger, more supposedly productive and more efficient businesses. ""There's also agriculture-finance experts suggesting today's funding discussions are very different to what they were six to 12 months ago, for two key reasons: banks' exposure to drought-impacted borrowers; and post the banking sector royal commission."" Frustrated and depleted from the foot and mouth disease outbreak and aftermath in the United Kingdom, Kevin and Gina Feakins uprooted their wool and horse breeding enterprise half way across the world to the NSW northern tablelands. Months of planning and due diligence, scouting locations right up the eastern seaboard, led them to Glen Innes, ironically because it never seemed to be affected by drought. ""We made several survey trips and every time we would come through there it always looked extremely well,"" Kevin Feakins said. ""The area around Glen Innes was considered one of the safest in NSW, as far as rainfall and grass growth was concerned, and it is stressful to see the way it's going. It's all on fire."" At its peak, the Feakins' Glen Innes property was running more than 2,000 sheep, as well as a few hundred cows and horses. But after 11 years, and staring down the barrel of one of the worst droughts in the state's history, they decided to pack up and move again. ""By Christmas last year, we'd had to kill a lot of our animals off because we didn't have the feed,"" Mr Feakins said. ""The stress and the hardship of facing that drought, that really came home to us."" Down to their beloved horses, 800 sheep and a few cows, the Feakins began again, 1,400km south in Warrnambool, Victoria. ""We don't have roots in Australia — for us, it's easy to just pick up and go,"" Ms Feakins said. ""If we'd stayed in Glen Innes, we'd have no animals. We moved for the right reasons and we think at the right time."" Their neighbours back in Glen Innes thought the decision was too hasty, that the drought was temporary, and before long everything would come right again. But, 12 months on, the couple watched in horror as flames engulfed much of the northern tablelands. ""We just feel extremely sorry for the farmers back in Glen Innes, they're going through something they've never been through before and it's extremely distressing to see them struggling to survive,"" Mr Feakins said. ""And while we are on a lot less acreage, it is is much more productive because you're getting the rain and you're growing the grass and the feed all the time."" On the NSW mid north coast, dry conditions are often referred to as a ""green drought"". Despite low rainfall, to the uninitiated, travelling through there is usually a green belying the lack of water. This time, in many areas the terrain is stark and brown because of little or no rain, which has primary producers reeling like their counterparts across the state. The region traditionally has been the destination for farmers from other parts of the state looking to buy property as a safeguard for their primary properties over the range. Many of the farms in recent times have been bought by couples soon to retire, financing them by selling their larger holdings elsewhere in the state and moving to a more reliable agriculture region. Port Macquarie Hastings Rural Sales principal Peter Richards has been handling property sales across the region for 22 years. ""There is a heap of big money coming through. It is cash. They didn't need the banks,"" he said. ""It is largely people who managed to sell their holdings from out west. ""I've never known so many people wanting land for agistment. ""They are desperate both locally and from elsewhere because they need feed, predominantly for beef."" A blueberry farm, an island property on the Murray River, landmark homesteads, dairy farms, traditional grazing and broadacre enterprises are among the properties on the market in the New South Wales Riverina at the moment. CBRE agribusiness director Tim Corcoran, based at Wagga Wagga in southern NSW, said high rainfall was currently driving property sales, with farmers from western and northern NSW keen to secure mixed farming land in the south-east of the state. ""In the last couple of years, we are seeing a shift to more people seeking out water security — whether that be high-security water, ground water or higher rainfall — just to get through these tougher times with less heartache,"" Mr Corcoran said. ""Ideally, the best scenario is for them to keep both properties and not sell their western or northern country."" Mr Corcoran said it was not surprising farmland values were hitting record highs in the Riverina during this dry period as high commodity prices were helping hold the market up. ""A big motivation for vendors — particularly for those who are retiring or succession planning — is to sell, as it is unknown how long this market spike is going to last,"" he said. Mr Corcoran said mixed-farming properties were most in demand in the Riverina because they enabled farmers to diversify their operation and split the risk. He said top dollar was being for farmland around Wagga Wagga that was close to services including schools. He said south of Wagga Wagga, land around Holbrook was in demand for its higher average annual rainfall — 600 millimetres — and its location to major service centres Wagga Wagga and Albury. Properties at Tumut and Tumbarumba were also being sought for their more reliable rainfall. Mr Corcoran said most farmland in the Riverina was being bought by large local families that were expanding their enterprise to accommodate another generation. He said prices per acre had lifted in the past 12 months, cropping country at Ardlethan — where annual rainfall was about 450 millimetres — were making up to $1,850/acre now, whereas last year, it was more around $1,550/acre. He said tightly held mixed farming land at Junee was making $4,000/acre, and grazing country at Holbrook was making upwards of $4,500/acre. ""Vendors definitely aren't complaining about the money they get for their country at the moment and they are often achieving above expectation,"" Mr Corcoran said. However, he expected property prices could plateau in the new year if the drought continued across the state. ""I expect there could be more farms hit the market and it will be a supply-and-demand situation for price,"" he said. In the southern Riverina region, where the general security-water allocation for irrigation farmers was zero per cent, a number of dairy farms were sold this year. Elders real estate manager for the Riverina Matt Horne, based in Deniliquin, said several dairy farms had been sold to mixed farmers and croppers for fodder and beef production. However, he said there had been a change in recent weeks, with more inquiries for dairy farms to remain as dairy operations. ""We have just sold a dairy farm to farmers from Warrnambool in Victoria, who are moving north to the Riverina to milk a Jersey herd,"" Mr Horne said. ""If we can get back to reasonable seasons, there will be some more dairy-sale activity through the Riverina and northern Victoria."" Mr Horne said broadscale cropping, pastoral country and irrigation country supported by bore water were currently the most sought-after properties at the moment. He said high prices being paid for wool, lambs and goats had brought a wave of buyers from Wilcannia and Broken Hill to invest in southern farmland around Bunnaloo, Wakool and Deniliquin. ""They are looking for properties to run younger stock on, which have bore-water irrigation,"" Mr Horne said. Mr Horne said despite the dry conditions, property prices were holding up well, and this year was a better selling season than 2018. ""Over the last four or five years, it would it would be safe to say that land prices have doubled in some areas of the Riverina, with strong commodity prices and low interest rates having a big hand in that,"" he said. He said irrigation country around Deniliquin and Finley was selling for about $2,000 an acre and pastoral country was selling for $300 an acre. ""Whether it is going to plateau off in time is anyone's guess, but while there is an appetite for aggregating land, I think that it will continue to trend upward,"" Mr Horne said. ""No matter what part of Australia you go into at the moment there are less listings on the market, but come autumn around sowing time, I think you will see quite a number of properties listed."" Rather than buying the farm next door, more and more farmers are looking to spread their risk by looking further afield. Farmers on the NSW south coast are buying properties in the Snowy Mountains with more reliable rainfall, to manage the ongoing drought. Dairy farmer Greg Heffernan is based at Candelo in the Bega Valley, and he and his family recently bought a farm 250 kilometres away in Khancoban on the NSW and Victorian border. He said farming in different climatic zones had given them more options to manage their livestock. ""You could buy the farm next door, but when you are in drought, next door is in drought,"" Mr Heffernan said. ""It's worth looking a little bit further outside the valley, I think it is a better risk — they could be having a good season while you're having a tough season. ""Khancoban is in a pretty good rainfall area, a lot of the paddocks are dam fed and the troughs are gravity fed from the dams, so we don't have to worry about things breaking while we aren't there."" Toad Heffernan works in partnership with Greg and he said after leasing the property in Khancoban for eight years, buying the farm was an easy decision. ""Right now, there's not a blade of grass on our dairy farm, we're trucking in every ounce of feed,"" Toad Heffernan said. ""Whereas, over at Khancoban you're guaranteed a winter, it gives us the opportunity to lock feed away and relieve pressure on this farm. ""We bought 400 acres with two houses on it for $750,000 and we also lease a 600-acre bush block next door, and I reckon it is the best decision we have made in a long time.""

254,Why hemp is gaining a reputation as a plant that can help make a home,house-and-home," ABC Rural Hempcrete — the eco-friendly material breathing new life into Australian homes Tasmanian builder Andrias McMahon has been working with natural building techniques for 15 years and has a couple of hempcrete builds under his belt. ""The process of structurally making a building with hempcrete is not very far from a conventional building,"" Mr McMahon said. ""You need to give it a minimum of six weeks to cure — that's the primary cure. ""The overall curing process takes about 50 years to complete; the process is called carbonation as the material takes up atmospheric carbon, that's the lime, effectively returning to its mineral state, that's limestone."" In the past three years more than 100 eco-friendly homes in Australia have been built using hempcrete, with the use of the material particularly prevalent in Western Australia, New South Wales, and Victoria. Hempcrete, made from mixing woody hemp fibre (from inside the hemp stalk), with lime and water, is then pushed into timber frames by hand to build an insulating wall. Hempcrete's unique credentials attracted Sean Manners to the material for his new home at Westbury, in northern Tasmania. He spent six years researching alternative building methods. Subscribe to Rural RoundUp: Stories from rural and regional Australia, every Friday. ""It's a lightweight building product, so it's one building product to complete the whole wall,"" he said. ""Progressively over time, this house will take in more and more carbon. ""It will negate any carbon emissions we've had to make — for the concrete for instance; it'll be a carbon-negative house."" Mr Manners said the cost of the build per square metre was roughly equivalent to the cost of a double-brick house, ""if you look at the cost over 10 years"". ""[With] the savings in heating and health [and] the fact that you don't get any condensation [and] no mould, the cost would equal out,"" he said. Building with hempcrete is fairly repetitive, labour-intensive work, so Mr Manners enlisted volunteers to help with tamping the mixture in place. ""Some have come for one day and I've never seen them again,"" he laughs. ""Then others, like Simon over there, come every day, so it's a wonderful thing."" In building an eco-friendly home, you want to leave the smallest carbon footprint possible. Shipping hempcrete across the country, or even from Europe, does not make much financial sense either. A standard house uses a 6-metre shipping container's worth of hempcrete with the additional cost of shipping it from Sydney to Tasmania at approximately $6,000. Tasmania produces nearly two thirds of the national commercial hemp crop, with the bulk of it grown for the food market. President of the Hemp Association of Tasmania Tim Schmidt believes there is scope to sell it for building materials too. ""It's not terribly economic to be importing [hempcrete] from Europe, which has been happening,"" he said. ""There is an enormous opportunity here for the raw material that's being ploughed into the paddocks to be processed and sold locally for a much cheaper price."" Next year the association will look at the feasibility of setting up a local processing plant, with a Western Australian firm also eyeing off a new hemp decorticator. In the meantime, Mr McMahon anticipates hempcrete homes on the Apple Isle will take off. ""I've got a number of people that are contacting me with fairly regular frequency,"" he said. ""I know of six projects that are set to proceed in the next 18 months, so it seems to be rapidly growing the demand.""

255,Your treechange could put native wildlife at risk. Here's how to be part of the solution,house-and-home,"  Housing developments are putting Australia's native wildlife at risk. Here's how to be part of the solution You've saved the money, signed off on the plans, packed your things. You're moving to your own piece of land outside the city, and you think you've planned for everything. If you're like many Australians, however, it's likely you've overlooked one important consideration: wildlife. Namely, your new home's impact on it. Here's how you can better design your homes and gardens to entice native critters to return. ""I don't think it's widely thought about or known how massive the impact of urban development is on biodiversity in this country,"" says RMIT sustainability and urban planning expert Sarah Bekessy. The good news? There are plenty of steps people can take to do something about the problem. Don Driscoll, a sustainability expert at Deakin University, agrees there's a ""lack of awareness"" of how housing construction in urban fringes and country areas affects wildlife. ""There's a whole bunch of native species that can't live in that sort of environment,"" he says. ""Some species just don't like a lot of human activity nearby. It might be noise. It might be other vehicles nearby."" Native species can also suffer as a result of domesticated animals moving into the landscape — like cats, dogs and horses. Professor Driscoll says feral animals such as foxes, deer and pigs — a major threat to native animals — will also ""move though landscapes on roads that are being built by people"". Invasive plants are also given new access to once undisturbed areas when roads are built. Professor Driscoll says when homes are built in existing forested areas, it has an ""enormous impact"" on native species. ""Buying a block that hasn't been cleared and putting your new house on it is definitely going to drive some of these species out of the landscape,"" he says. ""It's a big problem."" There are more than 500 animals on Australia's threatened species list, but scientists warn only a handful of them are getting the funding they need to survive. Professor Bekessy says urban fringe development is also an issue, as those areas are often ""co-located with a lot of biodiversity"". ""Some of our most critically endangered ecosystems are currently being cleared for housing developments in these urban fringe places,"" she says. ""So, for example, in the outskirts of Melbourne we have the critically endangered volcanic plains grasslands — probably Australia's most endangered ecosystem, absolutely loaded up with threatened species — and we're clearing massive amounts of it for developments at the moment."" She says the situation is similar in the outskirts of other Australian cities, too. ""The Cumberland Plains [in New South Wales] is currently being cleared at really quite high rates for housing,"" she says. ""The same in Perth; the Swan Coastal Plain is known as one of the world's biodiversity hotspots and enormous amounts of it are being cleared for housing."" She says one reason for that is the same land conditions that appeal to wildlife — ""flat, fertile, productive and wet"" — also appeal to developers. As our cities expand further and further out, we lose bushland — and a ""whole lot of species"", she says. ""Either species are now extinct from those areas or they're very, very threatened,"" Professor Bekessy says. For example, the grassland earless dragon has not been seen in Victoria since 1969, and the eastern barred bandicoot is locally extinct from the Melbourne to Geelong region, she says. Where home building does occur, Professor Driscoll would prefer it to be high-density, which ""leaves more area available that's less disturbed for Australian native species"". ""Everywhere where population is expanding, it's going to be better to try to cram [houses] into the smallest possible space so that you spare all the other land around, so that other species have space to live in,"" he says. ""Low-density housing areas are one of the worst ways to manage biodiversity. ""So, although it gets people out into the environment and they can enjoy their one or two-hectare block, it also has one of the biggest impacts on native species."" Professor Bekessy says it is ""absolutely not necessary"" that wildlife takes a hit as our population grows. ""We can be doing a hell of a lot better at protecting biodiversity,"" she says. Building a new home responsibly is ""absolutely"" achievable — ""but it takes a bit of work"", she says. ""In the first instance you've got to know what the values on your property already are,"" Professor Bekessy says. ""People often don't really understand the value of the biodiversity on the land they're purchasing and don't necessarily have the capability to manage it properly."" It's not a job you need to tackle alone. Locals councils, land care and parks groups, and catchment management authorities can all provide help. There are also organisations, for example Trust for Nature, that can help people survey their property to determine what kind of wildlife or vegetation there is, and develop management plans for them. Professor Driscoll's advice to someone making a treechange is to not perpetuate an existing ecological issue. Should you sacrifice lifestyle to buy? Or just rent forever? Are there other ways? ""They should actively avoid areas that are being newly opened. If they have to clear forest to build their house, they're part of the problem not the solution,"" he says. ""If they can move into pre-existing areas then they're probably not making it worse, and if they alter their land management to manage weeds and feral pests, and constrain dogs and cats, then perhaps they're going to improve it over what it's been like in the past."" Professor Bekessy agrees. ""Don't buy a property in a place that's been cleared for housing. That's going to send the loudest signal to developers,"" Professor Bekessy says. She says it's far preferable to buy land that's already cleared, for example ""fairly degraded, agricultural land"", then work to revegetate it. A homeowner can even come out on top and ""bring things back"". Life Matters is here to help you get a handle on all the important stuff: love, sex, health, fitness, parenting, career, finances and family. ""I think it's entirely possible to have developments that conduct a net positive for biodiversity on the site,"" Professor Bekessy says. ""You can be providing habitats for animals. You can have bird-friendly glass to prevent bird collisions and bird strikes. Or you can have bat boxes and bird boxes incorporated in your actual construction. ""Your garden itself can be a haven for biodiversity. ""And the really exciting part of that kind of advice is that it ... creates places you want to live in.""

256,"Tracey has just $6 left after paying rent and bills, but says she is one of the 'lucky' ones",house-and-home,"  Adelaide overtakes Sydney as the second-most-unaffordable capital city for renters in Australia Adelaide is now the second-most-unaffordable capital city in the country for rental affordability, with experts pinning the blame on slow income growth and cost of living. The latest report into rental markets across the country has shown Hobart is still the most unaffordable capital city to live in, however, Adelaide has leapfrogged Sydney into second spot on the national Rental Affordability Index (RAI). Brisbane was next on the list in fourth position, followed by Melbourne, the ACT and Perth. ""In Hobart, we've got a wicked combination where incomes are stagnant but rents have been rising at 10 per cent a year for the last three years,"" National Shelter executive officer Adrian Pisarski said. ""Adelaide becoming the second-most-unaffordable place to rent is largely due to rising rents and incomes not rising in the same way they've been rising in Sydney."" Regional South Australia is still the most affordable place to rent in the state, but even there, someone on the Newstart allowance cannot afford to lease a single property. The figures show there is not one place in Australia where a Newstart recipient can rent easily. ""Whilst we've got an average score of rental affordability across the nation, the average is masking a deteriorating situation for low-income households. On average, Sydney's improved slightly,"" Mr Pisarski said. ""Perth has improved slightly. Brisbane has improved slightly, where Adelaide and Hobart have deteriorated."" The Rental Affordability Index (RAI) is an indicator of the price of rents nationwide relative to household incomes based on new rental agreements. According to National Shelter — which released the report — there is also a drop-off in home ownership among people entering retirement. Women over 50 are one of the highest groups at risk. Mr Pisarski is calling on the Federal Government to address the issue and provide more funding for low-income housing. ""We really think there needs to be a national housing strategy to look at investing in affordable housing,"" he said. ""There really has been a neglect of housing policy in Australia going back 20 years and it'll take us quite a long time to rectify it. ""Even a couple who are both on the pension but earning a little bit of extra money, as many pensioners do, will struggle to find anywhere to rent affordably in Australia. ""This has really serious implications for our retirement incomes policy going forward."" Social services advocates say some low-income earners and welfare recipients are being forced to choose between rent and necessities like food or medication. Tracey Smallwood says she has $6 per fortnight to live on after she has paid for her rent in a share house, utility bills and food. She has finished her Masters in Forensic Psychology and has worked as a youth worker. Ms Smallwood now volunteers as the national advocacy coordinator at Australia's Unemployed Workers Union (AUWU), where she has also worked on the hotline. ""I'm lucky. I live with a good friend of mine whose sister and brother-in-law own the property,"" she said. ""The shopping centre is down the road and I live across the road from the train station. I'm lucky compared to a lot of other people. ""Being on the hotline listening to people, thinking I'm having a rough day, and then realising there are people out there that are dying. ""People that have to work out if they buy food this fortnight, they can't afford their medications. And it's a reality."" Ms Smallwood said while she was one of the lucky ones, others were being pushed into homelessness because they could not pay their rent. ""It's just to the point where people can't afford to live,"" she said. ""If they afford the rent they can't afford electricity, they can't afford food, they can't afford medication and it's also pushing them into homelessness. She said she believed the Federal Government needed to do more. ""Speaking to people on the street, I was asking this young man how many pay cheques are you away from being homeless and he's working full-time, but still not getting that much money, and he said being realistic he's two pay cheques away,"" she said. ""Youth homelessness is the highest it has ever been and the Government just throws money at different programs, they need the people on the ground to work those programs and do them properly."" When the RAI was launched five years ago it was unaffordable to live in Adelaide's inner city, but since then the problem has moved from those areas through to the north, south and into the hills area. All of those areas are now rated as unaffordable, something that did not shock Ross Womersley, the chief executive of the South Australian Council of Social Services (SACOSS). ""I imagine most of South Australia is surprised because we generally tend to think of Adelaide being a very affordable place to live,"" he said. ""We imagine that the cost of living, particularly the cost of housing is cheap, relative to those other eastern seaboard cities. ""And so as a result, we sometimes imagine that South Australia must be a really cheap place to be. The reality, as these figures illustrate, is that it's simply not."" He said even though regional South Australia is ranked as the most affordable place to live, low-income earners looking to move from the city might not find it to be a cheaper option. For renting to become a truly viable, long-term alternative to home ownership, greater rental affordability and security is needed, writes senior research fellow Emma Power. ""We do know that some people leave metropolitan Adelaide deliberately thinking they'll be able to get cheaper housing in the regions,"" he said. ""Even if they're lucky enough to get cheaper housing, the opportunities for them to find work may actually be substantially less."" SACOSS has joined National Shelter in calling for governments at a state and federal level to make big investments in more affordable housing as well as raising Newstart and the pension. ""The great majority of homeless people are people who are living in their car, sometimes with their families in the car, living on other people's couches,"" Mr Womersley said. ""Sometimes people [are] in other people's garages, [in] other people's caravans, hoping that they might be able to find their way into something more permanent, more secure and safe. ""It's just a fundamental basic human right and we should be driving to make sure that everybody has access.""

257,"Canberra's 'dodgy' developer ban chases 'the wrong end of the food chain', developers say",house-and-home,"  Canberra developers say they aren't to blame for bad buildings, as Government plans 'dodgy developer' ban Canberra's developers say a crackdown on company directors wrongly targets the top of the food chain. But the responsible minister has hit back, saying ""the fish rots from the head"" and the Government will push on with its plan to ban ""dodgy"" developers. Some of Canberra's largest property developers have suggested the ACT Government should stop hassling head office and get out on the construction site if it wants to improve building quality. The criticism has come in response to proposed laws designed to tackle ""dodgy"" property developers escaping accountability for poor quality work. Some of the more contentious proposals include a yet-to-be-developed licensing scheme for property developers — the first of its kind in Australia — and laws to make directors liable for penalties and rectification orders, even if their company goes under. The crackdown has left many of Canberra's property developers perplexed and frustrated. Barry Morris, the director of the Morris Property Group, argued developers were not to blame for problems around building quality. ""The ACT Government is going the wrong way on the food chain,"" he said. ""They're going up the food chain to developers, but, in fact, I think they should be going the other direction down the food chain to consultants, designers, all the engineering disciplines."" Mr Morris argued the current approach misunderstood how construction jobs worked, and the relationships held between developers, builders and subcontractors. He said it was unfair to require developers to carry the risk and be held accountable for the actions of other licensed professionals. ""We don't have an employee-employer relationship,"" he said. ""We have an arm's-length, third-party contract with a builder, and the builder then has arm's-length contracts with designers and subcontractors. ""So I don't agree that it's as simple as saying: 'Because the developer is ultimately the person sitting on top of that pile that he has the knowledge or the expertise to be responsible'."" A local inquiry into building quality has heard from the industry that some builders and subcontractors feel impossible time and financial pressures were placed on them to complete work, and that they sometimes cut corners as a consequence. But a spokeswoman for development company Doma Group said that was not realistic. ""The notion that a developer can force a builder to cut corners to save costs is foreign to us, as the builders we use would rightly reject any such pressure,"" she said. ""The call to license developers and make them responsible for building defects to address building quality issues is completely misdirected and disingenuous."" Mr Morris, who was recently taken to court by the ACT Government over a property in Kingston, also expressed his disdain for the Government's use of the term ""dodgy developers"". The label has appeared in a number of official government campaigns around the new laws, including the press release announcing the licensing scheme. ""We take offence that the minister would be calling them 'dodgy developers',"" he said. ""The inference is that every developer is dodgy."" The ACT Government is expected to continue its push to legislate for further financial accountability for property developers this week. Building Quality Minister Gordon Ramsay said they aimed to hold all levels of the construction industry accountable, from the top down. ""Using the old adage 'the fish rots from the head down', we want to look at the entire process and not just some parts of it,"" he said. ""There are important roles that property developers play in ensuring the quality of building that we have."" Mr Ramsay rejected suggestions the new regulations might drive high-quality, established developers out of the ACT due to increased risk and over-regulation. ""For developers who are doing the right thing, they've got nothing to fear,"" he said. ""For people who are operating transparently, ethically, making sure that there aren't inappropriate time pressures or financial pressures on builders or others, then there is nothing for them to fear."" The licensing scheme is still in its infancy, with consultation planned to work out exactly how it will be implemented over the next twelve months.

258,analysis: Decluttering guru Marie Kondo wants to sell you good vibrations,house-and-home,"  Decluttering guru Marie Kondo wants to sell you good vibrations You might remember how Gwyneth Paltrow's health and well-being website Goop was selling ""medical"" products with no proven measurable health benefits. Decluttering expert Marie Kondo may be going down the same path. Kondo now has a tuning fork and rose quartz crystal for sale in her online shop for US$75 (around $110): ""Striking the fork against the crystal creates pure tones that help to restore a sense of balance […] The rose quartz crystal in this set is associated with purification, connection and comfort."" Kondo's decluttering approach draws on her personal blend of Zen Buddhist and traditional Shinto beliefs. Traditional Buddhism sees sound and vibration as building blocks of the universe. Buddhists believe chanting creates a healing resonance and reverberation that benefits the universe. Much media discussion has focused on how Kondo's decluttering seems at odds with running an online store. But her tuning fork does appear to reflect the philosophy that underpins her decluttering. Her tuning fork is also part of a long history of humans using vibrations to understand our world, to treat illness, and to improve well-being. So why are we so fascinated with using vibrations to heal? And is there any evidence to back it? Human beings have always been instinctively drawn to vibration. It may go back to our experiences in the womb, where we live daily with our mother's heartbeat and vibrating breathing. The idea of the music of the spheres — that the universe produces vibrations that are harmonic and hold everything in place — goes back to the ancient Greek thinker Pythagoras. But it wasn't until the 1960s that English osteopath Sir Peter Guy Manners developed tuning fork therapy. He believed sound vibrations could provide comfort and healing for a range of conditions: chronic inflammation, arthritis, and even bacterial infections. This was based on ideas that were common to Western alternative practitioners and traditional Eastern practitioners. These practitioners argued all created things, including the body, are a network of living energies. These energies could be disrupted and restored by different interventions into this force field. You will find this idea today in acupuncture (qi), Ayurvedic medicine (prana), and reiki energy healing. Certainly, energy is real and used in modern medicine all the time. Lasers, electricity and radiation are all forms of energy. Magnetic energy and sound vibrations also appear to have some therapeutic properties. However, we don't fully understand these yet. The existence of other forms of physical energy like qi or prana or ""biofield energy"" is unverifiable. We can't prove scientifically they exist, even though many schools of healing believe in them and build their practice around them. Kondo's tuning fork is tuned to a frequency of 4,096 hertz. The idea is that you strike the crystal with the fork, and this sets up a reverberation of 4,096Hz in the crystal. Quartz is an unusual mineral. It acts like a tuning fork all by itself: it transforms energy applied to it into mechanical energy, which keeps the quartz vibrating almost indefinitely. This is very useful if you are making watches. A watch battery can run a charge through the quartz and keep it oscillating. This is why quartz movement watches are incredibly accurate until the quartz begins to deteriorate. The Kondo tuning fork also comes with a choice of three types of quartz: clear, rose, and smoky quartz, each with different apparent effects. However, there's no scientific evidence to suggest crystals are associated with anything other than different structures and colours. There is also no scientific evidence connecting particular quartz frequencies with health or psychological effects. Crystals can't really do anything by themselves except refract light. But if you believe strongly enough that crystals are healing you — or are bringing you confidence and joy or peace or stability — then there may be a placebo effect. If you culturally associate healing or peace with a particular type of crystal, then it may help you — but again only because you believe in it. Crystals are also comparatively harmless. With the industrial revolution, more doctors in the United Kingdom and Europe began to integrate electricity — known then as ""medical galvanism"" — into their treatments. This included using electricity to stimulate wasted muscles, which actually works, as does shocking a stopped heart back into action. So it's not surprising doctors also tried to use vibration as a therapy. In the late 19th century, it's alleged doctors used vibrators to treat women with ""hysteria"". However, this may be a myth, and a salacious one at that. There's no real evidence to suggest this was normal practice, or even experimental practice. Today, vibrators have moved into the sexual entertainment industry (and the home). But ""massage devices"" are still sold by mainstream retailers. Then there's the long history of why your hairdresser gives you a scalp massage while shampooing and conditioning. At the beginning of the 20th century, Australian hair salons used very popular vibrating devices to provide customers with ""vibro-massage"". This was believed to keep away grey hair and stop hair loss. Vibrating pads and belts were also popular for decades because they promised easy weight loss with no effort. However, it's not possible to lose weight unless you are actually doing the moving, rather than the machine — that's what burns the kilojoules. This hasn't stopped ""fitness"" vibrating devices and belts still being marketed enthusiastically today. Vibration belts were once thought to help you lose weight, and are still marketed today for a variety of uses. There's also the idea about vibrating your whole body to lose weight at the gym. But again this hasn't been fully tested and verified. As you read about these products, it's possible to see the same appeal to unverifiable energies. These can't be proven to exist. But this also means they cannot be proven not to exist. Practitioners of this so-called ""energy medicine"" like to appeal to quantum theory to explain and legitimise their therapies. The idea of ""quantum healing"" is that electrical and electromagnetic activity takes place at a subatomic and molecular level to bring about healing in individual cells in the body. We have no equipment specialised enough to detect these changes in individual cells in the human body, or to measure it over time. So it can't be proven. It also can't be distinguished from the placebo effect. We also need to remember there's a difference between energy and vibrations we can't perceive naturally (such as from oscillating crystals), and those we can perceive. Most people can tolerate or even enjoy a small amount of vibration, but too much can induce discomfort, nausea, or even injury. Ultimately, if you want to buy Marie Kondo's crystals and tuning forks, feel free, but buyer beware. Or you can choose to use healing techniques that have been shown to make a real difference in people's health at a much lower cost. Some of these, like walking and singing, are free.

259,Bren watched as her home burned down. She says it changed her life – for the better,house-and-home,"  Tragedy for children's book author Bren MacDibble sparked a complete life change – for the better When award-winning children's book author Bren MacDibble watched her Melbourne home burn three years ago, she could never have known how much her life would change — for the better. An electrical fault in an air conditioner caused the house fire, but after recovering from the shock of their loss, Bren and her husband Ken MacDibble began to relish the sense of freedom they felt with no possessions. ""We had a fire on New Year's Eve in 2015,"" Bren said. ""That was pretty horrendous — half the house burnt out and the other half was soot and water. ""But when you don't own very much it's a lot easier to pack it all up and say 'let's try something new'. ""When you have a catastrophe like that you get disenfranchised from your possessions — you realise they're not that important. What's important is that everybody's alive."" The couple were at a crossroads. Ken had taken a redundancy prior to the fire, Bren's career as a writer was taking flight and they thought: ""Why not take the chance to hit the road and travel indefinitely?"" With their newfound freedom Bren and Ken swapped conventional Melbourne life in suburbia for ""van life"" on the road with their dog, Basil. They set off travelling the country with Bren sharing her time between writing, relaxing and traveling. Along the way, when they were at Darwin in June last year, Bren received news her children's novel How to Bee had won a swag of awards, including the Children's Book Council of Australia's Book of the Year for young readers. But then, like the tumultuous times of Bren's fictional characters, life threw the couple a curve ball. As they toured the Northern Territory Ken had a motorbike accident at Mataranka, near Katherine, and shattered his leg, his arm and broke his neck. ""It's really, really scary to think that it could have all just changed like that,"" Bren said. ""I mean, you get a house fire and you realise how fragile everything is around you, and then that happens and you realise how fragile your life is as well. ""I mean, people die suddenly and unexpectedly all the time, so yes it's a bit of a wake up call."" After ten long months of operations and recovery in Melbourne the couple were intent to keep traveling, but also to look for a small place to settle down. Bren and Ken were about to set off again when they received more good news. Bren's latest novel, The Dog Runner, had won this year's NZ Book Awards for Children and Young Adults' prize for junior fiction, and had been nominated for the Carnegie Medal in the United Kingdom. As Ken's health improved they found themselves falling in love with the west coast of Australia. When they reached Kalbarri in WA's Midwest they knew they had found a new home. ""We really liked the look of Kalbarri, and the little town atmosphere, and how it's all really compact and right opposite the water,"" Bren said. ""There's great views and the national park's on your doorstep."" The couple have since bought holiday accommodation in Kalbarri to run as a business and plan to settle in the town next year after finishing their travels and packing up their life in Melbourne. No doubt Bren will use the tranquillity and slower pace of life in the Kalbarri to dream up her next children's book adventure.

260,"$5,000 to force someone into bankruptcy? Try $50k, say financial counsellors",house-and-home,"  Australian banks change rules around selling debt to collectors Australia's banks say they are making major changes to the way debt can be sold to debt collection agencies, after ""very disturbing"" reports of poor practices in the industry. In August this year, the ABC revealed debt collection company Lion Finance was suing hundreds of people for bankruptcy to recover debts. Debt collectors can legally sue to recover debts as little as $5,000, but consumer advocates were alarmed the tactic meant people were being dragged through the courts and risked losing their homes over small debts. Now the Australian Banking Association (ABA) has launched a ""major step up in safeguards"", which it said would protect vulnerable customers. ABA CEO Anna Bligh said the changes were designed to make poor practices ""a thing of the past"". ""There have been some publicly aired stories and others that consumer advocates have brought to our attention that are very disturbing,"" Ms Bligh said. ""Obviously, people that owe debts have an obligation to pay those back but it's important companies — whether they're banks or other companies — treat those people fairly, give them a reasonable chance to pay back their debt and take action that is appropriate to the size of the debt."" Under the new guidelines, banks will be required to proactively help customers find solutions before a debt is sold, such as restructuring, consolidation and hardship support. If a bank sells a debt, the debt collector cannot move to forced bankruptcy without the permission of the bank. Banks will no longer sell debts if a customer has an ongoing vulnerability and they cannot sell debt that is being disputed by a customer. There will also be regular audits of all contracted debt collectors to ensure they meet the new guidelines. Northern Territory parliamentarian Jeff Collins, who is also a lawyer, has been vocal in his calls for change to the debt collection industry. Mr Collins defaulted on a credit card several years ago, and the balance of $5,950 was sold to debt collector Lion Finance. Mr Collins was sued for bankruptcy by Lion Finance in 2017, after a dispute over an administrative change to a court-ordered instalment plan to pay off the debt. ""[It was] incredibly stressful,"" he said. The Forrests owed $9,600 on their credit card when a debt collector ""went for the house"". Consumer advocates said the case highlighted an alarming trend towards forced bankruptcies in Australia. ""You usually get into that situation with a fair amount of stress anyway, that's what leads you to that situation. ""In my case, there were various things going on in my life and … this just adds a completely new layer to that process."" Since he spoke publicly, Mr Collins said he had been contacted by people across Australia sharing their own stories. ""The common thread was that they had a dispute but they never felt that they were able to properly have that heard,"" he said. ""So a consultation process would certainly assist."" He had been hoping for swift changes, and said he was pleased banks would be forced to be proactive with helping customers before debts were sold. ""It's an area of consumer credit that really needs some review, just given the number of people who fall into those sorts of situations, and not by design,"" he said. ""Various things happen and people find themselves in those circumstances and nobody wants to be made bankrupt, nobody wants to go through that process, none of them want to get dragged to court."" Fiona Guthrie from Financial Counselling Australia, which consulted on the guidelines, said the new banking policy included important protections. ""This was a really urgent problem so we are really pleased to see these guidelines because they're addressing really shoddy, unfair and unethical debt collection,"" Ms Guthrie said. ""This is the first time that the industry has had a set of guidelines along these lines and it's important because these guidelines are going to address some unfair and unethical debt collection practices."" The ABA has also joined with consumer groups to ask the Government to review the $5,000 threshold for forced bankruptcy. ""The issue of threshold is one for the Government,"" FCA's Ms Guthrie said. ""One of the things we're really pleased about is that the banking industry and the community sector have called on the Government to hold a review into this woefully low $5,000 current threshold for bankruptcy. ""Five thousand dollars to force someone into bankruptcy is just ridiculous. ""Our view is in light of today's credit, it should be $50,000."" Alan Harries from the Australian Collectors and Debt Buyers Association said the new guidelines were a reflection of current practices between the banks and the debt buyers. ""I don't think either parties would be surprised by anything that's contained in the guidance,"" he said. He said the system had been ""evolving"" for some time and banks were already taking greater responsibility for the debts they sold. ""It's in quite a number of the debt sales agreements and has been for a while now, so I see that just as ratification of existing practise."" In a statement, Lion Finance's parent company Collection House Limited said the debt collectors had increased the threshold for initiating forced bankruptcy proceedings to $20,000, from October this year. ""This threshold is well above the regulatory threshold of $5,000 and will significantly reduce the number of bankruptcy claims taken by Lion Finance,"" it said. The company said it had also implemented additional approval requirements ""so that no customer or customer who has instructed a financial counsellor will face a petition of bankruptcy from Lion Finance"".

261,'Unethical and illegal': Estate agency's photos of Sydney flat look nothing like the real thing,house-and-home,"  The photos of this Sydney unit were gleaming, the reality was anything but A Sydney real estate agency that used doctored photos to advertise a property where a man had lain dead for weeks is being investigated by NSW Fair Trading. At least two inspections have already been held at the unit, in leafy Wollstonecraft, which will go under the hammer on November 23 with a price guide of $775,000. DiJones Neutral Bay advertised the property online late last month with several gleaming photos and a blurb describing it as ""an unmissable opportunity"". The advertisement was amended after the ABC began making inquiries and contacted NSW Fair Trading. A forensic analysis of the pictures revealed at least one of them, of the master bedroom, had been altered digitally. Neighbours described its previous owner as a person who lived a quiet life. The ABC understands he died in the house in late 2017 but was discovered only when other residents noticed they had not seen him for months. ""He usually doesn't leave his light on and his light was on for a while,"" one neighbour said. ""We noticed a smell and flies hanging around, so we called the police and they came to investigate and they found his body inside."" A spokesperson for the state's consumer watchdog, NSW Fair Trading, confirmed it had launched an investigation. ""NSW Fair Trading is assessing this matter further,"" they said. The spokesperson said real estate agents ""must act honestly, fairly and professionally with all parties involved in a property transaction"". ""Failure to comply with the rules of conduct also attracts significant penalties."" CEO of REINSW Tim McKibbin described the photos as ""unethical and illegal"". ""It's my experience that it isn't a systemic problem — but like any other industry there are people within real estate who do the wrong thing,"" he said. ""We acknowledge that and we do wish they weren't part of the industry. ""It is clearly unethical and illegal, there's no doubt about either of those."" The photos online have since been updated to more accurately reflect the house's condition. The 86-square-metre flat was described as ""a blank canvas ready to be reinvented"" that ""provides endless potential"". DiJones CEO Rob Ward confirmed in a statement the photographs were doctored but denied anyone from his business directed the changes be made. ""A third-party supplier engaged by DiJones Lower North Shore edited the published photos without consent,"" he said in a statement. ""We will of course cooperate and assist with any investigation that NSW Fair Trading may choose to undertake."" In a text message to prospective buyers on Thursday, it announced changes had been made to the online listing ""to ensure that we accurately position and represent this property throughout the duration of the sales campaign"". Top Sydney property lawyer Victoria Holthouse said real estate agents should ask themselves: ""Has the agent disclosed facts [about] the property which a purchaser could not find out from usual enquiries and inspections?"" One neighbour said they saw the man only ""half a dozen times"" in 13 years. ""I started collecting his mail because it was stacking up in his letterbox,"" one neighbour said. ""I left it on his doorstep for him, but he didn't collect it. ""One day I got a knock on the door and two police officers asked me if I knew 'the deceased'.""

262,The backyard noodle machine catering for Darwin's growing appetite,house-and-home,"  Darwin's backyard noodle machine catering for multicultural city's growing appetite If you've ever eaten out in Darwin, you've probably tasted Mr Ting's homemade fresh noodles. Ting, as he prefers to be called, makes noodles for most of the town's restaurants and street food stalls. He cooks about 700 kilograms of fresh noodles a week — from scratch — in his sweltering backyard shed in the suburb of Wulagi. Ting's noodles cater for a large part of the city's demand of about 1 tonne a week for street food laksa soups and Darwin's multicultural restaurant scene. Ting arrived in Australia in 1988 to study a bachelor's degree in business and accounting and complete his masters in computer technology, and then opened a schnitzel restaurant on Darwin's Stokes Hill Wharf. The Malaysian expat and his Chinese wife, Jiequn Chen, started their noodle-making business in 2008 when they were approached by the town's only noodle-maker who wanted to retire. Now he sells the noodles from a stall at Rapid Creek markets, from the kitchen door, and he delivers. The pair has also been servicing Darwin's famous laksa street food stalls — queues for the laksa stalls at markets are always the longest in the Top End. At the announcement of the Darwin International Laksa Festival, Chief Minister Michael Gunner said: ""The Territory's laksas are recognised internationally as the best in the world"". The festival is a month-long trail ending in a festival day. For the past 11 years, Ting and his family have barely had a holiday or a day off from their industrial backyard kitchen. ""It's very hard to take a day off because restaurants and takeaways have to be open,"" he said. Ting's noodles sell wholesale for 44 per cent more than commercially available varieties, but despite his higher prices he believes he holds ""probably 70 per cent"" of the Darwin fresh noodle market because he offers a superior product. ""I see a few people using fresh noodles that aren't mine,"" he said when queried about his calculations. ""A good chef will always say 'local, fresh — always best'."" Ting gets his ingredients from Asian United Food Service owner Nelson Lay — one of the main food distributors in the Northern Territory — who says he sells about 300kg to 400kg of interstate fresh noodles a week. That means Ting's estimate of 70 per cent market share is not inaccurate. But more importantly, he could claim to provide almost 100 per cent of fresh locally made commercial noodles. ""Ting is a loyal customer for a long time and he makes quality fresh noodles,"" Mr Lay said. Darwin International Laksa Festival judging panel chairman and local restaurateur Jimmy Shu is a customer of Ting's, and will have a keen eye on the noodles at the competition. ""When judging I'd look for 100 per cent authenticity in noodles,"" Mr Shu said. ""Ting is the only one who makes noodles locally and serves it fresh. ""He's always improving in his quality and now he's refined it. ""You know it's fresh when it's not dry. ""Fresh is the only type of noodle that has a bit of bounce in it."" Apart from running one of Darwin's most popular Asian restaurants for many years, Mr Shu reckons he's a noodle expert. ""I can talk about noodles with some authenticity because 55 years ago in Sri Lanka my father bought the first commercial noodle machine,"" he said. ""I was privileged to make noodles. But I thought it was slavery at the time."" The conditions in Ting's backyard kitchen are almost intolerable due to the Top End's weather. Darwin's annual build-up season between September and Christmas means high humidity, high temperatures, and there is no air conditioning to offer relief. ""Everyone says 'Why don't you put on the air con?' but because of the flour you'd clog up the filter every day,"" Ting said. ""Dry season is good to cool the noodles but no good to dry noodles — they dry very quick and crack."" As I watched Ting laboriously making his noodles I asked him why he works in such uncomfortable conditions — surely there must be an easier way to make a living than toiling in a hot shed. ""I have a young family and I can do this at home and look after the family,"" he said. His wife — who he describes as the ""main helper"" — was on the school pick-up during this noodle-making session. The Ting family eats noodles every day and they each have their favourites. ""I like rice noodles with a bit of gravy,"" he said. ""My kids are very fussy — they use my noodles for spaghetti bolognaise. ""Now I tell my customers they can also use noodles for spaghetti bolognaise."" But Ting's three daughters, aged 11, nine, and four, are forgiven for the cultural fusion because they are also part-time staff for the family business, helping with the packaging of the noodles once they have dried. While Ting says the basic ingredients are flour, gluten, water, salt, colouring — and patience — he says the real skill is in the method. ""Don't overcook it, don't undercook it, and don't put too much oil in it,"" he said. He wasn't too concerned with the extra workload for the inaugural Darwin International Laksa Festival. He says it's good for business in a quiet time of the year and that larger orders than usual are arriving.

263,"After several false dawns, Perth's housing market may finally be on the cusp of a recovery",house-and-home,"  Perth's housing market may finally be on the cusp of recovery as rental pressure bites Real estate agents say a tightening in Perth's rental market may point to a broader housing recovery, driven by a turnaround in population growth. Figures from the Real Estate Institute of Western Australia (REIWA) show the rental vacancy rate fell to 2.5 per cent in the September quarter. That represents a tightening in the market since June, but the vacancy rate remains above the 2.4 per cent recorded earlier in the year, when real estate agents were tipping a rebound in rents on the back of stronger demand for properties. REIWA deputy president Lisa Joyce said the Perth market was considered to have reached equilibrium when the vacancy rate hit 3 per cent. At its current level of 2.5 per cent, demand was considered to be slowly outstripping supply, Ms Joyce said, meaning rents were likely to rise over time. ""There is 19 per cent less stock available … compared to the same time last year,"" she said. ""That, combined with fewer days on market to achieve a tenant, puts more pressure on the rental market."" Overall, most suburbs — 117 in total — recorded no change in median rent in the September quarter, while 110 suburbs recorded an increase. Meanwhile, rental listings declined by 17 per cent during the quarter. Ms Joyce described it as the ""best indication yet"" of a broader recovery in Perth's housing market, following repeated calls of the market bottoming out over recent years. ""We're starting to see a steady decline in the vacancy rate, a steady decline in rental stock, a contraction in the number of days on market and we haven't hit the peak of the market for 2019,"" she said. Ms Joyce said two areas of the market in particular were showing signs of stabilisation — outer suburbs with high rental turnover along with an oversupply of stock, and inner suburbs popular with families moving to Perth for work. ""We're starting to get interest now for families relocating for the start of the new school year,"" Ms Joyce said. Relocation agents were seeking rental properties at the upper end of the market for oil and gas workers, Ms Joyce added. ""The demand is certainly building in those sectors and it'll be interesting to see whether there is enough stock at that end of the market to supply the interest. ""As we start to see pressure at the upper end of the market, that trickles down to those markets below that."" But despite signs of a pick-up in demand, rents are yet to increase across the board. The median rent for houses remained unchanged at $360 per week in the September quarter, while the median rent for units — at $340 per week — was marginally higher than in June. Earlier this week, Moody's Investors Service released a report which showed Perth's median house price fell 4.3 per cent in the year to September, the largest fall of any capital city. These are the suburbs across Australia the banks deem the most risky when assessing home loans. But Ms Joyce said the rate of decline in house prices had slowed and that, combined with signs of recovery in the rental market, may bring investors back to the market. ""Once you get stability in rentals, declines in the vacancy rate, slight pressure on the supply of property, you start to get increases in rents, increases in yields,"" she said. ""When confidence is restored … and you start to get investors coming back into the market, that's when you start to see an engagement between investors, owner-occupiers and traction in the market."" Ms Joyce said she expected that if vacancy rates and stock levels continued to trend down, rents would likely increase in the first quarter of 2020.

264,"If your next Airbnb booking is at a party house, you can expect to be kicked out",house-and-home,"  Here's what Airbnb's party house crackdown could mean for your next stay Airbnb announced a ban on ""party houses"" at the weekend following a shooting at a Californian rental on Halloween in which five people were killed. In a series of tweets, co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said Airbnb ""must do better, and we will"". But what does this mean if you're planning on booking a short-term rental? Here's what we know about the crackdown. In order to book on Airbnb, users have to share their full name, provide an email address and confirmed number, write an introductory message, agree to house rules and provide payment information. From there, Airbnb says it scores every reservation for risk before confirming them. On top of this, it runs its hosts and guests against regulatory, terrorist and sanctions watchlists. They also conduct background checks on guests and hosts in the United States. Meanwhile, hosts are asked to set clear expectations and requirements for guests, read their profiles and reviews, ""get to know [their] guests in advance"", and keep safety information and equipment handy in order to help keep themselves and their properties safe. Rowdy parties in Airbnb rentals have long been a problem in some communities, but now the company says it will take action after five people were shot dead at a party house in San Francisco. Airbnb's terms of service say guests have to leave the accommodation in the condition it was in when they arrived. If guests book services on behalf of additional guests, they have to make sure every additional guest meets any requirements set by the host, and is aware of Airbnb's terms and the host's rules and restrictions. So, Airbnb guests are responsible for everything that happens in the property while they're renting it, and this means following the host's rules. Mr Chesky outlined three key issues on Twitter. He said Airbnb would: These changes are effective immediately, according to Mr Chesky. And the ABC understands they will apply to listings worldwide, including Australia. Manual screening technology is already used by the platform to score reservations for risk before they are confirmed. ""We use predictive analytics and machine learning to instantly evaluate hundreds of signals that help us flag and investigate suspicious activity before it happens,"" it said. According to Airbnb this process is going to be expanded, which means your booking will likely be scrutinised even more than it already is, particularly if it happens to be a booking for a large house for, say, one night, as it was reported. They'll also be looking at hosts who allow their homes to become long-term nuisances to their neighbourhoods. As for the other two changes, it's still unclear exactly how they will be implemented. Airbnb have not clarified what would be classified as a ""party house"". That doesn't appear to be the case. So if you're envisioning a SWAT team arriving on the doorstep, dragging unruly guests from properties, you've probably gotten a little carried away. But Airbnb are yet to clarify exactly what this rapid response team would be responsible for. We should know more about what the response team will involve in the next week or so. For now, the company's working on ""reviewing and accelerating the development and implementation of these new safety initiatives"", Mr Chesky explained. … to come back with more info. Margaret Richardson, Airbnb's vice-president of trust — yes, really — has been tasked with overseeing the new team. Mr Chesky says she's been given 10 days to develop and implement the new safety initiatives. If you're found to be in a ""party house"", it appears you'll probably be kicked out immediately. Of course, unauthorised parties were always banned under Airbnb's company policy. But the updated policy is more a ""redoubling"" of Airbnb's efforts to stop them from happening, in Mr Chesky's words. It's unclear what would constitute a party house. We're also unsure who would make up the rapid response team and whether they could kick you out of the Airbnb property. And it's not known if the new policy will mean hosts and/or guests would be removed from the website, rental, or both, for breaching the rules.

265,"If you rent in Canberra, from today you'll have more rights ... sort of",house-and-home,"  The ACT's new rental laws start today, but how will they affect the market? New laws around rental properties in the ACT have come into effect today, making it easier for renters to keep pets, make minor modifications to the properties they're living in, and avoid unfair rent increases. The ACT Government says the laws will restore the balance of power between renters and owners, and make clear what obligations a landlord has. But that doesn't mean renters will have free reign. So what can and can't you do under the new laws? If you're a keen art collector, there's good news. Renters will now be able to make so-called ""special modifications"" to their homes, including installing hooks, painting walls, and planting a herb garden. You can also make modifications for safety, security or access. That could include child safety gates, ramps for a person with a disability or alarm systems. Any modifications made must be removed when the lease is up — meaning the tenant has to patch up (or repaint entirely) any walls if they've made changes. You're also only allowed to make modifications with the written consent of the owner. If they refuse, they will have to take it up with the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (ACAT). But the Tribunal can only overturn the refusal for a few reasons. For example, if the modification would result in added maintenance costs for the landlord or if the modification is illegal. The landlord can also put reasonable conditions on the approval — that might mean getting a tradie in to do the work or making sure the modification is done in a certain way. Pet owners (or at least owners of cats and dogs) are also winners under the new laws. But that doesn't mean you'll be able to keep a Doberman in a studio apartment or an alpaca at the foot of your bed. With the consent of the landlord, tenants can keep a pet on the property. Tenancy agreements will no longer be able to prohibit pets completely. And again, if the landlord wants to refuse having a pet on the property, they'll need to go to ACAT. ACAT can rule in the landlord's favour for a few reasons, for example if it's convinced the pet will damage the property, if the landlord would suffer significant hardship (such as if they had a pet allergy), or if the animal is a risk to public safety. Those with assistance dogs won't be affected by the new laws — it will still be the case that landlords can't discriminate against a tenant with a disability. The new laws will also prevent landlords from being able to make excessive increases to rent. Landlords will only be able to raise rent up to 10 per cent more than the increase in the Consumer Price Index, which is an indicator used to calculate inflation. Anything higher will either need to be agreed to by the tenant, or approved by ACAT. The laws are being touted as a big win for renters. But there are concerns the laws could actually leave renters worse off. The Real Estate Institute ACT predicts that the new laws, combined with high rates and land taxes in the ACT, will disincentivise investment in the property market. ""We're fearful it will get to a point where owners will perceive it's just too difficult and decide to sell their properties,"" director Craig Bright said. ""If supply is depleting in the market and there's increased demand as people move into Canberra, then the result has to be that rent will steadily increase."" He's also worried landlords will be left chasing money for any damage to a property that exceeds the value of the bond. Property lawyer at Meyer Vandenberg Archie Tsiramokos said he was already hearing from clients worried that investing in property in Canberra would not be worth it. ""A number of people have said, 'look I just don't want to be in that environment. I don't want to have somebody telling me that they can change my property without my consent or do certain things that affect the value of my property',"" he said. The ACT Government dismissed the comments as ""scaremongering"".

266,'It's never just about the stuff': The curious role of professional organisers,house-and-home,"  Who even needs a professional organiser and what do they actually do? Some might say that Susanne Thiebe has a strange idea of thrills. ""Decluttering is thrilling, it's the best. I find getting stuff out of people's homes thrilling,"" Ms Thiebe said. Come along with Claire Hooper and a team of no-nonsense experts to rummage through people's cupboards and learn the secrets of the super organised. More than most, Ms Thiebe has a reason to be excited by decluttering: she is a professional organiser in Sydney. Minimalism is having a moment right now, as is the advice of tidying celebrities like Marie Kondo, whose trademarked KonMari tidying method has its own Netflix special and New York Times best-selling book. But what is less clear is whether many people actually understand what a professional organiser does. Peter Walsh is Oprah Winfrey's 'get your life organised' guy, in some ways you might say he's the original declutterer. At the very least, Mr Walsh has helped take the profession mainstream. But even he sometimes gets puzzled looks. ""I'm aware of the fact that, many people see what I do as glorified cleaning,"" he said. ""And nothing could be farther from the truth."" As Mr Walsh and others would attest, there's much more to being a professional organiser than throwing a bin on the floor and sorting everything into 'keep' or 'discard'. It goes without saying that not everyone can afford their own organiser, someone who typically comes for multiple-hour sessions over the course of a few weeks. Most people will have to put up with the messy bathroom, the overflowing drawers, until they figure out some sort of hack or coping mechanism. But for those who can afford one, an organiser chiefly provides an outside voice and perspective that helps them not just tidy their homes, and introduce systems and practices to stop clutter accumulating in the future. This is how Lissanne Oliver, who has been organising since 2002, sees her role. ""I go into people's space, I do lots of hands-on decision making with them, and I give them a sense of relief where they've got control over their stuff, rather than their stuff having control over them,"" she said. Professional organisers like Ms Thiebe see themselves as trained specialists helping people create order in their own lives. ""I work with people who can't walk in some of their rooms, or elderly people who bump into stuff constantly,'"" Ms Thiebe said of a typical client. ""They tried organising, they read books, or they go on Pinterest or the wrong Facebook groups, but then they realise 'I just need less shit.'"" Most of Mr Walsh's work is over two days, when he is invited into their homes and goes through their stuff. ""I use two things when I help people,"" he said. ""One is a helping hand. If you want help, I will do whatever is needed to help you. ""And the other is I hold up a mirror to people and will ask questions. ""And I have found that as long as I am honest, if people believe I am honest, I can say pretty much anything."" The rise of the profession, at least in Peter Walsh's experience, has moved in sync with the rise in a consumer society and an increase in the amount of stuff we own. We asked 54,000 people about their lives. See what they told us — and how you compare. Nearly half (44 per cent) of women told the ABC Australia Talks National Survey they'd be happier if they spent less time running errands and doing chores — notably higher than the 32 per cent of men who said the same. ""I think everyone has been struggling with clutter for a long time now,"" he said. ""From excess consumption came the concept of decluttering and organising and from that came minimalism. ""It's the evolution of our relationship to our stuff."" The changing and varied stuff in the typical home means that most professional organisers offer a range of services. Often they'll focus just on one room, or one problem, and work to disentangle the problem from there. Ms Thiebe said the goal is not actually about being tidy, it's about being organised. ""I call myself a professional organiser, but I'm more and more saying I'm a 'declutter coach,'"" she said. ""Because if you don't declutter, if you just organise it's going from A to B and making it more pretty."" Often, it very quickly becomes obvious that problems with clutter are unrelated to being just about their stuff, Mr Walsh said. ""I'd like to think that what I do does have an effect on people's lives,"" he said. ""But it forces people to look at their stuff and the relationships, the way they live, their perceptions of things in a very different way. ""That's more about quality of life than it is about quantity of stuff."" Mr Walsh said his clearest example of this was when he worked with a client who had every single piece of baby clothing from her teenage boys stacked in the master bedroom, and wanted it organised. ""So after about 20 minutes talking about this, I said to the mum, 'Look, I just have one question for you: do you think your best life with your boys is in front of you or behind you?"" he said. ""She started sobbing and it turned out she had always wanted to have more children. ""And so if you or I looked at those baby clothes, or if her husband looked through those clothes, all we would see were baby clothes. ""When she looked at them what she saw was... her contribution as a woman, as a mother, as a wife. ""And if you asked her to let go of those, you ask her to let go of who she is, who she values as a person."" Tidying up the baby clothes ended up being more about moving on from her feeling of loss and communicating that to her husband, Mr Walsh said. ""She ended up donating all of those clothes to the woman who was adopting... a couple of babies from China,"" he said. ""And it started a whole new phase in her life with her relationship ""[It shows] we all get focused on the stuff, but it's never just about the stuff.""

267,Byron Bay's illegal campers say they're living the 'good life',house-and-home,"  Byron Bay's illegal campers draw the ire of native title holders, authorities Living in a tent in the scrubby sand hills north of Byron Bay, in northern New South Wales, Roger Maloney has carefully cultivated a life outside of regular society. His campsite is meticulous — a patch of fake grass keeps sand out of his tent, his cast iron cookware sits on the ground in symmetrical order, and his surfboard and $10 golf clubs stand within arm's reach of a matching white melamine stool and occasional table. Mr Maloney began living in the bush about 20 years ago after a workplace accident while bricklaying in Cairns. ""I decided to go the lone ranger and fend for myself,"" Mr Maloney said. ""It's a really good life — I play a bit of music and do various other things to entertain myself."" But the semi-permanent presence of Mr Maloney and others living in the dunes and bushland along the coastline is creating a headache for coastal communities and authorities. The Arakwal people of Byron Bay, who were this year awarded native title of the area, have said the campers do not have permission to be there and are causing damage to their country and showing disrespect to their culture. ""This reserve is part of the Arakwal people's country and has cultural significance to the Arakwal, who have maintained links with country that include the reserve since non-Aboriginal settlement,"" said Sharon Sloane, the general manager of the Bundjalung of Byron Bay Aboriginal Corporation. ""Some campers are causing damage to the environment, and threatened species are being further threatened by campers. ""Bushwalkers are feeling threatened and unsafe in this vicinity. ""Fires have occurred as a result of illegal campers and we do not support this at all. ""Our corporation works with many landholders to protect country in our native title area so that it is safe from damage. ""We have sympathy for people who are homeless but we feel the solution should not be to the detriment of country."" A report commissioned by the New South Wales Council of Social Services into the social and economic disadvantage of people in regional areas shows 900,000 people across the state are living below the poverty line, half of them in regional areas. The council's president, Tony Davies, said there was a perception among city-based politicians that the cost of living in regional areas was lower, but in fact about 20 per cent of regional families were living on about $100 a week after paying their rent and bills. ""We know that pretty much across the whole of the north coast we've got increasing numbers of people who are living in the coastal reserves, from Fingal right down to Stockton near Newcastle,"" Mr Davies said. ""It's just the cost of living — rental costs are incredibly high. ""If you are on a casual salary or working in the seasonal tourist industry, you don't get a lot of income. ""And then we've got, on top of that, the drought, and agricultural industries are not producing the income they used to."" Inspector Matt Kehoe from Tweed-Byron Police agreed the number of campers was growing and moving them on was proving difficult. He said part of the problem was the range of authorities responsible for the land on which people are camping. Last week, police targeted bushland at Brunswick Heads under Crown Lands jurisdiction. In March, they evicted two people from the nearby national park who had accumulated three truck loads of rubbish. ""It is quite difficult,"" Inspector Kehoe said. ""We have to go in there with maps because some areas are administered by Crown Lands, some by National Parks and some by Byron Shire Council, and they are all quite close to each other."" A spokesperson for Crown Lands said more operations to evict illegal squatters would take place in the lead-up to the Christmas holiday period. The council said that while it did not support illegal camping, it recognised the people living in the dunes were often vulnerable members of society. ""We are doing all we can to deter illegal camping via continued enforcement and issuing of fines,"" a spokesperson said. ""Homelessness, however, is a very complex issue that involves council as well as family and community services, NSW Health and other agencies."" The council has recently recruited a public space liaison officer to help connect the bush campers with government services and agencies. In the bush, the campers interviewed by the ABC said they were content with their living situation. Peter said the pace of life and serenity of the bush helped his mental health, which was impacted by a violent home invasion last year. ""I don't destroy the environment — quite the opposite,"" he said. ""It's just conducive for my health to be surrounded by trees. ""I'm not just being like a bum here, I do try to give back."" At an another campsite, 'Boogie' said his decision to go bush stemmed in part from the trauma of his baby son's death. ""I don't like living in walls, I don't like being boxed in,"" Boogie said. ""People try to move us on, but we don't leave — we've got nowhere to go.""

268,"analysis: Boom, doom and gloom: The forces uniting Australia and the United States",house-and-home,"  Boom, doom and gloom: The forces uniting Australia and the United States Why the long faces, everyone? For years, Australian consumers have been twitchy. With good reason. A lethal combination of soaring household debt, overpriced real estate and painfully weak wages have seen households slam the brakes on spending. Now, the pessimism is spreading to the business world and to financial markets. A survey of corporate leaders last week — almost 1,500 company directors — found that almost 60 per cent were concerned the economy would deteriorate next year, citing a laundry list of problems that primarily focused on things outside our control. China, trade wars and weak global conditions. Few, it appears, are convinced by the Reserve Bank's recent soothing remarks that we've entered a gentle upswing. In fact, just 8 per cent reckon things will be better next year. After decades of growth driven by a resources boom, a housing boom, an immigration boom and a construction boom, it would appear we are running out of options to maintain economic momentum. It's not just here, either. The mood of American business executives suddenly has turned sour. After two years of celebrating the rise of Donald Trump — whose corporate tax cuts added a burst of nitro to an already overrevved Wall Street — they too are anxious about the future. A study late last week showed confidence among American chief executives has dropped to its lowest level in a decade. That's despite a constant succession of Wall Street highs. For two years, corporate America has pumped up company valuations — and hence executive bonuses — through buying back shares, essentially showering investors in cash. It's been financed with the tax cuts and cheap debt. And that's the problem. Very little of the cash was invested for the future. The sugar hit from the tax cuts now has evaporated and with overstretched balance sheets, there's rising apprehension about borrowing more to simply hand back to investors, even with falling interest rates. Not surprisingly, the share buybacks suddenly have started to fall, raising concerns that one of Wall Street's key pillars has begun to crumble. In the second quarter, American companies spent $US166 billion ($243 billion) soaking up their own shares. That's well below the previous quarter's $US205 billion and the $US190 billion they spent in the same period last year. If it continues to drop, a large slab of demand for shares will be removed. The RBA's cut to 1 per cent is an extraordinary state of affairs here, but less so in other economies, writes Stephen Letts. No wonder the horses are jittery. Despite all the reassurances that the economy is in recovery, and RBA governor Philip Lowe's incantations that we're about to return to normal conditions next year, bond markets — the financial markets that really matter — simply don't believe it. Given his recent bullish comments to an IMF meeting in Washington, most pundits have scaled back the odds of a November rate cut. But there is a substantial bet on a pre-Christmas cut and almost certainty of one early in the New Year. In a weird contradiction, even senior RBA officials have hinted at just how they might continue propping things up once they exhaust their options on interest rates. If things really get desperate, with say a banking crisis, and the RBA cuts to 0.25 per cent, it seems likely the RBA's first step will be to inject money directly into the economy through what's known as Open Market Operations. This would help narrow the gap between the cash rate and the rate banks charge mortgage holders. It did this during the financial crisis in 2008 but interest rates were much higher back then. This time around, mortgage repayments could drop to around 1 per cent or even lower. US bond markets are behaving in a similar fashion. Late last year, American bond yields were rising in anticipation of a return to more normal economic conditions. The Trump administration's trade war put paid to all that. While US employment is still strong — as is the case here — the ongoing trade hostilities with China are starting to exact a toll in terms of manufacturing output and earnings. There's an unmistakable air of nervousness on stock markets. While the market sits just below record levels, three major local companies have been forced to back out of a stock market debut at the 11th hour in the past few weeks. First it was Latitude Finance, the former GE Money that enlisted the services of Ahmed Fahour in a bid to convince investors to tip in their hard-earned. Then came Retail Zoo, the owner of Boost Juice. And last Thursday, Singapore based Property Guru pulled its $362 million float. In each case investors baulked at the valuations. Latitude, which at $1 billion was to have been the richest float of the year, simply wasn't worth the price tag. Neither were the others. That followed a string of failures on Wall Street, the most spectacular being WeWork. From one of the most anticipated floats just a few months ago and worth a supposed $US100 billion, it now is in crisis, with founder Adam Neumann sacked and its high-profile Japanese backer SoftBank desperately attempting to keep it afloat. Uber and Lyft are trading at huge discounts to their listing price and investors, it would appear, have had enough. These developments have sent shockwaves through the venture capital and private equity industries and could be making some superannuation fund managers squirm. With the cash rate down to a fresh low of 1 per cent, Australia has entered what's been dubbed the ""era of irrationality, impotence and inequality"". With interest rates so low, super funds desperately have been seeking higher returns with many opting for ""alternative investments"". It's been a strategy that has delivered handsome returns. Until now. Venture capitalists, firms that inject cash into start ups, have been hyping the value of their investments, repeatedly marking them up each time they invest more cash despite many of them still burning cash. Private equity firms, meanwhile, have paid over the odds for old fixer-uppers, hoping a lick of paint and some new carpet may be enough to paper over the enormous debts and poor prospects when the flick them off to stock market investors. So, what do you do with your cash in a low-interest world if everything is overpriced? If there's one area where Australians are showing no signs of restraint, it is in real estate. The three rate cuts since June have done little to ignite the real economy. Instead, after almost two years of declines, property prices are bouncing back with a vengeance, at least on the east coast. According to CoreLogic, the past weekend saw the busiest week for auctions this year, with clearance rates climbing to a national average of more than 75 per cent. This time last year, just 48 per cent of dwellings cleared at auction. With pressure on regulators to ease the credit restrictions imposed in the wake of the banking royal commission, it would appear the Federal Government and the Reserve Bank are keen for anything to boost sentiment and lift spirits, even if it is a return to the boom that caused the household debt problem in the first place.

269,Couple never thought 'concrete jungle' could burn — and they nearly lost it all,house-and-home,"  Fire Chat: Perth couple urge others to make five-minute plan after lucky escape As the residents of a ""concrete jungle"", West Australian couple Natasha Turfrey and Denis Grzetic never thought about the threat of bushfire. Their house, in the south-eastern Perth suburb of Harrisdale, was built on flat land in a new estate just seven years ago, and the only trees to be seen were barely two metres high. But in February, the couple came perilously close to losing everything in a bushfire, an event that took them completely by surprise. ""What was going to burn here, it's all concrete and tiles?"" Mr Grzetic said. ""You don't really take into consideration the bushland that we have, it's not even 100 metres behind us."" On February 7, 2019, shortly after midday, a fire was reported in the adjacent suburb of Forrestdale and Ms Turfrey, who works nearby, remembers her colleagues' words of warning. ""They said 'you really should go home, you're in the yellow zone,'"" Ms Turfrey said. ""Being from New Zealand, I've never experienced anything like that before — what does that even mean?"" The yellow zone meant that her home was subject to a Watch and Act level warning, which indicated a possible threat to lives and homes in the area. ""I left work and was driving and there were all the detours and you could see how bad it was,"" she said. ""When I drove into the estate, you could see all the smoke and smell it quite strongly. ""By the time I had got home and packed up the car — we had one dog and two cats to get ready — and picked up photos and clothing, it had already turned into the red zone."" That meant the situation had escalated to Emergency level — those within it are in danger and need to take immediate action to survive. Shortly afterwards, Mr Grzetic arrived and decided to stay, although he had no plan to try to defend his home. ""I was sitting on our back patio overlooking the bushland waiting to see some physical sign of fire, because I couldn't actually see anything,"" he said. ""I was just waiting till I could actually see the fire and then go, 'yeah, now I'm trouble' — which is probably not the smart idea. ""I think because I wasn't really educated on what the red zone meant or what the yellow zone meant, I couldn't see anything. ""So I thought everything was OK and it wasn't until after the fact when I learnt what danger I actually was in, staying here."" In the end, a forecast wind change did not eventuate, and when Ms Turfrey returned home the next day there was no visible sign of the emergency the day before. ""I think we were just really fortunate that the winds didn't change the way they anticipated it to, that night,"" Ms Turfrey said. ""If it had it would taken out Skeet Road and the embers could have attacked the estate."" But it was not until days after the fire, when the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) conducted community education sessions explaining how fast embers can travel and how difficult it can be to leave at the last minute, that the couple realised how much danger they had been in. ""There were at least three other people on the street who did the same as me, just stayed here and didn't do anything,"" Mr Grzetic said. ""And one of them is a family of five."" The couple have since done what DFES is urging every household to do this month — sit down for a five-minute chat and planning what to do if another fire comes. Asking these three simple questions could save your life1. When will you know to leave?2. Where will you go?3. Which way will you go?If you have any doubt, your safest option is to leave early Source: Department of Fire and Emergency Services WA The biggest priority is getting their pets to safety, but that proved challenging on the day of the Forrestdale fire. ""I only had one cat carrier,"" Ms Turfrey said. ""I've got two cats but they'd never had to go out at the same time. ""So now we have a cat carrier each — it's just those things you don't think about. ""It was pretty stressful and frustrating."" They have also put all their photographs and important documents in one place and made sure they know various routes out in case of road closures. ""We know that if we can get back, we will come back, grab our photos, dogs and cats and get out,"" Mr Grzetic said. ""It should be a literally a five-minute turn around.""

270,"opinion: Australians have a lot of wealth tied up in property, but we keep making one common mistake",house-and-home,"  Location, location, location: why up to two-thirds of property investors may be getting it wrong The housing market is moving again. In the past month, national prices have climbed 0.9 per cent. What matters most to buyers (and especially to investors), along with price and value, is location. The cliché suggests that in the long run that's all that matters. So it would be unfortunate if investors were getting it wrong. Our examination of proprietary data from a major bank covering 1.15 million residential mortgage applications over the six years between 2003 and 2009 suggests they might be. Published this month in the Pacific-Basin Finance Journal under the title Home advantage: the preference for local residential real estate investment, it finds that more than two in every three Australians buying an investment property pick one close to where they live. A new crackdown on retail lending has seen banks throwing greater scrutiny on location and living expenses when assessing loans. This means that someone who lives in Manly is far more likely to invest in Manly over anywhere else in Sydney or in Australia and so on. There are several good reasons for this. First, the time, effort and travel costs are typically lower when investing in your local area than investing further away. Second, property investors sometimes plan to self-manage without an agent, making proximity an advantage. The Real Estate Institute of Australia believes one in five investors self-manage. And property investors might believe that they have a ""home advantage"" in knowing their location better than non-locals. Home bias is well-documented in other markets. For example, investors in the stock market are more likely to hold shares in Australian rather than international companies. Australia's housing downturn appears to be over … for now. But huge household debts leave the nation vulnerable to a shock. This is even the case for superannuation funds, who set aside a sizeable portion of their assets for investment in Australian stocks — far more than the Australian stock market would represent in a global stock portfolio. It brings with it problems alongside the advantages of convenience and local knowledge. Most investors hold only one investment property alongside their place of residence, making it one of the few chances they have to diversify away from the risk embodied in that suburb. Instead, most double down on that investment. If you are wondering whether this is unwise, or unwise enough to outweigh the advantages of local knowledge, consider this question: How likely is it that the location you happen to live in will always outperform every other location? Interestingly we find that ""sophisticated"" investors are more likely to invest outside of the suburb where they live than less sophisticated investors. Investing non-locally is more likely among investors who own shares, already receive rental income, and work as professionals or in management positions. The risks that doubling down on locations impose on unsophisticated investors extend to the financial system itself. Higher geographical concentration of property investments increase the risk of defaults and foreclosures in a market downturn, amplifying economic cycles. Australians have a lot of wealth tied up in property, and the property market in turn is highly connected to the financial system through bank lending. Our study suggests there is an opportunity to strengthen Australia's financial system by educating potential investors about risk. It could make them, and the Australian economy, better able to withstand downturns.

271,Embracing the jungle within — homemakers go crazy for indoor plants,house-and-home,"  Indoor plant trend sprouts home-based work opportunities and wellbeing Homemakers are going crazy for indoor plants and the social media-driven trend is inspiring home-based businesses and promoting wellbeing. It is being described as an addiction, with devotees starting with one plant in their home and ending up with hundreds. Some are even naming their plants and say they bring companionship. South Australian woman Kristy Robertshaw started the Facebook page Crazy Indoor Plant People of Australia two years ago and it now has 66,000 members. They post pictures of their plants, especially any new foliage, announce when new varieties hit their local stores, and seek support when their babies are wilting. Ms Robertshaw said the craze was embracing all ages and demographics, and showing no signs of dwindling. ""It's really therapeutic to care about the needs of a plant … it's like having pets,"" Ms Robertshaw said. ""It's a really lovely thing to look at in your home."" Ms Robertshaw opened her own plant shop in Victor Harbor, SA, after being made redundant from her office job. ""I name all the plants in store, and make up ridiculous stories about them on social media,"" she said. Along with the return to indoor plants she has seen homeowners embrace natural fibres, showcasing their plants in macrame hangers, kokedamas (moss balls tied with string) or woven baskets. ""All of that has come back in. There's a real theme of wanting to have nature around you, especially with high-density living or for people who are renting,"" Ms Robertshaw said. In SA's Riverland region, indoor-plant lovers are making and selling their own kokedamas and offering workshops to others wanting their own indoor jungle. Others are setting up their own plant nurseries and propagating plants for sale. Jo Greathead is a busy mum of two and a professional counsellor. Her passion for plants began about two years ago and she has since filled her home with greenery including Monsteras, a climbing ivy above her fish tank, large palms and fiddle leaf figs and hardy Zanzibars. ""Once you have one plant and you experience the joy as it grows and the joy it brings when it's thriving, it's kind of an addictive feeling,"" Ms Greathead said. ""I think it's such a big craze because people are tapping into nature more and enjoying the benefits."" She started making kokedamas and quickly found a market for them, selling them privately and through a local nursery. ""I had about 16 in the house and my husband encouraged me to start selling them,"" she said with a laugh. ""A little side business came of it, completely unintentionally, but they just sell so easily. ""I find it a really fantastic way to ground myself and become mindful, getting my hands in the soil and connecting to the earth and the plants."" A kokedama workshop hosted by another enthusiast, retired florist Ann Berriman, attracted mothers and daughters keen to spend some quality time together. Student Chelsea wanted some more plants to take with her to boarding school and attended the workshop with her mum Sandy. ""I've seen them [kokedamas] around, I thought, 'How do they do that?'. It looks so hard, but it's so easy,"" Chelsea said. She said when students at her boarding school went home for holidays, all their plants were relocated to staffrooms for watering. ""Everyone has names for them. If you don't name your plant, you haven't really bonded,"" she said. For Ms Berriman, teaching others to make kokedamas was a rewarding way to share a love of the ornamental plants. ""It's a form of Japanese bonsai. Because you're enclosing the roots … they won't grow as large as they would if they weren't all bound up,"" Ms Berriman said. ""Everyone can do it, whether they are eight or 80, as long as you can wrap string around a parcel, it's the same principle."" Ms Robertshaw said indoor plants had become readily available at hardware stores, nurseries and even online and that an increasing variety of plants were now available in Australia. ""The growers and wholesalers are realising what the capacity of the plant craze is,"" she said. Rarer varieties, known as ""plant unicorns"", such as the variegated Monstera Thai Constellation, are selling online for $300 for a small plant and pot, and more mature ones can cost a lot more. ""There's a lot of more unusual plants arriving in Australia, variegated plants that are becoming more popular and people are buying humidifiers so they can keep them alive and flourishing,"" Ms Robertshaw said. But before you fork out that sort of money, get your green thumbs working on the more common household plants. And beware of the biggest pitfall — overwatering.

272,"After surviving a bushfire, this family learnt to let go of their possessions",house-and-home,"  Decluttering for this family is about letting go, even after losing everything they owned in a bushfire In any other home, the clutter lining Will and Anna Polak's shelves would not be remarkable. The Polaks built this house themselves from sustainable materials — they cut local hardwood for the floors, and most of the labour that went into its construction came from Will. But behind the polished wood and the overflowing cupboards is a tragedy. The Polaks' previous Kinglake home was among more than 2,000 homes destroyed during the Black Saturday bushfires that swept through Victoria in 2009. ""I like the paradox of the bushfire house,"" Will Polak said. ""That it's fire-proof on the outside but full of wood on the inside."" The family lost everything and spent years building their new home up from the rubble. Ten years on, Mr Polak said the family of five now face a more mundane challenge. ""We went back to that same problem [we had before] of cupboards full of stuff or shed full of stuff and the constant need to clear out and take to the tip or take to the shop or get rid of stuff,"" he said. For Mr Polak, his family's story is one that is relevant for everyone. ""It's about how easy it is to accumulate stuff and how easy it is to get stuff,"" he said. ""And how hard it is to get rid of it."" Kinglake was at the epicentre of the Black Saturday bushfires, one of the worst in Australia's recorded history. Come along with Claire Hooper and a team of no-nonsense experts to rummage through people's cupboards and learn the secrets of the super organised. By the time it was over, 120 people in the Kinglake area were dead. When the Polaks returned after the fire with their two children, they found an empty plot where their house once stood. Their only possession was a rug they had loaned to a friend to soak in water and protect her children during the fire. After some time in hospital, Mr Polak said he felt he couldn't return to full-time work, and was forced to confront what he would do with his life. ""The only thing that made sense to me was to build a home that would outlast me and my family and that I could feel confident was safe for anybody who lived here thereafter,"" he said. It also was the start of returning to normal life — and accumulating clutter. Books, kids' toys, plastic containers — all the usual items of family life started to pile up in boxes inside the house and the garage. Their more mundane struggles came amidst other social hardships the fire left in Kinglake: trauma, loss and devastation. ""Getting more stuff began in the context of having absolutely nothing at all,"" Mr Polak said. ""Even what we did have, we really needed to throw away."" Although much of the Polak's stuff is recycled or reclaimed, they say the hard part has always been throwing things away. Kinglake does not have a hard rubbish collection; there are no charity shops nearby to drop unwanted items. But Mr Polak said there are other reasons that have prevented them from decluttering. ""The hard part about getting rid of stuff isn't the nostalgia,"" he said. ""For me, it's more the environmental impacts. It's the way it might be useful one day. ""Every time I throw something away, I feel guilty about what resources I've used and what resources I'm putting back into the land that can't be recycled."" Professional organiser Natalie Morey often has to help clients cut down on their possessions. She said decluttering a whole home can be overwhelming for most people, let alone those who have been through a traumatic natural disaster. ""I find most people just get so intimidated by that, they just don't know what to do,"" she said. ""So whenever we do a client's home, we always break it down. ""And the first thing that we do is pick out those key areas that people are having issues with."" Ms Morey said she advises clients like the Polaks to pick the problem room in their home and then break that decluttering down into small, achievable tasks. And be aware what you bring into the home — everything has to earn its place. ""Chunk it down into small areas, one shelf at a time — don't look at the entire space,"" she said. ""Set the timer, give yourself ten minutes, and then start the cull. ""Get things grouped into categories, like items by like items, categories for donate, rubbish and keep."" Outside temperatures on Black Saturday neared 50 degrees, and Mr Polak remembered an eerie, bluish vapor haze among the eucalypts outside the family's front door. His first sight of the fire was a puff of smoke. ""I was still thinking I was going to stay and defend,"" Mr Polak said. ""I was filling up the gutters with water and I looked across the rest of the field and then a forest across the road and over the top of the trees in the fields on the other side, I could just see like a wall of fire. ""And then the world went black."" As he rebuilt the family home, and watched it fill with stuff, Mr Polak said the hardest thing to abandon was his dream of a room with walls covered in books. It was, in his mind, a place of relaxation, somewhere to sit and read and drop out of the stresses of the world. He never had books in his childhood home — so immediately after the fire, he started to make that his reality. ""After the fires everybody offered us books,"" Mr Polak said. ""Relief centres were full of books, so I scoured the books and found all the best. ""And I collected a number of large boxes and suitcases full of really awesome books."" The books, however, sat in boxes in the shed for six years. It prompted a realisation that is crucial for decluttering: letting go. ""I had to say to myself 'No, I am no longer a person who needs to be surrounded by books,'"" Mr Polak said. ""At that point, all of the books and all of the suitcases and all the boxes and a lot of the stuff off the shelf started to go."" Ms Polak said it was a lesson the family learnt after the bushfires. ""It's like you realise that the only important things... are each other and other people,"" she said. ""The things that really matter is like your favourite dinner and your favourite days [with other people]. ""And it comes down to the water and the air. It's really all we need.""

273,Canberra developer defies emergency work order to prevent possible building collapse,house-and-home,"  Morris Construction refuses to perform emergency work on Kingston Place apartments The ACT Government has intervened to prevent the possible collapse of the Kingston Place apartments, after its developer refused to install temporary propping on the site. Morris Construction Corporation (MCC) warned the emergency work could risk safety and cause further damage to the building. The ABC understands an independent contractor began installing the 234 props to support the building on Thursday. Canberra's construction watchdog issued Morris Construction an emergency rectification order late last month over concerns the apartment block was not structurally sound. Apartment owners said they were told the building suffered from ""punching shear"" in its underground floors, a defect in which concrete columns are subjected to high amounts of pressure, which could cause them to fail. The developer, which has paid for the installation of props at the apartment previously, unsuccessful tried to block the order in the ACT Civil and Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It had until today to complete the work, but Morris Construction has confirmed it will breach the emergency order. ""The safety of the public and those who live and work in its developments is Morris's utmost priority,"" the company said in a statement. ""On the basis of expert advice it has received, MCC is not willing to perform the works specified under the [emergency rectification order] at this stage."" It is an offence not to comply with a rectification order, with corporations facing a maximum penalty of $1.62m for a breach. The ACT Government will be forced to pay for the work to be completed, with Morris Construction then owing a debt to the territory. Company director Barry Morris said he was committed to resolve the litigation involving the building. ""However, we cannot in good faith perform rectification works to a build when we have been independently advised that doing so may cause further damage to it,"" Mr Morris said. Mr Morris said requests to meet with the constructions occupation registrar over the order were not responded to. ""Further investigation is needed to ensure that any works required — if any — are performed safely,"" he said. Building Quality Improvement Minister Gordon Ramsay said neither the Government nor the community would tolerate sub-standard building work. ""Cleaning up the building industry requires all parts of the supply chain to realise that poor work is not only detrimental to homeowners and investors but damaging to the industry and community as a whole,"" Mr Ramsay said. ""I'm also committed to improving access to justice outcomes for Canberrans who have suffered or are suffering potential financial stress due to structural defects involving the work of a dodgy builder and or developer."" Mr Ramsay said the Government was considering a developer-licensing scheme to ban ""dodgy operators"" from working in Canberra.

274,analysis: Why renters are turning to cupcakes to snare a home,house-and-home,"  Looking to rent a home? There are six things that will help or hinder you Two-thirds of tenants in Australia rent through a real estate agent. A national shortage of private rental housing forces these tenants to impress the real estate agent to secure a property — their application needs to stand out from other applications. An analysis of articles on leading online real estate sites identifies six aspects of interactions between the real estate agent and tenant that affect a tenant's ability to secure a rental property. My research reveals the power of the agent over the tenant. Agents strongly stigmatise certain tenant characteristics during the property search. These real estate articles typically fail to recognise the systemic issues of housing shortages in Australia. As owner-occupied housing becomes more unaffordable and public housing becomes less available, a variety of household types are competing in a high-demand private rental market. Households have differing economic, cultural and social capital. This puts some applicants for a rental property at a disadvantage. But real estate sites present the issue of secure rental housing as an individual problem that can easily be overcome once a tenant understands how to highlight their desirable characteristics when applying for a rental property. When assessing a rental application, the two most important qualities a real estate agent looks for are a tenant's ability to pay the rent on time and their ability and/or willingness to care for the rental property. In addition, a tenant's ability to impress the real estate agent matters. My research identifies six aspects of interactions between agent and tenant that affect the ability to secure a rental property: Through these interactions, tenants can highlight their desirable characteristics while downplaying their undesirable characteristics. The ability to make a good impression on the agent, however, is largely based on a variety of factors that place some tenants at a disadvantage. For example, tenants are advised that several lifestyle factors may hamper their ability to secure a property. The real estate industry and tenant organisations may disagree on whether or not there is a rental crisis, but there are some points where they do agree. These include pets, dependent children, age, a negative rental history and other potential housemates. These findings match those of an Australian survey of private renters, commissioned by Choice, National Shelter and the National Association of Tenant Organisations. It found 50 per cent of renters have experienced discrimination in the private rental sector. This includes discrimination on the basis of: pets (23 per cent), receiving government payments (17 per cent), age (14 per cent), having young children (10 per cent), being a single parent (7 per cent), race (6 per cent), needing to use a bond loan (5 per cent), gender (5 per cent), disability (5 per cent) and sexuality (2 per cent). Further, when it comes to making an impression, some tenants are at a significant advantage. For example, factors such as English proficiency and the ability to ""dress to impress"" are often a reflection of economic and cultural capital. The articles assume that presenting an application form with no spelling and grammatical errors is simply a matter of taking a little extra care. However, a newly arrived migrant may find this difficult, not because of laziness but because they may not yet be proficient in English. The articles also highlight a tenant's willingness to be flexible as important. Flexibility is presented in the following ways: Tenants' ability to be flexible in these ways varies greatly —  not all tenants have the means to offer more rent or pay rent in advance. The ability to be flexible about lease length also differs depending on individual circumstances. My research shows the process of securing a rental property could reinforce the disadvantage of some tenants. This raises an important question. When private rental housing is the only option, what happens to those tenants who fail to impress the real estate agent?

275,How to get on top of clutter before it gets on top of you,house-and-home,"  How to get on top of clutter before it gets on top of you It's no secret that most of us have a complicated relationship with our stuff. Our homes may be loaded with more possessions than ever before, but the rise of Marie Kondo and The Minimalists shows that many of us are trying to live with less. Meanwhile, Australian op shops have reported a rise in donations over the previous few years, as people clear out their unwanted household items. But before they start to re-organise their lives, many people must confront why they have such strong ties to their bits and bobs in the first place. Come along with Claire Hooper and a team of no-nonsense experts to rummage through people's cupboards and learn the secrets of the super organised. And researchers like Bond University's Dr Libby Sander have investigated what messy environments do to human behaviour. ""Generally, what happens to our brain in a cluttered environment is we just get cognitively overloaded,"" she said. Dr Sander, Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour, said previous studies indicated a direct link between cluttered spaces and feeling overwhelmed. ""It reduces our working memory, so it reduces our ability to focus … [and] we can't process information as well and we're just not as productive,"" she said. Dr Sander and others have asked — does controlling our stuff give us more control over our lives? Dr Sander points to several ways that too much stuff can produce measurable changes in our brains and bodies. People who sleep in cluttered rooms have been shown to have more difficulty falling and staying asleep. She said most of us feel calmer when our environment is tidier because our brains tend to gravitate towards order. ""The more clutter we have around us, it's this constant visual reminder of disorganisation,"" Dr Sander said. Cutting down on clutter may even allow us to have better personal relationships, according to Dr Sander. She cited one study where participants watched a pre-recorded video and were then asked to interpret the emotional expression on the faces of the people in the film. Participants watching in a cluttered room were far less likely to correctly interpret the emotional expression on the person's face. ""Despite what most of us believe, the majority of us can't actually multitask,"" she said. ""So if you think about it in terms of the home setting or workspace, if there is a lot of clutter around, we might misinterpret what someone is feeling or what their emotion is, and obviously that could contribute to poorer outcomes in our relationships."" Peter Walsh is a professional organiser and Oprah Winfrey's ""get your life organised"" guy — it's his job to advise people on how to declutter their homes. He said he approaches decluttering with a view to making people more content. ""If you overload your space, if you fill it with too much stuff, if you don't treat your space with honour and respect, you can never be happy in that home,"" he said. Mr Walsh said most of our possessions fall into one of two categories: memory clutter (the stuff that reminds you of an important person, achievement, or event from the past) or ""I might need it one day"" stuff (the things you hold onto in anticipation of an uncertain future). ""To deal with this, you really have to dig below the stuff, to work out what the stuff represents,"" Mr Walsh said. ""It's an emotional release, and it's interesting about the stuff we own and the impression it creates with us. ""The stuff we own exerts some power over us. ""And letting go of our stuff means letting go of a dream, letting go of a perception of our self, embracing a future self that may be unclear or we're uncertain of, and that's the power of our stuff."" To help unpick all those years of clutter conditioning, Mr Walsh suggested one simple tidying trick to kickstart the process each day. ""If you want to stop clutter, don't put it down, put it away,"" he said. ""That will turn your house around in a week.""

276,"Even without solar panels, it would only cost $3.80 a day to run this eco-friendly house",house-and-home,"  'Passive' home more expensive to build but cheaper to run, achieves highest bushfire risk rating Australia's first passive house built to the highest bushfire rating has been unveiled in the midst of an early start to the bushfire season, as experts gather to advise residents on fire safety. When Joe and Merylese Mercieca began building solar passive homes 15 years ago, architects, suppliers, and contractors told them it would not work. Without the available solar technology, the Merciecas were able to achieve a solar passive rating by thinking creatively and adapting commercial products for residential builds. ""So we proved everybody wrong 15 years ago … [and] we're doing it again today,"" Mr Mercieca said. Their latest creation is Australia's first passive house to meet the development requirements for the highest bushfire risk rating — Bushfire Attack Level Flame Zone (BAL-FZ). The display home in New South Wales' Blue Mountains region has a complex system of remotely controlled electric shutters, fire resistant external cladding and fluid ventilation, balancing energy efficiency with strict fire safety standards. Certification for a passive house required strict energy efficiency measures, while BAL-FZ certification required protection from wandering embers and extreme heat. Mr Mercieca said the calculated daily cost of powering the house was equivalent to a cup of coffee a day, due to the home's sophisticated ventilation system which maintained a steady internal temperature year round. Source: Department of Environment and Energy, Your Home ""So [it costs] $3.80 to run this house a day without solar. We've actually put solar on this house so that we can achieve carbon-zero,"" he said. Mr Mercieca said achieving air tightness in the home was vital for supporting the robust ventilation system, and most homes were likely to experience 15 air changes an hour. ""We had to be 0.6 [air changes an hour] as a maximum to meet certification — we actually got it down to 0.39,"" he said. In the entire external envelope of the house, we have a combined 11-millimetre diameter hole, so it's smaller than the pinky finger."" Triple-glazed windows and climate-specific insulation round out the home's laundry list of features. Mr Mercieca said the experimental nature of the build raised its cost to 22 per cent dearer than a standard build, but he hoped to be able to lower the figure to 15 per cent in future. As an early bushfire season rages across regional Australia, the Merciecas know first hand the importance of building bushfire-ready homes. When devastating fires swept through the Blue Mountains in 2013, the Merciecas were encircled by fires and trapped on their property in the mid-mountain town of Winmalee. ""We were stuck at our office and at our home in 2013, we didn't have a chance to get out,"" Mr Mercieca said. Caught up in a blaze that would go on to destroy over 200 homes, the Merciecas watched as one of their cars caught fire and rolled into their nearby office building. Once the smoke had cleared, the office block along with four vehicles were left charred and destroyed. Their nearby house, however, survived the inferno because of fire retardant external cladding which resisted nearby floating embers. ""What that reinforced was that what we were doing was the right thing,"" Mr Mercieca said. He said their latest home's blend of environmental and safety features should provide peace of mind for prospective residents in times of unpredictable bushfires. ""It is a safer place to be, and that's what they're designed for,"" Mr Mercieca said. ""If you need to retreat, then you can retreat to the house and you've got more of a chance."" In response to the disastrous 2013 fires, an Australian-first community conference was formed to educate Blue Mountains residents on building and renovating their homes with the latest fire safety techniques and technology. Now in its fifth year, the Australian Bushfire Building Conference has been attracting industry leaders from around the country for a small trade show alongside expert talks. Bushfire architecture consultant Dr Douglas Brown attended the first year of the conference in 2014, and said residents appeared visibly traumatised one year on. ""Some people came and you could tell they'd lost their home, because they just looked stunned, they just looked overwhelmed by everything,"" he said. Dr Brown encouraged families rebuilding after bushfires to take their time, given the complex nature of fire safety products and ever-increasing safety regulations. ""I say 'you need to deal with your grief', so lease a place for a year, get your kids back into school, you get back into work,"" he said. ""Don't think about your house for a year until you push through the grief and you've had a year of getting your life back into some sort of order. ""The regulations are very well-meaning, a lot of thought and conscious decisions have gone into it. But it is quite overwhelming and it does tend to change."" Dr Brown said he has currently been co-authoring a book on bushfire architecture which planned to rethink how homes were built in fire prone areas. ""The issue is this: we take a suburban home, we put it into a bushland setting, and we say 'we're going to improve the level of fire protection of various components',"" he said. ""But that's not enough, we need to do more, we need to say 'we actually need to design differently'. ""We might need to have homes in bushland settings which are partly underground or have earth coming halfway up the wall as a protection. ""How a building will look in the future in bushfire prone areas is likely to be different.""

277,Financial advisers share tips on how to avoid money traps and uncontrolled spending,house-and-home,"  Financial advisers share tips on how to avoid money traps and uncontrolled spending It's called lifestyle creep — the more you earn, the more you spend, often without thinking about it. But spending without thinking can add up, leading to a feeling that you're short of money, even when you're on a high income. Perth-based private wealth adviser David Andrew said the majority of Australians had no savings, even those on high incomes. ""Of households earning over $200,000 a year, 40 per cent were living pay cheque to pay cheque,"" he told Jessica Strutt on ABC Radio Perth. These are the signs your shopping might be a problem and why so many of us feel compelled to keep browsing. Lifestyle creep starts for many people when they are young and often happens without them realising, according to Lacey Filipich, founder of advisory service Money School. ""I had the experience most uni students can probably relate to of timing your drinking for the cheapest drinks night and buying the passion pop or the cask wine and that being normal and still having a great night,"" she said. ""Over time, I started working with people who make a lot more money and I remember one day we bought a $97 bottle of wine and drank it that night; that was sort of mind-blowing, but I got into the habit then of spending a lot more money."" The secret is to stop and consider your spending before you get used to a change in income. ""Consumers very find it very, very tough to give anything up, so what you do with that pay rise becomes really important,"" Mr Andrew said. ""You're not actually giving anything up, you haven't got it yet, but it's a new opportunity. ""If you receive an inheritance or a pay rise, stop and think: What could I be doing with this?"" Both advisers recommended creating systems that bypassed the need for constant self-discipline when it came to spending. Mr Andrew suggested young people start making extra contributions to their superannuation and avoid credit cards. ""We live off debit cards because you get that immediate sense I can only spend the money that I've actually got."" A number of listeners said they paid more tax than necessary to boost their refunds and put the money out of temptation's reach. Anon: ""My husband and I, on a modest income, elected to pay more tax throughout our working life and it paid for our annual holidays each year with the tax return."" Andre: ""You need to force yourself to save. Go to your payroll department, ask them to take more tax out of your wage ... you will get used to working with what is left, and then when you do your tax return you get your savings back."" Ms Filipich suggested bypassing the tax office and having a set amount sent to a separate bank account each pay day. ""Set up a second bank account that's not connected to any of your cards, and hide it from your online banking so you can't see it and you can't touch and do it automatically,"" she said. ""Then you get to keep the interest, not the tax department."" Mr Andrew said many people found it hard to focus on saving for retirement, despite the fact they wanted to be financially secure in older age. ""It's just an overwhelmingly universal thing that people really want to be secure in their old age, yet people find it so hard to make that trade-off between today and tomorrow."" These simple and straightforward tips can help you boost your savings rate and reach your goals sooner. Ms Filipich, meanwhile, believes in aggressive saving, but not necessarily waiting until retirement to enjoy it. ""I will often say to people: If you had a 20 per cent pay cut, could you survive?"" she said. ""My theory is, be as aggressive in your saving as you possibly can, because you can always get the money back if you need to spend it. ""You'll never catch me putting extra into my superannuation, and because I'll save and invest it, I can have access to the money now."" For listener Beth, the best way to get satisfaction out of her savings is to give money away. ""If you give it away, the pleasure is never-ending,"" she said. ""A fancy car, boat, bathroom — the pleasure lasts at most six weeks, maybe six months, then you need another hit. ""One big donation to one worthy cause, the pleasure for that is ongoing, it never ends.""

278,Want to rule your pool? How about inviting the wildlife in?,house-and-home,"  Pool to pond as homeowners ditch salt and chlorine for urban wildlife waterholes With farmers across Australia facing dust, dry creeks, and financial ruin in what some are calling the worst drought in living memory, swimming pools are often seen as a luxury. Now some of the 2.7 million Australians currently living in a house with a pool are ditching the chlorine and looking at sustainable options like ponds and natural pools, saving on both resources and effort. When Ian and Carol Stroak step out of their South Turramurra home and into their pool area, they are welcomed into a wetland oasis with fish, microbats, frogs, and ducks. The now-retired couple were travelling across the country in a motorhome and feared their pool would suffer while they were away — until they decided to embrace the algae. ""One of the people from Ku-ring-gai Council suggested 'why don't you try a pool-to-pond', and it went from there,"" Ms Stroak said. Ku-Ring-Gai Council created their Pool-to-Pond program in 2007 and believe they were the first in the country to officially encourage residents to make the transition. The Pool will be screened on ABC TV Sunday September 22 and 29 at 7:40pm, and streamed on iview. Since then, the council has converted more than 100 swimming pools to wildlife ponds — an increase of about 6 per cent year a year. Once the Stroaks decided to give up the chlorine, the pair stopped looking after it. ""We didn't really have to do anything,"" Ms Stroak said. ""You turn the chlorine off, you turn the power off, the fish do their thing and the plants do their thing."" In the first two years, the couple said the pond looked ""a little pathetic"" until the plants were established. ""It's like a paradise here; it's a lovely little world,"" Ms Stroak said. ""My friends love to go down there and feed the fish and commune with nature."" Despite the assumption that a pond would encourage mosquitoes, smelly water, and bacteria, the water stays clean thanks to aquatic plants. Impurities are absorbed and harmful bacteria destroyed by natural water organisms. ""We've had it tested for pathogens and mosquitoes — neither of which have ever flourished,"" Ms Stroak said. ""And I can attest the water tasted okay the other day when I fell in and didn't get sick."" In the northern West Australian town of Broome a similar transformation has been completed, but with swimming encouraged, rather than left to accidents. Three years ago, ABC Kimberley feature reporter Ben Collins began the conversion of his family's chlorinated saltwater pool into a natural freshwater swimming pool. ""It felt like a big gamble to put rocks, plants and fish into our backyard pool which is an essential part of survival here in the tropics,"" Mr Collins said. The motivation to take the plunge came when wet season rains diluted the pool's salt and chemicals, turning it green and making it possible for plants and fish to survive. ""The pool shop said we needed to spend another $200, and I thought, 'Let's give this freshwater idea a go',"" he said. With swimming in mind, Mr Collins also modified the existing filtration system, depowering the chlorinator and swapping the sand filter for a bead filter more commonly used in aquaculture. ""We run the filter, pool vacuum and skimmer box pretty much as per normal,"" he said. ""But the aquaculture filter uses bacteria to help keep the water clean."" His pool also had a troubled beginning with murky water and struggling plants. ""It took about a year and a half before the water stayed clear all the time, and the plants really started to flourish,"" Mr Collins said. Now he said he would never go back to a traditional saltwater pool, although he admits it is not for everyone. ""I love the way dragonflies, birds and fish all make their home in and around the pool,"" he said. ""My boys love swimming and even snorkelling in the pool, but my daughter prefers more of a resort-style pool and refuses to swim with the fish."" In Mullumbimby, on Australia's east cost, comedian and author Mandy Nolan sidestepped the transition process by building an eco-pool in the first place. An eco-pool, also known as a natural pool, does not use any chemicals and stays clean by keeping the water moving. ""[We wanted] to create something that is an ecosystem, where the footprint is actually positive on our landscape and not negative,"" Ms Nolan said. When building their home, Ms Nolan and her husband decided to go with a natural option. They dug a hole and filled it in with cement, natural rock, water grasses and lotus flowers. ""When the pool was first put in, it was a mud puddle for quite a long time because of all the disturbance,"" Ms Nolan said. ""I thought, 'Oh my, we have spent all this money and we have a giant festering mud pond'."" But after eight weeks, the pool transformed to sparkling clean water. ""I woke up one day and it was crystal clear overnight. It's phenomenal,"" Ms Nolan said. ""It has a waterfall that runs all the time. That's part of the process that keeps it clean, that it is constantly moving."" Ms Nolan said the pool costs less than a standard chemical pool, and despite having to run the pump 24 hours a day, solar power means it costs less that $5 a week. The family is required to occasionally top up the pool when the water evaporates, but reliance on a rainwater tank again keeps costs down. ""It is used all the time in summer and even when you're not swimming, the rocks are inviting for kids to play around,"" Ms Nolan said. ""My daughter Ivy has been playing over by the waterfall with her dolls today. ""Even though she is not swimming in it, it's like a little fairy garden for her.""

279,Older people on the verge of homelessness are turning to house-sitting,house-and-home,"  House-sitting on the rise for older people in financial stress or on verge of homelessness Five years ago Sue Prince had a Christmas she would rather forget — her mother had just died and her house had been repossessed by the bank. The house, which she shared with her husband Kevin, had been mortgaged for a loan for their son's business, which had just gone bust. ""That was the day I had sunglasses on and was crying [from] too many losses,"" she recalled. ""We had to sell our home to pay back the loan and then, we just bought a caravan not knowing what we were going to do."" With their possessions in storage and the caravan parked out the front of her daughter-in-law's parents' house, Ms Prince started searching for options. ""I was just scrolling through the internet on my phone and I discovered house-sitting,"" she said. Life has changed dramatically since that day. Five years on, Ms Prince is staring at the sprawling countryside from the balcony of a house in the small country town of Bridgetown, in Western Australia. She and her husband do not own the house though; they are now professional house-sitters. The couple has used house-sitting to travel to almost every state and territory in Australia and even to save costs on the occasional overseas holiday. ""We don't have any home bills at all — no electricity, no gas, no rates, no rent,"" Ms Prince said. While their lifestyle requires the couple to be constantly on the move, it does not faze them. ""Kevin and I used to say we come from nowhere, but we thought that was pretty negative so we now say we come from everywhere,"" Ms Prince said with a laugh. The house-sitting trend has grown over the years, with many online websites helping to connect sitters with potential homes. While the lifestyle has turned Sue Prince's life around, for some older women, house-sitting can become a necessity rather than a choice. Liz Lennon returned to WA to care for a sick friend after a long stint living in Ireland and found herself with few housing options. ""I've spent nearly two years house-sitting and in those two years I have probably stayed in 12 or more different places,"" Ms Lennon said. At times, she found the life of a house-sitter exciting as she explored the suburbs of Perth, but admits it soon got old. ""After a number of years, I wanted a little place that I could just be in for a while and have my own things,"" she said. ""It's exhausting, it's a form of homelessness. You have a roof, but you don't have a home."" Jeff Fiedler from the Housing for the Aged Action Group (HAAG) said house-sitting had become more common for older women at risk of homelessness. ""They have been people who have been coping all of their lives just looking after themselves,"" he said. ""They don't think about going to a homelessness service, for example, because they don't see that as somehow appropriate to them, so they are looking at strategies such as house-sitting."" Mr Fiedler said ageing homelessness was an emerging problem across the country. Some 116,400 Australians are without a home — the highest number since the census began estimating the prevalence of homelessness. ""There's been a 16 per cent increase in homelessness between the 2011 and 2016 census for all older people — this is the highest increase of any age group,"" he said. He said during the same period, the number of older women without a home had increased by 27 per cent. ""They're all of a sudden facing the situation where, on the pension they are looking at having to pay 60 to 70, perhaps even 80, per cent of their income in rent,"" Mr Fiedler said. ""It's really a frightening proposition that many older women are now finding themselves in."" Ms Lennon said while house-sitting was great for those who chose the lifestyle, it could hide the true picture of homelessness in Australia. ""It abrogates governments and NGO [non-government organisation] responsibility for actually looking at some innovative housing options for older, single women at risk of homelessness,"" she said. ""Older single woman at risk of homelessness are silent, invisible and well-behaved; they are just not counted."" Mr Fielder is calling for governments to invest in more long-term social housing and other alternative housing options. Co-housing arrangements, co-operatives, and share housing with other older women are some of his suggestions. ""These are terrific ideas that are starting to be developed by older women themselves,"" he said. ""We are now looking to government and the not-for-profit sector to come forward and respond to this demand and this interest."" While house-sitting has been the answer to Sue and Kevin Prince's financial woes, Mr Fiedler suggests people also plan for the future. ""Get housing applications in and explore that so [you] can get on to waiting lists and have that longer-term plan in place at the same time,"" he said.

280,Banks are now referring people to Foodbank to help them pay their mortgage,house-and-home,"  Banks are now referring people to Foodbank to help them pay their mortgage Foodbank South Australia has been approached by banks wanting to refer their clients to the charity, in the hope it will prevent people from defaulting on mortgage payments. It comes as a new report has shown mental distress is increasing in older Australians, with nearly half of all homeowners aged 55 to 64 still paying off a mortgage — up from just 14 per cent 30 years ago. Foodbank South Australia is now working on a new agreement which would enable clients to access its food services directly, with a voucher funded by the major bank. However, Foodbank South Australia chief executive Greg Pattinson told ABC Radio Adelaide it was still exploring how the program would work. ""We are being approached by banks to find a way of referring their clients to Foodbank to try to avoid any defaulting mortgage payments,"" he said. ""That's what we are exploring with some of the banks at the moment … it hasn't started yet because we are still working through the process. ""We've never been approached by financial institutions in the past and the banks, to their credit, are doing the right thing in trying to find a way of keeping people in their houses."" He said traditionally, Foodbank worked through charities and the welfare sector but it had seen an increase in the number of people who require food assistance that are working. ""Increasingly we are being approached now by organisations other than traditional charities, so schools for example, where the schools have identified the children of parents who are doing it tough,"" he said. ""Each year we've seen an increase in South Australia of anywhere up to 20 per cent in the number of people seeking food assistance."" Mr Pattinson said the stereotype of a person or family that required food assistance was diminishing. He said more people must be suffering from mortgage stress because more of those needing help were from working families. ""We certainly do provide services to the unemployed and to people who are homeless,"" he said. ""But we are seeing an increase in the numbers of working families and working Australians who are needing to seek food assistance because of cost of living increases. ""We see an increase in demand, for example every three months, when people get their electricity bills. ""It's a case of those weeks where people are saying, 'we'll make sure the kids are fed, the roof is over our head but mum and dad don't eat this week'."" Mr Pattinson said the fact it had been approached by the banks had shown a significant shift and Foodbank was working on a project to support those in need. Mortgage delinquencies are on the rise, house prices are still tumbling and borrowers are falling into the quicksand of negative equity in their property. It's bad. ""We're getting inquiries from schools, pastoral care workers, from principals at various schools around the state,"" he said. ""And increasingly, we are now seeing inquiries from banks and financial institutions who are looking to try and find a way of helping their clients balance their budget."" He said the program was still in its early stages, but he hoped Foodbank would have a concrete program in place within the next two to three months. ""It may even be as simple as the banks referring their clients to the Foodbank food hubs,"" he said. ""But there would obviously be conditions to that which would have to be assessed by the bank to make sure those people … are genuinely in need of those services. ""We don't want to shift the food away from people who are genuinely needing it.""

281,"Property prices are rising in two cities, but will it spread to the rest of the market?",house-and-home,"  Property market showing green shoots, but is it enough to call it a rebound? There are new signs the property market could be on the rebound, with small price rises in Australia's two largest cities. ""There is a turnaround in sentiment in Sydney and Melbourne markets,"" Eliza Owen, a research analyst from Domain told 7.30. ""I think if you're looking to sell, you might be getting a better price for your property than you did at the beginning of 2019."" But it is not across the whole of the market just yet. Over the last quarter, the high-end housing market was up 2 per cent in Melbourne and 1.8 per cent in Sydney, according to Domain. ""It has always generally been seen that the high end of the market moves first, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne,"" Ms Owen said. ""It doesn't hold across all the cities, but generally we expect the high end of the market leads and provides an indication of what other markets can do in the future."" That then flows to the outer suburbs. ""It could be another six months or another year before the upswing is realised in areas further from the CBD and on the fringe of the metropolitan,"" she said. And although property markets in major capital cities used to move together, that is not the case any more. ""In Perth and Darwin, for example, property prices are still falling, and even though economic indicators in those mining-related markets are starting to turn around, we don't see property prices picking up just yet,"" Ms Owen said. According to figures from CoreLogic, in June values across Sydney ticked up 0.1 per cent, while in Melbourne they rose 0.2 per cent. Hobart also saw a rise of 0.2 per cent. Lorinda and David Smith could feel the change in sentiment when they sold their home in Melbourne's east on the weekend for just over $1 million. Australia's housing downturn appears to be over … for now. But huge household debts leave the nation vulnerable to a shock. ""When it got higher than expected we had to sit down, because it was just blowing us away,"" Ms Smith told 7.30. ""We expected the bidding to start out quite low, but it started out right at the top and it just went crazy from there. So, amazing!"" Mr Smith added. ""We're just lucky that we live in an area that seems to be coming back a little bit. We feel really fortunate about that."" But Ms Owen said the tentative rebound will be tempered by the national economy. ""The fact that we have sluggish income growth, sluggish economic growth expected, this means it's going to temper the nature of this upswing,"" she said. In Brisbane, the possibility of a turnaround is putting pressure on Iliria and Tom Stenning, who are looking to buy a four-bedroom house. They are hoping to snap up a bargain before the market turns. ""We are conscious of the market and we're trying to keep an eye on things to make sure we get a good deal,"" Ms Stenning said. They currently own an apartment, a section of the property market that mostly remains in the doldrums. ""If we were in a rush to sell, if we had to sell our apartment now, I'd be very, very concerned,"" Ms Stenning said. But sellers in Queensland's south-east will probably need to be patient. Graham Leask listed his Ipswich home for sale three months ago. One offer fell through because of a lack of finance. ""I'm sure we could sell it in a week if we had the right money on it … like bargain-basement stuff,"" Mr Leask said. ""But to get the price that you want, you may have to wait a while.""

282,analysis: It's one of the biggest myths about the female brain and it's finally been busted,house-and-home,"  Women aren't better multi-taskers than men — they're just doing more work Multitasking has traditionally been perceived as a woman's domain. A woman, particularly one with children, will routinely be juggling a job and running a household — in itself a frantic mix of kids' lunch boxes, housework, and organising appointments and social arrangements. But a new study, published today in PLOS One, shows women are actually no better at multitasking than men. The study tested whether women were better at switching between tasks and juggling multiple tasks at the same time. The results showed women's brains are no more efficient at either of these activities than men's. Using robust data to challenge these sorts of myths is important, especially given women continue to be bombarded with work, family and household tasks. Multitasking is the act of performing several independent tasks within a short time. It requires rapidly and frequently switching attention from one task to another, increasing the cognitive demand, compared to completing single tasks in sequence. This study builds on an existing body of research showing human brains cannot manage multiple activities at once. Particularly when two tasks are similar, they compete to use the same part of the brain, which makes multitasking very difficult. But human brains are good at switching between activities quickly, which makes people feel like they're multitasking. The brain, however, is working on one project at a time. In this new study, German researchers compared the abilities of 48 men and 48 women in how well they identified letters and numbers. In some experiments, participants were required to pay attention to two tasks at once (called concurrent multitasking), while in others they needed to switch attention between tasks (called sequential multitasking). The researchers measured reaction time and accuracy for the multitasking experiments against a control condition (performing one task only). They found multitasking substantially affected the speed and accuracy of completing the tasks for both men and women. There was no difference between the groups. My colleagues and I recently busted another relevant myth — that women are better at seeing mess than men. We found men and women equally rated a space as messy. The reason men do less cleaning than women may lie in the fact that women are held to higher standards of cleanliness than men, rather than men's ""dirt blindness"". Recent data shows Australian men are spending more time doing domestic work than they used to, but women still do the vast majority of housework. Working Australian women have seen their total time across work and family activities increase over time, with bread-winning mothers spending four hours more across these activities per week than bread-winning fathers. This means working mums are balancing planning birthday parties, childcare drop-offs and ballet lessons all on top of their regular jobs, commutes and careers. If women's brains are equally strained by multitasking, why do we keep asking women to do this work? And, more importantly, what are the consequences? Our recent study shows mothers are more time-pressed and report poorer mental health than fathers. We found the birth of a child increases parents' reports of feeling rushed or pressed for time, but the effect is twice the size for mothers than it is for fathers. Second children double mothers' time pressure again and, as a consequence, lead to a deterioration in their mental health. Women are also more likely to drop out of paid work when children are born or family demands intensify. They carry a larger mental load tied to organising the needs of the family — who has clean socks, who needs to be picked up from school, whether there is enough Vegemite for lunch. All of this labour is at the expense of time planning for the next day's work, the next promotion, and so on. Women are also asked to multitask family demands at night. Children are more likely to interrupt their mother's than their father's sleep. Although gender roles are changing and men are assuming a larger share of the housework and childcare than in the past, gender gaps remain in many important domains of work and family life. These include the allocation of childcare, the division of housework, the wage gap, and the concentration of women in top positions. So, the multitasking myth means mothers are expected to ""do it all"". But this obligation can affect women's mental health, as well as their capacity to excel at work. Public opinion persists that women have a biological edge as super-efficient multitaskers. But, as this study shows, this myth is not supported by evidence. This means the extra family work women perform is just that — extra work. And we need to see it as such. Within the family, this work needs to be catalogued, discussed and then equally divided. More men today are invested in gender equality, equal sharing and co-parenting than ever before. As well as in the home, we need to dismantle these myths in the workplace. The assumption women are better multitaskers can influence the allocation of administrative tasks. Tasks like taking minutes and organising meetings should not be allocated based on gender. Finally, governments need to dismantle these myths within their policies. Children add work that cannot be easily multitasked. Women need affordable, high-quality, and widely available childcare. Men also need access to flexible work, parental leave and childcare to share in this labour, and protections to ensure they aren't penalised for taking time to share in the care. Debunking these myths that expect women to be superheroes is a good thing, but we need to go further and create policy environments where gender equality can thrive.

283,Why this Perth woman swapped a house on five acres for an 80-square-metre 'micro lot',house-and-home,"  Medium to high-density living in 'micro lots' planned for Perth but can residents learn to love small living? Just a few years ago, Glenda Stephens was living in a big house on five acres and could barely see her nearest neighbours. Now she is one of the first people in Perth to live on a micro lot of just 80 square metres. When the micro lots were first announced they were greeted with horror, and Ms Stephens said that ""probably a few years ago I would have said the same"" but living in one has changed her mind. ""They are light, they are open, they are very well designed, they don't feel cramped at all,"" she said of the houses, like hers, that have been built on micro lots in the centre of Ellenbrook, north of Perth. ""I couldn't have afforded this quality of house on a big block,"" she said. ""Everyone comes in and is surprised. They are expecting it to be really cramped. ""I'm definitely converted from my five-acre lot that I thought I could never leave."" It is a conversion the West Australian Government and the Perth property industry are hoping another 1.5 million people will make, with plans to transform the metropolitan area through medium to high-density infill developments surrounding new and existing train stations. But they face strong cultural opposition, with Perth residents traditionally preferring sprawl and space — the 2016 census found that just 6.6 per cent of dwellings in greater Perth were apartments, compared to a national average of 13.1 per cent. Perth councils that have adopted new planning guidelines to increase density have faced fierce local opposition, with one mayor describing it as ""the most divisive matter that has affected the city in my time"". The Property Council has commissioned research that found there was a visceral negative reaction when density and urban infill were mentioned. ""Quotes we heard were 'it makes me think of overcrowding' and 'a tightly packed neighbourhood where no-one has any yard and your house takes up 99 per cent of your block',"" Property Council executive director Sandra Brewer told Di Darmody on ABC Radio Perth. Anabel Pandiella lives in a ""a two-and-a-half bedder"" with her husband and two kids, but she wouldn't change it even though all their friends live in houses. ""Their natural reaction is to imagine urban density in its extreme and to think 'I will be less safe'."" But when the survey asked people what they did want from their neighbourhoods, she said people described characteristics compatible with medium to high density housing. ""What people want from their suburb is to feel safe and to be able get around easily — to be able to go down the shops, pick up the kids from school, on a whim to be able to go out and about,"" Ms Brewer said. ""They want a cultural vibe, things going on, busy cafes. ""People are beginning to recognise that more people living [in] and attracted to an area makes it viable for new shops and cafes and services to thrive but also stay open longer,"" she said. Samantha Reece has taken the fears around apartment living one step further by founding a lobby group, WA Apartment Advocacy (WAAA), and is inviting apartment sceptics to try living in one to see if the reality matches up with the image. A recent survey by WAAA of 3,300 apartment dwellers in Australia found that 70 per cent of residents were professionals or managers and 23 per cent were retirees but Ms Reece said apartments were often characterised as bringing social dysfunction to an area and destroying community. ""I often say to people 'it's surprising no-one actually ticked drug dealer' because that's the impression that some of these groups like to reflect — that people who move into apartments are a second-class citizen,"" she said. ""That's not the case, they just want to live in a smaller space. That is their preference and we actually need to provide that housing choice."" The latest apartment trial participant was Jorja Woolton, who moved from a family home in Perth's southern suburbs to a 54-square-metre one-bedroom apartment in Rivervale, just 10 minutes' drive from the city, for a three-month trial. ""It was a big learning experience,"" she said. Ms Woolton's biggest fears were that it would be both noisy and claustrophobic, but she found it was neither. Is it possible to create a liveable apartment in just 24 square metres? That's the size of just two parking spaces. One of the biggest things that trading a larger living space for the inner city gave her was time, in the form of a drastically shorter commute. ""Back home it would take me at least an hour to and from work on the freeway, it was always very temperamental,"" she said. ""I work in Subiaco so some days [from the apartment] it was just 15 minutes, super quick. ""I spent less time driving and more time like doing my own thing after work, which was nice."" Ms Woolton also enjoyed the benefits of higher density life. ""There's always so much around apartments whereas living in a house, in a suburb, you've got to drive to everything,"" she said. ""Here there are always lots of cafes and everything is close by. ""I think I could definitely see myself living in an apartment, I think it's very much something I would prefer over living in a house."" All of WAAA's apartment trial participants have become valuable publicists for apartment living, reporting surprise at how much they liked it. But it does beg the question: will the State Government have to provide free trials to thousands of people to get a shift in mindset? Hopefully not, laughed Ms Reece, adding that the trial participants' experiences had been influential. ""I think that's going to instil a level of confidence in people who maybe have thought about it,"" she said. At home in her two-bedroom micro lot house, Ms Stephens is convinced smaller living is the answer to housing affordability. Her two-bedroom house cost just $340,000 and is opposite a park, and is walking distance from shops, schools, and the planned rail line to the city. ""For people to have their dream of having their own home, it had to change, it had to become something that was achievable and affordable for people,"" she said. ""In a perfect world everyone would want to have the quarter-acre block that you used to have, but it's not going to happen.""

284,Kim Forrest and her husband got an instore credit card. Then they were sued for bankruptcy,house-and-home,"  Debt collectors are bankrupting Australians over small credit card debts For Kim Forrest and her husband, money has always been tight, but they have managed and, until recently, believed they were on track for retirement. The Forrests had a mortgage and several other debts, but it was a $9,600 credit card debt that threatened to undo it all. In March, Ms Forrest said she received letters from organisations offering to assist the couple with their bankruptcy. The word ""bankruptcy"" was news to her. ""I just rang them and I said, 'What's going on? What's this bankruptcy about?',"" she said. ""And they said, 'well you'd better ring Lion Finance'."" Ms Forrest learned the couple's only asset, their home, could be put in the hands of a trustee unless they came up with thousands of dollars in 21 days. Kim and Steven Forrest, now 55, have been together since they were teenagers. They raised their five children in public housing just outside Newcastle while Ms Forrest worked as a chef and her husband drove trucks. ""We've never had any money. We're happy without money because we've got each other. It's never, ever about money,"" she said. They survived the collapse of their small transport business in the late 90s and bought their modest home when they were in their 40s. ""This was our very first home. It's just amazing this house, we love it, it's home,"" Ms Forrest said. About five years ago, they bought a bed and a washing machine using a credit card with an interest-free period. They continued using the card for several years. When the interest-free period expired, Ms Forrest said they began paying an interest rate of nearly 30 per cent. When she was injured and forced to drop out of the workforce, managing their finances became a struggle. Along with their mortgage, there were bills and other ongoing direct debits, including their car finance. They were churning through the one wage they had coming in. ""It's very, very tough. I mean we had two wages coming in for years,"" Ms Forrest said. ""Now it's just Steven, he's the sole breadwinner which is pretty hard."" As they battled to keep up, their repayments to the credit card debt became irregular and eventually stopped. In May 2018, the credit card company sold the debt to collector Lion Finance — a common practice in the banking sector. Debt collectors pay less than the debt is worth for the chance to chase down the entire sum, while the bank gets part of the loan paid out rather than writing off the full amount or waiting years to recoup payments. Once the debt collector took over the couple's debt, Ms Forrest re-commenced repayments at $50 a week. But in September 2018, Lion Finance, owned by the publicly listed Collection House Limited, took the first step in the legal process to recover the debt. In court, the debt collector claimed Steven owed more than $11,000. In Australia, an individual can be sued for bankruptcy for an unpaid debt of as little as $5,000. Last year, consumer advocates became increasingly alarmed by the number of clients being taken to court over relatively small debts by one company in particular — Lion Finance. They decided to do some research, analysing court lists over the past four years. Their data, released exclusively to the ABC, backed up their suspicions. ""Lion Finance stands out as the debt collector using bankruptcy proceedings so much more frequently than any other debt collector in the market that it's absolutely astounding,"" Financial Rights Legal Centre's Karen Cox said. When it comes to the number of bankruptcy cases filed in the past financial year, Lion Finance was not far behind the Australian Tax Office (ATO). But while the ATO halved the number of people it sued for bankruptcy from 1,215 in the 2015-16 financial year to 543 in last financial year, Lion Finance increased its cases from 182 to 512 people in the same period. ""Whereas most debt collectors ... have been using bankruptcy proceedings less and less, Lion Finance has been a growing user, the numbers of bankruptcies are just going through the roof,"" Ms Cox said. Ms Cox said bankruptcy would normally only be used if the debtor had an asset like a house. Lion Finance declined the ABC's request for an interview, but in a statement from its parent company Collection House Limited said it made every effort to avoid legal action. ""We encourage customers to engage with us so we can discuss and assess their financial circumstances and avoid the legal process,"" it said. The company would not comment on individual cases, but said its approach was different for vulnerable customers and ""those assessed as having the capacity yet an unwillingness to engage with us to meet their financial obligations"". Once an individual is made bankrupt, their assets are taken over by a trustee and sold to pay off their debts. The trustee also charges the debtor tens of thousands of dollars. ""Bankruptcy proceedings should be used as a last resort, [because] the impact on the debtor of bankruptcy proceedings is profound,"" Ms Cox said. ""They will not be able to travel overseas without the permission of the trustee. ""In some cases, their employment may be limited [and in] some occupations, you are not allowed to continue as a bankrupt."" In Steven and Kim's case, their home would be sold by the trustee to pay off their credit card debt. ""You can't explain how frightening that is. To know that they can take something away like our house,"" Ms Forrest said. ""Then it's embarrassing. You work hard ... and at our age we'd never be able to start again."" Lion Finance said its focus was always on helping customers ""rehabilitate their finances, enabling them to get back on the road to financial freedom"". As well as Lion Finance, Collection House Limited owns legal practice CLH Lawyers, which prosecutes its bankruptcy claims. The company adds costs during the process, which can triple the amount owed by debtors within months. ""A debt of $5,000, by the time you get to creditors' petition can easily be $10-15,000, with the addition of interest and legal fees,"" Ms Cox said. In 2017, Collection House's half-year report described how it was ""tightening up"" its legal process and taking a ""firmer but fair position with customers who refuse to meet their obligations"". Put simply, it was going to start suing more people for bankruptcy. According to the company, the benefits of this tactic were that it: The tactic worked to recover Kim and Steven's debt, but the couple said the experience felt far from fair. ""I've heard of blokes with a credit card debt and their wages are garnished,"" Mr Forrest said. ""Why didn't that happen? Why did it go straight to bankruptcy? ""Bankruptcy's a pretty big thing, well it is to me."" Over the past few months, the ABC has spoken to 22 people across Australia who have been sued for bankruptcy by Lion Finance. The people the ABC spoke to described the company as aggressive, difficult to negotiate with and determined to litigate. Some had lost their homes. Others borrowed tens of thousands of dollars from family or friends to stay afloat. Almost everyone was too ashamed to speak publicly. NT Parliamentarian Jeff Collins was not. As a former commercial barrister, union representative and firefighter, Mr Collins was used to having a powerful voice. Although he has had financial trouble before, nothing prepared him for his encounter with Lion Finance. ""They have no moral code,"" Mr Collins said. His story goes like many others: a marriage break-down, coupled with spiralling debt and a credit card he failed to keep on top of. ""I was earning good money, but I was also paying back a lot of debt,"" he said. He defaulted on his credit card, which he ran up to $5,950, and BankWest sold the debt to Lion Finance in March 2014. Nearly two years later, after failed repayment negotiations, Lion Finance took him to court, which ordered $100 a fortnight be taken from his wages. When he was elected to the NT Parliament in August 2016, the company was told of his new circumstances. Seven weeks later, in October the same year, he recommenced his payments, this time making regular deposits into their account. ""I received no correspondence, no communication, no telephone calls,"" Mr Collins said. ""Then I was served with a bankruptcy notice in August of 2017, which came as a complete surprise because I'd been paying the instalment amount,"" he said. Mr Collins successfully challenged the bankruptcy in court, and has since paid off his debt which, with added interest and fees, came to nearly $13,000. But the experience left him determined to break the ""cone of silence"" many others felt in the same position. ""I don't consider myself particularly vulnerable. I've earned good money,"" Mr Collins said. ""That must be a lot more difficult for other people and when you've got people like Lion Finance pursuing you and making your life a misery. ""It just makes everything so much harder to try and get your life back on the rails."" Lion Finance said it was confident in its procedures and practices in relation to the two cases featured in this story. ""It is a matter of public record that neither of these individuals were made bankrupt by Lion Finance,"" its statement read. Consumer finance groups want an urgent overhaul of Australian laws to lift the minimum amount for suing for bankruptcy from $5,000 to $50,000 to stop companies like Lion Finance using the courts to pursue vulnerable people. ""When you look at the amounts of credit people are given without even blinking, setting it at $5,000 is just ridiculously low,"" Ms Cox said. She said part of the problem was credit being offered without proper checks to make sure a customer could afford the debt, particularly when retailers offered cards with interest-only periods. ""Quite often the limit on the credit card is thousands and thousands of dollars more than what you require to make the purchase,"" Ms Cox said. ""And then there are strong incentives and marketing sent out to encourage those people to take out the remaining limit. ""That's definitely part of the problem and bankruptcy shouldn't be part of the solution."" Mr Collins said he thought a more reasonable threshold would be $20,000. He also wants more funding for community legal services and an alternative means of mediation to deal with amounts between $5,000 and $20,000. ""The bankruptcy proceedings [are] intimidation,"" Mr Collins said. ""It's about trying to force you to go ahead and beg, borrow, steal to get that money to pay them upfront, rather than come to a reasonable agreement about an instalment plan."" In mid-July, after seeking help from Financial Rights Legal Centre and the ombudsman, Kim and Steven Forrest reached a deal with Lion Finance. Lion Finance wanted the couple to pay $17,500 to settle the debt, but Ms Forrest asked for more information about the extra costs. After that, Lion Finance agreed to settle for the original $11,500 amount ordered by the court. The family borrowed the money from a peer-to-peer loan provider to clear their debt and last week the court matter was dropped. But the family said they faced a new fight to clean up Mr Forrest's credit score. ""It just takes a toll on you, it takes a toll on your marriage, it's heartbreaking really,"" he said. And while the spectre of bankruptcy no longer hangs over his head, Mr Forrest cannot spend as much time with his family as he'd like. He will keep driving until the debt is paid. ""I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I thought I'd lost everything over $10,000. It's just stupid,"" Mr Forrest said. ""They're ruthless, I've never dealt with anyone like them and never again.""

285,DIY renovators warned they could become part of 'third wave' of asbestos cancer victims,house-and-home,"  DIY renovators warned they're 'putting their families' lives at risk' because of hidden asbestos in suburban homes The lawyer for a man awarded a landmark $3 million payout from asbestos maker James Hardie has warned that the rise in popularity of home renovation TV shows could be putting more lives at risk. Adelaide's Mathew Werfel, 42, was exposed to asbestos while renovating two homes in the late 1990s and early 2000s and was recently diagnosed with a rare form of mesothelioma. Unaware that the homes contained asbestos, he was diagnosed in 2017 after he discovered a lump on the inside of his right leg. He is what is known as the third wave of asbestos victims, people who come into contact with asbestos which is already present in a home during renovations. Channel Seven's House Rules and Channel Nine's The Block are among two of the top home renovation shows in Australia, which promote making remarkable changes to homes in short time frames. However, Mr Werfel's lawyer, Annie Hoffman, said the rise in popularity of the shows and home renovations was increasing the danger. ""People take it upon themselves to do these types of renovations themselves without the knowledge and understanding that they could be putting their own lives at risk and the lives of their families at risk when doing it,"" she said. ""With a lot of DIY-type renovator shows on TV at the moment, many Australians are turning to do those jobs themselves and putting themselves and the lives of their families at risk unknowingly."" She said there was a ""huge lack of awareness"" about the specific dangers of asbestos and more needed to be done to raise awareness. ""The vast majority of Australians do not have enough knowledge to protect themselves against the risks … they don't know how to identify these products,"" she said. ""It is impossible to quantify the number of people who will contract mesothelioma as a result of doing home renovations."" She is calling for James Hardie to fund a mass media campaign to warn the Australian public about their product and the fact that there was still a hidden danger. She said there was no evidence the company had ever considered running this type of awareness campaign. ""They had a slogan that they used … 'renovate, don't relocate',"" she said. ""So, they knew that people would be carrying out the type of work that Matthew [Werfel] was carrying out on their home. ""And in knowing that, they must have known that people would come across the existing asbestos materials, including existing James Hardie asbestos materials when doing those renovations."" In a statement, a Channel Seven spokesperson said precautions were made on all worksites during filming and production of House Rules. ""House Rules worksites are governed by best practice health and safety rules and regulations,"" the spokesperson said. ""In particular with asbestos, we have very clear and precise guidelines. ""Until the experts give the all clear and declare a building safe, the whole site is off limits."" A spokesperson from Channel 9 said similar regulations were in place during production of The Block and multiple warnings were aired. ""We take the issue of asbestos safety seriously,"" a spokesperson said. ""Appropriate checks and management of the building site around asbestos and the many other occupational health and safety regulations are stringently adhered and have been an integral part of the show over the past 15 series. ""Over the years we have aired multiple warnings around the risks of asbestos."" Bunnings — one of Australia's leading hardware stores — has also addressed its concern with asbestos and the dangers it posed to home renovators. Managing director Mike Schneider said Bunnings had actively supported asbestos awareness campaigns, including Asbestos Awareness Month in November. ""We absolutely recognise the need to ensure renovators are aware of the risk of asbestos exposure,"" he said. ""In SA specifically, this includes providing display tables and information throughout Asbestos Awareness Month, with 'Betty the Asbestos Bus' visiting stores as well as having relevant representatives in store to talk to customers throughout the year and providing information for stores to give customers. He said Bunnings was also meeting with the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency on a number of initiatives. Another joining the fight for more awareness is Lesley Shears from the Asbestos Victims Association South Australia, who said home renovating was now a ""really risky business"". She said renovators needed to know what they were dealing with. ""If your house was built between the 1950s and the 1980s it is highly likely to contain some asbestos,"" she told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""The post-war housing boom in the 1950s when there was a shortage of building materials, people thought asbestos panels were just the best thing. ""We desperately want to educate people … we need a nationwide campaign."" Peter Tighe is the chair of the Asbestos Diseases Research Institute and said the need to get information to the public was ""really critical"". ""The thing that most Australians don't realise is there are over 3,000 products that contained asbestos that were used in the building industry in Australia,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""One in three houses in Australia have asbestos-containing material in them. ""The issue about getting information out to the public is really critical, especially for DIY home renovators."" He also sounded out a warning to home renovators to make sure all materials and worksites had been checked. ""The fibres are microscopic, they can sit in the air for up to three days and we don't know what the safe level of exposure is … it's a very invasive fibre,"" he said.

286,Nick went on a holiday and came back to find his house 'literally falling away',house-and-home,"  Tasmanian families watching homes 'literally fall away' fight for landslide compensation When Nick Daking and his family came back from a holiday to find a small crack between their garage and their house, they had no idea what was to come. ""Twelve weeks later it was on the ground,"" the businessman and local councillor from Launceston, in Tasmania's north, said. ""At the time we had our daughter who was four weeks old. ""We had to rip the kids out of school and go and find a place to live somewhere and we had to heavily rely on friends and family to get back on our feet."" Mr Daking bought his family's property in Deviot, on the banks of the Tamar River, in 2014, and was never told the area was known for landslides — also known as landslips. Heavy rain in 2016 caused part of the house to collapse and that section has since had to be demolished. The Dakings are one of five Deviot families who are now seeking financial compensation from the Tasmanian Government and the West Tamar Council because of the landslides. Mr Daking said it had been a ""massive financial strain"" for his family. ""You see your home literally fall away and you have to get the power cables cut down, the water turned off … you've probably seen $500,000 just float down the river,"" he said. ""Then your bank rings up and asks for your property to be re-valued because they're potentially worried about their security … to top it off, last week I got a rates notice."" That rates notice from the council was reversed after Mr Daking queried it. The Lazenbys are living a similar ""nightmare"" watching their property fall apart. They only built their house in 2011, but have since spent $350,000 repairing the damage — propping it up to stop it from collapsing. Every time it rains, the damage gets worse. ""[In] the winter of 2013 we had extremely heavy rainfall and that precipitation caused massive cracks to start within our house, which we couldn't understand,"" Clare Lazenby said. ""It had all been architecturally and engineered correctly and to all the specifications the [West Tamar Council] had given us. ""We started to notice our front bedroom was beginning to drop. ""We were noticing our sliding doors wouldn't close and that was beginning of the whole thing. Mrs Lazenby said the ordeal had ""been a nightmare"". ""I would like the Government to understand the impacts on us — financially and emotionally and physically,"" she said. ""I had a fall on the landslip which caused me four breaks and smashed my head open. ""We live with the stress, we don't know when the next slip is going to be coming and it can come anytime. ""We need to go to bed and not stress."" Kerry Finch, the Legislative Councillor for Rosevears, which takes in the West Tamar, has taken the concerns of Deviot residents to Tasmania's Upper House. On Tuesday, Upper House members voted in support of a motion to urge the West Tamar Council and State Government to resolve the matter ""as a priority"" and provide ""appropriate compensation for those properties seriously affected"". Mr Finch said landslides at the site, which is also known as Brickmakers Point, have occurred for more than a century, but neither the council, nor the State Government ever warned new homeowners of the risks, despite approving new building applications. ""I feel that with mistakes that have been made in the past by planners, there is a responsibility to look after these people,"" he said. He said the building planning maps for Deviot were not right. ""The significant landslide risk that existed was not recognised,"" Mr Finch said. ""This mistake was largely responsible for the surprise experienced by residents at the time of the 2016 slip and the damage that it brought to their homes."" He said both state and local governments had been ""asleep at the wheel"" and had ""a case to answer"". The West Tamar Council has recently spent $150,000 on a report looking at the cause of the Deviot landslides. The region's Mayor Christina Holmdahl said that report will be tabled to the council on August 20. ""The report that will be going to council will primarily be about the causational factors that brought on the landslip and how those causes can be mitigated for people,"" Ms Holmdahl said. ""Financial assistance was not a part of this report … that will be a separate project once this report has been passed onto the State Government."" The council is expected to endorse the landslip mitigation report before it's passed on to the State Government. Treasurer Peter Gutwein said the Government had been working with the council and ""looking at options"". When asked about possible compensation he said he did not want to ""rule anything in or out at this stage"".

287,analysis: Feeling worse off despite changing gender roles and less reliance on welfare? You're not alone,house-and-home,"  HILDA can explain why you feel no better off than 10 years ago During the election campaign then-opposition leader Bill Shorten repeatedly claimed that everything was going up. ""Childcare is up 28 per cent, out of pockets to see the doctor up 20 per cent, specialists … up nearly 40 per cent,"" he said. And then the punchline: ""Everything is going up, except your wages."" Statistically, it wasn't true. The official rate of inflation was just 1.3 per cent. The official rate of wage growth was 2.3 per cent. I haven't asked him, but I wouldn't be surprised if he kept saying it because his focus groups told him that's what people felt. Today's release of the 17th wave of Australia's Household, Income and Labour Dynamics Survey (HILDA) tells us that despite the official statistics, people were right to feel they were going backwards. Funded by the Australian government and managed by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, HILDA is one of the most valuable tools Australian social researchers have. It examined the lives of 14,000 Australians in 2001 and then kept coming back to them each year to discover what had changed. By surveying their children as well, and in future surveying their children, it will be able to build up a long-term picture of how circumstances change over the course of lives and generations. It can be thought of as Australia's Seven Up!, the British TV series that keeps going back for updates on the lives of 14 people it first examined when they were seven. Except that HILDA's results have statistical significance, and the questions are detailed, asking among other things about depression and anxiety, work-life stress, stress in relationships, and illicit drug use. The Australian Bureau of Statistics does indeed find that wages are climbing faster than prices, as they almost always have, but because it doesn't examine what happens to a particular household over time it can tell us little about whether an individual's experience of things is getting better or getting worse. HILDA gets a handle on each household's disposable income by asking each member of the household about their gross income from wages, benefits, investments and other sources and then deducting its estimate of taxes. It gets a handle on the real (inflation-adjusted) changes by adjusting its totals for changes in the consumer price index. It finds that for the thousands of households it interviewed, real disposable income grew strongly during the first nine years of the survey, between 2001 and 2009. Then, after the global financial crisis, for the eight years between 2009 and the 2017 results released today, that growth stalled. Expressed in today's dollars, the average annual real disposable income of those households climbed by $19,773 between 2001 and 2009, about $2,472 per year. But most of the growth was during the mining boom that stretched from 2003 to 2009 when the average annual real disposable household income climbed about $3,000 per year, as did the income of the more representative median (or middle) household. Since 2009 and the global financial crisis, the average and the median have moved in different directions. The average household's annual real disposable income has climbed a further $3,156. The median (or typical) household's income has fallen $542, although not steadily. The graph shows it falling between 2009 and 2011, climbing in 2012, and changing little thereafter. It has also become harder to ""get ahead"", in the phrase used often by the Prime Minister. Between 2001 and 2005, 40 per cent of the households in the bottom fifth of earners (the bottom quintile) moved out of it into a higher one. In more recent years, between 2012 and 2016, a lower 38.5 per cent moved up. Between 2001 and 2005, 44 per cent of the households in the top quintile had to move down to let other households take their place. In more recent years, between 2012 and 2016, only 41.5 per cent have moved down. Getting a long way out of the income circumstances you were born in is a long shot, according to HILDA's early attempt at measuring intergenerational mobility. People who were 32-34 years old in 2015-17 are highly likely to be in the same household income quintiles as those people found themselves in when they were 15-17 back in 2001-03. There's only a one in 10 chance of moving from the bottom quintile as a teenager to the top quintile in your early thirties. There's a 37 per cent chance you'll stay put. Even among teenagers who grew up in the middle quintile, there's only a 17 per cent chance of making it to the top, along with a 19 per cent chance of moving one rung up. Interestingly, women turn out to be more tied to the income their families had when they were children than men, and both men and women tend to stay more closely tied to their mother's income than their father's. When HILDA began in 2001, 39 per cent of Australians aged 18 to 64 were living in a household that received government welfare of some kind. By 2017, that proportion had fallen to 31 per cent, but almost all of the drop happened before the global financial crisis in 2009. Most of us are still in households that have received something from the government over a 10-year period: 58 per cent of working-age Australians in 2017, down from 64 per cent in 2010. Among older Australians aged 65 and over, reliance on the age pension and other benefits for more than half of income needs has dropped from 60 per cent to 51 per cent. Among new retirees aged 65 and over, the proportion receiving the age pension has fallen from 76 per cent of men and 74 per cent of women to just 60 per cent of men and 55 per cent of women. But while the growth of compulsory superannuation is likely to be part of the story, almost all of the decline happened before the financial crisis in 2009, suggesting that the destruction of wealth in the crisis kept people on the pension who otherwise might not have needed it. Before the financial crisis, almost three quarters (73 per cent) of men of traditional working age were employed full-time. After the crisis, the rate slipped to a much lower 67 per cent and stayed there. Female full-time employment was also hit by the crisis but has since almost totally recovered to be just a fraction below its pre-crisis peak of 39.6 per cent. Women's hourly earnings are also climbing faster than men's, up 24 per cent between 2001 and 2017, compared to 21 per cent for men's. While women have always been more likely than men to be employed casually, since the crisis male casual employment has climbed while female casual employment has declined. The two are now as close as they have ever been, with women now only six percentage points more likely than men to be employed causally. In dual-earner male-female couples, the proportion in which the woman earns more than the man has climbed from 22 per cent to 25 per cent. The woman being the main breadwinner is more common in couples that aren't legally married and don't have children. It is also far more common in the regions than in cities and among couples in which the man doesn't have a university degree. Men in predominantly female-breadwinner households are somewhat less happy with their lives and with their relationships, as (perhaps surprisingly) are women. Fathers tend to agonise more about work-family conflict than mothers, notwithstanding the much greater amount of housework and childcare work performed by mothers. The men who worry the most work long hours, have irregular shifts and very young children. A mother working the same hours as a father will typically be more conflicted. Most parents suffering high work-family conflict get out of it within a year or two, often by managing things better and sometimes by changing jobs. Those suffering high work-family conflict are 50 per cent more likely than others to separate the next year. HILDA's great strength is that it will be able to follow those parents and their children and all the other families it surveys and tell us what happens next. Rather than being an Australian version of Seven Up!, it might be better described as Australia's never-ending story. Its co-director Roger Wilkins says its design allows it to be ""infinitely lived"". Peter Martin is a visiting fellow at the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University.

288,"Hoarding can start in childhood and often runs in the family, research finds",house-and-home,"  Hoarding symptoms can start as early as childhood, and often run in the family, researchers say Since a flood eight years ago, Julie has slept in her living room. Water caused significant damage to the internal flooring of her rental unit, and until recently there was so much clutter that repairers could not put down new carpet in her bedroom. She has not used her second bedroom for the same reason. This is the best Julie, who requested we not use her last name, can remember her home ever looking. As a child, she kept anything she could get her hands on — especially catalogues, makeup and second-hand clothing — even the stuff that did not fit. She remembered her father was also an avid collector. Now, after a lifetime of being surrounded by clutter, she is finally getting help for her hoarding. She is still paying $250 a month for a storage unit brimming with gear, and there is her garage, but after months of dedicated decluttering the ""goat trails"" she used to navigate her home with are almost gone. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) pays for a cleaner to help her stay on top of her housework, and a decluttering expert comes by once a week. Friends and family also chip in. It is just in time. She has an inspection coming up. ""My tenancy has been threatened. I have to clean things up or I'd be evicted,"" she said. ""If I've gotten rid of enough stuff, they're going to paint and recarpet."" Hoarding was not classified as its own disorder until 2013. Before that, it was considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). According to research from the University of New South Wales, 1.2 million Australians meet the DSM-5 criteria for hoarding disorder. What factors are at play with this disorder that is typified by excessive behaviour, disorganisation and an inability to let anything go? Although it is commonly associated with older people, researchers say hoarding can start earlier than we might think. ""From what we know in the literature and from clinical experience, hoarding actually starts relatively earlier in life — usually during early adulthood,"" said Maja Nedeljkovic, an associate professor of psychology from Swinburne University of Technology. Part of what makes hoarding difficult to diagnose early in life is it is hard to pick up on in shared environments where the clutter is confined to a bedroom or a cupboard, like share houses or the family home. Associate Professor Nedeljkovic said although studies had shown children could show hoarding symptoms, there was comparatively little research about hoarding disorder in children. ""Some of the studies in paediatric OCD have shown that, in some of the samples, half of the children presenting with OCD had predominately hoarding symptoms,"" she said. ""There is very little research into the onset of hoarding in childhood. That's partly because the diagnosis is relatively new, so much of the research is lagging because the studies were done with OCD patients."" Associate Professor Nedeljkovic said it was common for hoarding to run in the family. ""Some of the studies show that individuals with hoarding are more likely to have a family member who has hoarded before,"" she said. ""It's very difficult to say whether there is a genetic vulnerability or maybe that there is a learned, environmental vulnerability."" Jess, who requested we only use her first name, has hoarded since she was in primary school. She collected old coins and odds and ends from hard rubbish and kept them in tins, which she hid around the house. ""I used to be a shocking newspaper collector, that was one of the early warning signs,"" she said. Jess's affinity with objects has continued her whole life. ""In my mind, it's my little safe space — my feathered nest,"" she said. ""I feel in my own little world, because it is a bit of a world, a hoarder's house … [where] there's more stuff in it than probably the Melbourne Museum."" Much later, she reflected on her mum's affinity for collecting objects: how every wall in her childhood home was lined with books and how the sheds at the family's property slowly filled to the brim. ""It was only really when I got trapped in this hoarding stuff that I began to realise Mum was a hoarder,"" she said. While most people would not have trouble throwing out outdated newspapers, unused crockery or clothes that do not fit, it is a different story for people with hoarding disorder. ""It's one of the rare mental illnesses that has such a physical manifestation of ill health,"" said Melbourne-based hoarding practitioner Tania Reid. ""Because people are so attached to their belongings, they fear people taking them away."" Reality programs about hoarding tap into this fear. The big reveal — an uncluttered, clean home — might look good for television, but it can have unintended consequences for people with hoarding disorder. ""They do the quick clean-up, everybody else is making decisions for people, it's shaming people,"" she said. ""It's trauma porn."" In 2016, Jess began getting help for her hoarding after her unit was deemed a fire risk. ""I always knew I had a problem, but I guess because I didn't have rotting food and animal poo in the house, I didn't think I was a 'hoarder' hoarder,"" she said. ""I think I was in denial for quite a while, I just was so emotionally attached to my stuff that I couldn't see anything else and I couldn't see it wasn't normal."" In Jess's case, a cluttered house full of collected treasures was the norm — it was how she had grown up. It is a common enough story for children of hoarders. ""In cases where it's a familial thing, you will get people within a family where there's a parent and their teenagers — they're all cluttering and hoarding,"" said clinical psychologist and hoarding expert Dr Christopher Mogan. ""They don't know anything different."" Dr Mogan said children as young as eight years old could be affected, and that clutter could act as a kind of protective layer. ""As one lady explained it to me, she surrounded herself with clutter so she could not be hurt by her family taking things that were precious because they wouldn't know what was precious,"" he said. ""The whole of her room was inches high in rubbish and papers and stuff."" There is no quick fix to hoarding — a quick clean is not an option when so much of a person's identity is tied up with what they collect. Julie said the road to recovery was arduous. ""It's something that you really have to do a lot of on your own, because if you do have someone come in and clear out the stuff, you're not going to know what they're going to throw out, so you have to be a part of the process,"" she said. Jess, who is getting help with her hoarding, said her 'feathered nest' had begun to constrict her. ""I'm stuck, surrounded — a prisoner in my house full of things,"" Jess said. ""I've really shut down. I don't want to build friendships with people because I'm too embarrassed. ""They ask me to their house and I can't ask them to mine.""

289,"Noosa declares climate emergency, considers warning homebuyers of future flood risks",house-and-home,"  If your coastal home could be threatened by flooding 80 years from now, would you want to know? If your home is at risk of being flooded in 80 years' time because of climate change — would you want to know? And would you be happy if others knew the possible dangers when you tried to sell it? The threat of climate change to Australia's coastal areas is on the mind of some, with news the luxury seaside shire of Noosa in south-east Queensland is formally declaring a ""climate emergency"". Around the world, about 740 governments have done the same, including many in Australia along with world cities such as Paris and New York. But that is not all. The Noosa Shire is also working out which parts of its coastline are at risk from climate change, and which plots of highly valuable land could be at risk of flooding in the future. The latest figures from the Department of Environment warn a sea level rise of 1.1 metres, considered a high-end scenario, would cost $226 billion nationally by the end of the century. If that eventuates, it would put up to 68,000 homes at risk in Queensland and the same number in New South Wales. In Victoria and South Australia, it would be up to 48,000 homes, up to 30,000 in Western Australia and up to 15,000 in Tasmania. Every coastal community in Australia is doing its own mapping, but Noosa may take it a step further. The Noosa Shire is now considering how best to warn owners, both current and future, about the risk. Councillors say the estimated 2,232 Noosa properties likely to be affected by storm flooding in 80 years' time could be told directly via rates notices. Possible buyers may also be alerted through routine property or rates searches. Noosa Mayor Tony Wellington said it was ""a problem that every coastal council is facing around the world now — and it's an issue of defend or retreat obviously"". ""What we have to look at is whether it is feasible and possible to defend property, in a worst-case scenario, or whether it is not possible, and what the cost implications are,"" he said. ""And then you have to ask whether all residents should be funding for protection of a few properties. ""It's a very complicated issue."" The Mayor also said it was a matter of ""buyer beware"" and those in low-lying areas ought to know the risks. In 2015, a report to Byron Bay Council warned that certain homes may become ""voluntary house purchases"" where the council buys homes at risk of flooding ""to reduce risk to life and limb"". Antonia Mercorella from the Real Estate Industry of Queensland said a climate change warning could scare off some buyers ""at a psychological level"". But she said that effect could be short-lived, or even ignored by those particularly keen on living near the coast. ""The reality is, many of us choose to live along the coast because it's a lifestyle decision,"" Ms Mercorella said. ""Only time will tell if climate change and coastal issues such as tide, inundation and erosion will start to have a detrimental impact on property value — certainly the data is not telling us that right now. ""But decades into the future, we might start to say that has an impact."" The Insurance Council of Australia said climate declarations and long-term fears of flooding would not affect premiums, but actual storm or water damage could. ""If you're already at risk and climate change predicts that you will become further exposed, then your premiums over the next 30–80 years will go up to reflect changes in that risk,"" the council's Campbell Fuller said. The Local Government Association of Queensland (LGAQ) represents all local governments in Queensland, and is working with the State to ensure homeowners know if their properties are at risk. LGAQ boss Greg Hallam said it is not about spreading fear. ""We don't to be alarmist,"" he said. ""We don't want to unduly scare people and we don't want people thinking it's going to happen tomorrow. ""But as long-term planners and custodians of the land, we're duty-bound to tell people the truth.""

290,Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest snaps up iconic Old Swan Brewery site,house-and-home,"  Andrew Forrest buys Old Swan Brewery as potential new home for Minderoo Group Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest has added another iconic West Australian building to his property portfolio: the Old Swan Brewery. The heritage buildings on the Swan River could become a new home for his Minderoo Group and Minderoo Foundation, which have expanded significantly in recent years. Minderoo Group has agreed to take over the lease of the brewery buildings from Besen, the Melbourne-based company of Daniel Besen, of the renowned Australian retail family. The move comes after Minderoo's recent purchase of the Indiana tearooms site at Cottesloe beach. But while the modern beachfront building is beloved of Instagrammers, the brewery site is steeped with more historical and cultural significance. Minderoo Group declined to disclose the financial value of the deal, but its chief executive. Andrew Hagger, said the group was excited to see the site return to WA hands. ""Minderoo recognises its long and significant importance to so many West Australians and looks forward to being part of its next chapter,"" he said. For Aboriginal people, the site is the resting place of the Waugyl — the Dreamtime serpent which created the Swan River and other waterways around Perth. For this reason, many protesters fought the WA Government's plans to redevelop the brewery site in the 1980s and 1990s. The brewery buildings, dating back to 1879, are an iconic presence on the Swan River, nestled in a cover underneath Kings Park. By 1924, Swan controlled about half the state's beer market, although Swan Lager — its flagship beer known as ""super"" by many West Australians — would not be created until 1940. For parochial drinkers and history buffs, they are a reminder of a time when local beer drinkers professed loyalty to either Swan or Emu beers, even though both were brewed by the Swan Brewery from the early 20th century. WA heritage records say the existing buildings ""are a physical embodiment of the generally accepted significance of beer to the Australian ethos"". Swan shifted its brewing operations to Canning Vale in the 1980s, with the brewery buildings now housing apartments, restaurants, a car park and commercial space. Do you know more about this story? Email turner.rebecca@abc.net.au Minderoo's deal to buy the lease of the Old Swan Brewery was completed last month but needs WA Lands Minister Ben Wyatt to approve the transfer of the lease, something that is yet to be granted. Minderoo said the restaurants would continue to be sub-leased to the existing tenants.

291,Bubble-wrapped windows and door snakes: How renters are trying to fight the Canberra cold,house-and-home,"  Canberra renters advised to use bubble wrap as insulation as winter temps bite Renters in Canberra are sticking bubble wrap to their windows in a bid to retain much-needed heat and reduce their energy bills as overnight minimums continue to dive below zero. Some houses the advocacy group visited dropped to 6 degrees Celsius overnight Advocacy group Better Renting runs an initiative called 'Home Truths', a home visit system designed to help renters increase the energy efficiency of their houses with easy DIY techniques. Eliza Moloney, 26, found out about the program through a newsletter. ""Our house can get pretty cold and we find that we put the heater on but that heat doesn't retain very well,"" she said. ""Anna [Dennis from Better Renting] took us round the house and she also has some expertise so she did a bit of evaluating in what she thought was cold and where she thought draughts might be coming through."" As well as draught-proofing the front door and using a door snake for other doorways, Ms Moloney was surprised to learn about the bubble wrap solution. ""I was really shocked, Anna explained a little of the science behind it — how the air in the bubbles keeps some of the heat in,"" she said. ""I take her word for it. ""It's made a big difference, we really noticed it straight away and in the few days after were were like 'oh my goodness, it is much warmer in here'."" Ms Moloney said when Ms Dennis over a month ago she sprayed a small amount of water on the window and stuck the bubble wrap to it and it was still going strong. ""We've put it in all the areas we hang out, so our rooms as well,"" Ms Moloney said. Joel Dignam, executive director of Better Renting, said seeing how poorly insulated some Canberrans homes were was ""confronting"". ""What's striking isn't just the low quality of some of these homes but that it's almost become accepted and normal,"" he said. ""A lot of people we're coming across often have their home getting below 6 degrees [Celsius] before they put the heating on. ""Some of them had ice inside on the windows in the morning. ""Renters can't do big structural changes so we're trying to find things that'll make a little bit of different for them."" Mr Dignam said he hoped the advice the Home Truths program offered would help improve both people's quality of life and their energy consumption over winter. ""For a lot of people too it's about reducing the climate pollution as well,"" he said.

292,Meghan and Prince Harry's home renovations cost UK taxpayers $4.3m,house-and-home,"  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's home renovations cost UK taxpayers $4.3 million Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's new home was renovated with 2.4 million pounds ($4.3 million) of taxpayers' money, Buckingham Palace has revealed. The sum, part of the annual Sovereign Grant, funded the conversion of Frogmore Cottage from several separate homes into a single dwelling for the Royal couple and their son, Archie. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex paid for the fixtures, fittings and furnishings in the renovation themselves. ""The property had not been subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation in line with our responsibility to maintain the condition of the occupied royal palaces estate,"" said Keeper of the Privy Purse Michael Stevens. ""Outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property."" Out of the ashes of the disastrous 90s, a new Royal brand has emerged that's highly influential, comes with star quality, and is media managed to within an inch of its life. The 19th century cottage, in the grounds of the Queen's Windsor Castle estate, became the official residence of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex when they moved in shortly before the birth of their first child, Archie, in May. The building had been previously converted into five separate residences and royal officials had already planned to renovate it before it was agreed that it would become the pair's residence. The six-month refurbishment included new electrical wiring, replacement of defective ceiling beams and floor joists, new heating systems and the introduction of new gas and water mains. A palace source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the taxpayer grant covered the basic cost for kitchens, bathrooms and flooring — with additional outlays for anything more bespoke being met privately by the Royals, who also paid for items such as curtains and furnishings. British newspapers have reported that among the changes, the cottage now has a ""floating floor"" and a yoga studio. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will part ways with the foundation that Prince Harry established a decade ago with his brother, Prince William, to set up their own charity. Work has been ""substantially"" completed and outstanding renovations would not feature in next year's annual report, meaning the cost would be under the 350,000 pounds threshold to be included in the public report. Queen Elizabeth was very involved in the decision to allow the couple to use Frogmore Cottage and had been kept informed of the progress of the project throughout, the source said. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had previously been living in a residence in the grounds of Kensington Palace, the London home of his elder brother Prince William and his wife Kate. But since their marriage in May last year, they have been forging their own path, separating their household from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and relocating their staff to Buckingham Palace. Last week, it was announced that they were splitting from the charitable foundation the two couples had shared. The outlay on Frogmore Cottage formed part of the 82.2 million pound Sovereign Grant, a government handout to the Royal family. Twenty-five per cent of the fund comes from surplus revenue from the Crown Estate, a property portfolio owned by the monarchy. But in detailing the costings for the Frogmore project, royal accounts showed taxpayers footed the bill for $4.3 million in renovations.

293,Kimchi and Korean culture with a Tassie twist finds a market out of rural Stanley,house-and-home," ABC Rural Kimchi and Korean culture with a Tasmanian twist finds a market out of rural Stanley Sue Glynn, a Korean-born and now north-west Tasmanian kimchi maker, and her husband Tom came to Tasmania four years ago to escape the hustle and bustle of Sydney life. They live and work in the rural town of Stanley where Mrs Glynn grows the vegetable to make her family-recipe kimchi — with a unique, local twist — to sell at local markets. ""Before we got too old we wanted a different lifestyle,"" Mrs Glynn said. ""Kimchi is not just about the food. This is Korean culture."" Like many Koreans, the art of making good kimchi was passed on to Mrs Glynn through her family. It is Korea's national dish, made by fermenting seasoned vegetables, and every year families will gather and make enough of the preserve to last through the cold winters. There are hundreds of different ways to make kimchi and each family has their own special recipe. ""When you go to visit Korea, each household has nothing in the fridge but kimchi,"" Mrs Glynn said. Are there certain foods you should eat and others you should avoid to keep your gut bacteria healthy? She has continued the kimchi-making tradition since moving to Australia at the age of twenty. ""This is my personality. I like to make things on my own and feed my loved ones,"" Mrs Glynn said. When Tom and Sue met ten years ago, they quickly decided to settle in Stanley with room to grow the kimchi vegetables that Mrs Glynn decided to turn into a business. She does, however, have to cut down on the chilli powder for her Australian customers. ""Otherwise it will blow your head off,"" Mrs Glynn said. She grows a range of cabbages, daikon, garlic, turnips and kale in her garden, and adds her own Tasmanian twist in the form of organic apple cider. ""It brings such a different aroma,"" she said. Making kimchi is second nature to Mrs Glynn, but learning how to grow vegetables on a commercial scale has been a steep learning curve. She taught herself from organic farming books and watching Gardening Australia. ""Our best TV show. They tell us what to do every week and remind us [when to plant],"" she said. With kimchi's sudden fame in Australia, Mrs Glynn's produce has proven successful at local markets across Tasmania. ""It is hard work, but I really enjoy when I'm harvesting my vegetables and making my kimchi,"" she said. The couple said the community had been incredibly welcoming, with local farmers giving them growing advice and helping to set up their paddock. ""Lots and lots and lots of people have been so helpful and supportive,"" Tom Glynn said. Mr Glynn tends to his law practice in town, and is helping to set up a community bank which opened this month. They could not be happier with the move and think more Australians should move to the regions. ""It's what everyone should be doing — it's [regional Australia] crying out for these types of lifestyles. It's all set up for it,"" Mr Glynn said.

294,"Sydney housing's 'missing middle' explained, and why some people are fighting it",house-and-home,"  Sydney housing squeeze prompts push for more medium-density development Laura and Latham Keen were faced with the same choice as many young couples in Sydney — move out or move up. They could not afford a freestanding home close to their jobs in the CBD, and did not want to live in a high-rise with their 15-month-old son. The answer for their growing family was a three-bedroom townhouse in Lane Cove, on Sydney's lower north shore, 12 kilometres from the CBD. ""We spent six, seven months looking and we looked at just four townhouses in that time,"" Mr Keen said. ""There just wasn't many available. ""This ticked all the boxes and we jumped on it when we found it."" Medium-density homes like the Keens' have been dubbed Sydney's ""missing middle"" by NSW Planning Minister Rob Stokes, who believes more terrace-style housing is the solution to the city's real estate squeeze. While values have fallen by 14.5 per cent since their 2017 peak, the median price of a home in Australia's biggest metropolis remains almost $900,000. The spotlight is also on Sydney's apartment developments after two buildings in the past seven months had to be evacuated when they began cracking. ""Apartment-style living is a great choice for some but it's not necessarily for everyone,"" Mr Stokes said. ""Detached homes in the ever-expanding suburbs are out of reach for many families. ""The beauty of terrace-style housing is that it's low-rise, it's human scale, it doesn't overshadow everyone else."" Sydney's population is expected to swell to more than 8 million over the next 40 years. In a bid to begin catering for those extra residents, the Berejiklian Government last year introduced laws that make it easier to carve up existing blocks and build terraces, duplexes or manor houses. Welcome to Ryde, where the new realities of inner-city living are colliding with locals who remember life before the rush. The Low Rise Medium Density Housing Code means that style of dwelling can be built without lodging a development application (DA). ""I want us to have a choice and a spread of different housing,"" Mr Stokes said. ""If we fail to meet the housing needs of our existing and future populations we will live in a city that is increasingly divided between the haves and the have-nots."" The new rules mean a compliant development could be approved in about three weeks, compared to more than 70 days under a traditional DA process. Developers would also not be required to notify neighbours. But there is fierce opposition to the code. About 50 councils across NSW applied for an exemption when it was first introduced, but those exemptions will be lifted on July 1. Chris Johnson from Urban Taskforce, a not-for-profit group that represents prominent property developers and equity financiers in Australia, does not believe the code will provide enough new homes to house Sydney's future residents. ""We need people living in more urban locations,"" he said. ""Around railway stations, using public transport, walking to work, walking to shops — it's a change of culture, a change of living."" The president of the not-for-profit residents group Save Our Suburbs, Tony Recsei, is dedicated to fighting what he describes as ""forced rezoning"" and ""overdevelopment"" in Sydney. Record apartment rental vacancies and a softening housing market are creating an odd phenomenon — apartments with no-one in them. Mr Recsei fears medium-density housing will destroy character in leafy areas. ""It's going to completely change the whole character of the suburb,"" he said. ""It's going to have detrimental effects in terms of traffic density, parking and the characteristics of the houses themselves. ""It shouldn't be a dictatorship … the community should decide."" While terrace housing is an iconic feature of many suburbs in Sydney's east and inner west, many of those homes date back to the 1800s. Laura and Latham Keen are hoping the harbour city rediscovers its love of medium-density living. ""I grew up in this area and I would like to stay in this area,"" Ms Keen said of Sydney's lower north shore. ""It's got the schools that I know, the places I know and the people I know. ""But with the price of housing now, I can't afford a freestanding home.""

295,A powerful turning point as electricity use forecast to fall for the first time amid solar surge,house-and-home,"  Electricity demand in WA set to fall for first time, AEMO forecasts, as solar power takes over The body that runs the national wholesale electricity market is forecasting demand for electricity from households and businesses in WA will fall for the first time as the extraordinary uptake of solar panels reshapes the power system. In its latest report on the south-west wholesale electricity market, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) said it was no longer expecting the use of power drawn from the grid to increase as the state's population grew. Instead, AEMO said it was forecasting demand — or ""operational consumption"" — to fall almost 4 per cent between 2019–20 and 2027–28, bucking long-held assumptions that link power use to an economy's size. At the heart of the operator's latest forecast is the ""extraordinary"" take-up of rooftop solar power, with more than one in four homes in the south-west grid now having a solar system. AEMO said the proportion of households expected to have a solar panel installation would exceed 50 per cent within a decade, while the amount of rooftop solar capacity would rocket from about 1100 megawatts to 2500MW. This would make rooftop, or distributed, solar the biggest source of capacity in the grid by far when taken in combination. 2 million homes in Australia have solar panels — so what is going on in all those shiny rooftop structures? By contrast, the system's biggest stand-alone generator, the Muja coal-fired power plant in Collie, has a nameplate capacity of 810MW. The forecast of a fall in consumption comes after years of softness in demand driven by households and businesses using increasingly efficient appliances and installing solar panels. AEMO said since 2010–11, ""total operational consumption"" had risen by an average of just 0.1 per cent. Crucially, consumption among residential and business customers had been falling over the same period at an annual rate of 1.6 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively. The agency said that with demand set to fall among large industrial users — the only segment of the market to have grown over the past eight years — overall consumption would be dragged down. Scott Davis, who represents electricity generators and retailers as the WA head of the Australian Energy Council (AEC), said the report brought into sharp relief the changing nature of the state's power system. Mr Davis said the trend of falling demand for grid-drawn power and the increasing self-reliance of customers with solar panels also served to highlight many of the problems facing state-owned power retailer Synergy. It emerged last week that Synergy was facing losses of almost $200 million over the next four years, while it would also have to borrow up to $140 million to fund capital spending. WA's state-owned power utility Synergy will slump to almost $180 million in losses over the next four years as its financial position deteriorates. Mr Davis said Synergy was caught in a bind because consumers with solar installations were using less of the power it generated but its costs — for running its plant and accessing the power grid — were high and largely fixed. ""It links into Synergy's forecast losses,"" Mr Davis said. ""Synergy has a whole lot of fixed costs they're trying to recover from less sales because of rooftop solar."" Making matters worse for Synergy, Mr Davis said AEMO had consistently underestimated the rate at which solar panels were being added to the mix, suggesting the utility's revenues were likely to be hollowed out even faster in coming years. ""Forecasters tend to be conservative,"" he said. ""If you look at the forecast historically, I think you'll find they always under-predict the amount of rooftop solar that goes on each year."" Mr Davis said the system needed to be shaken up to ensure the costs of generating and supplying electricity at any one time were better reflected in the prices people paid for the service. Key to this was better accounting for the costs and the benefits of distributed energy resources (DER) such as solar panels, which Mr Davis said offered significant upside if accommodated properly. But he said current incentives for solar panels were leading to perverse situations. The most notable incentive was the renewable energy buyback scheme, which was administered by Synergy and regional provider Horizon Power and paid eligible customers 7.13 cents for every surplus unit of electricity their solar panels pumped back into the grid. Mr Davis said customers were paid the same rate for their surplus power regardless of how much or how little it was needed at various times of the day. An example of where this caused problems was the middle of the day, when solar output was at its highest but demand for electricity was often relatively low, especially in mild and sunny conditions in spring and autumn. In this scenario, Mr Davis said wholesale electricity prices were sometimes being driven into negative territory, meaning big fossil fuel-fired power stations were having to pay to stay online. Although he said broader reforms were necessary, Mr Davis suggested the buyback scheme should be overhauled to make sure it aligned with the economic value of any surplus power at the time it was produced. Such a scenario raised the risk of system reliability and security, he said, given conventional power plants were currently essential to maintaining frequency and voltage levels on the network. ""I think the other interesting thing that ties into this is you've still got a lot of subsidies over-incentivising things like rooftop solar,"" he said. ""We're spending a whole lot of money giving these cross-subsidies to solar customers on the demand side and then we're spending a whole lot of money on the market side to try to change everything to accommodate that. ""Are the signals to DER efficient? ""I think DER does have its place in the market and can add real value to the market, but at the moment I think some of the settings aver over-compensating."" AEMO's executive general manager in WA, Cameron Parrotte, said the rapid pace of change in the state's biggest grid was creating challenges, but he was more sanguine about dealing with them than he had been in recent years. He said for all the upheaval being caused in the wholesale market by the boom in renewable energy, WA's grid had plenty of capacity as a buffer for any supply shocks. Underpinning this was the state's so-called capacity market, which is a form of insurance that pays generators for every megawatt of power that can notionally provide at times of peak demand. But Mr Parrotte said there was also a growing recognition by the State Government that changes needed to be made to the market's structure to cope with evolving mix of generation types and demand patterns. Energy Minister Bill Johnston has outlined the Government's plans to lay out a roadmap for the industry through the Energy Transformation Taskforce, which aimed to bring together the old and the new strands of electricity generation and use in WA. ""I'm feeling a lot more confident in terms of the state's ability to work through this,"" Mr Parrotte said. ""They're not small changes but I've got a lot of faith that the technical solutions — if we don't already have them then we'll get them. ""What we've got to work through is how to do we optimise that so that we actually can incentivise the investments in the right things that ultimately result in the lowest cost outcome for consumers.""

296,How to stay warm at home without breaking the bank,house-and-home,"  Energy-efficient ways of heating your home this winter Keeping houses warm without breaking the bank can be challenging, especially during cold snaps like the one currently affecting much of southern Australia. The winter quarterly power bill makes up a significant proportion of energy costs in Tasmania, where a typical electricity account is just over $2,000 a year. Searching for a solution, some people subscribe to the urban legend that leaving your heat pump (reverse-cycle air conditioner for non-Tasmanians) going continuously is the most efficient way to keep a house warm. ""If it's on, it's using power,"" said Aurora Energy's Kaitlin Ransley, who dismissed the suggestion. ""We recommend customers turn their heat pump off at night — over a quarterly bill, you're saving 720 hours of electricity usage."" She suggested using a timer to get the heater up and running early each day. Meanwhile, Marc White from Goanna Energy told ABC Radio Hobart that using a heat pump was about balancing comfort and cost. ""Unfortunately, you can't save money by keeping the heat pump going,"" he said. ""The reason for that is that you're trying to maintain a higher temperature inside the building while the temperature outside is dropping."" The higher the temperature inside, the faster the heat was lost to outside, he said. ""What you can do is reduce the thermostat a little bit and have a more comfortable overnight experience. ""Putting the thermostat down to 18C or 19C instead of 21C is probably going to save 20 per cent. ""For every one degree on the thermostat, the extra energy cost is significant, about 10 per cent."" Ms Ransley agreed that the gauge should be ""hot, but not too hot"", recommending between 18 and 21 degrees. The secret, Mr White said, was to slow the loss of heat energy by sealing draughts, replacing window frames and installing insulation. Ms Ransley said while heat pumps were great, they were not always suitable. ""It's important to understand the room you're trying to heat as to what's going to be efficient,"" she said. ""If you're trying to heat the kids' bedroom, you can't have a heat pump in every area of the house, and if you have quite a big house, you're not going to be able to heat it all from that one heat source. ""Our message is always around people getting the right-sized heater for the right-sized room."" She suggested having a heat pump for the lounge room and bigger spaces, and then shut doors to other rooms, use electric blankets and heated throw rugs to keep warm in bedrooms and heat lights in bathrooms. Mr White said it was important to understand a heater's usage — if a 2.4-kilowatt fan heater was being used, the household could expect to pay 63 cents per hour to run it. While that might be acceptable for an hour or two a day, it was not suitable for continuous use, he said. ""If you're trying to heat a larger area like a living room, and you're running a heater for eight hours a day, then the heat pump with a coefficient of performance is much better, because one unit of electrical energy into a heat pump can produce three kilowatts of heat energy out."" Customers in Tasmania have different power tariffs: Meanwhile, wood heaters or fire places were a nice idea but not always efficient, Mr White said. ""They are lovely, but the fact is in terms of the cost of wood compared to a heat pump, they are a luxury. ""At $100 per tonne of wood, they aren't that efficient.""

297,'Medieval witch prison' dubbed Britain's 'most haunted house' up for sale,house-and-home,"  'Medieval witch prison' dubbed Britain's 'most haunted house' up for sale Britain's potentially ""most haunted house"" — a ""medieval prison for witches"" — is up for sale. The property listing, marketed by Home Domus, said the owner was seeking offers in excess of 240,000 pounds ($440,000) for the two-bedroom cottage. Real estate website Right Move described the cottage as the ""most haunted house in Essex and possibly England"". ""The Cage was a medieval prison where thirteen witches were kept in 1582 while awaiting trial. They became known as the Witches of St Osyth, and among them was the notorious Ursula Kemp,"" Home Domus wrote in its advertisement. ""At the end of the trial three were found guilty, including Ursula, and were sentenced to death by hanging."" Kemp was a midwife accused of witchcraft after young children became sick or died in her neighbourhood in St Osyth in the 16th century. The house was used to detain men, women and children up until 1908. ""Many of the subsequent owners could not handle the paranormal activities and sold on quickly,"" Home Domus said. Vanessa Mitchell has been the owner of the property, dubbed ""The Cage"", since 2004. Home Domus said Ms Mitchell only lived there briefly ""because of the relentless paranormal activity"". According to the Clacton Gazette, she fled the house because she was ""physically attacked by spirits"" while pregnant, ""witnessed mysterious blood spatters appear"" and ""even alleges she was spanked on the bottom by a demonic entity"". The paper said Ms Mitchell has repeatedly tried to sell the dwelling. It added that a walled courtyard outside the cottage leads to ""Coffin Alley"" — a passageway ""where the bodies of the dead were carried en route to the cemetery"". The house has also been the subject of a docudrama and Ms Mitchell co-authored a book called Spirits of the Cage about the ""paranormal nightmare"" of living there. ""The house has now been cleared of the many evil residents encountered over the years: a vision of a satanic-looking goat, growling moving shadows, violent rattles, drops in temperature, and visions of ghostly [figures] quite often trying to push the living down the steep staircase,"" according to the website Right Move.

298,Tiny house crowdfunding helps vulnerable women in homeless hotspot,house-and-home,"  Tiny house crowdfunding project helps vulnerable women in homeless hotspot Niki Maher was on the New South Wales Housing Register for more than 13 years before a spot finally opened up for her. But in the middle of escaping a violent relationship with her two young children, she missed the opportunity. Ms Maher said she was also struck off the list, something she only learnt about years later. The 41-year-old has been homeless for more than four years, surviving by couch-surfing and asking friends for money and, when she's really desperate, sleeping at bus shelters or on park benches. ""It's a nightmare,"" she said. ""We've gone through the Department of Housing, we've jumped through every hoop that they have three times over, only to be turned away."" Severe childhood trauma, poor physical health, and mental illness has seriously affected Ms Maher's ability to find work and a stable place to live. She has also lost custody of her children. ""Sometimes I just want to lay there and forget I'm alive … I struggle to even get up, go to bed,"" she said. ""People say 'deal with what's here and now'… but really you can't deal with that if you can't deal with the first step that you've taken."" Ms Maher is one of the thousands slipping through the cracks on the NSW Central Coast. Government figures reveal the homelessness rate skyrocketed by 75 per cent in the electorate of Gosford between 2011 and 2016 and increased by 35 percent in the Wyong region, with at least 1,000 people surviving on the streets or seeking refuge in tent cities. But the not-for-profit Tiny Homes Foundation has its sights set on a new initiative to help vulnerable women like Ms Maher. The latest Tiny Homes Foundation project comes just 12 months after the completion of its highly successful Australian-first pilot in Gosford, which now provides alternative housing for young people in their teens and early 20s, but this time it will be funded by public donations. Project manager Kellie Parkin said this latest venture aimed to help vulnerable older women, who are the fastest growing demographic experiencing homelessness, as well as mothers with young children. ""The project in Gosford has been a great success so we want to make sure it's flexible for other people,"" Ms Parkin said. Council-owned land at Umina Beach has been earmarked for the build, with properties expected to be twice the size of the last project. Existing tenant Orden D said her tiny home had given her opportunities that were not possible when she was ""refuge hopping"" up and down the east coast. Forced out of home two years ago due to physical, emotional and verbal abuse, the 17-year-old was shuffled from shelter to shelter before being settled into a tiny home in Gosford. ""When you're not going to get evicted randomly … you can focus on relationships, you get back into study, you get a job and focus on your mental health,"" she said. In the year she's been there, Orden has found a job at a fast food restaurant, completed RSA, first aid and barista courses, and has built up a credible rental history. But the teenager also admitted the model was not for everyone. ""You've got to be working or studying full time because it's not good for your mental health being in there 24/7,"" she said. ""You kind of go insane; you go a bit delirious."" She also said the lack of security around the properties was concerning. ""I've got a lot of trauma with males, it's a bit uncomfortable being the only female there … I don't feel safe in my own home,"" she said. Currently the cluster of four properties is guarded with CCTV cameras. Ms Parkin said the concerns had been taken on board and she specified the new homes would be double the size of the existing 14.4sq metre properties with bolstered security. Unlike the foundation's initial project, which was funded by a private donation, the Tiny Homes Project for Women will depend on crowdfunding. The target is $180,000 to complete the two tiny homes but the foundation was confident it would attract enough support. The unconventional funding model for the project also comes as no surprise to CoastShelter practice manager, Mary Biddle. She argued there had been a steady increase in the number of community organisations turning away from government and seeking alternative funding sources. ""Philanthropic organisations or those bodies that look after them say that there's been a 100-fold increase in applications,"" she said. Ms Biddle has worked with a number of the young people who have lived in Gosford's tiny homes and have since moved on. ""This has been a fabulous entry,"" she said. ""The importance of good budgeting, to pay rent and to look after your lifestyle. ""This is the safety net component that young people need before they really move on towards more independence in the private rental market.""

299,Woman uncovers graveyard crosses used in thrifty post-WWII reno in her bathroom wall,house-and-home,"  Woman finds makeshift graveyard in her bathroom wall Emma Strong did not know her home was host to a strange kind of graveyard until she started a home renovation. Ms Strong, from Murwillumbah in far-northern New South Wales, noticed something strange after pulling down a wall. She found crosses with names, dates and gold lettering. ""To be honest, it spooked me for the first one or two nights because our bed is right there where we're sleeping, looking at the names,"" she said. ""After the second night, we actually came to enjoy it and got to learn more about the stories, and now we're not spooked at all and we really like it."" The crosses, which date from 1945-1958, were used as temporary placeholders on graves before tombstones had been completed. The mystery of how they came to be used in the walls probably comes down to a simple case of 'waste not, want not', and someone trying to renovate resourcefully. Tweed Regional Museum curator Erika Taylor described the wall as a ""well-preserved time capsule"" that said a lot about how thrifty people were after the World War II. ""Resources and materials were scarce and every scrap of wood and metal would have been re-used,"" she said. Ms Strong has researched the people behind the memorials, and even contacted family members. ""Everyone that's come [to get their cross] has given a bit of a story about the family member and whose cross it is,"" she said. ""A lot of them have been quite significant people in the area which has been really nice and it's been really warm. It's been lovely."" For Gladys Daisy Gilliland, receiving her father's gravesite cross was a sign with special significance. ""Today is the date that Dad passed away in May 1950 — unbelievable, the same day,"" she said. ""I can't believe it, just can't believe it and my sister's just over the moon and she couldn't believe it this morning when I spoke to her either."" As for the remaining crosses, Emma and her husband are planning to honour those left behind through a memorial artwork. ""My favourite would be Margaret Cooper, her cross is beautiful,"" she said. ""It's got really beautiful information on it, it's got a lovely hand-painted angel. ""It's a stunning piece. We love it.""

300,Water restrictions are starting. Tap into what it means for you,house-and-home,"  How to save water at home during water restrictions and beyond ""Every drop counts"" has been the cliched mantra used by water experts, and for good reason, ahead of restrictions being reintroduced across Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Illawarra from this weekend. As a result of falling dam levels and the state's drought crisis, Level 1 water restrictions will apply to everyone from Saturday. There will be fines of $220 for individuals and $550 for businesses that do not comply, unless you are a non-residential customer and apply for an exemption. Source: Sydney Water Water restrictions were last in place during the millennium drought. When introduced midway through 2003, Sydney Water reported that water demand plunged in the first six months. Taking into account residential and non-residential use, it correlated to a reduction of about 20 to 30 litres per person per day. Total water demand then continued to fall and reached its lowest level under restrictions in 2008, with the average person using around 300 litres per day. Currently, each person in Sydney uses, on average, 200 litres of water a day, according to Sydney Water. ""I strongly feel [the water restrictions] are going to make a difference,"" said Ian Wright, a senior lecturer in environmental science at Western Sydney University. ""In both Melbourne and Sydney, when restrictions were imposed, demand drops, so I don't know why we ever lifted it."" Source: Sydney Water Sydney Water lifted the enforced restrictions in 2009 and replaced it with so-called water-wise rules stipulating ""commonsense behaviours"" to promote water conservation. But Mr Wright said Level 1 restrictions should be in place permanently to help change behaviours and have an ongoing impact on the environment. Sydney should follow Melbourne's example and set a community water use target of no more than 155 litres per person each day, he said. Sydney Water said the decision to raise restrictions to Level 2 (when dam levels fall to 40 per cent) or Level 3 (30 per cent) was a matter for the State Government. Infringement notices for breaching the restrictions will be issued by Sydney Water community officers. Seventy per cent of all water used in Sydney happens at home. Sydney Water advises people to take shorter showers, install water-efficient shower heads and taps with a WELS three or four-star rating, and avoid a running tap where possible, instead fill a basin to wash dishes and vegetables. ABC Radio Sydney listeners offered their tips and tricks to help save water: ""Turn the tap off when brushing your teeth. Sounds simple, but you would be surprised how many people don't do it."" — Natalie ""Thirty years ago, I started recycling all washing machine water for bathroom flushing. How is it possible to use pure water down the toilet?"" — Renee Fixing leaks around the home can also help you save up to 2,000 litres a month. That involves replacing washers on taps as soon as leaks start, and getting to know your water meter to check that it's not going up when no water is being used. Most water at home is put into the garden. Gardening Australia's top tip for reducing water use in the garden is to compost. Instead of blowing leaves into the street or adding piles to the green bin, break them down to soil. ""When you grow compost, what you're doing is creating water-holding capacity,"" Costa Georgiadis, host of Gardening Australia, said. ""When you add 0.1 per cent of organic matter to an acre, you're adding 100,000 litres of water storage. ""A compost bin underneath the mulch in your garden is like a rainwater tank — you water less, you save water, and you start to change the culture to a conservation culture."" Mr Wright also had a lawn-mowing tip: ""Keep the blade up high and the grass will keep some cover from the wind and protect the soil from drying out."" Also think about how you might be able to transport water from inside the house to the outdoors. ""We have never stopped keeping a bucket in our shower to capture the warming-up water, which we use to water plants and for other outdoor purposes."" — Wendy ""Ever since the last water restrictions, I catch every drop l use — from washing up (I have no dishwasher), from the washing machine, and even my showers — in buckets to put on my garden. My water use last bill was 34 litres a day."" — Jenny For a weekend project, consider installing drip irrigation in the garden or go bigger and install water tanks to catch rainwater. ""When we did home renovations in 2014, we installed two water tanks, each holding 3,800 litres. This flushes three toilets and waters our gardens; to think that not so long ago tanks weren't allowed in the city."" — Judith We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

301,Living tiny in an old bus — a couple's plan to escape the rat race,house-and-home,"  Couple buys a big old school bus to realise their dream of living tiny Tobias Bockholt and Marisa Schlichthorst had been following the tiny house movement online for years when, inspired by tiny house enthusiasts on Instagram, they purchased an old South Australian school bus for $4,500. Already, the couple from Torquay in Victoria have gutted the interior, added insulation and installed a miniature fireplace fittingly called the hobbit. Now, they are ready to finish painting the interior — all without going into more debt. Mr Bockholt, a secondary school teacher, and Ms Schlichthorst, a university researcher, said they wanted more time to do what they loved and less time commuting or in front of a computer screen. ""If you don't need to have 40-hour weeks to get enough income to pay for everything, then that gives you heaps more time,"" Ms Schlichthorst said. ""Breaking that trap, the rat race trap, that's what it is."" Mr Bockholt hoped to turn his boutique knife-making business into a full-time career, while Ms Schlichthorst said that with less bills, she hoped to have more freedom to work remotely or part-time. Ms Schlichthorst said peeling back her life to what was necessary was what made tiny house living so appealing. ""When we have big houses, we have more space, we intend on filling it with things, things that we don't necessarily use all the time, or even need,"" she said. ""All these things tend to slow you down and make you more immobile and stale,"" she said. The pair, who migrated from Germany 12 years ago, purchased 14 hectares of bushland at Franklin, south of Hobart, and planned to station their 25 square metre bus home there by 2020. It's a huge adjustment for the couple, who were drawn to Torquay for the surf lifestyle, and now intended to rent out their home to help pay off their mortgage and move into an 11 metre by 2.5 metre space. ""I know it's going to be a challenge, big time, but I also know that the life that we're envisioning is going to cater for that more,"" Mr Bockholt said. ""We're going to be living on and off the land, so you may need to have less clothing, your shoes will always be work boots because it's going to be a messy life."" By following families on Instagram who were already living tiny, Mr Bockholt said he was aware that tiny living was not always picture perfect. ""You see that there are times when things will be messy, on washing day, where do you hang all the stuff?"" ""The reality is, it's a challenging lifestyle — but feasible,"" he said. Still, they won't be sacrificing all the creature comforts of a bigger home. Their new kitchen will include a gas stove and oven, hanging cabinets and a large concrete sink. ""We're almost using about a quarter of the bus as kitchen, so we're going to have the kitchen on both sides [of the bus],"" Mr Bockholt said. The modest size of the home has afforded the couple other benefits too, including a larger budget to splurge. ""Because the spaces are smaller, we can actually use nicer materials because you need less of it,"" Mr Bockholt said. ""For example, in the kitchen we've got Otway Blackwood bench-tops that we were able to source reasonably cheaply."" Tasmania had always held an appeal for the couple, who said they enjoyed the colder climate and the idea of getting back on the land. Their new home will include a composting toilet, a permaculture garden and a separate workshop and studio space for the couple to work from. The bus is the couple's attempt to combine the tiny house moment with the 'skoolie' movement — where old school buses are converted DIY-style and repurposed into accommodation. The skoolie movement has taken off overseas, particularly in the United States and New Zealand, where grey nomads, travellers and minimalists buy used school buses and fit them out to their own individual needs. ""There's a lot of people in the States that are buying old school buses and turning them into tiny houses, living a reasonably nomadic lifestyle,"" Mr Bockholt said. ""While the aspect of mobility was not the most important issue for us, we just had the opportunity to get a school bus reasonably cheap.""

302,Not just high house prices: The reasons more young adults live with their parents,house-and-home,"  Not just high house prices: The reasons more young adults live with their parents More young Australians are living at home with their parents into early adulthood, but it's not just high house prices being blamed for the trend. A touch over 43 per cent of those aged 20 to 24 lived with their parents in 2016, compared with 36 per cent in 1981. There was a rise among those aged 25-29 and 30-34 as well. The Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS) has recently analysed the data to reveal the trends across city and country, men and women, and even cultural backgrounds. It found young men were more likely to stay home than women — particularly in capital cities — but the factors were more varied than just cost of living. ""Young adults are also now staying in education longer [and] their employment tends to be less secure, so the income is not as stable,"" AIFS director Anne Hollonds said. ""We're delaying partnering these days. We're not settling down into our own households until around the age of 30. ""So really, the 20s are a decade of transition these days compared to how it was a few decades ago."" In 2016, 50 per cent of young men and 43 per cent of young women in our capital cities lived at home, compared with 42 per cent and 31 per cent respectively in regional areas. ABC audiences have responded with their own stories, revealing how the country-city divide can be both a blessing and curse. ""You can only stay home if there are employment and education opportunities available near your parents,"" Skye said. ""Not privileged to be born in a city? Have to move."" Mel echoed the sentiments. ""My 20-year-old has been out on her own for two years, but came back home last week,"" she said. ""Brisbane city living is too expensive; however, we live more rurally [and there are] not many jobs available."" The AIFS found cultural backgrounds also influenced the likelihood of young people living at home for longer. ""Among young adults born in Australia, those with Asian, Middle Eastern, African or Southern and Eastern European ancestry are more likely to live with their parents, compared to those with Australian, Northwestern European or New Zealand backgrounds,"" researcher Lixia Qu said. ""Among young adults born overseas, the numbers living with their parents fell between 2001 and 2011, particularly those in the 20-24-year-old age group. ""This trend reflects booming international education in Australia and greater numbers of unaccompanied international students living here."" ABC audiences have shared their own experiences of a full house, with their stories revealing the decision is not always by choice. ""My eldest son has been a typical boomerang kid. He had a few attempts at moving out, but insecure casual work makes long-term commitments difficult. He gets full-time work usually, but if he's sick or injured there's no security and no income."" — Ozzy ""I'm a parent of young adults who have both moved out and back. It's mainly the cost of renting and electricity. It's also very hard for young people to compete in the rental market, especially with insecure income."" — Anon ""Both our sons, 25 and 30, had to move home ... Until they get well-paying jobs — one just finished his degree, the other midway through and a single dad — they will be here for longer."" — Marcus ""Our twin girls lived with us until 26 years old while they built a house together. Our eldest daughter, son-in-law and grandson lived with us for nine months while building a new house. They are welcome back for short terms and they visit every weekend. We love our time alone together, too."" — Katie ""Our son is 24 this year. He went overseas for a year and a half and now has moved back. We love having him home. He supports his younger brother and functions as an active member of our household. I love having my family together."" — Megan ""I would be spending all of my income on rent if I moved out, and I want to save for a deposit. I only just started working full-time after graduating last year so I've got some catching up to do."" — Carlina ""I'm 27 and have been out since 20. I returned home for a few months here and there. I am independent and self-sufficient and probably better for it, but I struggle to save money.

303,"As beachside bungalows disappear on the Gold Coast, architects call for heritage protection",house-and-home,"  Gold Coast's caravan-shaped house a beacon of a bygone era as beachside bungalows disappear A caravan-shaped cottage on the Gold Coast has become an icon for a bygone era in beachside architecture as developers buy up and bowl over original bungalows. Retired architect Malcolm Cummings was a fresh-faced 32-year-old in 1969 when he was briefed by a council officer to design the caretakers' cottages at the Burleigh and Tallebudgera tourist parks. ""I was doing a few buildings at that time with curved fibro and curved corrugated iron,"" the 82-year-old said. He used the caravan's shape as his inspiration and came up with a design which incorporated a curved roof. ""They were quite out there,"" Mr Cummings said. The young architect's design caused controversy when it went before council for approval. ""The councillors got up and said, 'You can't have the roof coming down as the walls because the spiders will get in' or something, and that was actually what one said,"" Mr Cummings said. The design was approved, and the cottages were constructed 50 years ago. Former Gold Coast City Council architect Philip Follent said the design stood as a beacon of a bygone era. ""Whilst it might have been slightly whimsical on the architect's part it was probably quite apt, because it was reflective of the holiday nature of the Gold Coast,"" Mr Follent said. ""It was an experiment with materials, the Super Six which you could bend and so on or could be formed into curved shapes. ""It sits beautifully on the hill in the sense that the hill rises up behind. ""It's not as if the building looks as if it's stuck up on top of a box."" Burleigh Tourist Park cottage is home to caretakers Barry and Christine Hasselmann who have been living in the three-bedroom property for eight months. ""It's no different to living in a normal house, you don't realise until you're outside looking at it,"" Mr Hasselmann said. ""It's been renovated about 10 years ago and it's quite modern up inside now and we don't have any problem with any vermin getting in."" The cottage has been placed on the Gold Coast City Council's Local Heritage Register which was established in 2010. Mr Follent said it was important to preserve significant Gold Coast buildings. ""I think that it's terrific that the Tourist Park part of council has chosen to recognise the iconic value of a form like that,"" he said. Original beachside homes are quickly disappearing as people buy the properties and demolish them to build modern homes or amalgamate land parcels for high-rise developments. ""Some of them are trying to do up older places, but regrettably the vast majority do disappear, because they're relatively close to the beach and in the path of development,"" Mr Follent said. ""The city is still coming to recognise the value of these properties, but alas a lot of it is a little bit too late so yes incentives need to be provided."" Mr Follent said the Gold Coast City Council and the Queensland Government could look at what other cities were doing in Australia to protect heritage properties. He suggested council could offer rate relief or Transferable Development Rights (TDR) where developers purchased the development rights of land parcels and transferred those rights to another area to increase the density of their new development. Mr Cummings said he was pleased the caravan-shaped cottage at Burleigh had been protected and was not surprised the cottage at the nearby Tallebudgera Tourist Park was demolished when the site was redeveloped a few years ago. ""Being an architect on the Gold Coast, one of the things is that nothing is permanent,"" Mr Cummings said. ""So many buildings that you've done have been pulled down or bastardised.""

304,These people are happy to ditch agents and sell their own houses,house-and-home,"  Private real estate sales can bring benefits but they're not without risks Marketplaces can reach people within seconds thanks to the internet, so it's little wonder that millions of us shop online. But would you go so far as to buy or sell a house on Facebook? Social media and trading sites are seen by an increasing number of home owners as a way to avoid paying fees for real estate agents. Others believe the technology gives them a better shot at buying properties when they hit the market. Nevertheless, people in the housing industry have cautioned that selling privately was not without risk. The ABC reveals the so-called blacklist of areas where location is deemed more of a liability to people seeking to borrow money. Kathryn Kley sold her house online several years ago, and has decided to do the same for her floating shack at Strahan on Tasmania's west coast. The property has been advertised through a large buy-and-sell website and on social media. ""I think that so many more people are aware of online sites like Gumtree and even groups on Facebook,"" Ms Kley said. ""You can reach enough people through that way; you don't really need an agent."" She said she sold her house on Gumtree after it had been listed with agents without success. ""You don't have to pay commission, and most mobile phones can take great pictures. ""We had a lawyer to handle the conveyancing, so there were no issues."" Similarly, Jan Burton is offering her Ridgley house for sale via a Facebook group. Last year she sold a Ringarooma property within one day to a ""mainlander"" through a Facebook page dedicated to people interested in moving to Tasmania. Ms Burton said she tried the social media platform after her property was listed unsuccessfully with a real estate firm for three months. ""It all moved so fast,"" she said, adding that she hoped her latest sale would have the same luck. ""We have had two separate valuations from real estate agents, and both are, in our opinion, well over-priced in their fee. ""It is an individual decision, and for us, we simply do not have the luxury of losing in excess of $9,000. ""In terms of the market, perhaps it will go in our favour. We can only hope."" Mother of four Carrie Poprawski said she had desperately tried to buy a home about a year ago and was not having much luck. ""I was looking everywhere constantly,"" she said. ""By the time properties were in the paper, they tended to be sold — everything got snatched up so quickly."" So with a healthy level of scepticism, she turned to Gumtree and arranged to view a property. ""I was worried a bit but I thought I'd give it a go."" Ms Poprawksi said she made an offer on a house in Hobart using a standard property contract. ""It was a deceased estate and they wanted it to go to someone who really needed it,"" she said. ""They had a lawyer and I organised my own — we were able to do it quicker than originally thought. ""It was exactly the same as it would have been with a real estate agent."" Policymakers have embarked on the delicate task of deflating a property bubble without bursting it — this year we'll find out if they've succeeded. Buying and selling property doesn't come without risks, and the various contracts, forms and processes can be confusing. Tony Collidge, president of the Real Estate Institute of Tasmania, estimated that around five to 10 per cent of property in the state was sold privately. He said the biggest risks with selling property privately were legal problems arising, particularly around failures in disclosing information relevant to the sale. ""That can end up resulting in issues further down the track and finding yourself in all sort of hot water because that's not done,"" he said. ""We've got the insurance and the protection and we're trained to know what you can and can't say in terms of disclosure."" Sale contracts were also becoming more complex, he said. ""Our contracts for sale have grown over the past four or five years, with new clauses added."" Mr Collidge said in instances when a transaction was straight forward, such as family and friends selling property to each other, it might not be necessary to engage an agent. But in situations with multiple interested buyers, it could get more tricky, he said. ""I'm not necessarily advocating everyone should use an agent — there are some people who are confident and feel they can handle the sale of their own home. ""Where it gets difficult is when you've got to deal with and negotiate with a prospective purchaser."" Mr Collidge said if someone was doing their own conveyancing, problems could arise with the building inspection. ""The purchaser then wants to renegotiate the sale price and it's too much for the parties to handle."" Issues might also arise with boundary checks prior to settlement, he said. ""If all of a sudden they find there's a significant difference with the boundary sizes, if you're trying to do it all yourself it just gets too difficult. ""You really need to engage a conveyancer to do that for you."" Real estate agents could secure higher prices for properties by playing buyers off against each other, Mr Collidge said. ""Good agents are able to introduce a number of buyers to a property and then try and force those buyers as high as they can."" And agents had lists of potential buyers when a house came on the market, he added. ""We can get that list of buyers and get them through the property, whereas as you as an individual, you don't have those 1,000 names."" He said agents could work with buyers for months, which took time and money. ""Then a property comes along and sells within 24 hours, and people say, 'that was an easy sale', but they don't see behind the scenes, that the agent has been dealing with that buyer for months."" A surge in repayments is set to hit interest-only home loans over the coming 12 months. Mr Collidge said agent fees were becoming lower due to market demand and it paid to shop around. ""A decade ago I was getting more to sell a property than I do today."" Tasmania has a deregulated market, in which individual agents can negotiate fees, whether it be a percentage of the sale or a flat price. ""It allows each different salesperson to use their own initiative to implement a commission or payment scheme that's agreeable with the owner,"" Mr Collidge said. ""Don't take the agent with the lowest commission, choose the agent who you feel most comfortable with. ""It really is a relationship thing and you've got to feel comfortable with the person you're dealing with.""

305,Could these tiny homes be the solution to a big problem for many older women?,house-and-home,"  Can the popularity of tiny homes provide a solution for older women facing homelessness? The number of women over the age of 55 experiencing housing stress and homelessness is rising in Australia, but the increasing interest in tiny homes may provide a viable solution for these women. The quirky, transportable homes have become the darling of the reality TV scene, and social media groups sharing ideas and tips for tiny homes boast tens of thousands of followers. Now moves are afoot on the NSW mid-north coast to establish a tiny home village, specifically for older women. Kim Connolly came up with the idea after increasingly common conversations with women her age about their financial difficulties in her home community of Coffs Harbour. ""Over and over again women kept coming to me and saying, 'I'm going to be homeless, if not in the next few months, in the next few years',"" Ms Connolly said. ""I found out all the statistics and research and I didn't have an answer, [but] I love tiny houses and I thought, 'That's it, I'm going to build one'."" On census night in 2016, there were an estimated 6,866 women over 50 who were homeless — the figure representing a 31 per cent increase since 2011. The number of older women renting privately had also increased in recent years. In 2006, there were 91,549 older women who were private renters. By the 2011 Census, that figure had almost doubled to 180,617. Dr Yvonne Hartman and Dr Sandy Darab from Southern Cross University studied the plight of single, older, non-home-owning women in regional areas, publishing their research in 2017. A public call-out for study participants living in the Northern Rivers region of NSW provoked an overwhelming response. ""We were just swamped with replies, from other regions as well — people from other parts of Australia were ringing us and wanting to be interviewed,"" Dr Hartman said. Dr Hartman and Dr Darab interviewed 47 women for their study and found most had common experiences. Most had been married with children and ended up single because of a marriage breakdown, in which they tended to lose the family home. ""Many of them had children and many of them took on the caring responsibilities for those children, which meant that their working opportunities were limited,"" Dr Hartman said. Most of the participants had relied on single parent pensions, which Dr Hartman said kept them in poverty and limited their housing options to renting. ""That takes up quite a big proportion of an income like a single parent pension, so that is socially excluding to start off with,"" she said. ""You're left looking for very run-down places and some single women we interviewed were living in the bush in sheds and caravans to try to keep down those housing costs."" The study found women had clear ideas about what sort of housing would suit them as they aged. For all of them, stability and security of tenure were priorities. Ms Connolly became so passionate about her tiny home village idea, she has now set up a tiny home building business. She said about 80 per cent of her enquires were from over-50s looking for affordable housing. ""It actually makes me angry that women have worked all their lives, they've taken time off for their children, they've taken time off for their ageing parents, and quite often there'll be a divorce in there, or they're just single women and despite all of this, they're ending up with no room at all to get secure housing for themselves for the rest of their lives,"" Ms Connolly said. ""It's women who are just like me and they're shaking their heads saying, 'I don't know how this happened, I never thought I'd end up in this situation'."" Ms Connolly was now in the process of setting up a not-for-profit organisation to facilitate her tiny home village concept. She has been offered land on which to build the village and was working through the development application process. ""My idea of the village would be 15 houses — there would be three houses that are rental houses, the other 12 would be owned by the occupants, there'd be two couples and the other 10 houses would be all older women,"" Ms Connolly said.

306,McMansion expansion is leaving Perth 'full of terrible houses',house-and-home,"  Project home expansion in WA costing owners in the long run, architects say Architects say it's time to rethink the suburban dream, with data revealing that around a fifth of new homes built in Western Australia don't meet six-star energy standards, costing their owners dearly in running costs. All new-build designs need to demonstrate compliance with the national construction code that includes specifications for energy efficiency. But Anthony Wright, the research lead of building simulation at the CSIRO, said there was a glaring disparity in the numbers. ""Nationally speaking, about 1.5 per cent of houses we see come through our database are less than six stars,"" he told Jessica Strutt on ABC Radio Perth. ""In Western Australia it is somewhere like 15 per cent or even 20 per cent over some of the past years, and we're not entirely sure why that is."" Is it possible to create a liveable apartment in just 24 square metres? That's the size of just two parking spaces. Architect Kate Fitzgerald believes it is because project-home builders dominate the WA market. She said architects were rarely involved in tailoring a design to either its owner's needs or best use of natural breezes, site orientation, window placement and insulation. ""Part of that is this idea that you can potentially short-circuit the design aspect of the project by going straight to the builder."" Research by Ms Fitzgerald into 50 project-home companies found that only two had architects working on projects. She said many people who built their own home steered clear of architects in the belief they were too expensive, but that was not necessarily the case. ""I think a lot of architects really start working on projects that are maybe around the $500,000 mark and over, so we're not talking about affordable housing,"" she said. ""But I think that's the point with McMansions — they're not affordable houses, they're huge and they're just badly designed."" Ms Fitzgerald said it was possible to find emerging architecture practices to design homes at a lower price point, or to employ an architect to provide short-term advice on making a project home better. ""We will have a look at your project in the first instance and give you some tips and pointers about which way to face it, and even how to go back to the project-home companies and say, 'Actually, this is what I want'."" The Housing Industry Association, which represents the home building industry, said project homes were designed to meet minimum energy efficiency standards in order to comply with the national construction code. ""There is no difference in how project homes are designed to meet the minimum energy efficiency standards as any other type of new home,"" director of policy Kristin Brookfield said. ""All homes in Western Australia are required to meet a six-star design standard and councils are responsible for approving these designs."" Ms Brookfield pointed out that the design of a building was just one factor in a home's final running costs. ""All homes meet the six-star standards under the national construction code and the cost of running these is based on the number of electrical appliances a home owner chooses to have in their home,"" she said. ""The star ratings only give a home buyer an indication of the amount of energy they use to heat and cool their home. ""No other electrical appliances are included in a star rating."" Architect Ben Caine said many people were torn between good design and building big. ""They do want a house that is energy efficient and well designed, but there just seems to be this really ingrained attitude that a big house is important for resale, to make the most of a block in a nice area or where big homes are prevalent,"" he said. ""I get contacted a lot by people who have already been to a builder and been given a design that is too expensive for them to build. ""When I look at the plans, I often find that the houses are horrendously oversized and often have a very poor layout from a sustainability point of view."" Australian housing prices have been unwinding at a serious clip now for close to a year-and-a-half, and it has regulators and policy makers concerned. He said his challenge was to persuade people that a smaller, better-designed house would be more comfortable to live in, cheaper to run and would still have good resale value. Mr Wright agreed, saying his research had found that the cost of building had decreased since the energy star rating was introduced and that there was evidence that resale values were improved. ""A University of Melbourne study looking at Canberra, where they disclose the energy performance rating at the time of sale or lease for their buildings, found that there is actually a price uplift for the houses that perform better, so you may actually get more money back,"" he said. Many ABC Radio Perth listeners bemoaned the predominance of energy-inefficient design and described well-designed homes that naturally stayed cool in summer. Greg: ""We designed our house five years ago with: high ceilings throughout; passively positioned on our block to maximise solar heating during winter and reduce direct sun exposure during summer; a light-coloured Colorbond roof; light-coloured bricks; and we used top-end roof insulation. Hence, our house is not air conditioned nor centrally heated."" Helen: ""We've lost a beautifully treed single-home property next door to two huge McMansions, one of which has five bedrooms for two retired people."" Claude: ""Designs have gone backwards. There are no longer verandahs or eaves used, and here in WA we have a mentality of double brick which we must change. I have completed a timber-framed extension with wall insulation and ceiling insulation and an air gap built into the framing. On very hot days we don't need to switch on the air con for a couple of days."" Anne: ""My neighbour subdivided and built a McMansion at the rear. It has a black roof, no solar panels. From my shaded garden I hear their air con running nearly 24/7."" Ms Fitzgerald said she was not just lecturing other people on how to build their homes — she has put her money where her ideas are and, with her partner and father, built a small, solar-passive home on a 170-square-metre piece of land in Scarborough. The development will eventually include three houses and has been done without losing the old house that was on the block, or the established trees, and used many recycled building materials. ""We did a development because we wanted to prove to people that what we're showing on plans and what we're trying to explain to our clients can actually work,"" she said. ""People aren't aware until a thing is constructed what they've actually paid for and that's quite scary."" Policymakers have embarked on the delicate task of deflating a property bubble without bursting it — this year we'll find out if they've succeeded. Her house is just 1.5 bedrooms and the living area is three metres wide, but she can show people that the space doesn't feel small. ""We had 2,000 people through our house on that weekend and not a single person came up to me and said it's too small, and I think that's really interesting for a house that size."" Ms Fitzgerald said there were consequences to the home building industry saving on design costs. ""I think with the fees that are required to design a project, we've been circumventing those fees for a long time and we've got a whole city full of terrible houses,"" she said. ""I think it's time to say, 'OK, well we've tried that way, we've tried to circumvent that skill set', and if you look at the broader picture, architectural houses always sell for more.""

307,What to look out for when applying for a loan (hint: watch out for those school fees),house-and-home," Updated 
    
      April 13, 2019 11:53:18 If you're at the stage where you might be thinking about buying a house, one of the most difficult things to get your head around can be knowing where to start. Should you talk to your bank first? Start looking at potential homes and worry about the finance later? Or start giving up your takeaway coffee, cold turkey? That's why Zoe asked us to investigate what is the process of getting a mortgage as part of our personal finance series. ""There's been a lot of focus on the mortgage industry since the royal commission, and how it's harder to get credit,"" she told the ABC. ""It made me realise no-one teaches you the process of getting a mortgage and a property. ""The path to home ownership involves a lender and a mortgage broker, a real estate agent, a previous owner and a conveyancer. We never get taught how they all fit together.""  She's started a savings plan with her partner to afford a down payment for a house in a few years and wanted us to also look at how lenders calculated how much they were willing to lend you.  Here's what we found. The big four banks use a number of measures to decide if you're loan-worthy and how much they're willing to lend you. Mortgage broker Bruce Carr says borrowers can think of it like three or four c's (which can vary from lender to lender):  A property expert with home loan comparison site Mozo, Steve Jovcevski, says lenders operate loosely around those principles, although they have begun to scrutinise living expenses more recently. ""I think it's happening across the board for all lenders … so you're finding all the lenders have cut back and definitely made it more difficult to get a home loan than it was a couple of years ago,"" he said.  Mr Carr said each of these assessments are largely seen as equal ""because any one of them could knock you out"". ""On the day you apply, they basically take a photo of you,"" he said. ""They don't know you could get a car loan next week, they don't know that you're going to leave your job next week, or that you're going to fall pregnant. ""So they take a snapshot on the day you apply [do all the necessary checks], and after that it's up to you to manage it.""  Yep. Although in some cases, these expense checks have become a recent requirement for banks. Last year, Westpac updated its credit policies to improve the way it measures the household spending of people applying for loans, including increasing the number of expenses categories from six to 13 to get customers to provide much more detail about what they spend money on. On top of asking about basic expenses, childcare, education, insurance, telephone, internet and others, potential borrowers were also asked to questions in categories like groceries, medical and health, recreation and entertainment, transport, and others. Mr Jovcevski says in some instances lenders are looking closely at your expenses, including your telephone bill, AfterPay debts, internet, media streaming subscriptions and child care.  ""Even credit cards, if you hardly use it but it's got a $10,000 limit it will be [assessed at that limit], so you'll need to cut those limits right down to say $1,000,"" he said. These measures have followed reports from investment bank UBS that a large minority of mortgage borrowers had been understating their living expenses, with almost three-quarters of loan applications defaulting back to the household expenditure measure (HEM) benchmark to assess household spending. As Mr Carr puts it: ""If you say you're spending — and I've actually had people say this to me — $1,500 a month and then I go through your banks statement and find out you're actually spending $5,000 a month, I'm going to start asking some pretty serious questions,"" he said.  The key for those looking for home loans is that it's not always assumed that you're going to cut your current spending habits once you get a loan. ""I've had a clients that could clearly afford a loan, for example a double professional couple borrowing relatively modestly who made quite a realistic expenses declaration,"" Mr Carr said. ""And the bank came back to me and said they've just put thousands of dollars on their credit card last month. How does this reconcile with their living expenses? ""So then the client and I went through it and weeded out the one-offs — the air tickets they bought for an overseas holiday and other one-offs — to show their regular spending was as per their declaration."" Mr Carr said in those cases, it was a matter of providing a reasonable explanation for these one-off expenses to the bank. ""The question I ask myself is, would this person go on an overseas holiday ever year and lose their home? Or would they forgo the holiday, maybe go on a camping trip instead, to keep their home?"" he said. Mr Jovcevski says the greater focus on everyday living expenses has also included greater scrutiny of private school fees.  ""In the past they didn't assess private school fees, now they do,"" he said. ""Some private schools [in Sydney at least] can cost $25,000-$30,000 per year, per child, and if you have two children in private school that makes a big difference in your ability to service a loan if you're paying those sorts of fees. ""And then they're also looking at how much you're spending on medical and health, clothing and personal items where in the past they sort of based [living expenses] in this instance on an average of a two-child family.""  Mr Carr says it's definitely harder if you're applying as a single person, ""because your expenses don't change that much from a couple"". ""The living expenses of a couple together are certainly nowhere near double a single's — you're sharing electricity, water, food and so on,"" he said. ""Couples live much more efficiently and the second income can almost go completely to the borrowing."" He says this has been highlighted in the past 25 years, where we've gone from a single income borrowing culture to a two-income borrowing culture. ""The thing that people haven't quite got their heads around yet is that we're not going to go from a two-income loan to a three-income loan, or interest rates are not going to drop from 3 per cent to -3 per cent, which is the same as going from 9 per cent to 3 per cent, so there's a lot of reasons the property market should not go off in the stratosphere,"" he said.  Mr Jovcevski says lenders are also required to apply a base interest rate percentage figure (otherwise known as a stress test rate) to loan repayments. It was historically set at about 2 per cent over the loan interest rate. However, according to Mr Carr, as interest rates have come down in recent years, lenders have left their evaluation at a floor rate of around 7 per cent. ""Now, one of the consequences of that is as interest rates have dropped from 5 per cent to 4 per cent that hasn't increased people's borrowing capacity,"" Mr Carr said.  You'll need to provide a bit of information to a lender to assist them with calculating how much they're willing to lend you. If you're a first-home buyer you'll need to: And Mr Jovcevski says people should refrain from making too many credit inquiries. ""Even if they haven't rejected you, but as soon as they do a credit check in pre-approvals it starts counting as an inquiry, and it can count against you if you have too many inquiries,"" he said. ""And if you got to a lender and you've done 10 inquiries, they'll ask you about it — and that's always been a factor."" Under these circumstances Mr Jovcevski says first-home buyers in particular might have to start cutting back on their spending at least three or four months prior to applying for a loan.  ""Make sure you're paying off your credit card debt or AfterPay and try cutting back on your Uber Eats … get your spending in order,"" he said. ""And sometimes it's a good idea if you show savings, or at least that you can repay the loan. ""So for first-home buyers setting aside the amount the loan would be, that you're looking to get in, those prior few months would make the banks feel more comfortable."" For example, if you're looking at a $600,000 loan with repayments of $2,000 a month, set aside that amount every month before you actually apply for the loan.  Yep. The Australian Prudential and Regulation Authority (APRA) directed banks two years ago to tighten their loan tests to ensure financial stability.  It followed other measures designed to moderate higher risk lending, including a 10 per cent cap on housing investor loans in 2014 and a cap on new interest-only lending in 2017 to 30 per cent of home loans they issue. Last year's third wave of intervention was in response to banks using something called a HEM benchmark to estimate a loan applicant's annual expenses, which was then used to calculate their borrowing capacity. ""Use of HEM took out of the equation potential vast differences in spending between otherwise equivalent families (eg. kids in private school or not, cost of child care, medical expenses and so on,"" Mr Carr said. People could be assessed across four categories: student, basic, moderate or lavish. But experts say banks are now scrutinising an individual's expenses as well as using the HEM benchmark.

308,opinion: Home ownership is about to plummet for retirees — and younger Australians should take note,house-and-home,"  Home ownership is about to plummet for retirees — and younger Australians should take note Australia's retirement incomes system has been built on the assumption that most retirees would own their home outright. But new Grattan Institute modelling shows the share of over 65s who own their home will fall from 76 per cent today to 57 per cent by 2056 — and it's likely that less than half of low-income retirees will own their homes in future, down from more than 70 per cent today. Home ownership provides retirees with big benefits: they have somewhere to live without paying rent, and they are insulated from rising housing costs. Retirees who have paid off their mortgage spend much less of their income on housing (on average 5 per cent) than working homeowners or retired renters (25 per cent to 30 per cent). These benefits — which economists call imputed rents — are worth more than $23,000 a year to the average household aged 65 or over, roughly as much again as the maximum pension. Our 2018 report Money in Retirement showed that while Australia's retirement income system is working well for the vast majority of retirees, it's at risk of failing those who rent. [Renters] are more than twice as likely as homeowners to suffer financial stress, as indicated by things such as skipping meals, or failing to pay bills. This is not surprising — renters typically have lower incomes. But the rising deposit hurdle and greater mortgage burden risks means rates of home ownership are falling fast among the presently young and the poor. The share of 25-34 year olds who own their home has fallen from more than 60 per cent in 1981 to 45 per cent in 2016. For those 35-44 years old it has fallen from 75 per cent to about 62 per cent. And home ownership now depends on income much more than in the past: among 25-34 year olds, home ownership among the poorest 20 per cent has fallen from 63 per cent to 23 per cent. Home ownership is likely to fall further in coming years. Using Grattan Institute modelling, we find that on current trends, the share of over 65s who own their home will fall from 76 per cent today to 74 per cent in 2026, to 70 per cent by 2036, 64 per cent by 2046, and 57 per cent by 2056. And while we don't project home ownership rates for different income groups due to data limitations (we have the necessary Census data on home ownership rates by age and income only for 1981 and 2016), it is more than likely that less than half of low income retirees will own their homes in future, down from more than 70 per cent today. Today's younger Australians will become tomorrow's retirees. Worsening housing affordability means renting will become more widespread among retirees. As a result, more retirees will be at risk of poverty and financial stress, particularly if rent assistance does not keep pace with future increases in rents paid by low-income renters. The maximum rent assistance payment is indexed in line with the consumer price index, but rents have been growing faster than the consumer price index for a long time. Between June 2003 and June 2017, the consumer price index climbed by 41 per cent, while average rents climbed by 64 per cent. Should you sacrifice lifestyle to buy? Or just rent forever? Are there other ways? That's why our Money in Retirement report recommended boosting Commonwealth Rent Assistance by 40 per cent, at a cost of $300 million a year in today's dollars. That would restore it to the buying power it had 15 years ago. It should be indexed in future to changes in the rents typically paid by the people who get it, so its value is maintained, as recommended by the Henry Tax Review. There's another important implication. Retirement incomes are likely to become more unequal in future. Money in Retirement found that in general future retirees will have adequate retirement incomes. Most workers today can expect a retirement income of at least 89 per cent of their pre-retirement income, well above the 70 per cent benchmark used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and more than enough to maintain pre-retirement living standards. But a retirees who rent will have much less for living on. Among home-owners, an increasing proportion will be still paying off their mortgages when they retire — the proportion of 55 -64 year olds who own their home outright fell from 72 per cent in 1995-96 to 42 per cent in 2015-16. Some will (quite rationally) use some or all of their super to pay off their mortgage. And rising housing costs will in time force retirees to draw down on more of the value of their home to fund their retirement. Currently, few retirees downsize or borrow against the equity of their home while continuing to live in it. But that will have to change. House prices have outstripped growth in incomes. Median prices have increased from around four times median incomes in the early 1990s to more than seven times median incomes today (and more than eight times in Sydney). Government policy should continue to encourage these retirees to draw down on the increasingly valuable equity of their homes to help fund their retirement. They are not the ones who will need government help. The government's recent expansion of the Pension Loans Scheme that allows all retirees to borrow against the value of their homes is a step in that direction. Retirement is going to change in the years ahead. Most retirees will be far from poor, many of them better able to support themselves than ever before. But an increasing number will not. They are the ones who will need our help. Brendan Coates is a fellow and Tony Chen is a researcher, both with the Grattan Institute. This article first appeared on The Conversation.

309,Your daily coffee could be one reason why you can't get a loan,house-and-home,"  Coffee, Afterpay purchases could all count against your chances of getting a bank loan There may be a higher price to pay for all the coffees you've bought this week or the dinners you've had delivered. Banks and credit unions are closely following the daily spending habits of potential loan customers — purchases using Afterpay, food deliveries, daily splurges and entertainment are all being put under the microscope. This scrutiny on borrowing heightened especially amid the fallout of the banking royal commission, according to Brisbane mortgage broker Steve Moore. ""It's the hardest it's been in the past 15 years — even harder than when the global financial crisis was around,"" he told ABC Radio Brisbane's Rebecca Levingston. ""I have never seen it this tough. ""The focus is on the living expenses, and they never focused on that in the past."" Mr Moore said most banks, including the big four, were looking at where and when you're spending money. ""They're looking at your daily coffee and assume that that will continue to do so going forward,"" he said. ""What they aren't thinking about is that people do live within their means and they do adjust after taking on debt. ""The banks are assuming what you're spending now is what you'll spend for the rest of your life."" Mr Moore said many credit unions and banks were looking at your statements to try and calculate future living expenses. ""We are having arguments about it every day and many banks are counting debits and calling them living expenses."" He added that smaller lenders were going harder than others. Currently, most applications that fall into a grey area are tending not to be approved. ""The lack of loans will also potentially see drops in the construction side of things,"" Mr Moore said. ""If people can't qualify to buy these new properties, it will flow through to the builders and the tradies as well."" ANZ and NAB bosses told a parliamentary hearing earlier this year they were willing to lend, amid a greater focus on responsible lending post the banking royal commission. ANZ's Shayne Elliott said the ensuing debate about responsible lending had caused the banks to become more conservative. ""As a result of that, Australians ... some, not all, will find it a little bit harder to either get credit or get the amount of credit that they would have otherwise had in the past or would like, and I'm not suggesting for a minute that's wrong, it's just the reality."" Callers to ABC Radio Brisbane vented their frustrations on the difficulty of obtaining a loan. ""It was horrendous, and if you're self-employed it's tough. We had banked with our bank for over 25 years and had money in the bank and we've owned multiple homes before. When we went to get a mortgage, it was just 'no, no, no'. Finally, our bank said we would need to have a 40 per cent deposit. We had never defaulted on a mortgage."" — Robyn from Brisbane ""We tried to get a $40,000 loan but were turned down due to the previous three months of spending, along with my wife not working enough hours. The house is paid off and we have more than $700,000 in cash and super and a combined income of $130,000. My wife is livid and she wants to take all the money out of the bank right now."" — Peter from Maryborough ""We refinanced and got it, but one late payment on a credit card, the first time in 15 years, and I had to write them a letter to explain why. We have more equity in the loan and we have money in the bank to pay the loan out and we're no risk, but it was that difficult and it's still not finalised yet."" — Scott from Mt Warren Park ""We paid off our house and wanted to purchase a new car, but I believe we have no hope of getting a loan now. I work casual but reliable hours as a doctor, but that doesn't even count. We'll now have to save for our car — it's not worth the stress."" — Peter from Toowoomba Mr Moore said most lenders would look closely at your previous three months of spending when you applied for a loan.

310,Driving a hard bargain is about more than just the price you pay,house-and-home,"  Art of the deal is knowing when and how to bargain ""Is that your best price?"" It's a question often posed to sales reps. But before you ask it, take a minute to consider if you've equipped yourself with the right tools to secure a bargain. Voice coach Dr Melissa Agnew said a lot could be determined by how a question was asked. ""If you walk into a store you need to sound confident, present and acting like you want to be there,"" she told ABC Radio Brisbane. ""You also have to really engage with the people you're speaking with — that's a very big part of it."" Ms Agnew said many people in Australia added an upward inflection at the end of a sentence which could give a mixed message when trying to negotiate. ""It can sound like a question or that you need validation, whereas if you say it without the upward inflection, it sounds like you have completed it or nailed it. ""I don't enjoy the engagement of bartering, but because I've been a voice coach for over 35 years, I don't seem to have to negotiate very much."" Dr Agnew said one mistake often made was that too much ""wiggle room is left if you don't finish a question"". ""We've forgotten the art of the full stop. ""We're hearing that more in broadcasts today, as people don't reach a full stop and all the information rolls together. ""When you use a full stop and you get to the end of the sentence, it's final and you hear it."" Source: Dr Melissa Agnew Body language and facial expression also played a big part in communicating, she said, so ensure you're looking interested in the seller to make them feel hopeful about the sale. Not every situation is appropriate to ask for a better deal; consumer advocacy group Choice encourages people to think about not just the bargaining process but the negotiation over the whole package. Big-ticket items such as cars, whitegoods and mortgages are all suitable instances, and throw in with that negotiations over features, customisation, services, installation and delivery. However, it's best not to bargain over the price of small, inexpensive items in supermarkets and similar stores unless an item is damaged. Financial adviser and author Noel Whittaker said people should go into the process with a positive attitude. Being polite during negotiations could also help you reach a happy medium with the seller, he said. ""It's well documented that successful people have an optimistic attitude and that unsuccessful people have a pessimistic attitude."" Mr Whittaker urged people to become an ""expert"" on what they were buying, especially when it came to property or big-ticket items. ""Read books by well-known and trusted experts, acquire as much knowledge as you can."" Choice also reminds customers that with the increasing worldwide economy and online shopping, shoppers are open to more variety and have the ability to compare prices, empowering them to negotiate a better deal.

311,Fire-gutted 'architectural masterpiece' restored to former glory,house-and-home," Posted 
    
      March 17, 2019 11:31:01  Tim Bult and his wife Lisa Church were enjoying an end-of-year overseas holiday when they received the phone call every homeowner dreads — their house had burnt to the ground. ""It was a very, very difficult time for our family, Mr Bult said. ""But let's put it into context — nobody was hurt thankfully.""  Paganin House, the family's home in Perth's western suburbs, is far from your average three by two — it is an eccentric 1960s post-modernist building designed by revered Bulgarian architect Iwan Iwanoff and named after the family who built it in 1965. Just days before Christmas in 2015, the entire building was gutted by a blaze that devastated not only Mr Bult and his family, but Perth's architecture and heritage communities more broadly. The temptation was there to make an insurance claim, walk away and start over somewhere else. But Mr Bult told ABC Radio Perth he and his wife were determined to rebuild the home exactly as it was. ""We loved the home so much,"" he said. ""Primarily we wanted our beloved family home back, but there was certainly an aspect of wanting to preserve this part of Iwan Iwanoff's amazing design portfolio.""  Iwanoff died in 1983, making the mammoth task of re-creating his unique and intricate design from scratch seemingly impossible. However, Mr Bult discovered Iwanoff's original handwritten blueprints for the home were being kept in storage at Western Australia's State Library. ""When we discovered that structurally the skeleton of the home was OK and we found the original drawings, all of a sudden we thought there was a chance we could do this,"" Mr Bult said.  Three years later, the restoration of one of Perth's most recognisable homes is complete. ""It was a difficult job,"" Mr Bult said. ""There were amazing tradespeople that had the skills required to build houses the way they were built 50 years ago."" The project has been documented in an upcoming episode of the ABC's Restoration Australia TV series. ""It was a very daunting task, and in the wrong hands that could have been a disaster,"" host Stuart Harrison said. ""The Paganins were big Perth stone and timber merchants so the house is a real showcase of beautiful materials. ""It's just as good now in 2019 as it was in 1965 — it's a perfect model for a house.""  Iwanoff designed a litany of architecturally significant buildings in WA, among them the heritage-listed Marsala House in Dianella and the Northam Council Office and Library. ""Iwanoff is to Perth what Gaudi is to Barcelona,"" Mr Harrison said. ""He was a critically important figure and was a shining light in Perth in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. ""He did incredibly great work and did these exceptionally good modernist houses that got more expressionistic as he went on through his career.""  Mr Harrison said Paganin House and Iwanoff's earlier works sparked a shift towards the use of expansive panels of glass and open space in home design. ""That was actually an entirely new idea that a house might have that degree of transparency, that much connection, view and amenity,"" he said. ""They're probably the first houses to really understand Perth's climate, with shading on all of the windows and also the introduction of open plan living and connected spaces.  Mr Harrison admitted Iwanoff's bold designs were not everyone's cup of tea. But he said the community's perception of what a heritage building looked like was evolving. ""I think we're beginning to appreciate it,"" he said. ""I don't think anyone questions art deco in terms of its historical importance now, and that's where we are with modernism now,"" he said.  Many ABC Radio Perth listeners were familiar with Paganin House and were happy to learn it had been restored. Susan — ""This home is a gorgeous head turner, noticed it even in fast traffic last week!"" Julie — ""I very fortunately went to a home open for this house before it was sold to the current owners. I grew up in the area and it was always my favourite house in the world. OMG it is amazing! So glad its been restored and thank you to the owners."" Anonymous — ""Often drove past the Paganin house and loved watching its progress. We recently finished up our lease rental of a lovely old mid-century house in City Beach. We were the last tenants of our house. Now it has been bulldozed to the ground, making way for a modern mansion I expect."" The restoration of Paganin House will be featured on Restoration Australia on ABC1 and ABC iview on Sunday at 7:40pm.  Topics:

312,Iconic fire-gutted Perth home restored to former glory,house-and-home," Posted 
    
      March 15, 2019 17:25:23 In late 2015, Perth's architecture and heritage communities were devastated when an iconic Iwan Iwanoff house in Floreat was gutted by fire. But rather than bowl over the burnt remains and start again, the owners of this architectural gem, known as Paganin House, decided to restore it to its full 1960's mid-century glory. Bulgarian national Iwanoff brought some swinging 60's flare to sleepy Perth and now his modernist designs are widely celebrated. When you walk through the restored Paganin house you can imagine Steve Mcqueen chatting to Twiggy and Jimi Hendrix at a cocktail party. The story of this rise from the ashes is told in the new season of ABC's Restoration Australia TV series. The show's host Stuart Harrison and Paganin house owner Tim Bult joined Nadia Mitsopoulos and Russell Woolf on ABC Radio Perth Breakfast to talk about the mammoth restoration project.

314,"Plan to cut $1,100 from household power bills faces pushback by NT Treasurer",house-and-home,"  Plan to cut $1,100 from household power bills faces pushback by NT Treasurer A move which would see more than $1,100 slashed from Territorians' household power bills over the next five years is facing pushback from NT Treasurer Nicole Manison. The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) has proposed extensive changes which would see Territory energy provider Power and Water Corporation's (PWC) revenue stream cut from a pegged annual $927 million to $760 million. Much of the savings would be found by trimming the energy bills of Territory consumers. Under the AER's draft distribution determination, NT residential customers would see an initial cut to their bills of $231 in 2019-20, followed by an annual $32 increase until 2024. Power and Water's proposed model would see bills drop by $72 in 2019-20, followed by rising hikes of $60 to $70 each year until 2024. While it would ultimately remain the responsibility of the NT Government to regulate residential power prices, if it followed the AER's structure, Territorians would be paying an average $14,288 on household power bills over the next five years compared with $15,401 under the PWC model. If it did not follow the AER's determination, the savings may have to be found elsewhere within the organisation. Small businesses would have a substantial $889 trimmed off their bills in the first year of the AER's determination, versus $277 under PWC's. ""Had we accepted Power and Water's proposal, the distribution component of the average annual residential electricity bill in 2023–24 would increase by about $190 from the 2018–19 level,"" AER wrote in its draft. NT Treasurer Ms Manison voiced her concern over the AER's draft determination, which would see Power and Water's ""allowance for operating expenditure"" significantly chopped. She has argued against the plan, which she said could be ""unsustainable and not consistent [with] Territorians' expectations for safe and reliable power"". ""PWC is unique in that it services a small population over a large geographic area,"" Ms Manison wrote in her submission. ""Given this, it cannot achieve efficiencies from the scale of its operations as is the case for other network service providers."" She also said the Territory's ""harsh climate"" put pressure on staffing requirements and that the tropical weather ""increases prudent maintenance and vegetation management expenditure"". PWC is already cash-strapped, having seen a $40.8 million decrease in its cash balance from $144.7 million in 2017 to $103.9 million in 2018, according to its latest annual report. Ms Manison also used the cost burden of power outages triggered by storms and cyclones in her argument against the savings — but nowhere in her submission did she mention the possibility of undergrounding power in Darwin, a pledge made by the Gunner Government following widespread blackouts from Cyclone Marcus in 2018. ""Cyclones and severe tropical storms are frequent events in the Territory and PWC requires sufficient resources to be on-hand and available to respond quickly to restore power,"" she wrote. ""PWC recently had to deal with the challenge of Tropical Cyclone Marcus, which caused extensive damage to the electricity network and resulted in widespread and sustained power outages across Darwin. ""Over 500 line spans were damaged and 28,000 customers … lost power with some customers left without power for 11 days. ""… It is important to ensure that PWC not only continues to be capable of responding to extreme weather events faced in the Territory, but that it can improve its responsiveness."" The AER said the NT Government's move to rollout underground power would further impact PWC's spending, if and when it went ahead. PWC said it was still ""awaiting the NT Government's decision on the suburb roll-out schedule[for undergrounding power]"". ""This means we do not have accurate information to estimate how undergrounding will affect our capex program,"" it said. In a statement to the ABC, Ms Manison said the Government was ""committed to undergrounding and is working closely with PWC to finalise priority areas for its implementation"". ""An announcement on this will be made soon,"" she said. In a response to the AER's draft determination, PWC said it had faced challenges in trying to engage ""customer and stakeholder interest"" into the proposed changes. ""Understandably, the estimation approaches for return on debt are an area of arcane detail in the eyes of many of those we engaged with in the NT,"" PWC's response said. ""Nonetheless … our return on debt was … not rejected by customers, and [was] commented upon as reasonable in our circumstances by one of our largest users."" When asked by the ABC if she stood by her statements considering recently reported high power bills, Ms Manison said her ""submission to the AER's determination process sought to ensure that the AER considered the Territory's unique circumstances, which it may not previously have encountered when making revenue determinations in other parts of Australia, to ensure that the Government's objectives of safe, reliable and least cost provision of electricity services is achieved"". ""It is important to note that electricity prices for residential customers in the Territory are regulated by the Government and remain one of the lowest in the country,"" Ms Manison said. The AER will be taking on new powers to set the revenue from July 1 this year. After months of negotiations with Power and Water and stakeholders, the AER will make its final determination on PWC's revenue by April 30.

315,Does the banking royal commission make buying a house even harder?,house-and-home,"  Buying a house? Here's how the banking royal commission affects you Analysts had warned that the banking royal commission could make it harder for would-be homebuyers to get a loan. Commissioner Kenneth Hayne's final report offers 76 recommendations, all of which the Federal Government and Labor say they will support and implement. Find out more here. That ended up coming to pass as banks began cracking down on home loans last year, but it raises the question: did the final report recommend any changes that will make buying a house even more difficult? We've taken a look at what the recommendations mean for home buyers. Nope. One of the big issues flagged before the royal commission started and during the inquiry was how banks assess would-be homebuyers for a loan. But since last year, the major banks and other lenders have made changes to loan applications to better verify the income and expenses of applicants to ensure they can afford to repay their debts. So, getting a loan had already become a lot tougher before the royal commission — a move that was recognised by Commissioner Kenneth Hayne in the report as a ""view to improve compliance"". Analysts are divided about just how much further the royal commission-induced lending slowdown has to go. As a result, he ended up recommending no changes to responsible lending laws. Instead, Mr Hayne left it up to the Federal Court and banking regulator APRA to determine what is required to comply with the National Consumer Credit Protection (NCCP) Act. ""I think if APRA hadn't already moved to tighten lending standards in late 2017, going into 2018, then the royal commission would have had an impact,"" AMP's chief economist Shane Oliver told the ABC. ""But as it turned out they had, and that has brought lending standards into being consistent with the NCCP ACT, so I don't see a further impact. ""In fact, the royal commission basically seems to be saying [the tightening has] already happened and to imply there was nothing further to do, other than what was already happening."" It seems like a pretty obvious measure on the surface, but when you dig a little deeper you'll find that the royal commission actually identified instances where mortgage brokers weren't necessarily acting in their client's best interests. It all came down to how mortgage brokers are paid, with Mr Hayne pointing out a conflict of interest between brokers recommending loans and the banks paying them. Brokers get paid a percentage of the loan amount, meaning they make more money if the borrower takes on a bigger debt. As business reporter Michael Janda explains, there are two possible ways this conflict of interest could play out: The issue then becomes murkier because of something called trail commissions, which allow mortgage brokers to charge fees for as long as a customer has a loan. Basically, if you have a 25-year loan, the broker might be getting commissions for the next quarter of a century. (Although it's the bank that is paying this trailing commission, not the borrower). It led Mr Hayne to point out in the report: ""The chief value of trail commissions to the recipient, to put it bluntly, is that they are money for nothing,"" he wrote. ""Why should a broker, whose work is complete when the loan is arranged, continue to benefit from the loan for years to come?"" So, he recommended that this practice should end, along with banks paying any kind of commissions to brokers, within two to three years. He also recommended mortgage brokers should meet similar obligations to financial planners, by requiring them to put their clients' best interests first. Not necessarily. The Government is still looking into Mr Hayne's recommendation on banning broker commissions from lenders. While the royal commission may cost the banks profits in the short term, it's very likely they'll find new ways to shift the cost back to you and me, writes Ian Verrender. Currently banks can still pay mortgage brokers commissions, although it will be significantly less now that trail commissions have been banned. Mr Oliver says it's possible they could decide to pass these savings on to borrowers (meaning your home loan could become cheaper). But he says you'll probably see mortgage brokers raise their upfront fee now that trail commissions are gone, so the cost could end up being the same. So what if changes to broker commissions were made in the future? Labor has already promised to back the ban if it's elected to government. In that scenario, Mr Oliver said there will be knock-on effects for smaller lenders, who rely on these intermediaries to break into the market. With bigger banks being able to outspend smaller banks on things like advertising and having more branches, Mr Oliver said you'll probably see more people going to the big banks for loans instead of going to a mortgage broker and paying an upfront fee. And in that scenario, he says big banks will face less competition and they won't necessarily pass those savings on to consumers. In fact, you could also see them raise their prices in the long term (meaning your loan will become more expensive).

316,New Territory homebuyer scheme 'most generous' in nation: Gunner,house-and-home,"  New Territory homebuyer scheme 'most generous' in nation, Michael Gunner says First home owners in the Northern Territory will receive up to $50,000 worth of incentives in what the Gunner Government has described as the ""most generous"" scheme in the country. The construction industry has seen a 50 per cent decline in the value of new homes built over the past two years, while population growth has slumped, creating challenging economic conditions in the Northern Territory. ""We know that the residential construction sector in particular is hurting right now and a lot of our stimulus programs have been designed around the trades that work on those programs,"" Chief Minister Michael Gunner said. ""But nothing substitutes for a new house."" A key aspect is a $30,000 construction bonus for 600 new homeowners who build or buy a new property. They will also get up to $18,000 worth of stamp duty concessions, as well as a $2,000 grant to buy household products. It doubles the previous value of incentives available to new home buyers purchasing new homes. But the value of incentives for those purchasing an existing dwelling as their first home will fall from $33,929 to $28,601. People who already own a property in the NT and plan to build and move into a new one will receive a $20,000 construction bonus, instead of a $7,000 stamp duty concession. The scheme also allows those who have not owned a property in the NT for at least two years to get back in the market with a stamp duty concession worth up to $18,601 for existing homes, and an extra $20,000 construction grant for new homes. Married and de facto couples who separate would have the two-year period waived. ""We don't want to lose that person (from the Territory),"" Mr Gunner said. ""I think this is one where genuinely from a very human point of view how do we get you into a house. ""I've seen it happen to my parents where mum got the house and dad had to go into the rental market."" The construction bonus will cost the Government $12 million, which is being diverted from the existing capital works cash budget. The Master Builders Association applauded the incentives program, saying it would also help retain workers. ""Real people who get to lock in on a future in the Territory — tradies, suppliers, everyone involved in construction having the opportunity to continue to work and to stay in the Territory as well,"" said MBA's Dave Malone. Opposition Leader Gary Higgins has welcomed the new home buyers scheme but said the Government needed to reveal its savings plan. ""They're doing a lot of spending and no saving,"" he said. ""I mean they have a lot of spin and rhetoric around savings but they are not putting anything down in writing."" The commencement of the new scheme comes as new figures revealed a slow uptake of another government incentive scheme, which offers up to $15,000 over five years for jobseekers and their families to relocate to the Territory. The Government hopes to attract around 2,600 people per year to the Territory as part of its broader population strategy. But in the first three months of that scheme, only two couples and one family have received $18,000 worth of payments. Another 15 applicants have been approved after securing jobs in specified categories, but were yet to relocate to the Territory to receive their incentives. Around 830 people and 100 businesses have registered their interest in the incentives program. ""I think it's early days,"" Mr Gunner said. ""It's about where I would have expected in the first couple of months."" He said the population scheme would be reviewed in March, including an update on the types of occupations that the scheme applies to.

317,Mould moves in as floodwaters ease in Townsville,house-and-home,"  Townsville floodwaters are easing but now the mould and mildew are setting in After rain, mould can pop up almost anywhere and it's getting worse by the day in Townsville, preventing the opening of schools in the wake of the flood disaster. While the north Queensland city starts cleaning up after record rain and floods, many are stuck trying to clean the fungi that is spreading across ceilings, walls, books, clothes and shoes. It is thriving in the schools, with about 30 closed in the region from flooding, according to Tony Cook, the director-general of Queensland's Department of Education. ""Mould is our biggest issue,"" Mr Cook said. ""Over the next two days we will have teams and teams of people working in our schools working on the mould. ""Our aim is to progressively open our remaining schools over the next week or so. ""We are positive and ambitious about that."" The smell isn't pleasant, but mould can also be hazardous. It has taken over both storeys of Lisa McMahon's Balgal Beach home, and little can be done to fix the problem until the roof cavity dries. ""The water started coming down through the fans, through the light fittings and smoke alarms,"" she said. ""Because we lost power we didn't have any air movement, so the mould started to grow. ""It's that mould that you can taste, it gets into everything, it's disgusting. ""All the linen and pillows, cushions, bean bags and teddies … the couches, all of the kids' beds, teddies. ""Literally the whole house … even all the woodwork. ""It's pretty devastating."" Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) officers doorknocking the region have reported that mould is becoming worse by the day. Mick Burley of the QFES said the area was already beginning to smell as the tropical sun hit water-logged homes. ""The mould growth will be significant and it'll start to increase as it all dries out,"" Mr Burley said. Townsville Public Health Unit director Steven Donohue said for most healthy people it was just a nuisance. But for some it can be dangerous. ""People who have a specific allergy, people who have lung diseases including asthma may react,"" he said. ""If they are on chemotherapy or they've got diabetes or kidney disease, some of them are at higher risk of getting an opportunistic infection."" The basic message is that mould is relatively easy to clean up. It thrives on darkness and water and therefore drying things out and sunlight are ways to keep it under control. Dr Donohue recommended wearing rubber gloves and a mask, and using diluted vinegar on a rag or paper towel.

318,Mortgaged to the hilt: Data reveals extent of WA's crippling debt crisis,house-and-home," Updated 
    
      February 05, 2019 16:35:35 West Australians are making more calls per capita to the National Debt Helpline than residents in any other state, as the legacy of a mining construction and housing downturn continues to bite.  In the three months to December, more than 9,000 calls were made to the financial advice helpline in WA, making up 21 per cent of the national total. That figure represents a 68-per-cent increase in calls compared to the same period in 2017, when WA made up just 14 per cent of the total. ""We're getting a fifth of the national calls, [but WA represents] only a tenth of the population,"" said Bev Jowle, executive officer of the Financial Counsellors' Association (FCA) of WA. In the past month, the WA branch of the helpline, which is run from the FCA's office in East Perth, has received an average of 70 to 80 calls per day. ""We had 137 calls in one day,"" Ms Jowle said, describing it as a record in her two-and-a-half years in the role. ""January's never usually this busy. We're really surprised.""   While the FCA is grappling to understand what is driving the spike in calls, a large number of callers have cited mortgage stress and property repossession. ""The mining downturn, I think, really started the ball rolling,"" Ms Jowle said. ""Many, many people are just mortgaged to the hilt. They basically either owe what their house is worth or they are going backwards. ""We know that there's a whole cohort of people who are just hanging in there and a change — even a slight change — in mortgage rates is going to have an impact."" Ms Jowle said many workers who had received redundancies in the immediate aftermath of the mining boom used the money to pay down their mortgages or other debt. ""Now that [money has] run out, they're starting to have to go back to making repayments on the mortgage,"" she said.   In some areas, particularly the North West, those home owners were now in negative equity, Ms Jowle added. ""They can't sell the asset, they can't live off the asset and their income isn't enough to sustain the debt that they've got on their assets,"" she said. ""We know that the mum-and-dad investors often were borrowing to the hilt on their own mortgage, extending that mortgage to buy the second house, and now they're having difficulty renting that house out for the cost of the mortgage.""  The other key issue, Ms Jowle said, was customer disconnections from electricity retailer Synergy, which make up about 30 per cent of WA calls. ""It's people who've been advised by Synergy that they're either about to be disconnected or have been disconnected,"" she said. ""There are people who are on almost an indefinite payment plan, because they're never going to be able to afford that bill. ""It's not unusual for us to have people who have $6,000–$7,000 worth of utility debt that they're probably never going to ever repay.""  Data from Synergy showed there were 17,614 residential disconnections in the past financial year, up from 14,251 in the previous year. The utility said in a statement it was able to provide debt waivers or incentive payments in cases where customers had made an effort to address their financial hardship. The FCA also said an increasing number of small businesses — in particular, sole tradespeople and franchisees — were seeking help.  ""Either their customers are in so much financial hardship [the business is] not getting paid, or they themselves have got too much debt,"" Ms Jowle said. ""As people have less and less money in the economy, they're spending less and less, particularly [on] things like fast food and restaurants."" While many callers were on low, fixed incomes, an increasing number were on middle incomes, Ms Jowle said. ""It's people who are starting to raise children, who are out there in the mortgage belt, who are not the retirees who have perhaps benefited from having lower mortgages 20 years ago."" The helpline data, which is collated by Telstra, only revealed the number of calls made to the Federal Government-funded helpline, rather than the number of calls answered. Almost one-third of calls in WA went unanswered between October and December last year. Some agencies offering face-to-face counselling were reporting a three-week wait list, while others had stopped taking registrations altogether. ""The numbers speak for themselves, but there are many, many people who don't get through because we simply don't have the staffing to manage that volume,"" Ms Jowle said.  A maximum of five financial counsellors are on duty at the helpline at any one time, with a single call taking up to one hour. Calls are triaged to prioritise the most urgent cases. ""We've got one solicitor who works for the whole state,"" Ms Jowle said. ""I think capacity really needs to be doubled before we actually start to see that people are getting those services as quickly as possible.""  Topics:

319,"Debate on national energy policy is even worse than Rudd, Gillard years, says senior NSW Liberal",house-and-home,"  Debate on national energy policy is even worse than Rudd, Gillard years, says senior NSW Liberal It was one of the most turbulent periods in Australian political history and culminated with the dramatic removal of both a prime minister and opposition leader. In November 2009, Kevin Rudd was trying to build enough support to pass an emissions trading scheme through parliament while Mr Turnbull put his leadership on the line by agreeing to negotiate with the Labor government. For a brief moment, it looked as if the pair might actually rise above party politics and reach bipartisan agreement on tackling ""the greatest moral challenge of our time"". But by June the following year, both men had failed and it ultimately cost them their jobs. A decade later, Australia still lacks a clear plan for securing reliable, affordable, and clean electricity for households and businesses around the country. In fact, one senior Liberal figure believes the politics of power is even more toxic than it was 10 years ago. New South Wales Energy Minister Don Harwin says there remains an overwhelming consensus to act on carbon emissions but it is being hijacked by extremist views within mainstream parties. He cites as an example the dumping of the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who declared the policy ""dead"" in September last year. ""It's almost an exact re-run of what happened in 2009 where there was a lot of support for what was Kevin Rudd's carbon reduction scheme and that failed,"" Mr Harwin told Background Briefing. ""A small group was able to effectively hold the federal government to ransom."" Five conservative Coalition MPs had earlier threatened to cross the floor if the legislation reached a vote in parliament. Mr Harwin says it is unfortunate a vocal minority can wield so much influence. ""The nature of our two party system is that pressure from small groups on the extreme can actually have a lot of effect because there's just not enough bipartisanship,"" he said. This is not the first time Mr Harwin has clashed with his Liberal colleagues in Canberra. At a COAG meeting in Adelaide last December, Mr Harwin tried to raise the issue of emissions but says Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor cut him off and shut down the discussion on procedural grounds. ""I wasn't sticking to the script,"" Mr Harwin concedes. ""I think people thought it was going to be a relatively uncontroversial meeting but there was a bit of tension,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say it was awkward. It was a little tense, though."" When asked about the incident, Mr Taylor would not refer to Mr Harwin by name but said he would not entertain an increase to emissions targets beyond the 26 per cent agreed to under the Paris accord. The federal government is instead seeking to focus debate on lowering the price of electricity and increasing reliability. It initially proposed a divestiture law which would have given Treasurer Josh Frydenberg the ability to force energy providers to sell power stations slated for closure in order to keep them running under a different operator. A spokesperson for Mr Frydenberg's office said the draft legislation was subsequently changed to require a court order where recommended by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. He said the government would only intervene in particular cases in order to secure supply and stop price-gouging by companies that benefit when prices soar following the closure of generators. ""If you had an energy company that was deliberately withholding supply from the market or shutting a plant and refusing to sell it to a third party in order to manipulate prices, that would be a scenario for instance where these powers might be used,"" Mr Taylor said. But Mr Harwin says the Coalition's ""big stick"" approach has spooked the industry and risks discouraging investment as a result. ""It's a matter for the federal parliament but the feedback I'm certainly getting from the sector is it's making it less likely they'll invest,"" he said. As the debate rages on, energy policy expert Tony Wood is frustrated by the seeming powerlessness of politicians to take meaningful action to address this tricky issue. When asked about the number of proposals that have come before parliament only to fail, Mr Wood quipped, ""You're going to make me cry"". A senior executive of Origin Energy for 14 years, Mr Wood is now the Director of the Energy Program at the Grattan Institute. ""I've been working in the energy industry directly since 1995 and for the first half of that period, things were reasonably stable and energy was pretty boring, really,"" Mr Wood told Background Briefing. ""It all started to go a bit strange in the early 2000s and we've probably seen on climate change policy at least seven or eight different attempts to try and do something,"" he said. ""Has it just been a series of unfortunate individual events combined with political circumstances that have meant we keep falling over, or is there something more fundamental about climate change that has made it so difficult to progress?""

320,Perth records strongest rental market in six years. See how your area performed,house-and-home," Updated 
    
      February 01, 2019 11:49:13 As property analysts debate whether Perth's housing downturn has reached its nadir, one part of the market is staging a quiet recovery.  In just over 18 months, the rental vacancy rate in Perth has fallen from 7.3 per cent — its highest level on record — to 2.8 per cent, the lowest rate in almost six years. That rapid contraction has been reflected in the crowds of potential tenants turning out to view properties, Real Estate Institute of Western Australia deputy president Lisa Joyce said. ""We are starting to see groups of people at home opens, multiple applications on rental properties, and this is a space we haven't been in for some time,"" she said. ""There's certainly some shuffle in the local market, tenants moving to new properties, but on top of that we are seeing much more activity in that corporate, executive expat market, as well as the interstate market."" As co-founder of real estate firm Joyce Property Investments, Ms Joyce recently hired a temporary administration assistant to process rental applications. ""For me, as a business owner, I'm looking at whether that's a seasonal spike in January or whether this is a sustainable, renewed interest in rental properties,"" she said. ""I think we'll have 10-to-15-per-cent growth in rents by the end of the year and it'll be interesting to see how that then translates into the sales market.""  Property analyst Gavin Hegney agreed, but said he believed rents may rise even further, by 15 to 30 per cent. ""That will have a knock-on effect eventually to values, because people will start to say, 'Well, if I have to pay that in rent, I may as well buy',"" he said. ""It's got to break out somewhere. You can't have rental stock dropping by over 27 per cent in the last year, as it has … and it not find its way into the purchasing market at some stage. ""That's probably what we'll see in 12 months' time."" The rapid change in market conditions has caught some prospective tenants by surprise. Three days ago, Shane and Njeri moved to Perth from regional New South Wales with their 10-month-old daughter, Amani.  ""A lot of my reading suggested it was still fairly flat [in the Perth market],"" said Njeri, a doctor who relocated to take up a new job. ""I'm quite surprised that this is what we've encountered. ""It's certainly better than what we avoided, which would have been eastern Sydney. That was probably another option for work."" Mr Hegney said the Perth rental market was the product of a ""perfect storm"" of financial and demographic factors. ""We've had investors selling properties and a tightening of finance as well, at the same time as we've seen an increase in tenant demand, and that's caused the vacancy rate to drop like a stone,"" he said. Reduced access to finance had kept some tenants in the rental market for longer than usual, Mr Hegney said, while lower rents had prompted household sizes to shrink. ""We're now seeing individuals being able to rent a property on their own, or two couples being able to move out and get their own property, and that effectively is increasing demand in the rental space, [rather than] population growth"" Mr Hegney said.  While rental availability has tightened markedly, rental prices themselves are yet to follow suit. Data from CoreLogic shows Perth rents have fallen by almost 22 per cent since their peak in May 2013, with the median rent — at $350 per week in the December quarter — close to its level of a decade ago.   CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless said that would change as Perth's population growth rate recovered. ""We're still seeing quite a negative result from interstate migration, meaning there are more people leaving WA than are arriving, but overseas migration has definitely levelled out and shown a subtle improvement,"" Mr Lawless said. ""I think that combination of an increase in demand without much increase in supply is probably what's going to be driving Perth rents a little bit higher.""   Over the past two years, a surplus of new residential development — which peaked in December 2015 for houses, and in the first quarter of 2016 for units — has been slowly absorbed. ""I wouldn't say that Perth's housing market is now undersupplied, but we are seeing the marketplace moving back into some level of equilibrium between the level of demand versus how much supply has come onto the market,"" Mr Lawless said. The recovery in the rental market has prompted some property observers to predict an increase in house prices, following a four-year decline.  However, Mr Lawless cautioned that risks remained in the outlook for Perth's property market, following a false start to a recovery in 2017. ""Jobs growth started to weaken, unemployment started to rise once again and that seems to have resulted in a bit of delay in Perth's housing market bottoming out,"" he said. ""But I think if we do see an ongoing improvement in local economic conditions, [with] stronger commodity prices, I think that should help turn around migration figures even more and drive demand. ""Finance availability has thrown a bit of a dampening blanket across the entire market, not just in Sydney and Melbourne … it's much harder to get credit these days than it used to be. ""I think towards the end of the year, we probably will start to see the Perth marketplace levelling out. I'd be really surprised if we saw any material rate of capital gain coming back into the market."" Much depends on whether prospective buyers could secure mortgages in the current market, Mr Hegney said. ""People will move over into the purchasing market because … it'll almost be cheaper to buy than rent, but that's on the basis they can get the money,"" he said. ""If they can't get the money because the banks have tightened up lending, then we may well see rents move higher relative to values than we have seen in the past.""  Topics:

321,analysis: A partial defence of the hipsters who've taken over the inner city,house-and-home,"  Hipsters have changed inner cities for the better, so why should the suburbs miss out? One of the stark differences between neighbourhoods in the inner city and outer suburbs in Australia is the quality and type of retail offerings. Gentrifying inner-city suburbs — places like West End in Brisbane, Fitzroy in Melbourne and Newtown in Sydney — are characterised by independent owner-operated retail businesses. Busy ""third places"" such as cafes, bars and restaurants — where people spend time between home (""first"" place) and work (""second"" place) — are common. These are the favoured haunts of the hipster. Hipsters have an uneasy place in our cultural landscape, not least of which is their role in gentrification. However, their role in the inner city is important in showing the rest of the city how to create contemporary, accessible and successful third places with low, non-gendered barriers to entry. Third places provide residents and visitors with a variety of what Ray Oldenburg calls ""the core settings of informal public life"". Cafes, bars, pubs, clubs or chess rooms (in some places) are places where people can meet informally or be ""alone together"". They allow for planned and accidental encounters across different times of the day and are essential for a healthy neighbourhood social life or sense of community. As we travel out of the inner city towards the outer suburbs, residents become increasingly deprived of these places. Suburban retail centres become less ""local"" — shopping centres are isolated from the surrounding neighbourhood, controlled by a single corporate landlord, marooned in a sea of parking and offer a predictable range of franchised outlets and national brands, often anchored by a large supermarket. At the district level are huge impersonal shopping malls. None of this enables residents to take advantage of local third places or feel any sense of authorship over them, which is so important for creating place and community. History has an obvious role to play. Inner-city suburbs were planned and built before widespread car ownership. Streets are laid out in grids, which make for easy and direct pedestrian or bicycle travel. These areas were built before the introduction of strict ""single use"" zoning regimes, so have a good mix of land uses. Retail, residential and even industrial properties exist side by side. Property ownership has evolved so one landlord rarely controls an entire retail strip. Businesses open on to wide, protected footpaths which are thoroughfares for more than just the businesses located there. The built form is varied, interesting and vernacular and suited to small independent businesses. Inner-city neighbourhoods in recent decades have been gentrified as more affluent residents and businesses colonise formerly working class, migrant or Indigenous areas of inner cities. Gentrification takes place over a long time and in particular phases. The first to colonise an area are ""renter gentrifiers"". They are responsible for making the place hip or edgy through alternative music and art, underground fashion and an embryonic start-up business culture. This in turn attracts better-resourced gentrifiers who share the same cultural tastes as the renter gentrifiers but have money. This creates demand for a range of retail outlets, such as artisanal bakers, micro-breweries, tattoo artists, vintage fashion shops, vinyl record stores, independent bookstores and, most importantly, abundant bars and coffee shops. Hipsters are often disparaged for their lack of originality, for championing a look that mimics a historical period they never experienced. As Jake Kinsey writes sarcastically in a whole book that derides hipsters: … creativity, genius, eternal value and mystery are inseparable from the hipster. Authenticity is a contested word, but if we think in terms of ""authorship"", the independently owned and operated third place where both owner and customer feel a sense of ownership and reciprocal obligation provides much more authenticity than just another outlet in a chain of franchises. While some hipster businesses that work in the gentrified inner city might not work so well in the outer suburbs, people who live in these suburbs are not a different species. The desire to get out of your house, to socialise, to see your neighbours out in the community or to be ""alone together"" is not limited to the inner city. There is no reason people in the suburbs would not respond to independently-owned businesses, rather than the remotely controlled, rationalised franchises — see ""McDonaldisation"" — that populate so many suburban shopping centres. Quality third places are just as important in the outer suburbs, which are becoming increasingly diverse in terms of life stage, ethnicity, culture and employment type. Property developers are often quick to point out that local retail is not economically viable in new suburbs unless it consists of supermarkets and fast-food outlets and is surrounded by tarmac. Local (walkable) retail is invariably compared on price to the large impersonal shopping malls that draw shoppers in from the suburbs. However, a small local shopping precinct, where ""third place"" businesses (such as bars, cafes and restaurants) and community hubs can operate at survivable rents, is a different proposition. This is not a new suggestion. Various models have been proposed to subsidise retail rents or provide independent freehold of individual retail premises or rent control. Developers have been reluctant to help with this as it not profitable (for them). Local authorities have also been reluctant to engage developers on this front. There are, however, some encouraging exceptions to this. Some more enlightened developers see the sustained benefit of creating community hubs. The argument is for a social good rather than a purely economic one. The outer suburbs are spatially different to the inner city — history and late capitalism have taken care of that. Local authorities need to think about current inflexible zoning regimes and how small, socially beneficial businesses can be encouraged. Suburbs do not empty out during the day. In a post-work and ageing society, suburbs will become socially barren places to live unless there are lively hubs where people can leave the private realm of the home and see each other in a welcoming environment over which they feel some authorship.

322,Family makes precious discovery in old tins during Marie Kondo clean-up,house-and-home,"  Marie Kondo clean-up leads to Perth family's precious discovery in old biscuit and tea tins Marie Kondo is a name that has been on a lot of people's lips this summer. Through her Netflix show, the Japanese tidying expert has inspired people around the world to declutter their lives and homes. Unwanted items have been sent en masse to charity shops. But the KonMari method, as it is known, has also helped Perth woman Kate Gorce-Masham discover a precious family treasure. Ms Gorce-Masham said she made the find while tidying a collection of old biscuit and tea tins. ""One of them was particularly old and I couldn't quite work out why I had it and I kept looking at it and thinking, 'No I don't recognise this tin',"" she said. ""I heard a little rattle inside and I thought 'Oh I wonder what's in there', and of course we opened it. ""Inside is this little envelope and there's a little note written to Matilda [Ms Gorce-Masham's daughter]. ""The little note explains where the tin comes from and how it was my mum's great-grandmother's tin when she was a little girl."" ""My mum … kept all her knitted dolls clothes in it and she's marked here in the little note too that the tin is actually 65 years old, and she's treasured it and she says she hopes Matilda will treasure it too."" The letter reads: Dear Matilda When I was about five years old this tin was given to me by my great-grandmother. I was thrilled as it was filled with hand made knitted dolls clothes for my doll. This tin is 65 years old and I have treasured it, and I hope you will too. My great-grandmother was a tall white-haired, elegant lady who held her head high as she walked. All my fondest love Nan xx The pretty, oval-shaped tin is now 77 years old and its former keeper, Doreen Macham, who was born in 1936, has dementia. ""Mum had three sisters and I don't think they had an awful lot growing up, so having a special little tin where she could keep her dolls clothes would have just been wonderful for her,"" she said. ""When we see how much kids have nowadays, you know perhaps that was her only little treasure and joy to play with."" Kate Gorce-Macham's daughter, Matilda, plans to keep the tin for generations to come. But they have culled other items that do not, as Marie Kondo says, ""spark joy"" — giving them away to relatives and doing runs to the local charity shop. Judging by the St Vincent de Paul Society's January donation figures, they are not alone. Compared to this time last year, donations in WA are up 30 per cent. In Sydney, clothing donations have jumped by an average of 35 per cent — translating to 120,000 kilograms worth of clothes being processed in the charity's Sydney warehouses each week. St Vincent de Paul's chief executive in New South Wales, Jack de Groot, said the summer school holidays were always a busy time for donations, but he suspected the Marie Kondo craze was responsible for some of this year's increase. ""We can't give you any more than the anecdotes that come from people … [but they say] the Marie Kondo shows on Netflix and this phenomenon of decluttering has inspired them to declutter and thus to give to us,"" he said. Mr de Groot said St Vincent de Paul was grateful for the increase and the quality of the items people were giving, but asked that donations were made thoughtfully. ""So the first sort of rule of thumb is if you wouldn't give it to a mate, don't donate … if it's rubbish then take care of it responsibly and put it into the rubbish collections,"" he said. ""But also check with the charities as to whether they can use the donations. ""[For example] not every organisation is able to cope with electrical goods because of the requirements for safety in different states in Australia."" The founder of Perth's first Buy Nothing group, David Klein, said neighbourhood Facebook pages like the one he set up were another great place to recycle KonMari cast-offs. ""Marie in her wisdom has highlighted the fact that we don't need to have as much stuff as most of us have, and that's a lot about what Buy Nothing is about too,"" he said. Foodbank is one charity that has not seen a noticeable increase in donations in the wake of the Marie Kondo craze. Foodbank general manager Sarah Pennell encouraged people to declutter their pantries and donate unwanted staples. ""Obviously they need to be within the use-by date, but if you have items that are surplus to your needs then there's definitely someone out there who could make use of them,"" she said. Ms Pennell said items could be taken to one of Foodbank's warehouses or to local charities accepting food. ""Many churches, the Salvation Army, Anglicare, they will have outlets in every community providing food relief to people,"" she said. Ms Gorce-Masham and her daughter Matilda said they had only just started their Marie Kondo journey. But they were planning to take a break to visit Matilda's Nan in her nursing home and Ms Gorce-Masham said when they did, they would be taking her tin with them. ""We'll just see what kind of reaction she has. It might take her a while too,"" she said. ""I guess we'll open it and show her the little note that she wrote … hopefully she'll remember.""

323,opinion: 'I don't accumulate things': The ups and downs of tiny house living,house-and-home,"  What is tiny-house living really like and how can it be made better? Mention ""tiny house"" in any social gathering and people almost always say, ""Oh I love tiny houses"". The enthusiasm for tiny houses isn't matched, however, by the take-up of tiny-house living. Very few people actually live in tiny houses. So, why the discrepancy? As a follow-up to my research (in 2015 and 2017), I interviewed people around the country (in person and on social media) about their lived experience in tiny houses. I also stayed in a tiny house. Tiny houses have received heavy coverage in the media, but there's more than meets the eye, writes Megan Carras. Most of the people I interviewed were in southeast Queensland, but some were in Victoria and Tasmania. The majority were situated in rural or semi-rural areas, although a couple lived in suburban locations (Brisbane and Logan). Most were aged in their 20s, or were 55-plus, and were couples or singles, the majority women. A few had children. Nearly all had built their own tiny house, but some had bought their homes from tiny-house builders. Interestingly, few homes were the archetypal tiny house on wheels — there were container houses, converted buses, and even tents. This accords with research on the typology of tiny houses, which found they can take a number of forms. Note: ""True tiny houses … (whether on foundation or wheels) are generally smaller than 400 sq ft (37m2)."" People had lived in their tiny houses from weeks to a couple of years. The majority had only positive things to say about tiny-house living. As one respondent enthused: I LOVE it. Love living in it; independent side of things … it's much better than [living in] the caravan — own shower, kitchen, composting toilet, complete independence. Another said: I actually enjoy to live in a smaller space, because you don't feel overwhelmed, and with kids you can see all the time, you can hear them and see what they're up to. I love tiny house living, and I would love to help other people getting into it, it would be awesome. Other positive experiences included: People also often mentioned the ease of maintenance. Nearly all commented on how easy it was to keep clean and to heat or cool. One respondent said: ""Cleaning the house takes half an hour and I know where everything is. I don't accumulate things I don't need."" Another commented: ""A tiny house is a breeze to clean."" Those who were negative expressed minor concerns with issues such as cleaning composting toilets and small spaces. One commented: ""The multipurpose nature of each room means that the bedding smells like fish when I cook salmon."" But, more seriously, longer-term concerns included: One young Tasmanian couple with a 15-month-old son moved out of their tiny house (which they had built themselves), partly because it was too difficult to keep their active child content in the small space during the cold and wet winter months. An ongoing issue is where to put tiny houses. Planning laws are still the major obstacle to tiny-house living. One respondent said: ""I don't like the fact that there is no surety that I can stay legally in one place. I don't like knowing that I can't stay long-term. You know what your timeframe is for renting, [you're] not going to be moved for a ridiculous reason. There's no protection if in a tiny house. Silly [council] rules like I [have to] stay in it for two nights, then move into the main house for one night, I get why these things have been put into place … waste and water, amenity; but I don't see why [regulations] for that can't be implemented."" Major findings of this and other research are that tiny houses are here to stay. They are definitely not just a niche market, but are more suited to certain demographics. Interestingly, those who had moved to more conventional houses seemed almost guilty about having left. Tiny houses should be more realistically viewed as one stage in the lifetime housing journey, which may suit some and not others. Housing in the 21st century needs to be more flexible to suit various lifestyle stages and households, not just singles and nuclear families. Safe shelter is a fundamental human right, but conventional housing has become increasingly unattainable for many. Local governments in particular could be far more proactive by adapting their planning schemes to permit more flexible types of dwellings, obviously in accordance with building, health, safety and environmental regulations. This would enable people to live in security without being afraid that they are going to be moved off because some neighbour might complain. ""As long as safe and sanitary, and not an environmental eyesore, then why not? It's very easy to say, if you have a certain size property, then you can have x tiny houses, [at a] certain distance."" Finally, as the owner of a property that has a number of tiny houses said: ""I have worked in urban development for 20 years and the concept of affordable housing is a furphy unless we change legislation and allow people to live smaller. I am passionate that housing should be accessible by all, that people shouldn't have to resort to social and public housing. Tiny housing offers a major disruptive solution to an ever-growing housing unaffordability and social divide in housing."" This article first appeared on The Conversation.

324,How far-away lands shaped the Queenslander,house-and-home," RN Queenslander homes are quintessentially Australian, but their design owes much to Asia The classic Queenslander is one of Australia's most iconic architectural styles, but the multicultural influences that make it unique are barely acknowledged. While British colonial trends dictated the basic design footprint, the wooden houses of northern Australia owe their decorative finesse to an ancient Asian tradition. To understand this unspoken orientalism, it helps to travel north — about 7,000 kilometres, in fact, to rural Cambodia. As in many Asian countries, Cambodia's traditional buildings imitate the elegant nature of high Buddhist temple architecture. Houses and communal buildings are decorated with ridges, horns and finials, intricate fret-work and ornamental embellishments intended to lift the corners of the roof as if to the heavens. The wealthiest examples have a multi-gabled roof or a classic Chinese hip-gable construction. Though often intricately adorned, their layout and build speak of a functionality and simplicity born of necessity: open-plan, timber-clad homes raised high on stilts to catch the breeze and protect against flooding. The high-set cottages suit a tropical climate — a land of searing heat and torrential downpours, not unlike that of far-away Queensland. Some bear more than a passing resemblance to the iconic weatherboard workers' cottages that proliferated in the northern parts of Australia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Nowhere is this more evident than in the village of Kampong Khleang, which sits on the edge of Tonle Sap lake. Many tourists come to see the region's ""floating villages"" — collections of moored house-boats. But the town is also home to an impressive array of what could rather cheekily be called Cambodian Queenslanders. The similarities are obvious — the houses raised high on stumps, with ornate fretwork features, deep, covered verandahs, decorative cantilevered verandah-brackets and screens. Looking down the dusty main street, it's not hard to imagine you've been plunged back in time to late 19th century Queensland. While the two styles aren't directly related, they share two common traits: a vernacular build adapted to contend with the taxing tropical climate, and a reverential nod toward the majesty of Imperial Chinese design. Many parts of Asia still carry remnants of the architectural patina of European colonialism. From the 1840s onward, places like Shanghai, Hong Kong and Phnom Penh began to look increasingly European in character, with new public buildings and wealthy residential dwellings borrowing heavily on European styles — neo-classical, Italianate and French Renaissance, for example. But the tide flowed both ways. Soldiers and civil servants of the British Empire brought back to England a taste for the exotic east that stretched well beyond rice and curry. The Victorians, and before them the Georgians, not only imposed their design stamp on the world, but also borrowed the best of the architectural features they encountered. The Royal Pavilion in Brighton, built as a regal holiday residence in full Indo-Saracenic style, is the most famously ostentatious example of this. But design appropriation also had a practical side. It allowed the architectural virtues found in one part of the Empire to be pressed into service across a number of colonies. The British famously co-opted the idea of a deep outside covered porch from India, turning the Hindi word varanda into the Anglicised verandah. In the Australian north, that particular innovation was so well received that verandas soon became the norm, in many cases wrapping around two or even three sides of a house. But the earliest examples tended to be more practical than decorative. Photographs of Queensland colonial housing in the mid 19th century show a rather un-ornamental style. The great change — the embellishment of the Queenslander — came around the 1880s and continued through into the Edwardian age. European expansion into China, and the opening up of Japan to foreign trade several decades earlier, renewed a dormant mania for all things oriental. For the titled elite, ""Chinese drawing rooms"" became the fashion. And for the common people, oriental mystique found its most obvious physical form in what we now know as the Victorian rotunda or bandstand. Today, such structures are viewed as quintessentially British. But like the traditional houses of Cambodia, the Victorian bandstand borrowed heavily on temple motifs. Many were round or hexagonal like a pagoda, with the elegance and intricacy of stylised Chinese decoration: finials, fretwork (now cast in iron), ridge horns and often acroteria — those ornamental features that give the corners of the roof an upward oriental inflection. In the colony of Queensland, those same features also found their way into domestic housing construction. ""Chinoiserie"", the European interpretation of Asian artistic traditions, was all the rage. Embellishing a building in the ""Chinese taste"" gave colour and distinction to the utilitarian nature of the weatherboard home. Hence the Queenslander took its final magisterial form. In the 1990s, historical anthropologist Nicholas Thomas theorised that colonial Australia drew inspiration from Asia and India in part because of what they saw as a lack of indigenous vernacular architecture. Numerous leading architects of the time like Harold Desbrowe-Annear and his one-time boss William Salway had experimented with Chinese styles and, in the case of Salway, had actually lived and worked for many years in Asia. According to conservation architect and heritage consultant Amanda Jean, ""Chinese symbolism"" also found its way into what became known as Australian Federation design — an antipodean variant of the Queen Anne style that became popular in the southern Australian colonies from the 1890s. ""The picturesque features, the dominant roof form, conical tower, red roof tiles decorative ridge capping and finials, the use of timber brackets and fret work,"" she says, all combined to produce an architectural mix of ""Chinese details with English tradition"". While Victorian Britain's passion for oriental folly has long been acknowledged, even celebrated, the same cannot be said for Asia's influence on Australian colonial and federation architecture. The historic influence of oriental symbolism on our early building design is, even today, largely overlooked or ignored. The one exception is William Hardy Wilson who, in the early 1920s, spent several years researching design in China. He subsequently wrote explicitly about the connection, which even at that time had been forgotten. Wilson, says historian Zeny Edwards in an article on the influential architect for the National Library of Australia, ""discerned a Chinese influence in the circular forms and strongly horizontal lines of many Colonial buildings"". But his was very much a minority voice. If such national architectural amnesia seems unusual, Ms Jean suggests it's important to remember the dominant theme of late colonial/early Federation politics — race. In the early 1900s, just as the fashion for orientalist Chinese was quietly becoming an important aspect of Australian architecture, fear of the ""yellow peril"" was also gripping the nation. And one of the first actions of the new parliament of Australia when it convened in Melbourne in 1901 was the passage of the Immigration Restrictions Act — the foundation stone of what became the ""White Australia"" policy. Ms Jean describes this paradox as one which ""allowed an Asian cultural art form to become deeply embedded within what is regarded as the first national Australian architectural style: a style which coincided with the height of British imperial rule, the declaration of the Federation of the Australian colonies as a nation in 1901 and introduction of the White Australia Policy, which served as an ideological function to keep out Asian migrants"". Fortunately for those who find pleasure in the eccentricities of Australia's architectural past, over time good design has proven more durable than bad politics.

325,analysis: Planning a Marie Kondo clean-up? Here's what clutter does to your body and brain,house-and-home,"  Marie Kondo's Tidying Up is on point — here's what clutter does to your body Many of us have started the year determined to be more organised: no more drawers full of plastic containers with missing lids or lone socks. The decluttering craze is led by Japanese tidying aficionado Marie Kondo, author of a New York Times bestseller and Netflix show Tidying Up. Charity groups such as St Vincent de Paul are reporting a 38 per cent increase in donations, year on year, as we get rid of the clothes, books and household items that don't ""spark joy"" or have a place in our future. And there is good reason to get on board, whether it's via the KonMari method, or just having a good clear-out. Clutter can affect our anxiety levels, sleep, and ability to focus. It can also make us less productive, triggering coping and avoidance strategies that make us more likely to snack on junk and watch TV shows (including ones about other people decluttering their lives). My own research shows our physical environments significantly influence our cognition, emotions and subsequent behaviours, including our relationships with others. Bursting cupboards and piles of paper stacked around the house may seem harmless enough. But research shows disorganisation and clutter have a cumulative effect on our brains. Our brains like order, and constant visual reminders of disorganisation drain our cognitive resources, reducing our ability to focus. The visual distraction of clutter increases cognitive overload and can reduce our working memory. In 2011, neuroscience researchers using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and other physiological measurements found clearing clutter from the home and work environment resulted in a better ability to focus and process information, as well as increased productivity. Clutter can make us feel stressed, anxious and depressed. Research from the United States in 2009, for instance, found the levels of the stress hormone cortisol were higher in mothers whose home environment was cluttered. A chronically cluttered home environment can lead to a constant low-grade fight or flight response, taxing our resources designed for survival. This response can trigger physical and psychological changes that affect how we fight bugs and digest food, as well as leaving us at greater risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Clutter might also have implications for our relationships with those around us. A 2016 US study, for instance, found background clutter resulted in participants being less able to correctly interpret the emotional expressions on the faces of characters in a movie. And surprisingly, it doesn't go away when we finally get to bed. People who sleep in cluttered rooms are more likely to have sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep and being disturbed during the night. Multiple studies have found a link between clutter and poor eating choices. Disorganised and messy environments led participants in one study to eat more snacks, eating twice as many cookies than participants in an organised kitchen environment. Other research has shown that being in a messy room will make you twice as likely to eat a chocolate bar than an apple. Finally, people with extremely cluttered homes are 77 per cent more likely to be overweight. Tidy homes have been found to be a predictor of physical health. Participants whose houses were cleaner were more active and had better physical health, according to another study. Buying more and more things we think we need, and then not getting rid of them, is an actual disorder in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). According to DSM-V, those with hoarding disorder compulsively acquire possessions on an ongoing basis and experience anxiety and mental anguish when they are thrown away. A Yale study using fMRI showed that for people who have hoarding tendencies, discarding items can cause actual pain in regions of the brain associated with physical pain. Areas of the brain were activated that are also responsible for the pain you feel when slamming a finger in a door or burning your hand on the stove. People who suspect they have hoarding disorder can take heart: cognitive behavioural therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment. Participants in Marie Kondo's Netflix show Tidying Up report that her decluttering method changes their lives for the better. Indeed, her first book was called The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Research does indeed show cluttered home environments negatively influence the perception of our homes, and ultimately our satisfaction of life. The study authors note the strong effect is because we define ""home"" not just as a place to live, but as: ""the broader constellation of experiences, meanings, and situations that shape and are actively shaped by a person in the creation of his or her lifeworld"". But it seems clutter isn't always bad. One study showed messy desks can make us more creative. The findings suggested neat, ordered environments make us more likely to conform to expectations and play it safe, while messy ones move us to break with the norm and look at things in a new way.

326,opinion: Tiny houses look marvellous but have a dark side,house-and-home,"  Tiny houses look marvellous but have a dark side: 3 things they don't tell you in marketing blurb Tiny houses are everywhere. They've received heavy coverage in the media and there are millions of followers on dozens of pages on social media. While there is no census for these homes, they have seen a surge in popularity in the decade since the Great Recession — witness the prolific growth of tiny house manufacturers, for instance. Originating in the US, tiny homes have also been popping up across Canada, Australia and the UK. Tiny houses are promoted as an answer to the affordable housing crisis; a desirable alternative to traditional homes and mortgages. Yet there are many complexities and contradictions that surround these tiny spaces, as I discovered when I began investigating them. I have toured homes, attended tiny house festivals, stayed in a tiny house community and interviewed several dozen people who live inside them. My research took me throughout the US, from a converted accessory unit squeezed between two average size homes on Staten Island to a community in Florida full of cute and brightly coloured tiny structures — appropriately located just down the road from Disney World. Here are three things I unexpectedly discovered along the way. Millennials have a complicated relationship with home ownership. They often still want to own a home but are simply not able to do it in the same way as their parents, and are known as ""Generation Rent"" as a result. All the tiny-houser millennials that I interviewed wanted to own bigger houses in future; they saw tiny living as a means of owning something now and being able to save at the same time. Several young couples planned to upgrade once they had children, selling their tiny homes or even keeping them as guesthouses. But if they saw these homes as a temporary option they would abandon as their lives progressed, it's not always so straightforward in practice. Apart from the obvious challenge of saving enough to afford a bigger place, it's not easy to sell tiny homes since they usually depreciate in value. And because they are not attached to land, there is often a question mark about their long-term viability as well. Tiny homes tend to be on wheels as a way of getting around government regulations on minimum habitable dwelling size. This often makes their inhabitants feel unsettled. In my own experience staying in a tiny home, I recall feeling a general awareness of the wheels underneath and a slight swaying as I jumped from the ladder that accessed the lofted bed. As one interviewee who lives with his partner and small child on private land in rural Washington State told me: ""It doesn't feel that grounded; it feels like we are detached from the Earth because there are wheels underneath us … it's a constant reminder … you are in this fragile state of housing."" The majority of dwellers that I talked to were eager to live on a solid foundation in future. I met one millennial who used her college fund to build a beautifully crafted and customised tiny home, but felt so groundless after only a year of living on wheels that she was trying to sell. This suggests that building codes will need to be relaxed to allow more tiny housers to live on foundations. Some places have taken the lead on this already — one example is Spur, Texas, which has changed its relevant housing laws with the express intention of attracting tiny housers in response to a declining population. Spur is pitching itself as the first tiny house friendly town in America. More broadly, however, the legalities around tiny homes remain complicated. They continue to restrict the potential for this lifestyle both in the US and elsewhere. In the UK, for instance, there can be issues with planning laws that require all new dwellings to have more than one bed space. In south-west England, Bristol City Council recently overruled such rules to allow several tiny homes to be built in the back garden of a terraced house in the suburbs, reckoning that it was necessary to help alleviate a local housing crisis. Tiny houses are often put forward as a more sustainable housing option. They are certainly a potential check on the continued pursuit of bigger houses and greater consumption of energy, building materials and so forth. Yet reducing your environmental impact by going tiny is not as simple as some have claimed. I came across several tiny households that were using external storage spaces for items that wouldn't fit in the home, for example. Referred to as a ""dirty secret"" by one interviewee, another explained her desire to keep items from her previous home in case she changed her mind about tiny living. Over half of my interviewees had a ""one in, one out"" mentality, where they would throw away or donate one item to make space for something new. As one dweller in her late 30s, who lives in a state-of-the-art home in a caravan park in rural New Hampshire, said: ""I have a TK Maxx addiction. I still go out every couple months and buy a bunch of stuff then come home and decide which things to get rid of."" Regardless of how tiny living is marketed by the enthusiasts, sustainability was not a major driver for most of the participants in my study. Instead it was almost an afterthought. It seemingly takes more than changing the size of a home to change the mentality of the people who live inside.

327,Dreaming of a tree or sea-change? Read this first,house-and-home,"  On Escape from the City, I help people find their dream sea-change homes. Here's how to find yours I've spent most of 2018 in my dream job. I travelled all over Australia to help people find their dream home as they tried to make a life-changing move to coastal and regional towns, the bush or the country-side. Most of them are city-slickers who have been dreaming of a tree/sea change for several years and after seeing the casting call for the new ABC TV show, Escape from the City, decided that now was as good a time as any. Key aspects of your life can shift dramatically when you leave the city for the country — here's how to adjust. To my surprise, the show attracted Australians of all ages — retired couples, families with young children, even single women who were hoping the move would spark a romantic connection. After considering their different needs, desires and budgets, I presented each house-hunter with four properties, hoping one would become their dream home. Together, we explored beach-side shacks, vintage houses, even bushland retreats from the Kimberly regions of Broome in Western Australia to the tropical rainforests in far north Queensland — our property obsession saw no limits! Along the way, the house-hunters let me in on their deeply personal journey and after enduring the highs and lows of their life-changing experiences, I've compiled the following tips for those who're planning on turning their regional dreams into a reality. If you're contemplating moving to a regional area, I recommend spending as much time there as possible. Try renting a property there for a few months. If renting is not an option, try to visit as frequently as possible — especially during the non-tourist season. After filming a couple of episodes in Port Douglas and Cairns during the winter months, I fell in love with the area. I casually remarked to one of the locals, ""I could move here permanently myself"", but before I finished the sentence, they retorted, ""Come back in summer and see if you still feel that way!"" Turns out that during the sweltering far north Queensland summers, cooling off with a dip is simply not an option due to crocodiles and jellyfish. Spending time in the region is a good way to get a sense of the housing market, check out neighbourhoods and explore community groups/activities that you can join to ensure that you will adjust to the different lifestyle the region has to offer. Everything is negotiable in real estate. It goes without saying that you'll get more for your money moving from a metropolitan city into a regional area. At first, the prices will seem astoundingly cheaper. But you'll be surprised by the bargains you can snap up if you're willing to expand your range of suburbs. When I met Melbourne resident Simone Illet, she had her heart set on the lovely country town of Daylesford — somewhere she'd been visiting for several years on holidays and a very popular tourist spot. She had a budget of around $450,000 but the median house price for Daylesford was $507,500, so finding the dream home was a struggle. I convinced her to expand the search to include the neighbouring town of Castlemaine, where the median house price is $480,000. There, we found Simone her dream home within her budget. Unless you have saved up enough to completely fund your new lifestyle for several years, you will have to find a way to work or a source of supplemental income. Many of the house hunters I met decided to hedge their bets by choosing a region that would allow them to commute to the nearest city. For newlyweds Cat Clarke and Luke Johnston, Victoria's Kyneton and Castlemaine were a perfect choice as both are connected by train with Melbourne — a roughly hour-and-a-half commute to the CBD. Lara and Phillip Gray were planning to move from Manly in Sydney to Port Douglas in far north Queensland as they were craving that outdoor lifestyle for their two young daughters. They were looking for a four-bedroom house close to the beach and near good schools. We explored a couple of options for selling their Manly home — either spend the whole sum on one massive beach-side property and live mortgage free, or purchase a property a couple of blocks back from the beach and use the remainder to invest in a second, smaller property that could generate rental income. We advised them to consult a trusted financial adviser before reaching a decision. Imagine yourself living in that dream home in your country or coastal town — what does your life look like? Are you spending your days gardening in your new (much bigger) backyard? Are you feeding the chickens, horses or any multitude of animals you've acquired on your newly purchased acreage? Or perhaps you're spending your days hiking the nearby bush trails? Whatever that dream life looks like, consider what types of activities you're keen to pursue, the community groups you'd like to be involved with and choose a region based on this. This is how retired couple Nonie Betts and Stuart Wine chose the Eurobodalla region on the NSW South Coast. They are both passionate beachgoers — they love getting out on the water as much as possible, whether its kayaking, fishing, or strolling along the sand. They wanted to be part of a small community, so we steered clear of larger towns like Batemans Bay and Narooma. Nonie also wanted to connect with an artistic community. So, we explored properties in Malua Bay, near a beach popular with walkers and kayakers, and other properties including a former artist's home in Nelligan on the banks of the Clyde river, just 15 minutes from the ocean. Combining your house hunt with your lifestyle goals and hobbies will make the transition easier. The best part of hosting Escape from the City is that priceless moment when joy spreads across the house hunters' faces and they're in love. The reaction gets even better when they guess the price and realise — much to their disbelief — they can actually afford it. I've had people like 55-year old single mother of five Lisa Moylan hold my hand and jump up and down in disbelief when she saw her dream home on the Sunshine coast. There were tears of joy and hugs for days. It's a powerful, emotional moment for many people and it's an absolute privilege to be part of it. But the joy is often fleeting because sooner or later, the other shoe drops. We've made their dreams come true and nothing could be more terrifying. The thought of moving your whole life to a new place, embracing a completely different way of living is enough to scare off most of us. So, I often ask the house-hunters to remember why they're doing this. Lisa dedicated her entire life to her five children (including triplets). This sea change was about finally putting herself first and embracing a healthier, more relaxing outdoor lifestyle. Another couple, semi-retired Malcolm and Phyllis Roberts, had a life-long dream of moving back to their country roots, but work, family or travel had prevented that from happening. A health scare made Malcolm realise it was now or never. I'm delighted to say we found Malcolm and Phyllis not one but two dream houses (including a converted church) and here's hoping they can finally make their move.

329,Swimmable garden ponds making a splash in the suburbs,house-and-home,"  Using fish and plants instead of chlorine saves backyard pool owners time and money Backyard pools are a great way to keep cool, but some people believe you can save time and money by ditching the chlorine and pool cleaner to go natural. Queenslanders are turning their pools into garden ponds using plants, fish and even crayfish and snails to keep the water fresh. Heather Harris: ""We created ours in mid-May this year — a simple conversion."" Nick Bushnell: ""Ours is going to have a separate lap pool section from the garden."" Larry Matters: ""Once established the cost of upkeep is basically nil."" But how does it all work without getting stagnant and filthy? Brisbane resident Sarah Eastwell said she created a garden pond that she could also swim in. ""The idea kind of grew as my mother gave me a water fountain and it made me wonder what sort of water feature I would like."" She told ABC Radio Brisbane that her plan was to create something that was easy to look after but also cost-effective. ""I wanted something big and I really wanted to be able to swim in it, but I didn't want to maintain a pool or have to use chemicals or power to run it. ""This has become a green option as I get the garden plus swimming and the wildlife as well."" While swimming pools are a popular choice for families, Ms Eastwell encouraged people to consider building a pond first. ""Many people's pools sit for nine months with nothing going on,"" she said. ""It is so much fun and it's like having an aquarium you can jump into."" Stocking the pond with fish also helps keep on top of mosquitos, she said. ""You set up the pond as an ecosystem with fish and plants and it regulates itself,"" Ms Eastwell said. ""It has a nitrogen cycle where the fish produce ammonia, which turns into nitrites that becomes nitrates. ""These then fertilise the plants and the fish eat the plants and it goes around and around. ""We have native fish in the pond including rainbow fish and snails, as well as blue claw and there's lots of frogs too."" It's fine — just be aware where your feet are. ""I get nervous of the blue claw, but there's rocks on the bottom so I don't put my feet under anywhere,"" Ms Eastwell said. Aquascaper Patrick Hanley said people needed to think of what plants they used to aid filtration and prevent pests. ""Mosquitos like a little puddle of water, and if the water is moving they tend not to breed in it as they like confined areas,"" he said. ""You become more aware of cane toads when you add a water feature, so it's an opportunity to humanely remove them from the environment and to do it in a kind way."" He said to also ensure a fence was in place around the pond just as with a swimming pool. ""If you have an existing swimming pool, make sure the fence stays in place. ""If it's a garden pond to swim in, then it's still a body of water and you need to protect yourself and others.""

330,What happens when apartment living lands you the neighbour from hell,house-and-home,"  Real estate nightmares and Sydney strata disputes — what happens when your neighbour is a bully It did not take long for Grant* to come across a classic power-tripping neighbour. He bought into a small block of strata-titled townhouses in Sydney several years ago. The first sign of trouble was a request for money to cover work that had been completed on the building before he lived there. ""The difficulty is the personality,"" Grant said. ""This neighbour was acting as though he was the landlord."" It was the beginning of a frustrating pattern. A small space of common property in a yard became the subject of endless disagreements, as did the family's request to put up a fence for safety and privacy. Its colour, location and height were all put under the microscope. ""It became apparent he was never going to say 'yes',"" Grant said. ""He was a sort of dictator in our strata block, and he could never agree to peace."" The neighbour sent more than 120 emails about various grievances — eventually, Grant stopped responding, and hired lawyers. ""We would never buy into a strata again,"" he said. ""It was a pure manipulation and power thing. Truly, it takes your breath away."" Strata is the fastest growing form of residential property ownership in Australia, according to a 2015 City Futures Research Centre report. It estimated over half the new metropolitan dwellings being built Down Under were strata-titled. There are more than 76,000 residential strata schemes across NSW, according to the latest registration figures from NSW Land Registry Services. Almost 60 per cent of those are in the greater Sydney area. The data shows in the past decade, the number of strata schemes in NSW has risen by an average of about 1,200 per year. ""Every building has one — a self-appointed building manager who has lived there the longest,"" one real estate agent told the ABC. The most common advice for those grappling with escalating disagreements is to try and sort things out among yourselves. If you decide to take legal action, you could end up at the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal — an independent body and court alternative that deals with landlord and tenant disputes, among other issues. Regardless of whether you rent or own your property — or how long you've lived there — everyone is bound equally to the by-laws under NSW's Strata Schemes Management Act. John Douglas, special counsel at Colin Biggers & Paisley, said the legislation set out high-level principles. ""Sometimes the way such principles manifest in daily life may not be as black and white as in the legislation,"" he said. The building's size can be important — in large strata schemes residents can benefit from anonymity. In smaller buildings, the strata committee may be influenced by one dominant resident. ""Disputes can first attempt to be resolved with the building management, but in a smaller building where the strata committee may be controlled [or] heavily influenced by the neighbour in question, things can become tricky,"" Mr Douglas said. ""The next option is through Fair Trading's strata-mediation service."" Fair Trading's strata mediation service is often the first option to solve small grievances — like noise complaints, or issues with pets — in a building. Mr Douglas described the tribunal as far more user-friendly and cost-effective than the court system. ""These cases tend to be more straightforward and will not involve barristers and eventual High Court judgements,"" he said. ""But even if you're off to mediation and, failing that, the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal, any sort of dispute is time consuming and can be quite emotionally and mentally draining. ""It's one thing to have rights, it's another to actually spend the time and energy enforcing those rights."" Grant said it was ""totally understandable"" disputes drove some people to move, rather than endure ongoing awkwardness. ""There was quite a hefty emotional toll,"" he said. ""If it's just business you don't get so wound up about it, but when it affects your home, it's quite damaging."" He said people battling an abrasive neighbour should do their research. ""Be absolutely sure via a lawyer what your rights are,"" he said. ""And under no circumstances expect the body corporate to be reasonable, fair or generous. ""You're just not going to get it.""

331,Energy retailers say they've got a gift for consumers — this is the deal,house-and-home,"  Consumers want lower bills, the PM is pushing for that too and now energy retailers have a plan Energy retailers have copped a lot of flak for rising power prices, but now they're saying they will be part of the solution to help households cut costs. Ahead of an energy ministers' meeting next week, the Energy Council of Australia — which represents retailers — has unveiled its plan for something called a reference bill. The plan is to arm consumers with a comparison rate to help them shop around for a better deal — an index of sorts. The reference bill would be a single figure that retailers will compare their offers against. The Energy Council of Australia said it would be calculated using the estimated energy usage of a two to three-person household in each network area. Then retailers could then offer discounts against that figure. The reference bill would be calculated using publicly available retailer prices, and would be set by an independent consultant. Let's go through an example scenario: The Federal Government has been trying to bring down prices and has been asking industry to do its bit. In November, industry was offered the chance to develop what's called a comparator rate so consumers could compare prices more easily. The reference bill is what industry came up with. A reference bill will make it easier to shop around, but there are already a number of tools out there if you're keen to run the numbers on your power bill. Check out: Energy ministers are meeting on Wednesday, where they're expected to discuss the reference bill plan. If they approve the plan, it could be in place as soon as February. Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor said he had a ""first look"" at the reference bill and thought it was ""a good move in the right direction"". ""We'll want to analyse it and look at it particularly from the point of view of customers, making sure customers get the clarity and comparisons they need to get the best possible deal from their energy service provider,"" he said. The plan for a reference bill would help consumers in New South Wales, south-east Queensland and South Australia. Victoria is moving ahead with its own system, while the ACT, Tasmania and the rest of Queensland are regulated markets. The NT and WA are not part of the national energy market. Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au If you're already actively in the market shopping around for offers, it should make it easier for you to compare deals. And if you have never tried to negotiate a better deal, this should give you more confidence to do so. It could help you know where you stand. In the past, it has been hard to know if you are getting a good deal because every retailer offered a different standing offer. A standing offer is the price you pay for electricity if you don't shop around. It's like a default rate that you'll be charged for power. The problem is, retailers offer discounts on their own standing offers. Given all those offers are different, it can be extremely confusing for consumers to compare deals. And that ultimately costs us more. New research from Energy Consumers Australia shows about 50 per cent of customers have never switched electricity providers, with the energy market described as a ""confusion-opoly"". Lower power prices are top of the agenda for Scott Morrison, who has vowed to take ""the big stick"" to energy companies. But how much are we really spending on our energy bills? Energy Consumers Australia spokesperson Rosemary Sinclair said it suited retailers to keep things confusing, because it put them at an advantage. ""That's our view, and the ACCC [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission] called that out clearly in their report,"" she said. Ms Sinclair said consumer sentiment told the ACCC people were not confident about the market, or the ""tools or information that are available to them to make choices and switch providers"". ""So we're really supporting the work that industry is doing because we think if choice is made easier by a simple comparison, then that will be part of rebuilding consumer confidence in the market,"" she said. ""Then they'll be more encouraged to pick a package that really suits them, and that should bring down the number of people who are on the higher-priced standing offers."" According to the ACCC, a standing offer should be there to make sure people who don't want to shop around are still getting ""reasonably priced electricity"", but any discounts should be offered from a more comparable figure such as the proposed reference bill. ""The confusion of the role of the standing offer is that over the last few years as retailers have been able to set the price of the standing offer, they have used that as the basis from which to offer extremely different discounts,"" Ms Sinclair said. The plan has merit, according to St Vincent de Paul Society energy expert Gavin Dufty, who acts as a voice for consumers when policy is being developed. Mr Dufty said electricity retailers were ""on notice"". ""The big issue is industry coming out and trying to show some leadership or strategic thinking about how to help consumers,"" he said. ""They need to improve because they don't have another chance here."" He said the proposed reference bill was similar to unit pricing. ""It's like when you go into the grocery store,"" he said. ""You have a look and you will see how much per kilo it is and then it will tell you down the bottom about how much per kilo you're paying. And then you can sort of scan across similar items. ""You'll know relative to what is a reasonable price whether you're above the odds or below the odds. And that will give people some understanding about whether they should shop around or whether they're doing OK."" Ms Sinclair said she was optimistic about the industry's plans. ""There's every chance that industry will actually land a simple, clear comparison offer that will make choice in the electricity market much easier for consumers,"" she said. ""And that will be a much better outcome than the confusion-opoly that we have at the moment.""

332,Keeping the traditional Queenslander house standing tall,house-and-home,"  What will become of the Queenslander home and should more be done to protect them? The traditional Queenslander home is an iconic piece of architectural design, but debate is growing about the best ways to protect their heritage value and keep them standing for years to come. New developments have now have moved away from the classic style and opted for modern and easy-to-maintain home designs, but they lack the Queenslanders' distinctiveness and charm. The classic traits of the Queenslander include tall ceilings, distinctive timber and wide verandahs perched high to catch the breeze during hot summer days. Verandahs also offered larger living spaces and sleep-out areas. Shane Earle, the director of Queensland Heritage Restorations, said the handywork seen in the historical homes was part of the reason they should be saved. ""When you get into the older Queenslanders, there are pressed-metal ceilings and archways and fret work — you get to see part of the tradesman in the house,"" he told ABC Radio Brisbane's Katherine Feeney. ""Some of the houses were made with second-hand materials and as you peel them back when you are renovating you get to understand and read the house."" Mr Earle said many people were drawn to the style because of its unique characteristics or they lived in one growing up. ""In the 1980s my parents started doing up houses and were buying them for $16,000 with a $3,000 renovation budget and would sell the house for $40,000,"" he said. ""Our streetscape and lifestyles are made for Queenslanders."" Many buyers or renovators have claimed the homes that were once built to catch the breeze are not needed due to modern conveniences such as air conditioning. ""The elevation of the house was necessary to keep it cool, but they were also elevated to stay away from termites,"" Mr Earle said. ""If you look at early photos of Queensland houses, they were entirely devoid of trees as they were trying to keep vegetation away from homes so the termites didn't eat their houses down. ""I'm not against implementing some of our current lifestyles by opening up the homes and putting in bi-fold doors and decks on the back — we can still do that as well as keeping the character of the home."" Brisbane City Council recently created a Character Design Forum asking people what they believed should be done to preserve Queenslanders. The website allows the public to discuss design elements and character adaptations and whether zones should be created across Brisbane to protect the heritage style. One contributor, Blake, said there had to be better balance in the community: ""Heritage protection can involve protecting Queenslander houses in their low-density setting, but sustainable development means we need to intensify development in areas close to services."" Christine hoped more would be done for upkeep: ""I agree the large majority of old Queenslander homes seen on the way to work in the city have not been kept well, and I know developers have bought up many houses on large lots renting them out without fixing them to cash in."" Broog80 added that the structure of the homes provided many advantages: ""They are high-set to allow air flow, but as seen in recent flooding events, a Queenslander on stilts has some protection from floodwaters."" Sue Wright said they were part of Queensland's identity: ""Queenslanders are immediately identifiable. A Queenslander is a wooden structure with a gabled roof, chamfer boards on the outside and tongue-and-groove ceilings. They help define Brisbane as a unique place."" Mr Earle said he hoped people would contribute their thoughts and see what the structures did for the wider landscape. ""Those zones attract people from other areas as they know they love that old style and know it's going to be protected in their area, and that's why they're making the investment,"" he said. ""Many councils have areas designated as character zones where you simply can't alter the style of the property. ""I think the money is better spent on the old Queenslanders; although it is an expensive proposition, they are worth every penny."" He said when people looked to renovate, they should keep in mind the character of the house while bringing it up-to-date. ""It's unfortunate when people completely strip the inside,"" he said. ""If there's nothing wrong with the house don't change its style — you can move walls to change your lifestyle but keeping the character is important. ""Unfortunately, in some areas the Queenslander is in peril as some people believe it's easier to knock down a house and build new but these houses have stood the test of time.""

333,Negative gearing changes 'could tip Australia into recession',house-and-home,"  Negative gearing changes 'could tip Australia into recession', warns John Symond A number of housing industry insiders have issued a warning about curbing negative gearing, with mortgage company boss ""Aussie John"" Symond saying ""it could tip Australia into recession"". Labor promised if they won the next federal election they would reform negative gearing so it only applied to investors buying new properties. The idea, first pitched by Labor leader Bill Shorten before the last federal election, is that this would give first home buyers more opportunity to get into the housing market. ""We will put the great Australian dream back within the reach of the working and middle class Australians who have been priced out of the housing market for too long,"" Mr Shorten said in 2016. Labor's rule change would not affect people who are currently negatively gearing investment properties. But Mr Symond, the founder and non-executive chairman of Aussie Home Loans, said caution was required. ""You've got to treat negative gearing very carefully and do your homework to work out what the ramifications will be,"" he told 7.30. Chief economist at UBS George Tharenou also said he was worried about the effect the change would have on the economy. ""My concern would be that if you were to make a material change to tax policy at the same time as banks are tightening lending standards, it could exacerbate what's already a downturn into something more serious,"" he said. Australia is edging towards the sharpest downturn in property prices since the last recession. Head of Asia Pacific research at data company CoreLogic Tim Lawless said the proposed changes would result in less investment in the housing market. ""We could see more investment demand funnelled into new housing, but of course we know that buying into a new housing market is fundamentally higher risk than buying into the established market,"" he said. ""New housing quite often has a long settlement period, particularly if you are buying into the apartment sector. Anything can happen between when you sign your contract and go to settle."" Labor is also proposing to halve the capital gains tax exemption from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. This means when investment properties are sold, 75 per cent of the profit would be taxable. There is much debate over what effect the proposed tax changes would have on a housing market already facing its worst downturn since the GFC. ""It's simple. If you own your own property, under Labor's policy it will be worth less. If you rent your home under Labor's policy you will pay more,"" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a social media post last month. Almost 1.3 million Australians own a negatively geared investment property, and more than half of negative gearers earn less than $80,000. According to Mr Frydenberg, among those using negative gearing ""are 58,000 teachers, 41,000 nurses and 20,000 police and emergency services"". But it is the wealthy who benefit the most. The top 20 per cent of those negatively gearing get 53 per cent of the benefit, according to the Grattan Institute. ""Negative gearing provides an opportunity for all taxpayers to reduce their income and incentivises them to invest in property, but the benefits of those gains have been relatively concentrated,"" Mr Tharenou said. ""Higher-income people pay more tax and that's the way the system works — the more tax you pay, the more tax you save. So the benefits were always going to be skewed towards higher-income households."" In 2016, the Coalition's campaign against Labor's changes suggested rents went up when negative gearing was briefly abolished on rental properties by the Hawke-Keating government in 1985. Rents did rise in Sydney and Perth, but it was not clear that removing negative gearing was to blame. ""I don't think the '85 period really gives us any context of what may happen with negative gearing removal now, simply because it was such a short period of time,"" Mr Lawless said. ""It takes a lot longer for rental markets to respond to changes in supply, it doesn't happen instantly."" Negative gearing has been available in Australia for much of the last century, but only widely used by property investors since the 1980s. It enables investors to deduct property expenses from their taxable income where they add up to more than is earned from rent. Deductions can include interest payments on a loan, necessary maintenance and depreciation on a property's value. For example, say you earn $100,000 annually and pay a bit less than $25,000 in tax per year. You buy an investment property which earns $50,000 a year in rent. If your interest payments on that property are around $60,000 a year, you can deduct the difference of $10,000 from your taxable income. Which means your taxable income would drop down to $90,000, which would reduce your yearly tax bill to roughly $21,000. While you are still not out in front, you do get $4,000 back in your pocket. Kathy Ran bought her home in 1988 and paid it off in five years. Now she negatively gears an investment property, but supports Labor's planned changes. ""I would be in favour of it getting removed even though I benefit from it, because I see how difficult it is to get into the property market for people who aren't already in it,"" Ms Ran said. ""It's not all nurses, and it's not all police officers who are investors. What the negative gearing tax breaks allow that small proportion to do is get everybody to pay for their losses, so I don't think that's fair."" Ms Ran said she would like to see a more level playing field. ""I'd like to see more first home buyers get into the market, and I'd like to be able to visit my children and my grandchildren in their own homes. ""I want the future generations not to have to rely on the bank of mum and dad to be able to get into the property market."" Couple Alex and Emily Truong are against changing the negative gearing rules. They earn about $150,000 a year between them and live in a rental while they rent out the house they own. ""Having negative gearing just allows us to save enough money that little bit quicker,"" Mr Truong said. The couple is saving to buy more property. ""I think negative gearing is very important for someone who is starting out,"" Ms Truong said. ""Sometimes the extra $5,000-$6,000 to minimise your tax could help you go further. ""I think it's important for the middle class, like us, working very hard, trying to have a better future for our children."" Watch part three of 7.30's housing special tonight on ABC TV and iview.

334,The town taking energy prices into its own hands,house-and-home,"  Solar panels at pension prices sees regional city taking energy into its own hands Low-income residents of a regional South Australian city are using an innovative solar scheme to shave money off their power bills. The Port Pirie Regional Council recognised that with more than half of the city's population on government benefits, its residents could not afford runaway energy prices or a $3,000 solar system on their homes. As the Federal energy debate raged without resolution, Councillors in Port Pirie, at the foot of SA's Flinders Ranges, put to tender an ambitious home solar scheme. Port Pirie Regional Council's director, James Holyman, said the council was aiming to get a solar power system set up that people could pay off over four years, for no more than $20 a week. ""We wanted to use community collective buying power to get a high-quality product at a great price,"" he said. The Council's demands were simple; In return for recruiting hundreds of local customers, a business would deliver specified quality solar panel systems to be repaid over four years for the price of an average electricity bill or lower. ""Our intention was to get a system at that price to help the most vulnerable,"" Mr Holyman said. With a bid offering South-Australian-made panels and batteries at the specified price, South Australian company Cool or Cosy won the tender. Managing Director Glenn Morelli said 800 community expressions of interest in the program made it doable. ""We priced it very aggressively for the council to meet their brief and we really needed that volume to make it financially viable,"" he said. ""The more people, the better for everybody."" He said residents then installed the solar systems on their roofs, instantly reducing their power bills as they paid it off over four years. ""Then after the four years all that energy is free, and they're no longer paying for the system anymore,"" Mr Morelli said. Though they installed the panels halfway through their last billing period, Gordon and Lorraine Williams said their electricity bill nearly halved, and they expect the trend to continue. ""The next bill should go down to $100,"" Mrs Williams said. The average weekly income of Port Pirie residents at the latest census was $500, so the savings are a huge relief. ""We never go out for dinner or anything because it's the extra money,"" she said. ""Now I've got $200 extra that we can actually go out for dinner or go to Adelaide to see my daughter."" The system deducts the solar panel repayment directly from the Centrelink user's fortnightly allowance before it is paid to their bank. ""We don't even see the money taken out of the bank … paid, everything, done,"" Lorraine said. The solar panels used in the project are made in Adelaide and, as of recently, the batteries will be too. The company running the project has partnered with Sonnen, which has just opened a factory in Adelaide's northern suburbs at the former Holden site. Mrs Williams said it was an added bonus that participation in the scheme was supporting South Australian jobs. ""They're always going to have a job because the panels are guaranteed for 25 years,"" she said. ""So in 25 years, we won't be here, but someone else comes along, they'll be able to renew them."" When all — roughly 300 — systems are installed at the beginning of 2019, Port Pirie Council hopes to run data from software that monitors all systems to assist the rollout of similar programs around Australia. ""The aim is once we've got the baseline to use this data for the betterment of all Australians,"" Mr Holyman said. ""I don't want to own the model, so Cool or Cosy could take this model to other councils around the state and benefit other communities."" Through research being conducted at Adelaide University, there are also hopes for a community microgrid, which could leave Port Pirie independent of the state power grid. Mr Holyman said with the Upper Spencer Gulf and surrounds being the site of multiple large-scale renewable projects, Port Pirie's independence could benefit the state. ""If we could build the microgrids and take that load off the system, it would provide more for the current infrastructure for those renewables to the main population centres like Adelaide,"" he said.

335,Thinking about buying or selling property in WA? It's about to cost you more,house-and-home,"  The cost of buying and selling WA homes is about to rise thanks to e-conveyancing Buying a house? Selling a unit? If you live in Western Australia, being on either side of a property deal is about to cost you more. On December 1, Western Australia will adopt electronic conveyancing — or e-conveyancing — for most property settlements, using the online platform Property Exchange Australia (PEXA). WA is only the second state, behind Victoria, to mandate the use of PEXA. But what does this mean for consumers? PEXA is the only online property exchange platform used in Australia. It was developed in 2010 following a Council of Australian Governments (COAG) directive to create a single, national property settlements system. New South Wales and South Australia also use PEXA, but unlike Victoria and WA, it is not compulsory in those states. PEXA's original shareholders — including the WA Government — sold the business earlier this month to a consortium of companies for $1.6 billion, after a share market float fell over. From tomorrow, all eligible property transactions in WA will be processed online, instead of manually. Settlement agents will lodge land title documents with Landgate electronically, rather than in person. Landgate's registrar of titles, Jean Villani, said the change would benefit all parties. ""The gap between settlement and lodgement of documents is reduced because in the electronic environment it occurs simultaneously, reducing the risk and increasing the security and integrity of the titles register,"" she said. Proponents of the PEXA system say it will deliver faster and more accurate settlements. Under the current manual system, 25 per cent of settlements fall over, according to PEXA — with human error in processing paperwork taking some of the blame. In May, a Deloitte Access Economics report, commissioned by PEXA, found electronic processing had ""on average"" reduced the incidence of delayed settlements. Agents had reported fewer postponements, the report said, allowing buyers to set dates for moving properties with ""greater certainty"". There are also financial advantages for sellers. ""One of the big benefits is no bank cheques, so if you are selling, you get cleared funds into your account very quickly,"" Ms Villani said. PEXA charges $112.64 to transfer a single title, which the conveyancing industry says will be passed on to consumers. In addition, there are fees for: While estimates vary, LJ Hooker Settlements WA owner Janet Hryb predicts buyers and sellers in an average home sale will pay an extra $200 for using the PEXA platform. Meanwhile, Landgate will continue to charge a title transfer fee based on the value of the property, which equates to $261.20 for the average house when based on the median Perth house price of $485,000. The agency said there were no plans to adjust its fee structure to reflect the change from manual to online settlement. Under the new system, settlement agents are also involved in stamp duty administration, which was previously done by the Office of State Revenue. Some agents expect settlement fees will rise to reflect the additional workload, as well as insurance and cyber security costs. ""It's double the work so we'll need to double the fees, [but] we are in a very, very tight market,"" Ms Hryb said. However, a report by KPMG in February found settlement agents could save up to 4.45 hours per transaction, thanks to reduced travel time and administrative tasks. Not quite. Some settlements will still be required to be conducted manually. Deceased estates, bankruptcies and other ""complex"" transactions will continue to use paper-based processing. Earlier this year, a couple lost $250,000 on the sale of their Melbourne home, conducted via the PEXA platform, after hackers breached the email account of one of the conveyancers involved. PEXA says the hackers were able to create fictitious profiles on its platform and change bank account details to make the fraudulent transfer. The bulk of the funds were recovered. In the wake of the breach, PEXA upgraded its security with multi-factor authentication and machine-learning algorithms to detect suspicious activity. It says in the event of a ""specific type of fraud"", sellers will be eligible for PEXA's residential seller guarantee, which will refund a fraudulent payment within 10 business days. Ms Villani said Landgate was not concerned about security risks. ""There is much integrity in the system, however those frauds did act as a strong reminder that everyone needs to remain vigilant and adopt the highest ICT security systems they possibly can,"" she said.

336,analysis: 'This massive fungus grew from the wall': renters are skipping contents insurance and it's ending badly,house-and-home,"  Half of Australians don't have the home insurance for when disaster strikes House and contents underinsurance looks like a problem in need of a solution. It is estimated around half of Australians don't have an insurance policy that fully covers their assets. Without insurance, households are unable to ""bounce back"" after a disaster or emergency event. A lack of insurance has been associated with issues of affordability. It has been assumed that households suffering financial hardship and disadvantage are at risk of being underinsured. If their property is lost or damaged, underinsurance would lead to hardship and disadvantage becoming more entrenched. But emerging research in Australian cities shows that rental status rather than socio-economic disadvantage is a driver of underinsurance. The prevalence of ""middle Australian"" renters who don't have contents insurance is challenging the idea that affordability is the real issue. Renters appear low risk. For these people, a disaster or emergency event might involve a loss of personal possessions but not of a housing asset. But, following a disaster, renters can face eviction, homelessness or be forced to live in a damaged property. A renter we interviewed described being evicted on the morning after Hobart's recent floods: We were wondering about temporary accommodation, whether they would put us up until we found a new place to live … They said that that was under contents insurance, which was our responsibility, and the house insurance just covers the house. Unable to find a new rental, he and his friends couch-surfed for six weeks. ""It was really quite stressful … not knowing where we were going to go."" Another renter stayed in her flood-damaged house and found the lack of communication about repairs frustrating. We're trying to keep the communication going, like taking photos of things as they deteriorate … This massive fungus grew from the wall and we were like, 'Here, this is what's happening in the bathroom' … but not getting any response back. With an increasing number of households in the rental market in Australian cities, exactly how insurance interacts with rental experiences merits a closer look. Our findings also show that households aren't making the connection between insurance and climate change. Despite a predicted increase in impacts, Australians generally assume that disasters will not affect the price of insurance. In response to new risk modelling, parts of cyclone-prone northern Australia have experienced rising premiums — 350 per cent increases for strata properties in the case of Port Hedland. Unmitigated flood threats in New South Wales and Queensland have resulted in significant price increases or even in insurance becoming unavailable. Households in rural and regional areas are more likely to be insured than those in cities. Previous research suggests this is because rural residents are more attuned to environmental conditions. In cities, residents can feel less connected and less exposed to environmental changes. Australian cities are becoming denser and losing greenery, which might contribute to declining environmental awareness. Cues from plants are important drivers of people's perceptions of environmental change. In one study, the presence of dead pot plants was found to strengthen belief in global warming. Other visible clues to the environmental changes happening in our cities may also be hidden by engineered solutions such as the enclosure of watercourses in stormwater drains. As one of the renters affected by the Hobart flooding said, the risk ""hadn't really crossed my mind. It just seemed like quite a tame climate"". Uninsured or underinsured households lack the self-sufficiency that frees governments from significant spending on recovery. Unsurprisingly, governments are aiming to improve insurance coverage to lessen vulnerability and build resilience. Underinsurance is seen as a social welfare issue and appears to draw attention to the need for improved financial literacy. Submissions to the Financial Services Royal Commission highlight some issues that householders face when dealing with insurance. But there is more to understanding how households think about insurance and why so many are underinsured. Our research illustrates how rapid urban change is likely affecting insurance uptake. Those living in disadvantage are at risk, but underinsurance must be uncoupled from simple assumptions about affordability. How renters fare when property is destroyed or damaged appears significantly different from home owners, but no less problematic. If house and contents insurance is to help in ""bouncing back"" from disaster events, we need to know more about this and about urban environmental awareness.

337,The benefits of mindfulness for busy parents,house-and-home,"  How mindfulness can help busy parents cope with information overload Being a modern parent has plenty of demands and time constraints that can cause stress and tension build up. It may be sleep deprivation from children waking up in the middle of the night, or fatigue from spending hours driving between weekend sport. Meanwhile, there are lunchboxes to be packed, homework to be done, dishes to be washed. In the face of all this, some parents are turning to mindfulness and meditation to reduce stress, get a better night's sleep and be a better listener for their children. They say mindfulness has helped them encourage a happier and calmer home. ""I don't want to make it sound like I'm the Dalai Lama,"" jokes radio host and comedian Jo Stanley as she talks about her mindfulness routine. Listen to parents and experts give their tips on how meditation can help around the home with the new ABC podcast Mindfully. Between busy media engagements and taking care of her kids, she is never going to have the dedication of a Buddhist monk. But in an everyday context she uses mindfulness to bring a sense of calm to her domestic life and to better connect with her daughter, Willow. This is often something as simple as making sure her full attention is turned to Willow when they spend time together after school. But she says there are plenty of opportunities for mindfulness throughout the daily routine. ""[For example] I hate cooking dinner,"" Ms Stanley says. ""But then I'm like, 'OK, lets actually mindfully engage with the practice of it' and I listen to the sound of the knife on the chopping board as I'm cutting onions. ""I think there are really beautiful moments of mindfulness in your day to day activities that can really slow down and change the perspective."" Parenting author and educator Maggie Dent believes one of the benefits of practising mindfulness in this way is that it becomes a form of ""role-modelling"" for children. Ms Dent says something as simple as pausing and taking three deep breaths as a calming exercise will ease the stress of the daily routine. Another suggestion is to use mindfulness to help to quiet the frenetic thoughts from a busy day and aim for a good night's sleep. She says doing small mindfulness activities throughout the day will encourage children to mimic this behaviour and make them happier and calmer. ""We are incredibly influential,"" she says. ""When we prioritise taking care of us, we are showing our children that we matter."" This is something Ms Stanley has experienced first hand, with Willow occasionally offering her own mindfulness suggestions. ""She once told me off for swearing, and then she said 'Mummy, your monkey mind has taken control,'"" she says. ""Then she took me through the breathing exercise that they do at school to calm their monkey mind and take them from one side of the rainbow over to the good side of the rainbow."" Ms Dent says learning how to be more grounded has become especially useful as the pace of modern life speeds up. The key for parents of young children, Ms Dent says, is to stop trying to do too much and to incorporate ""small pockets"" of mindfulness throughout family life. ""There's almost too much information, there's too much stimuli, too much pressure, and then all of those things together make us become ungrounded,"" she says. ""So mindfulness brings us back into this moment, into our body and into what is really happening."" ""A house that is more mindful will be a more loving and fun place - and isn't that what we all want?"" For Jo Stanley, her practice emerged as a response to the stress of Willow being in intensive care as a newborn. She says the mindfulness techniques she used to stay calm during that difficult period have since transferred to the home and her relationship with her daughter. ""It is just a calmer space, we have a language that is calm and gentle,"" she says. ""The stillness is really beautiful between us. ""It just informs everything else you do. And it probably makes mummy a nicer person."" The ABC has teamed up with Smiling Mind and former Sydney Swans captain Brett Kirk to look at how mindfulness can help parents and children in the home. Here are a few simple exercises you can try each day: Focus on your breathing: Take three long breaths more often and create a sense of calm in your mind and in your home with this meditation. Pay attention to the small moments: Listening can be hard, especially when we're busy and distracted, so this meditation will help you learn how to focus your attention and really listen. Aim for more sleep: Get ready for a good night's sleep by closing all your open brain tabs with this meditation.

338,There is this thing called a 'standing offer' and it could be the reason your power bill is so high,house-and-home,"  Energy 'confusion-opoly' blamed for consumers paying too much for electricity Energy prices have become so confusing that at least 1 million Australian households are languishing on uncompetitive deals. That's according to a new analysis of energy tariffs that highlights the huge differences between so-called standing offers and market offers. Standing offers are what you pay if you don't try and negotiate a competitive market offer with an energy retailer. But standing offers in every state and territory have crept higher over the years, so many consumers have ended up paying more. The co-author of the annual Tariff Tracking report, Gavin Dufty, said scores of households could be saving up to $1,000 if they just ""picked up the phone"" and negotiated a better deal with their energy provider. ""For the people that are on standing offers and have never entered the market, you're looking to save between $500 to $1,000,"" Mr Dufty told the ABC. ""At the extreme, depending on where you are, there's $1,000 on the table there … it is a lot. ""Probably a more modest and average sort of price, if you haven't shopped around in the market, there's $600, easy, waiting for you right on the table."" Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au If you're in these states you should definitely be investigating whether you're getting the best deal, according to Mr Dufty, who's an expert on energy policy with charity group Vinnies. Tasmania and the ACT have regulated energy markets, while the Tariff Tracking project doesn't cover Western Australia or the Northern Territory. Mr Dufty said the market did not work when consumers were not actively engaged in it. ""They're not shopping around, they're not taking it up to their retailer to try and get a good deal, and those people are being premium priced,"" Mr Dufty said. His advice if you're about to pick up the phone: don't be afraid of smaller retailers. ""Don't always go to the known brands,"" he said. ""There's some really keen prices from companies that aren't the big three or four. ""Don't be afraid to go to them. They have been tested by the regulators about their financial viability, they have to meet certain standards. ""So just because you don't know them, doesn't mean that they're dodgy or risky. ""They might not be able to give the same full customer service, particularly because they don't have huge call centres, but in terms of price they are very competitive."" Mr Dufty said some people put electricity prices in the ""too hard basket"" and stayed on standing offers because the market was a ""confusion-opoly"". ""When we started tracking things in 2008, it was only one tariff and it was all the same,"" he said. ""Now we're up to 2018 and you have hundreds of different tariffs with different discounts."" Sydney retiree Merinda Air has tracked her energy bills over the past few years using a spreadsheet, but said it was still difficult to know if she was getting the best deal. ""Each provider seems to use a different format, so my current provider gives me one price … that covers everything I use, and then gives me my solar rebate,"" Ms Air said. ""But others give me peak, shoulder, off-peak — and so if I only have one price, I don't know how to compare the others, so I find that disconcerting. ""I will start looking around again, but it's trying to understand the differences, and that's the hard part."" Last month Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the Government wanted to end this confusion and help consumers get the best deal for their electricity. As part of a four-part package, the Coalition proposed setting a base or ""default"" price for power in each jurisdiction. This would ensure customers were not being exploited for staying with a standing offer, Mr Morrison said. While the market could soon be changing, Mr Dufty had a warning for households. ""Don't expect the Government to be looking after you. If you engaged in the market, you would save a minimum of $500,"" he said. Here's how the Government plans to help some households save more than $800 a year on their power bills. Sarah McNamara from the Australian Energy Council said the industry was working hard to make it easier for consumers. ""There are already good deals in the marketplace today and we want to encourage consumers not to wait for reforms to be completed, but to get on the phone to their retailer or get on the Government comparator website and choose the best deal for their circumstances today and start saving,"" she said. ""In the medium term though we want to reassure customers that we're working very hard on reforms with the Government, and we've been doing that for some time to make the market easier to understand and easier to engage with. ""We absolutely appreciate that it is a market that is confusing for consumers and particularly in an environment of high prices, we want to make sure it's as easy for them as possible to get onto those cheaper market deals."" In the 10 years since the Tariff Tracking project began, electricity prices have more than doubled in South Australia and Victoria. South Australian prices have gone up by 112 per cent and Victorian prices have gone up 104 per cent. On average, electricity prices have increased by 75 per cent since 2009. Vinnies have pulled together all their data in an interactive map, where consumers can explore changes to bills as well as potential savings that could be made by switching retailer. Ms McNamara said the difference in Victoria and South Australia was the closure of coal-fired power stations. ""The exit of those plants creates volatility in the wholesale market and that volatility tends to push prices up,"" she said. ""Those markets have recovered somewhat following those events but it does take some time to stabilise."" Ms McNamara said volatility in the wholesale market would continue until policy around emissions was developed. ""That's the best way to stabilise these wholesale prices,"" she said.

339,Ways to keep your air con on and shockproof your power bills,house-and-home,"  Air conditioning dominates many Top End homes but there are ways to stop power bill shock Walk through Darwin's residential streets at night and you will hear it: the low hum of air conditioners pumping cool air into homes during a sticky, humid night. They are among the most energy-consuming domestic appliances, but are air conditioners and high power bills an unavoidable part of life in the tropics? According to some architects, the rise of the air conditioner is one reason why fewer modern homes are designed to cool naturally. ""The best way to think about it is that before air cons were a standardised element to a residential building, the house worked as a machine,"" Troppo Architects director Jo Best said. The Burnett House in the city's heritage precinct — with its large, breeze-permitting openings in walls and its long eaves to prevent walls retaining solar heat — stands as an example of regionalism in design. Sadly, this kind of climate-responsive tropical housing is far from the style of those built in Darwin today. ""Once the air con comes along, the house can dumb down and the air con is the machine,"" Ms Best continued. ""Of course air conditioners provide a service and people can use them as they like, but they have an embedded cost and an ongoing cost and I guess a lot of people are struggling to meet those costs now."" Just how high are those costs? The Northern Territory's energy retailer, Jacana Energy, anticipates a 20 to 30 per cent rise in energy consumption over the sweaty end-of-year months. ""Essentially it's pretty much all attributed to air conditioning, although there are other factors,"" David Walker, Jacana's executive manager for operations, said. There's no denying that living and sleeping would be uncomfortable without air conditioning in some Top End homes. Even the Environment Centre NT's sustainable living arm, COOLmob, sometimes turns the air conditioner on to stay cool around the office. But they say you can take a number of steps to maximise the device's efficiency and ultimately avoid a shock when the power bill arrives. The first one is to set your air conditioner between 23 and 27 degrees — the range where most people are comfortable. ""Every degree that you lower your air conditioner actually increases your energy consumption by about 10 per cent,"" Lou De Mattia told ABC Radio Darwin's Annie Brown.. ""Try to keep it in that range where it's quite comfortable but you're not actually having to reach for a cardigan or something, because that's something you really want to avoid. ""You don't want to be cold in the room because you're going to be paying for that."" Secondly, Jacana says the effects of a ceiling or standing fan — both comparatively low-consumption devices — can't be underestimated. ""If you can run your air conditioner at a higher temperature level and get that cooling effect with air movement by a ceiling fan, then you'll certainly reduce your energy consumption,"" Mr Walker said. ""You can't underestimate the air movement's effect on cooling — it does change the apparent temperature."" And despite it seeming obvious to some, Mr Walker said a number of people were inadvertently adding dollars to their bills by failing to adequately seal rooms while the air conditioner was switched on or keeping them running in rooms that are empty. ""You'd be surprised how many people might have louvres that aren't shut correctly; drapes that aren't pulled across,"" Mr Walker said. Ms Di Mattia said you could also consider zoning off one living area to cool rather than the entire house, particularly as a large proportion of Darwin's housing stock doesn't naturally cool itself well. According to Jacana's website, cleaning your air conditioning twice a year will also help, as clogged filters can increase running costs by 5 to 10 per cent. Another cornerstone of the tropical lifestyle could also be hitting your hip pocket harder than you expect: the beer fridge. Fridges generally work harder to stay cool in the humid months, Mr Walker said, but never more so than when a fridge was empty. ""It's trying to cool the air and that loses its temperature quite easily, whereas if you've got less air to cool and the cool is retained within goods, it works a lot more efficiently,"" he said. ""There's consideration there to not actually use a second fridge unless you really, really require it."" Both Mr Walker and Ms Di Mattia agreed it was worth more in the long run to stump up for more expensive appliances with high star energy ratings. This will significantly reduce the overall cost of your energy bill over the appliance's lifetime, they said.

341,"Landlords not taking mould issues seriously despite grave illness, tenants claim",house-and-home,"  Landlords not taking mould issues seriously despite grave illness, tenants claim Tenants are struggling to get landlords to take mould in their properties seriously, despite a growing number of people claiming it has left them seriously ill. A parliamentary inquiry looking into mould-related illnesses in Australia heard those in rental properties or public housing often faced an uphill battle to get the problem addressed. Caleb Rudd runs a Facebook support group for Australians with mould-related illnesses and said many of them became sick because of mould in their home. ""If the buildings were not damp and water damaged, no-one would actually have this condition,"" he said. The committee investigating has called on the Federal Government to work with the states and territories to ensure tenants know about mould or water damage before they move into a property. They also want the Government to have a fresh look at whether Australia's building codes are good enough. Mr Rudd said the committee's recommendations were a step in the right direction. He also agreed with its call for the Government to look into the varied and sometimes unreliable ways people tested for mould. ""It's a bit of a wild west at the moment in this space,"" Mr Rudd said. ""A lot of people can call themselves a remediator without much training."" Leo Patterson Ross from the National Association of Tenant Organisations said there was often an assumption that mould was the residents' fault. ""A landlord or agent's first reaction to you reporting mould is to say, 'well, clearly you haven't been ventilating enough, you haven't been cleaning enough, you've done something wrong',"" he said. The rules vary slightly in different states and territories. But generally, a tenant must keep a property clean and avoid damage, and a landlord must ensure the place is in decent condition at the beginning of lease and keep it in a reasonable state of repair. ""Particularly, for instance, in a bathroom,"" Mr Patterson Ross said. ""You can't expect a tenant to be able to ventilate that by just opening a window."" If there is a problem or dispute, the matter can go to a tribunal. ""And then it starts getting complicated, because the tribunal can order repairs to be done, but they can't actually force a landlord or an agent to call a tradie or pick up a hammer and do any work themselves,"" Mr Patterson Ross said. ""So if a landlord or agent ignores that order, and this does happen fairly routinely, then you have to start going back for compensation."" That could include demanding compensation for the cost of damaged clothes or furniture. But not many people find the idea of a prolonged legal battle over mould appealing, and the inquiry heard tenants who made a fuss were often evicted. Tim McKibbin from the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales (REINSW) said property agents usually wanted to cooperate. But he said tenants should also use common sense. ""So if there is an exhaust fan in the bathroom, use it,"" he said. ""If you are able to leave a window open, most bathrooms will have some sort of a window available to them to let fresh air in."" Mr McKibbin said unreliable testing methods were also an issue for landlords. He said a test that picked up signs of water damage, such as bacteria in the air, could just as easily detect bacteria coming from a full garbage bin as from mould on the wall. And he stressed there was still no scientific evidence that mould would make people sick. ""Where is the science in this? There just isn't any at this stage,"" he said. ""Provide us with some science, provide us with some guidance as property managers on how we can deal with this issue. ""It doesn't seem like an unreasonable request.""

342,Chart of the day: Upmarket house prices fell first — but cheap properties are following,house-and-home," Updated 
    
      October 29, 2018 11:57:41 House prices have been falling for more than a year in Australia. To date, most of the slump has been quarantined at the top end of the market — among the most expensive 25 per cent of houses and apartments. However, since June the more affordable end of the market has also started to fall. Cheaper housing tends to have less extreme swings in price and falls are quite rare. But when the bottom end does fall, it tends to point to more persistent weakness in the property market.   This is part of a new daily series featuring charts which tell a story.

343,Volunteer-built house to go under the hammer after athlete's tragic accident,house-and-home,"  Volunteer-built house ready for auction to raise funds for athlete's spinal injury therapy More than 100 volunteers have finished building a house that will be auctioned to raise funds for a man who suffered a severe spinal cord injury on his 21st birthday. Albury man Nick Dempsey became a quadriplegic after diving into his parents' swimming pool in January 2017. He hit the bottom of the pool, dislocating his neck and severely injuring his spinal cord. Prior to the accident, Mr Dempsey had put a deposit on a block of land in Thurgoona in NSW. His father Peter came up with the idea to build and sell a house to raise funds for advanced therapy. ""We estimate there were probably just over 7,000 hours of volunteer work and about $230,000 of donated materials,"" Peter Dempsey said. ""We've had volunteers from the start, through the design concept right through to Albury City Council waiving the fees, through to this morning when there were some painters here doing some work for nothing. ""It's been tough, it's been hard, but when you look at what Nick's going through it hasn't been that hard really,"" he said. About 130 people donated their time, money and materials for the Nick's Journey House project. Mr Dempsey, a prominent water polo player and local footballer, said many of the volunteers were strangers. ""It's amazing enough that people I do know how much effort they put in, let alone people that I've never met before willing to put in all of their time and effort,"" he said. ""I tried to make the effort to come out and meet as many people as I could, but there's still some that have done it without wanting any praise, so it makes it even more amazing."" Many volunteers followed Mr Dempsey's rehabilitation progress and the construction of the house on Nick's Journey Facebook page. ""Nick's pretty well known around town with his water polo over the last few years. With what happened to him a lot of people got affected by it and felt for him and wanted to help,"" Peter Dempsey said. ""That's the amazing thing about the Albury Wodonga community."" Mr Dempsey's mother Trudy said the last 12 months of building had been hectic but well worth it. ""It's amazing. Volunteers just jumped on board from the word go and are still asking if they can do anything,"" Ms Dempsey said. ""A big thank you to everybody, we can't say it enough."" Mr Dempsey was flown to The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne for immediate surgery after his accident and later spent six months at the Austin Hospital's Royal Talbot Rehabilitation Centre. ""I sort of just accepted it from the start. I was obviously upset and trying to get used to it, but generally speaking I just copped it on the chin and moved forward, [focused] on trying to get better,"" he said. His parents have been amazed at their son's positive attitude after the accident. ""I've never heard Nick complain yet, so if he's not going to complain then we're not going to,"" Peter Dempsey said. ""Nick just makes it so much easier, it has been his mindset from day one,"" Ms Dempsey said. Mr Dempsey started dating Freya Saunders four months ago, more than a year since he became a quadriplegic. ""When I met him I didn't second guess it,"" Ms Saunders said. ""I met Nick for who he was both inside and out and I wouldn't change him for the world. ""I thought he was going to be struggling a lot more than he has, and he hasn't shown that he's struggling once,"" she said. The couple admitted there were difficulties to dating with a severe spinal injury. Most of all, Mr Dempsey missed the independence of his old life. ""Being able to give people a hug or hang out with mates and do normal things. I'm not fussed if I never play a game of footy again — that's not really a priority — it's just the independence and normality of a life,"" he said. Money from the auction will go towards ongoing rehabilitation, as well as travel costs and equipment. Mr Dempsey must regularly travel to Melbourne and Queensland to attend advanced therapy facilities that are not available in regional NSW. ""If there is travel overseas with new therapies if they come up, or cures, it opens up the doors for those opportunities,"" he said. The extra therapy had given him more mobility in his upper body and allowed him to be more independent. ""When I first left rehab I had almost no movement whatsoever, but through a lot of therapy I've gotten a lot stronger in my upper body,"" he said. ""I've already got a lot further than what doctors were saying I was going to. ""I think there will be big progress in the future and I won't be stuck in a wheelchair forever."" Although Mr Dempsey still needed assistance with most tasks, therapy allowed him to push a manual wheelchair and occasionally feed himself. ""I remember at the start I'd ask for a hug and he would put his arm around me, and it would just lightly touch me,"" Ms Saunders said. ""Now he's gained more strength and he's able to [hug me] a bit tighter. It's nice."" Ms Saunders now lives with the Dempsey family, but the couple were looking to move closer to his rehabilitation. ""Being in Albury you don't get a lot of the high-level therapy that I need right now, so we are exploring options of moving to Queensland because of the rehab centre there,"" Mr Dempsey said. The house will be auctioned on Saturday, November 17. Mr Dempsey and his family said it was amazing to see the beautiful finished product after 12 long months. ""I can say thank you a million times and it still wouldn't do it justice. A massive thank you to everyone who was involved in the whole project.""

344,Number of older Australians drowning in debt on the rise,house-and-home,"  Record number of older Australians in poverty, with switch to 'principal and interest' a struggle Financial helpline counsellors are at ""capacity"" with record numbers of older Australians struggling in poverty, but they still urge those experiencing debt distress to not hesitate to call. The National Debt Helpline — a federal government-run financial counselling service — said it's on track to receive a record number of cases through its call centres this year — many from older Australians who can't meet their mortgage or rent payments. ""The phones just never stop now,"" financial counsellor Greg said. ""They're just going day after day, after day. ""You put the phone down, you pick the phone up again."" Greg has been with the call centre for 14 years. He said it's never been so busy, now with record numbers of older Australians calling in, unable to pay rent, or make good on their mortgage repayments. I sat with Greg while he took some calls. One man who called in had lost his job, and the bank was on his back about meeting his repayments. Greg coached him through his options. ""Have you approached the lender in relation to a hardship arrangement, or have you approached the lender to talk about reducing your payments, putting payments on hold, until you get back into employment?"" Greg asked. Karen Cox co-ordinates the Financial Rights Legal Centre, which runs the call centre. ""Call volumes are huge,"" she said. ""We're at capacity in terms of the number of calls we can take, in fact we're a bit short staffed at the moment."" For the first time, the National Debt Helpline has started fielding calls from Australians struggling to switch from interest, to principal and interest mortgage payments. ""We are seeing an increasing number of older Australians calling us,"" Ms Cox said. ""Very occasionally we're still seeing people who have just been granted a very large mortgage, even though they're in their 50s or 60s, and one that's set to go for a 25 or 30-year term."" Those sorts of lending practices can lead older Australians down a financial rabbit hole. That is when sickness can creep in and marriages break down. The Salvation Army's financial counselling service, Moneycare, warned it was at breaking point. In the 2017-18 financial year, Moneycare saw an 18 per cent increase in Australians seeking help. The service has seen a big increase in the number of Australians over the age of 55 reaching out for help to deal with what it calls ""severe debt"", which is debt at more than six times a person's annual disposable income. ""The trigger may be someone who can't afford hot water, that's when they connect with us,"" financial counsellor Kristen Hartnett said. ""For someone else it might be legal action, or someone says they can't afford the next bill. ""People are trying to do the best they can, but we want them to connect with us so that we can see what they can do to take some of that stress off them,"" Ms Hartnett said. The Salvos' experience with older Australians, and their growing debt distress, matches up with the call data from the National Debt Helpline. Ms Hartnett revealed the proportion of people over the age of 55 accessing The Salvation Army's Moneycare service has increased by 37 per cent over the past 10 years. ""I think it's the change in circumstances,"" Ms Hartnett said. ""People hit retirement, and they're still carrying heavy debt with mortgages and credit cards."" Commsec economist Ryan Felsman has done a lot of research on the financial challenges facing older Australians. He said while many baby boomers rode the recent property boom, those of lower incomes had been doing it extra tough in recent years, and it was only going to getting worse. ""What we're seeing with the data is that if you're a pensioner, really that's the type of person that's under pressure,"" he said. ""If you're a self-funded retiree, generally you've accumulated enough savings over time to live a fairly comfortable life. ""It's mainly people on government transfers and welfare payments that are struggling in this environment."" And while help is available, reaching out is not always easy. Financial counsellors say many Australians still hesitate to pick up the phone, held back by a sense of shame, deciding just to go without. ""Cutting back on food is definitely one we see on a daily basis,"" the Salvos' Kristen Hartnett said. ""People do all that they can, from my experience. I see people taking huge responsibility, and also going without very basic items to honour their debt."" It is a scenario financial counsellor Greg is familiar with. He took a call from a woman on Sydney's northern beaches. Her partner had not asked for any help, but she knew they were in financial trouble, so she called the Helpline. ""Are we talking about personal debt?"" Greg asked. ""Are we talking about debt collection — any legal action on foot? What's happening?"" Greg tried to get as much information as he could. ""Where does your partner live?"" ""Now, what he needs to do is take along paperwork — so correspondence, anything he's got in relation to his debts. ""If he can do his own mini budget at home — like food, rent, the big-picture items — that will help with the financial counsellor. ""We get a lot of third party advice calls,"" Greg said. ""One party hasn't told the other what's happening. It can get vicious if it's a partnership or a marriage."" Often men try to solve the financial problem on their own, with varying degrees of success. ""Men do like to take ownership of it and do not like to make the first call,"" Greg said. ""The wife will ring in with the presenting problem, and we'll say, 'Well, your husband should ring us or see a financial counsellor'."" Ms Cox said hundreds of thousands of Australians struggled with credit card and mortgage debt — the most she has seen in her career managing financial help call centres. ""There's a lot of shame around it,"" she said. ""A lot of people don't want to admit they're in trouble, but there are hundreds of thousands of people out there who are struggling. ""So, you're not alone, and the smartest thing to do is to get advice sooner rather than later because as time goes on, your options get more and more restrained.""

345,Don't fool yourself  — building inspections aren't the protection many home buyers think,house-and-home,"  Push for building inspection changes to help reduce conflict between buyers and sellers Adele Charalambous and her husband had been looking for a new home for two years when they made an offer on a 1930s character home in the Perth suburb of Nedlands. In January, the pair moved in, despite a litany of defects having been picked up in the pre-purchase building inspection report they commissioned. ""It was a 36-page report, of which 27 pages detailed about 35 defects,"" Ms Charalambous said. All bar two of the defects — including problems with the roof and a tilted boundary fence — were not deemed to be structural, and were therefore not covered under the standard annexure issued by the Real Estate Institute of WA (REIWA). While the sale proceeded, Ms Charalambous said the experience had been ""a little confronting"". ""Our biggest learning out of this process was the fact that we weren't clear — or … weren't particularly well informed — in terms of what does a structural defect mean?"" Under the REIWA annexure, if a structural defect is detected, the seller of the property is obligated to either compensate the buyer or remedy the defects using a registered builder. But the definition of structural defect is narrow in scope, according to Elias Oostveen, a registered builder who operates building inspection company Home Integrity. ""People don't understand. We deal with lawyers and doctors, really smart, professional people, but when it comes to building terminology, I think people just make up their own mind [about] what building and structure mean,"" he said. Defects that are not considered structural include sagging ceilings, leaking shower recesses, problems with the roof (other than the roof frame) and rising damp. ""A non-structural defect might be no heat shields to down lights,"" he said. ""If debris or insulation come into contact, it's a huge fire hazard. We have to put it in the report … but people are very confused."" That confusion has motivated Mr Oostveen to draft a new annexure, which allows buyers and sellers to specify what will be covered in the inspection. ""If they've come from a house that's had a leaking roof or leaking shower … there's a section where they can insert 'we want the roof cover checked',"" he said. ""There's also a section for the seller to sign that, so if the seller doesn't want to be liable for fixing the roof, they just cross that section out."" Real estate agent Peter Robertson, who worked on the draft annexure with Mr Oostveen, said he believed the new document would help reduce conflict between buyers and sellers. ""It used to be caveat emptor, buyer beware. [That] doesn't exist anymore, so my job as an agent is to make sure that we have a really good, really clear transaction where everybody understands what they're getting and what they're giving,"" Mr Robertson said. ""I would expect the industry will look at this and embrace it as a good idea."" However, newly elected REIWA president Damian Collins said REIWA does not ""see any need, as it currently stands, to change the annexure very much"". ""We're open to amending our annexure, but obviously we'll take the feedback of the [REIWA] members based on their feedback with the public,"" he said. ""The issue is, what's a structural defect? You cannot define that definitively, and so we're thinking that maybe the qualification level might need to be looked at."" In Western Australia, there is no formal qualification or regulation defining who may be a building inspector, in contrast to other states. However, that may be about to change, with REIWA considering new rules to ensure inspections are performed by a qualified professional. Mr Collins said the organisation was looking at several options, including inserting a clause in the standard annexure to allow inspections by registered builders only. ""When people are buying their biggest asset, we want to make sure that they're protected and that the qualified people are making the assessments, whether something is structurally sound or not,"" Mr Collins said. REIWA said it did not have a timeframe for voting on the changes, but planned to canvass its members in the months ahead. For Mr Oostveen, that decision is overdue. ""People are very surprised when I explain … that you don't need to be licensed,"" Mr Oostveen said. ""You don't need to be registered, you don't need to be accredited, anyone can do building inspections.""

346,Don't want to go into a retirement home? Try a tiny house instead,house-and-home," RN Octogenarian's tailor-made tiny house offers a retirement home alternative While Australia reels from stories of malpractice in the aged care sector, perched petitely in regional Victoria is a house that could serve as an alternative model to a retirement home. It's Merle's house — her tiny house, to be precise. ""I'm 82 years old and I can manage this easily, and I don't have to depend on carers,"" she says. ""I am completely independent."" Merle moved into the tiny house earlier this year, and she hasn't looked back. Roughly 7 by 2.5 metres in dimension, her light-filled residence sits on her family's country property. But Merle's home is completely self-contained, and it's tailor-made to suit her specific physical requirements. It has an entrance ramp leading to the home's veranda, assistive bathroom rails in the shower alcove and touch-open cupboard doors. There is underfloor heating and a hydraulic bed that she can raise with the press of a button during the day — revealing a couch underneath. All for a price tag of around $150,000. ""I love the living, I love the warmth. I'm warmer here than I ever was in Queensland,"" Merle says. ""There's nothing in this home that isn't great, and I love the half-hour of housework instead of four bedrooms."" Chris Wenban — who isn't of retirement age — also lives in a tiny house, next door to Merle. She runs a tiny house construction company and, along with her business partner, built both homes. She says she became ""quite obsessed"" with tiny homes for primarily environmental reasons, which eventually prompted her to move into one herself. ""I like efficiency. I like the idea of not having as big an impact on the environment and not having to spend as much money on housing,"" she says. She says there's a common misconception that a tiny house is a just a fancy caravan. But there are major points of difference in a tiny house. ""The look and the feel and the sense of space is completely different,"" Ms Wenban says. ""My lowest ceiling height downstairs, because I have a loft bedroom, is two metres high in the kitchen and the bathroom."" She sleeps in a loft that's around a metre high. Her three-metre kitchen is full-size, as is her gas oven, and a ""little, secret table"" can be pulled out to make an office space. She has a composting toilet, with solids that are emptied every three months into a nearby compost bin. Nasty pathogens are then killed off over the course of a year, before the resulting fertiliser is spread onto the garden. ""Most people advise putting it on fruit trees and not on your vegetable garden, because you don't want to have that conversation with your dinner guests,"" Ms Wenban says. Both women's houses are in Kinglake West, facing a ridge where, nine years after the Black Saturday bushfires, lifeless trunks are a grim reminder of how many people lost their lives in the small community. In this context, a tiny home on wheels offers benefits that extend beyond sustainability. ""We permanently have a vehicle on site that will be able to pull the tiny houses out,"" Ms Wenban says. ""Because they are on wheels, you can do that. ""So, our fire plan is, essentially, if we were in a situation where we thought that there was a fire that had started nearby, we could very easily just hook them up and pull them out."" She says tiny houses are advantageous not only in the event of bushfires, but flooding too. Ms Wenban has taken her tiny constructions to home shows and farming expos, and says she's surprised by the demographic of potential buyers she meets there. ""I would say about 20 or 30 per cent of those people are older people, either looking for themselves for the future [or for their] elderly parents,"" she says. ""Everyone wants to look after their parents but the reality of having another family member living in your own house can be quite stressful."" Tiny houses allow older people to live independently from a main household, but close to people who can keep an eye out for them. ""For a lot of people who get older it's not [that] they need a high degree of care or that they can't live independently anymore,"" Ms Wenban says. Rather, ""two or three small things start adding up"", she says, like needing a stair-free home, or someone to monitor medication or a proper diet. She believes these things alone ""aren't necessarily a great reason to go into an old people's home"". Ms Wenban says Merle is an example of someone successfully opting for a tailored tiny home over accommodation in an institution. ""Merle's very independent,"" Ms Wenban says. ""She has a separate physical space and it's hers and people have to knock on the door when they come in. ""She continues her lifestyle as she normally would, getting up when she wants, eating when she wants, eating what she wants, and has very much that sense of independence. ""It's very much her home."" Life Matters is here to help you get a handle on all the important stuff: love, sex, health, fitness, parenting, career, finances and family. But if Merle needs a hand with a meal or to be run down to the shops, help is easily accessible. Plus, says Ms Wenban, ""it's often good for your mental health when you're around family, people who are going to check on you regularly"". She believes we'll see more living arrangements like Merle's in the future. ""As councils realise that this is an alternative to people going into old people's homes, I think it will become more recognised, permitted and accepted,"" she says. ""[A tiny house] can extend people's ability to live independently for an extra number of years.""

347,"Amid an epidemic of mortgage stress, a financial 'perfect storm' is on the way",house-and-home,"  Amid an epidemic of mortgage stress, a perfect financial storm is on the way, experts warn As Australia's levels of household debt relative to disposable income hit historic highs, experts are warning of a perfect financial storm on the horizon for struggling home owners with a surge in repayments set to hit interest-only home loans over the coming 12 months. Homeowners, particularly in the mining states of WA and Queensland, are already grappling with a number of factors including unemployment, under-employment, stagnant wages growth and weak house prices. Another looming threat is rising interest rates, with three of the four major banks raising variable home loan rates earlier this year independent of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Andrew and Rachel Hayden built their dream home in Perth's south-eastern fringe three years ago, but they are expecting a mortgage default notice from their bank within a month. ""We put probably $600,000 into it and [are] probably going to sell it for $480,000 — shocking,"" Andrew Hayden said. He said he wanted to unlock his superannuation to pay his mortgage but couldn't until the bank served him a default notice. The couple's financial problems began when Rachel Hayden fell ill 18 months ago. The mother of five was forced to stop work and Mr Hayden had to shut down his business to care for her. ""[I feel] absolutely gutted,"" she said. ""You do everything by the book, everything. Gutted for the kids, they don't do sports or anything and haven't because you just can't afford to. ""It took us so long to get here and we thought yes, no wasted rent money or anything like that. ""Both had good jobs, the kids are happy, everyone's thriving — you peak and then it just crumbles."" The Haydens' tale is a common problem felt across the economy as households become increasingly stretched. Siobhan Meerman, a financial counsellor at the Midland Information, Debt and Legal Advocacy Service (MIDLAS) based in Perth's eastern suburbs, is at the coalface of the problem. She said 75 per cent of the clients who walked through her agency's door were suffering mortgage stress, an increase of about 25 per cent in the past two years. ""The clients I see coming in can be of any age,"" Ms Meerman said. ""They can be single people, couples with and without children, most of them are coming in about to lose their house. ""A lot of them have been FIFO [fly-in, fly-out] workers, but increasingly in recent months we're seeing people in secondary and tertiary roles, the jobs which used to support the mining industry. ""Loss of income, persistent loss of income because they can't get another job, under-employment once they get a new job and over-committal of credit from before they got their job. ""I think it's going to continue for quite a while. I think what we are seeing is the knock-on effect of poor lending, bad market, downturn of jobs and that doesn't peter out immediately."" The situation is leading to a rising number of mortgage defaults, particularly in the mining states of Western Australia and Queensland. Of the 10 worst performing postcodes across the country, six are in Western Australia and four are in Queensland. If you extend out to the 20 worst performers, 15 of the spots are occupied by WA and Queensland. There are also pockets of stress in Victoria and New South Wales. NT/QLD border Source: Moody's Investor Service, November 2017 ""I think the community underestimates the fragility of so many families' wellbeing and their financial situations,"" said Mark Glasson, executive general manager of charity Anglicare WA. ""There are whole communities out there living week-to-week and hand-to-mouth, where the slightest disruption will create a major problem."" The organisation has seen the demand for financial help rise 40 per cent on the same time last year. ""We knocked back more people than we saw, so there is a phenomenal number of people in financial hardship,"" he said. ""Of those people about one in three, a little bit more than that, are in housing stress or mortgage stress in particular, so what we are finding is somewhere between six and seven people a day are coming to us needing help to sustain their mortgages."" Credit Ratings agency Moody's has predicted the situation will worsen as a growing number of interest only loans convert to principal and interest, adding about 30 per cent to monthly fees based on current interest rates. About 40 per cent of all mortgages funded by banks during 2014 and 2015 were interest only, and many of them included clauses which stipulated homeowners would have to start paying principal payments after five years. Throw into the mix flat wages growth nationally, underemployment on the east coast and stubbornly high unemployment in the west, and according to Keith John, founder of Pioneer Credit — which buys debt off the banks once people default on their loans — you have a perfect storm. ""A perfect storm in the sense of, and I think we're seeing it play out now, really low retail sales and a general lack of consumer appetite, and … people are desirous to paying down debt but don't have the capacity that they did a year ago, or two or three years ago,"" he said. ""I don't see it changing for some time. I don't see a catalyst that's going to change the unemployment or the underemployment rate, and [there] certainly doesn't seem to be a catalyst that's going to be any cause for a material uplift in wages growth."" After spending most of his 25-year career in debt collection, Mr John believed there was a better way to help people suffering financial hardship. ""Our job is to help them through that situation and if we can help them through it well, then it will be a good outcome for them,"" he said. ""If we do a good job, they will pay us. We need that obviously to succeed as a company, and if we do it really well, they'll continue to shop with us, they'll take out a personal loan with us once they're back on their feet financially."" Mr John said many people's finances came unstuck when they encountered a major event in life. ""People generally look the same — that is, they live week-to-week on credit cards and personal loans going along quite nicely and then something happens: death, divorce, sickness, lost their job,"" he said. ""Domestic violence is increasingly a challenge and that event causes them to re-shift their priorities and not be able to address their debt situation."" Anglicare's Mark Glasson warned that Australians may need to rethink the Australian dream of owning their own home. ""I think the great Australian dream of buying your home is definitely something we need to reconsider,"" he said. For renting to become a truly viable, long-term alternative to home ownership, greater rental affordability and security is needed, writes senior research fellow Emma Power. ""I think we need to provide better for renters, we need to provide better long-term tenancies, we need to look at tenancy law to make sure [people] are protected when they're renting. ""I think we need to be mindful, for many young people, they're not going to have the option of owning a home. ""But we see a lot of people who see housing an an investment and that's part of our difficulty — there's accommodation there that people don't have access to because it's being used as an investment,"" he said. As for the Haydens, they are still hopeful of selling their house, and are now renovating a bus which will become their next home.

348,The Perth property market is so bad even real estate agents are selling out,house-and-home,"  As Perth property prices tumble, even real estate agents are selling out of the market You know things are tough in the property market when a seasoned real estate agent sells his own family home and chooses to rent instead. Greg Rossen has been selling homes in Perth's wealthy western suburbs for decades, but even he doesn't have the confidence to invest in housing at the moment. And he can't see it getting better anytime soon. ""No-one can predict the future, but for my own self I have sold out of the market and I am renting a family property because I don't see any light on the horizon,"" he said. ""Investors need to be mindful of where they think the cycle is and make up their own mind. ""But there is a body of thought, that I subscribe to, that conditions are not good and I believe they could well get worse."" After strong price rises across 12 suburbs — largely at the premium end of Perth's property market — the Real Estate Institute of WA recently claimed ""aspirational suburbs are really leading the way in the property market's recovery"". But Mr Rossen takes a less bullish view. ""It's lovely to quote certain suburbs where you have what appears to be an increase in price, but in reality, if we look at the total metropolitan market, those are almost anecdotal,"" he said. ""We are coming off a low base so statistics can lie and they need to be very closely looked at."" Mr Rossen said those price rises were attributable to ""pent-up"" demand but the broader market ""is generally in a bad condition"". He noted that while prices in Nedlands have risen 15 per cent over the past year, he recently re-sold three properties in the area for 10 per cent less than he sold the same houses for a decade ago. He said a ""devastation"" in commercial rents as well as tenant vacancies in both the residential and retail sector continued to point to poor market conditions. According to property data firm CoreLogic, house prices across the Perth metropolitan area have dropped in real terms by 24 per cent over the past 10 years. Such statistics contradict many buyers' expectations that their house price will double in price every decade. ""Real estate has never been a short-term investment, it's always been a long-term investment — long-term I am talking 20, 30 years,"" LJ Hooker Rockingham Baldivis director Paul Baird-Murray said. He said the area south of Perth in which he worked was currently saturated with properties for sale, the majority of which were bought as investments. ""A lot of buyers that buy into property don't understand the real estate cycles,"" Mr Baird-Murray said. ""Some of them have actually said 'but I thought rents just kept going up, I thought property prices would just continue.'"" Many investors were now panicking because they were under financial strain or feared further market falls. But Mr Baird-Murray said they were unrealistic about the value of their property in the crowded market. Local resident Steph Moses said ongoing land development in the area was exacerbating the problem. She and husband Daniel have an investment property in Port Kennedy, between Perth and the regional city of Mandurah. They had intended to keep the property for the long term, but were recently forced to list it for sale. ""I was given the diagnosis that I had stage four cancer so we had to change a lot of things,"" Mrs Moses said. ""I have had to stop work because of my illness."" The only offer they have had on the property was $70,000 less than they paid for it. ""If you want to build a house, you get $10,000-$15,000 for building a new home, so there is no incentive for the first-home buyers market to buy an established property,"" Mrs Moses said. REA Group chief economist Nerida Conisbee said there were positive signs in the Perth market. After a four-year decline, rental demand for Perth properties has jumped 20 per cent on the back of interstate interest, particularly from Queensland. ""It's really reflective of the jobs growth,"" Ms Conisbee said. ""You know when people move to a city they typically rent first before buying, and it is a good indicator of what is to come.""

349,Builder dreams to future-proof homes for our ageing population,house-and-home,"  Townsville builder's dream for disability-friendly housing to become standard North Queensland builder Martin Locke has been pushing for Townsville to become a pilot city where all new homes are built to a silver level standard, to meet the needs of Australia's growing populations of older people and people with a disability. Mr Locke has garnered support from Townsville City Council, land developers and the building industry, but without a financial incentive provided by Government he said there is no way every new home buyer will build to that standard. ""It is a bit sad that we have to offer financial incentive for something that is just and right … but unfortunately it is just not happening,"" Mr Locke said. ""Making it mandatory isn't the way to go, but I think everyone will realise where you can you should build to this standard. ""It future-proofs the homes you are building for the fastest growing market, the aged and the disabled."" In 2010 the Federal Government's Liveable Housing Australia Guidelines were developed to address the shortage of homes that meet Australia's growing populations needs. The guidelines' target was for all new homes to be built to silver level standard by 2020. Silver level is the minimum level needed for a person with a wheelchair to be able to live in a house. The Queenslanders With a Disability Network (QDN) has estimated that less than 5 per cent of new homes are being built to that standard. ""There has been lots of targets set, but without actual commitment and requirements put in place and incentives to get the building industry to reach those targets,"" Michelle Moss from QDN said. ""So the project here in Townsville, which is about silver level housing, is actually heling support meeting those targets."" Mr Locke said the few changes needed to make a house silver-level compliant add less than $2,500 to the cost of a new home. The main changes include having one metre-wide hallways, a step-free shower, 870 millimetre-wide doorways, extra beams in the walls of the bathroom to allow for grab rails to be installed, one entry without stairs and 1.2m between the toilet and the toilet door. ""The thing about silver level housing is it is so basic, it is so easy to do it at the start of construction,"" Mr Locke said. ""There has been numbers saying it costs 20 times more to do it retrofitting."" Townsville resident Jeff Wright was badly injured while riding his motorbike in 2015 and now requires a wheelchair for mobility. Mr Wright spent four months last year looking for a rental property that he could access in his wheelchair. ""There was nothing on offer that I could find,"" Mr Wright said. Confounded by the rental options available, Mr Wright ended up having to buy a property and modify it to make it wheelchair accessible. ""I was in the building game before the accident so I had a good idea of what I wanted to do,"" . ""But still, it took six months and I was in a hotel for six months waiting for the modifications to occur."" But even after $130,000 of modifications Mr Wright said his home is not ideal. ""A couple of the doors …  I have got to be lined up perfectly or else I'll skin my knuckles,"" he said. QDN has reported that 830,000 Queenslanders with a disability are facing a housing affordability crisis. Ms Moss said people with a disability and older people on a pension find it particularly hard to find housing that is both suitable and affordable. ""Often people are on fixed incomes, which impacts on their ability to participate in the housing market and then there is a lack of options,"" she said. Mark Henley from the Queensland Council of Social Services (QCOSS) said this lack of accessible housing is preventing people with a disability from integrating wholly into society. ""If you don't have that foundational piece around housing, other areas will suffer,"" Mr Henley said. ""Housing is foundational as far as people having good health, opportunities for kids to get to school and be educated … accessing employment and sustaining employment."" Liveable Housing Australia has reported a 60 per cent chance that a home will be occupied by a person with a disability at some point. As Australia's population ages, accessibility is also on the minds of many older home buyers. Mr Henley said it is not enough to have accessible homes just for people with disabilities. ""People with a disability want to actually go and visit family and friends and also get access to the other infrastructure that exists whether it is retail or commercial,"" Mr Henley said. ""The more they can access other premises the more inclusive the whole community is."" Mr Wright said he has to be a ""bit inventive"" when it comes to accessing some houses or businesses. ""There are some places that I just cant get into,"" he said. ""The boys will lift you up and carry you, but it is not quite dignified either and you don't want to impose on your mates,"" he said. ""You want to feel independent rather than feel obligated on people's assistance."" Ultimately, Mr Locke said he would like to see a First Home Buyers Grant-style subsidy scheme for silver level housing established, but for the time being he would be happy to see a 12 month pilot program in Townsville. Mr Locke said both State and Federal Government representatives have been very enthusiastic during meetings about the Townsville pilot but he fears the project has stalled around the subsidy. ""We have done everything we can as a local community,"" Mr Locke said. ""I am hoping that State and Federal Governments really do find a way to match what the Townsville community has done, that is the final piece of the puzzle.""

350,opinion: What should you know about a house before you buy it?,house-and-home,"  What should you know about a house before you buy it? Buying a house is probably one of the most important purchases a person will make. Many people think the vendor is required to disclose matters that affect the property value, particularly if the buyer has no other means of finding out the full history of the house. For instance, if someone was murdered in the house, do the buyers have a right to be told? The solicitor or conveyancer who acts for a buyer will probably tell them the law is ""buyer beware"". It is up to buyers to satisfy themselves that the property is not affected by any defects in title, that it can be used for the purposes the buyer intends, and that any building on the property is sound. If a vendor actively conceals a known defect, then that might amount to fraud. It's time to jump into the market and purchase a property. But loans, auctions and contracts can be confusing, and the hidden costs can add up. So, how should you go about buying your first home? Examples include painting to conceal serious termite damage, or giving a deliberately false answer to a question from a buyer about the property. A purchaser would need to show, though, that the vendor was deliberately dishonest or at least reckless. That's a high standard of proof to meet. The law requires vendors in some states, including New South Wales and Victoria, to disclose the title documents and any registered encumbrances such as easements and covenants. The vendor's mortgages will be discharged on settlement. In NSW and some other states, vendors must attach to the contract a certificate from the local council that sets out whether the land is affected by administrative or regulatory matters. This includes issues like zoning, subdivision, contaminated land or identified bushfire or flood hazards. These council certificates can give buyers a good idea of whether they will be able to use the property as they wish. Where certain statutory requirements have not been disclosed, the buyer can rescind the contract and get their deposit back if the matter was so important that they would not have entered into the contract had they known about it. In many states, though, there is no duty to disclose matters relating to the title or the use of the land. If the property is a commercial or investment property, the Australian Consumer Law gives remedies to buyers who are induced to enter into contracts by misleading or deceptive conduct in trade or commerce by the vendor or the vendor's agent. Even if the vendor is selling privately, an agent might still be liable if they misrepresent the property, or tell half-truths that give a misleading impression. But there is still no general duty on vendors or their agents to disclose matters that affect the property value and may be significant to buyers, but which do not amount to defects in title that can't be discovered by reasonable inspection. Should vendors be obliged to disclose all matters that might influence a buyer? There is probably a good case for all state and territory governments to follow NSW with a requirement to disclose council information. But, beyond that, just how far should a duty of disclosure go? For instance, if something terrible, such as murder or other violent and upsetting events, has happened at a property, should a vendor be required to tell potential buyers about this? In some US states, courts have held that a vendor should disclose the history of the house where a murder has been committed. US brokers call these ""stigmatised properties"". In a case in NSW, a house where three members of a family were murdered was sold to unsuspecting buyers, who later found out about this history. They refused to proceed, but as the vendors were not required to disclose the history, the buyers lost their deposit. Should you sacrifice lifestyle to buy? Or just rent forever? Are there other ways? The estate agent who handled the sale was ultimately fined for glossing over the history of the house. The agent also met the cost of the forfeited deposit, but that depended on the particular facts involved. Such horrible events are rare, but buyers might be very distressed by that kind of history. Shouldn't buyers have complete information? One problem is just how far any duty of disclosure would reach. Should any matter at all that affects the value of the property be disclosed? Some buyers might be particularly sensitive and consider that they should be given comprehensive information about the history of the property. Would it be necessary to disclose that a person had died at the property, even if of old age or natural causes? Just as vendors might not know about any structural defects in the property, they might not know much about the history of the property. A landlord vendor, for example, might not have information about what went on in the house while tenants were living in it. It might be unfair, then, to shift to the vendor the risk of any decline in value caused by sensitive buyers. Estate agents are usually responsible for marketing the property. So, if any duty is to exist for making statements about it, perhaps this should lie on the agent, and not the vendors, and should be confined to compensation rather than the ability to get out of the sale. Purchasers can always on-sell a bad bargain, but vendors might be stuck with the property through no fault of their own if they have to bear the responsibility of disclosing everything about its history.

351,Can't pay the rent? 'Get two jobs' or 'move to Adelaide or Perth',house-and-home,"  Tenants unable to pay the rent should get two jobs or move to Adelaide or Perth, Real Estate Institute says The nation's top real estate agent has some advice for anyone trying to get on top of property prices. Tenant organisations say we are in the midst of a rental crisis ""Do the hard yards. Maybe even, God forbid, get two jobs,"" Real Estate Institute of Australia (REI) president, Malcolm Gunning, told 7.30. ""Now, your viewers will hate that, OK, but many, many people do it — a lot of our migrants work two jobs."" More Australians than ever before are stumping up rent money. That is especially the case for middle to high-income earners who have been locked out of the housing market in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. It is a squeeze at the top and bottom of the market. Tenants associations and community housing groups say the burden to pay higher rents has fallen on low-income earners, who are also being hit by a significant drop off in public housing. But the REI says there is no national rental affordability crisis at the moment — it just depends where you want to live. ""I don't accept there's a rental affordability crisis, not in Australia, because most of the stats are focussed on Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne,"" Mr Gunning said. ""The reason the rents haven't dropped, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney, is because of population growth. ""If you want to live on the fringe of the city, it's affordable, if you want to live closer to the city, it's expensive. ""What we need to do is create jobs in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, and I'm sure many of your viewers, if they can earn the same money, they'd bolt."" In Sydney, five kilometres from the CBD, $470 a week gets you three walls and a balcony on the eighth floor of an apartment block with no car park. ""[A studio] is not for everyone, but if you want that convenience that's the way you live your life,"" Mr Gunning said. Sixty kilometres away in Penrith, on Sydney's western fringe, Wendy Gammon and her family are looking at renting something for $400 a week. They are about to be evicted from their current home, which is going to be demolished to make way for new units. ""I'm now 53, and to live in a unit for the first time at my age would probably be a bit of a shock to the system,"" she told 7.30. Her husband is a truck driver and she works in a call centre with varying hours, which means rent money is tight. ""My job is much more volatile, so it's always a stress for me with shifts,"" she said. Her son Brad is moving back in with his mum to help pay the rent. ""Me and my girlfriend moved out on our own for six months,"" he said. ""It was $300 a week, which is affordable, but I mean a little one-bedroom. ""We had hot water for a 30-second shower each, it was a nightmare."" The National Association of Tenant Organisations (NATO) is in no doubt. ""We really are in a bit of a crisis, and it's a crisis that's been brewing for a long time,"" NATO spokesperson Leo Patterson Ross told 7.30. ""I think the first thing we need to do is accept that rented homes are homes and they're not simply investment vehicles. ""I think it's the uncertainty that gives people a lot of fear. We really don't know what we're going to be paying in a year, in two years, 10 [years]."" The real estate industry and tenant organisations may disagree on whether or not there is a rental crisis, but there are some points where they do agree. But the nation's biggest real estate data company, CoreLogic, disagrees. ""Relative to buying a house, renting is relatively affordable across Australia,"" CoreLogic head of research, Tim Lawless, said. ""26 to 28 per cent of household income is dedicated to a landlord. ""If you're paying down a mortgage like [in] Sydney, households are paying 48 to 50 per cent of their gross annual income paying down a mortgage."" But he accepts low-income earners are suffering. ""This segment of the marketplace that's absolutely under the most rental stress — we've seen wages growth overall tracking very slow, less than inflation — but we're finding in those lower income brackets, lower quartile, we're finding income growth is even lower,"" he said. It is those people at the bottom who worry Ellen Witte, a specialist in economic geography at SGS. ""45 per cent of the low-income households are now in rental stress,"" she said. ""That's, of course, a dire situation which means that people are paying 30 per cent of their income or more on rent. ""That leaves very little left for food, heating and cooling of the house, transport and education for the children."" She said governments were not investing enough in public housing, forcing those at the bottom out onto the street. ""About a third of all homeless households actually give the main reason to housing unaffordability, so that's a key driver,"" she said.

352,Renting: What are the facts?,house-and-home,"  Renting: What are the facts? The real estate industry and tenant organisations may disagree on whether or not there is a rental crisis, but there are some points where they do agree. More Australians are renting than ever before — up to 31 per cent of all households. (HILDA) There is less social and affordable housing ever before. (HILDA/ABS) Federal funding for new social and affordable housing is lower than any time over the last decade. (UNSW) This means more Australians are being pushed into the private market. (HILDA) People who own property have used those properties to leverage their position to buy more properties (AHURRI), pushing out would-be home owners. (SGS GROUP) So people with middle to higher incomes are renting longer. That affects middle to lower-income renters by keeping rents higher. (SGS) Even in Sydney, where there are 13-year record vacancies in some areas, rents have not dropped dramatically. Vacant properties are still worth holding onto, effectively parking money, only for long-term capital gains. (REIA/SGS) Two thirds of landlords operate at a loss. (ATO) More community housing is needed. (REI/NATO) Longer term leases, like those in Europe, are needed. (REI/NATO) Tenants want tax policy changes. ""Most landlords have moved away from rent as the main income source,"" National Association of Tenant Organisations (NATO) spokesman Leo Patterson Ross said. ""They're really looking at the capital gains and that's why capital gains tax and negative gearing are such an important part of this conversation."" But the real estate industry warns any change to CGT or negative gearing would threaten the current market. ""If we have a change of government, negative gearing will be altered because Labor are rusted on,"" Real Estate Institute of Australia (REI) president Malcolm Gunning said. ""We're saying, you be wary, the markets already sliding. You don't need to push it off a cliff."" ""Now's the time to lock your rent in because I'm of the opinion in 18 months, when demand outstrips supply, you're going to see rents really climb.

353,Tiny home trend could have big problems without better planning laws,house-and-home,"  Cheaper land, better planning laws needed if tiny homes are to become viable housing option Registered builder Sally Wills says when it comes to housing, there is no such thing as too small. ""If you can address your actual living needs, I think potentially 10 or 15 square metres is a very workable space,"" she said. Ms Wills is the director of Small Change Design and Construction and is passionate about building small, affordable and sustainable homes. But while consumers are starting to embrace the trend, local laws are not keeping up. Ms Wills has been lobbying governments to relax the rules governing small homes, saying currently ""it's not clear where they are allowed to be parked"". But she also wants tighter controls over who is allowed to build tiny homes to ensure they adhered to building codes. ""There's no regulation. Pretty much anyone can put their hand up and say that I'm a tiny house builder,"" she told ABC Melbourne's Hilary Harper. Ms Wills's company designs homes that can be ordered in small, extra small, and extra-extra small. But while tiny houses are more affordable to build and run, she said they needed to be paired with cheap land to truly offer long-term secure housing. Otherwise they're just a ""bandaid solution"" that could potentially leave people with a depreciating asset, especially if it's parked on someone else's property. ""As romantic as tiny houses on wheels are, we are getting carried away with what are ostensibly heavy duty caravans and hoping that will be a solution to our housing crisis. It is not,"" she said. ""It's a little bit like offering fabulous swags to homeless people."" Ms Wills said the public had made it clear they were prepared to compromise on size in order to own their own home. ""It would be good if they didn't also have to compromise on complying with the national construction code, being protected by building with a properly registered builder, and, importantly, actually owning the land their house was on,"" she said. Green Design Solutions director Janine Strachan is also working behind the scenes to see the regulations changed. She is part of a Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV) steering committee that's identifying possible changes to statewide planning schemes and local council regulations. Ms Strachan said many councils were trying to reduce the regulatory barriers, particularly for tiny homes on wheels which faced additional challenges. ""Some councils may deem a tiny house to be a caravan and therefore they don't want people to live in them for more than 30 or 60 days, but it really depends [on the council]."" She said tiny homes on wheels were required to be mounted on engineered trailers that were registered with VicRoads, and if they were going to be a second dwelling, they also required a planning permit. While she wanted to see a relaxation of rules determining where tiny homes could be parked, Ms Strachan has also pushed for stricter regulations governing their construction. She is reviewing the Building Code of Australia to try and ensure tiny homes will be structurally sound, energy efficient and suitable for bushfire-prone areas regardless of where they are eventually located. MAV president Mary Lalios said the association believed that tiny homes could be one solution to housing shortages. She said it was working with the construction industry to develop a proposal to put to the Victorian Government, encouraging it to amend planning and building laws to better support tiny houses. ""Local government recognises the potential that tiny houses could add to the diversity of housing options available to accommodate our growing population,"" she said.

354,Are we ignoring the heritage value of Melbourne's mid-century architecture?,house-and-home,"  Architecture advocates argue for change to interpretation of heritage buildings Melbourne's beautiful Victorian-era buildings are widely appreciated as some of the city's most valuable assets — but that was not always the case. Decades ago, debate raged about whether Victorian architecture was worth saving at all. These days it is Melbourne's post-war buildings that are in the crosshairs, with homes from the 1950s and '60s at the centre of a debate around which architectural styles are worthy of protection. So, is it time for the community's understanding of what is considered a 'heritage' building to evolve? National Trust Victoria advocacy manager Felicity Watson thinks so. Ms Watson said mid-century modern architecture evolved during a time of significant change in Melbourne, culminating in the hosting of the 1956 Olympic Games which showcased the city to the world. ""In terms of architecture, the post-war period was a really exciting time of experimentation,"" she said. ""There were lots of really skilled and significant architects that were practicing."" She thinks it is time to reshape the way we think about buildings from this era, which are often dismissed as daggy. ""We really see this as a turning point in the heritage movement,"" she said. ""In the 1970s it was about protecting places of Victorian heritage — which at that time were not always seen as the way that we appreciate them now but were sometimes seen as ugly and undesirable. ""That's sort of the argument we're seeing in relation to post-war heritage."" Ms Watson called on local and state governments to recognise the significance of these homes, but said property owners also had a responsibility to protect them. ""There are certainly views in the community that heritage is an encumbrance on a property,"" she said. ""But what we really need to take into account is the benefit to the community and not think about just individuals."" One of the largest concentrations of significant post-war homes can be found in the bright, open-plan, mid-century modern residences of Melbourne's bayside suburbs. Local community group Beaumaris Modern has sprung up to spruik the architectural innovation they believe makes these homes worthy of preservation. The group's president Fiona Austin said many homes in the area were designed by significant Australian architects. Ms Austin, an interior designer, said the group's members were distressed at seeing so many mid-century modern homes demolished; homes that evolved during a time of important architectural innovation. ""People were sick of dark houses that look like something from England,"" she said. ""Young architects, after the war, started designing houses that face north, face the garden, had big windows, skillion roofs, flat roofs and you know, enjoyed outside spaces. ""It's perfect for our climate and still is now."" Only last week the group fought — but failed — to save a home on Mariemont Avenue in Beaumaris which was designed by architects Chancellor and Patrick in 1962. The home was originally identified by Bayside City Council as worthy of protection in a 2007 heritage study. But in 2018, the council abandoned planning scheme amendments to introduce a heritage overlay on this and other mid-century properties, after what they described as strong opposition and community division. Bayside City Council now plans to introduce a voluntary process for owners to nominate their mid-century homes for possible inclusion in a heritage overlay. National Trust Victoria has urged them to reconsider, saying conducting their own study could have protected this ""significant home"". In a statement, the council said the permit to demolish the property was issued by a private building surveyor and did not require council approval because it was not covered by heritage controls. Boroondara Council, in Melbourne's east, has a large concentration of heritage properties, albeit from a different era. Councillor Coral Ross said the jury was still out on whether heritage listings drove property prices up or down. ""Our role and our responsibility is to conserve and enhance the area which we live in,"" she said. ""We have done large surveys which say that our community values the character of the area in which they live and the heritage is something that they really value. ""The reason that people move into an area is because they like the architectural style [and] we certainly have a lot of people that want to live in our area."" Beaumaris Modern is trying to take matters into their own hands by matching sympathetic house hunters with mid-century modern properties. Ms Austin said at least one local real estate agent had embraced the niche market. ""He has a database of over 100 people who want to buy a mid-century house in Beaumaris, so he goes to them before they go on the market and often just matches people with their houses,"" she said. The City of Melbourne has just released an audit of heritage listings across the CBD. Greens councillor Rohan Leppert described the 2,000-page Hoddle Grid Heritage Review as ""the mother of all audits"", unprecedented in scale in Victoria. The review considered increasing heritage protection for 64 properties and six precincts within the grid — including some from the post-war period. The City is now seeking permission from the Planning Minister to formally exhibit the Planning Scheme amendment C328, which proposes permanent heritage protection for properties identified in the review. Cr Leppert said he was surprised many of the buildings had not been granted heritage protection already but said heritage was a ""tricky issue"". ""We need to really carefully measure the social heritage of a place, the architectural heritage [and] the scarcity of particular types of buildings,"" he said Cr Leppert said the review had looked at post-war and post-modern buildings including the Hoyts Mid City complex in the Bourke St Mall and the Lyceum Club in Ridgway Place. ""The Hoyts Mid City complex is maybe not what Melburnians typically think of as something worthy of heritage protection but it is quite a remarkable building,"" he said. ""The Lyceum Club is not a building that people might necessarily think is a standout piece of architecture. ""But it is something that we think has remarkable social and architectural heritage and is quite unique in the way it came about, so we're seeking protection for that building as well."" Cr Leppert said there would always be competing interests between development and heritage protection — especially on the most expensive land in the state. He hopes the public will embrace mid-century architecture as an important part of the city's history. ""I think public heritage values do change over time and we're having a fascinating debate publicly about that at the moment.""

355,Open-flue gas heater models taken off the market after deaths,house-and-home,"  Open-flue gas heater models taken off the market after deaths Several models of open-flue gas heaters have been removed from sale after failing technical testing, with others due to be withdrawn from the market soon. Open-flue gas heaters have been responsible for several deaths in Australia, including those of Melbourne woman Sonia Sofianopoulos, 62, last year, and brothers Tyler Robinson, 6, and Chase Robinson, 8, in 2010. The models removed include faux-log fires, as well as older-style space heaters. Hundreds of thousands of open-flue heaters are estimated to be installed in homes across Australia. They have been labelled an outdated technology by regulators, and can have deadly effects if they're installed in homes without proper ventilation. Energy Safe Victoria (ESV) said in May it would move to stop the sale of all 19 models of open-flue heaters still on the market. The Australian Gas Association (AGA) and the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials have now removed eight of those models from sale after they did not pass technical testing. However, ESV chief executive Paul Fearon said the heaters were fundamentally safe if consumers already had them in their homes and were serviced regularly. He said many of the heaters had not passed technical testing due to issues other than carbon monoxide concerns. ""There was one or two that the certification was cancelled because they were no longer manufactured,"" Mr Fearon said. ""In some instances, they are what we would call very minor technical issues. ""Some of them might relate to performance issues or efficiency, and there is a subset we're still looking at from a safety perspective."" He said more would be known about whether a safety alert or recall would be issued on those particular heaters in the coming weeks. He said many of the certifications were cancelled because there are more rigorous standards today than there may have been when they were first manufactured. Mr Fearon reiterated that people should have their gas appliances serviced every two years by a qualified gas fitter. ""If the heater is being managed and serviced properly, they are not unsafe,"" he said. On Wednesday, a Victorian coroner recommended the AGA and ESV work to phase out the sale of all open-flue heaters. Mr Fearon could not give a timeline as to when the remaining models would be taken off shelves, but said it would take longer than a ""matter of months"". ""It'll be a longer timeframe but this is a matter that government is very carefully considering,"" Mr Fearon said. The only open-flue gas heaters currently under a safety undertaking are the Vulcan Heritage and Vulcan Pyrox heaters, which are estimated to be in about 50,000 homes in Australia. Victoria's Department of Health and Human Services has them installed in 6,500 public housing units. In a statement, a spokesperson said 5,100 homes had been checked, with 3,200 heaters disconnected and a further 1,000 heaters had been replaced. She said around 3,800 temporary heaters had been provided, and the department had prioritised the removal of heaters in smaller apartments. Chris Wealthy, Chief Executive of the Australian Gas Association, which certifies heaters for sale, said he believed all states and territories would follow Victoria's lead in banning open-flue gas heaters from sale. ""They're all are taking a keen interest in this matter, I'm sure they'll be very keen to apply a national approach on this,"" he said. Some of the models removed from sale include: The list of currently certified open-flue gas heaters is available on the Energy Safe Victoria website.

356,Being evicted for your cooking or told to hide from prospective tenants — the ugly reality of renting,house-and-home,"  Racial discrimination widespread in the private rental market, advocates warn Imagine having to change your name just to get a rental, or your family being kicked out of a rental house because of your cooking. This is the reality of rental accommodation for many minority groups in WA, according to equal opportunity advocates who have warned racial discrimination in the private rental market is having a serious impact on the lives of an alarming number of families. The issue was thrust into the spotlight in 2009 when an Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) report found substantial evidence of discrimination against ethnic minorities and Indigenous people. Equal Opportunity Commissioner John Byrne said while there had been improvements in the nine years since then, the problem remained widespread. Dr Byrne said many people with Indigenous or foreign-sounding names found they repeatedly had rental applications rejected, often despite having a steady income, excellent rental records and good references. He said much of this was the result of unconscious bias or prejudices landlords may not even realise they hold. ""In Australia we say 'a fair go for everyone', but many are not getting that fair go,"" he said ""The majority of Australians are not racist, a minority are. But I think even the majority have some unconscious biases they are not acknowledging or recognising, and that basically shows through with how they deal with an application. ""There is clear evidence people are discriminated against on the basis of their names, often barely getting past the first hurdle of having their application looked at."" Dr Byrne said this discrimination had led to calls for rental applications to be anonymous, and it was not uncommon for people to use an anglicised name in applications. He said this often merely delayed the discrimination until a face-to-face meeting could take place or official documents were requested. Many people faced a cycle of rejected applications and wind up on waiting lists for public housing or, in the worst cases, homeless. Dr Byrne said those from minority groups who did secure private rentals were commonly only offered short-term leases. ""If there are children involved, the impact of having only a number of short-term leases and having to move from one area to another affects their schooling and their socialisation,"" he said. According to the state's peak body for renters, Tenancy WA, even those ethnic minorities and Indigenous people who could secure longer-term leases remained highly vulnerable. ""We've had tenants who paid well above market rent in order to keep a house,"" principal solicitor Kate Davis said. ""We've had tenants live with really poor maintenance and major problems, including some that have faced safety issues and suffered health consequences with mould and other problems. ""And they've just tolerated those things because they're concerned that if they upset their landlord they might not get other housing."" Ms Davis said lawyers and advocates at Tenancy WA's helpline regularly took calls from renters with problems stemming from racism This month she said they dealt with the case of an engineer of South Sudanese descent whose landlord had decided to sell the flat he was renting. The man asked to be present during home opens because there would be strangers visiting his home and he was concerned about his valuables being stolen. But she said the real estate agent told him he would have to leave during the inspections because he was ""too dark"" and potential buyers would be intimidated. Another call came after a family was issued with a breach of their rental agreement following an inspection because the landlord said their cooking made the kitchen smell ""Asian"". A third caller had his landlord refuse to let him break his lease early because the tenants he had found to replace him were Muslim. Dr Byrne said stories like these were common, but they were just the tip of the iceberg. He said when discrimination was reported, it was often almost impossible to prove. ""The issue with formalising a complaint is the onus of proof is on the person who has lodged the complaint,"" he said. ""Even where the owner deliberately excludes a person of a particular race the estate agent is not going to give that reason to the applicant. They will not want to leave an evidence trail, because with an evidence trail a case of discrimination can be proven."" He said while progress has been made in recent years, he was concerned equal opportunity legislation could merely ensure discrimination was covered up, rather than prevented. Dr Byrne urged victims of discrimination to do more in the way of gathering evidence to support their claims. He said it was common for someone with a foreign-sounding name to feel a landlord has lied and told them the rental they applied for is no longer available. In such a situation, he suggests having a friend call back later that day and ask about the same rental using a common English name. ""If the owner says 'Yes, come and have a look,' and then offers it to them, then bingo, you've got a case,"" he said. Real Estate Institute of WA (REIWA) president Hayden Groves said discrimination in the rental market had improved dramatically since the 2009 EOC report. ""I think there was a more natural tendency then to make assumptions about certain people and certain groups of people, particularly around residential tenancies,"" he said. ""In markets where there was high demand for properties, property managers and/or landlords could be tempted to choose one tenant over another based on a prejudice."" Mr Groves said those issues today mainly persisted within the 35 per cent of rentals in WA not managed by a professional agent. ""Professional REIWA agents are very much aware of their obligations, and therefore are acutely aware of [the impact of discrimination],"" he said. ""In my experience, [they] will be absolutely certain that, if they've got two competing tenancy applications in front of them, that they choose the best one based solely on the merit of the references that the tenant provides, written and verbal, from their previous rental history, and from the instructions from the landlord. ""Where they're from, what sex they are, that is all really completely irrelevant in the mind of trained REIWA professional. ""They're very much focused on just making sure that they get the very best tenant."" He said it was disappointing when professional agents, himself included, encountered landlords who asked them to discriminate. ""We have to make it very clear we are not able to follow their instructions if it is unlawful or unethical to do so,"" Mr Groves said. ""Generally speaking, from my experience, if a landlord does state that then often a REIWA member agent just won't take the business and won't actually act on behalf of the client if they're insistent on those instructions.""

357,Living with mould: The 'tightrope walk' between landlords and tenants,house-and-home," RN Living with mould: The 'tightrope walk' between landlords and tenants As Simon* opens the door to walk downstairs, he pauses, creases his nose, and asks: ""Can you smell that?"" It's the strong odour of must, and it's coming from the basement. He first noticed it more than two years ago, following extensive water damage downstairs. ""We noticed that a lot of water was pouring through the walls,"" he recalls. ""After that the musty smell increased incredibly, and mould started to develop inside the main living areas of the house."" Simon and his partner Markus* are renting in northern Sydney and, despite the mould, they're reluctant to move. ""Is it fair that tenants have to bear the full cost of moving out, where we might usually be quite happy in this home except for the mould issue?"" Simon says. The couple migrated to Australia three years ago from Switzerland — a country where a high proportion of the population rent rather than own their own home. Simon says in Switzerland, the focus is more on the rights of tenants. He says in New South Wales, current laws ""protect the owners, much more than they do the tenants"". The pair voiced their concerns about the mould two years ago, but Simon says their landlord has only recently started to take steps to remove it. ""He has slowly taken it seriously now that we have informed ourselves of what our rights really are, but we feel that a lot information has been withheld from us. ""He sent in a free visual inspector to do the report, but we haven't seen any of the results from that. ""When the inspector was here he was quite shocked with the state of the water damage in the home and said that it had been ongoing for a longer period of time."" Simon says some tenants are reluctant to raise issues with landlords out of fear of being evicted, or facing other repercussions. For this reason, he asked for his identity to be concealed in this story. ""Tenants are afraid of being blacklisted for pushing back too much, and that's valid for most repairs in rental properties in Australia because people are scared of ruining that relationship,"" he says. ""It's a tightrope walk in that relationship between the tenant and the owner, and unfortunately the owner, as it is, holds all the cards."" Simon and Markus have also started to question the potential impacts that indoor mould could be having on their health. ""Symptoms have [been] allergic-type reactions; runny noses, nasal congestion, respiratory problems, skin rashes,"" Simon says. ""We might as well move in with the GP."" In the coming weeks, Simon and Markus plan to see a specialist and undergo further health tests. ""It's difficult to really get to the bottom of it until we have more facts or results,"" Markus says. The Tenants' Union of NSW has recently surveyed renters about their experiences of living with household mould. The union's Leo Patterson Ross says there were more than 400 responses from across the country. ""In general, you'd be looking at older houses that are more likely to have leaks and holes in the roof or walls. But there are certainly new apartment buildings that have big mould problems,"" Mr Patterson Ross says. ""Some people have been reporting that they've had issues in multiple houses over multiple different states, and whenever they move out of a mouldy house their breathing condition clears up and when they move into a new one it comes back."" The union plans to use the survey results in a submission to an ongoing federal inquiry considering implementing minimum standards for dwellings, that would address issues of damp and ventilation. ""At the moment a lot of properties aren't sufficient for dampness and ventilation, and there's no good way for tenants to rectify that or to enforce it,"" Mr Patterson Ross says. ""Partly, the barrier to enforcement is that the legislation doesn't make clear what the landlord's obligation is. ""But also tenants face the retaliation through no-grounds evictions which can happen at the end of a fixed-term agreement. ""One frustration that people often express to us is that they know the next person who moves in is going to have the exact same problem, because there isn't a way of making sure that work that is needed to be done on a property actually happens."" NSW Fair Trading says who is responsible for fixing mould issues in a rental property depends on the cause of the problem. It's up to the landlord to provide a habitable premise, and the tenant is responsible for keeping premises reasonably clean. ""If the mould is not the result of the tenant's neglect to clean and keep the premises reasonably ventilated, then it is considered the landlord's responsibility to repair,"" the spokesperson said. Renters can contact Fair Trading if they're having issues with a landlord, and can also apply to tribunals who can order that a landlord undertake repairs. So how concerned should you be about mould in your home? Dee Carter, a professor of microbiology at the University of Sydney, says mould thrives in damp, poorly ventilated environments. ""I think any amount of visible mould is not a good thing,"" she says. ""Depending on the environment you live in, you could find it growing on your carpet, on your curtains, or in the ceiling tiles. Any substrate really can be a home to mould if there's enough moisture."" Professor Carter says certain species of mould, such as penicillium, aspergillus and Cladosporium, can pose a particular problem indoors. ""These ones can produce a lot of spores and the spores can produce allergies and inflammation,"" she says. ""They can be inhaled and can cause lung diseases if they get a bit too invasive."" Some people are more likely to be affected by mould exposure than others, says Professor Guy Marks, head of respiratory and environmental epidemiology at the Woolcock Institute in Sydney. ""Allergy itself is common, nearly half of all people are allergic to something. A small proportion of those people are allergic to moulds,"" he says. ""Amongst people who are allergic to moulds, those who have asthma or hay-fever are more likely to experience symptoms when they're exposed."" Professor Marks says symptoms can include chest tightness, asthma attacks and allergic rhinitis — a runny nose, nasal blocking and sneezing. This happens when allergenic particles from the mould, usually related to the spores from the moulds, secrete allergenic proteins to which the person reacts. ""I have certainly seen people whose asthma seems to be worse when they're in the home, and in a particular home,"" he says. But he says many other things in the indoor environment can also contribute to such symptoms. ""We assume that it's something in the indoor environment that they're allergic to. ""Moulds are one of the things it could be, but probably more commonly it's related to house dust mite which is ubiquitous in houses and tends to grow in houses that are more damp It can also be difficult to prove significant casual relationships between mould exposure and particular diseases or symptoms. ""This is often frustrating for the patients and the doctors,"" Professor Marks says. *Names have been changed for privacy reasons We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

358,Former inmate calls for more affordable housing so ex-prisoners don't go homeless,house-and-home,"  Former inmate calls for more affordable housing so ex-prisoners aren't immediately homeless, on the streets When John Kenney was released from prison in the 1980s he ended up on the streets, saying he received no help transitioning back into the community and struggled to find proper accommodation. ""The set-up is if you go out on parole you've got to find a place to live. You've got to do that from inside prison, which is very hard to do,"" Mr Kenney said. ""If you do your full time, they just release you from the prison out onto the streets."" He said he unsuccessfully wrote around 100 tenancy applications and was judged based on his criminal history. ""You get judged from the day you're released. Because you've got a criminal background you got nowhere to go. You get no jobs, no place to live, anything,"" he said. He said the system has not changed in the years following his release, with many other released prisoners facing similar housing issues. ""We need some kind of set up in prison that could help to get affordable housing for the prisoners before they get released. Not left on our own to get it ourselves,"" Mr Kenney said. Mr Kenney said he chose to stay in prison an extra six months because he had nowhere else to go. ""Even sometimes homeless people who haven't been to prison are sick of living on the street and getting moved on. They're thinking about going into prison,"" he said. ""It's the best and easy option if you don't want to live on the street. You've got two choices: live on the street or you repeat offending."" Corrections Victoria discharged around 9,000 prisoners in 2014 and 2015. But data from the Department of Justice and Regulation showed that 43.6 per cent of those people returned to prison under sentence within two years of release. Catherine Jefferies from BeyondHousing said homelessness often leads to recidivism. ""We hear prisoners tell their story, they reoffend because they haven't secured a place to live. [In] prison and they have somewhere safe and secure to live,"" she said. Some of the hundreds of people sleeping rough on Melbourne's streets talk about how they ended up there. BeyondHousing is the largest community housing organisation in the Goulburn and Ovens Murray regions of Victoria. Ms Jefferies works with landlords to find homes for people released from Dhurringile Prison and Beechworth Correctional centre, and also provides food assistance and money management help. ""A lot of prisoners exiting prisons have limited options in the sense they may no longer have connections with family and friends, and they've been in prisons for extended periods of time,"" she said. Data collected by BeyondHousing indicated a 14 per cent increase in released prisoners requiring housing assistance from 2013 to 2017. The report highlighted challenges including limited finances, a lack of rental references and the lack of affordable options. ""Housing is crucial, because without affordable housing none of us can function, Ms Jefferies said. ""If you haven't got somewhere safe and secure to live you can't begin to consider employment, you can't begin to reconnect with your family."" A spokeswoman for Corrections Victoria said it worked with the Department of Health and Human Services and other service providers to house offenders. ""All Victorian prisons provide a wide range of rehabilitation and transition programs to help offenders break the cycle of crime when they return to the community,"" the spokeswoman said. She said intervention programs, looking at housing, independent living skills and employment, happens as early as possible. But Mr Kenney said the Government needed to rethink its procedures and implement ongoing long-term support systems. ""[Former inmates] need support when they get out of prison as well. You can't release someone from prison and put them in a flat and say 'you're on your own'."" He said most prisoners just wanted a fresh start. But a report by the Australian Institute of Criminology, released this year, showed a community resistance in establishing housing options — especially for serious or repeat offenders. Information provided by Corrections Victoria showed some service providers are particularly reluctant because of the ""multiple and complex needs"" of prospective residents. Read more about John Kenney's remarkable personal story. ""They should be trusted. If they're going to prove that to society they should be able to come out [and put their] criminal records behind them and go get a job so they can maintain a living, so they can buy or rent a flat,"" Mr Kenney said. Ms Jefferies said BeyondHousing was making headway in regional Victoria, its success was measured by the number of clients who only use the program once. ""We've been able to successfully work with people on release of prison who've stayed locally. We've been able to link them with support and find long-term housing for them. They've been able to get employment locally and re-establish their lives,"" Ms Jefferies said. ""But we don't just need a Government response, it's a community response. It's around having an awareness that there's limited options for [these] people.""

359,'Taj on Swan' riverside land in Perth under offer for $17 million,house-and-home,"  Oswals' Taj on Swan land under offer for $17 million A block of land on Perth's Swan River, which was once home to the mansion dubbed Taj on Swan, is under offer for $17 million. The Peppermint Grove property was passed in at auction last weekend when bids failed to reach anywhere near the rumoured asking price of $30 million. But, real estate agent Vivien Yap said after ""intense negotiations"" between four parties, the land owned by Indian billionaires Pankaj and Radhika Oswal was now under offer. A price of $17 million has been agreed with a West Australian buyer who wishes to remain anonymous. The 6,600-square-metre parcel of land has been in the headlines for years because of the Oswals' ambitious plan to build a $70 million mansion on the site. The home was to include seven domes, a temple, gym, swimming pool and parking for 17 cars. The partially built mansion was abandoned in 2010 after the couple left the country following the collapse of their ammonia company, Burrup Holdings. The building was demolished in 2016 amid concerns it had become a dangerous eyesore. Ms Yap said the Oswals were ""very happy"" with the final offer and their neighbours were also pleased. ""The neighbours are very pleased to hear that the name Taj on Swan will no longer be in the headlines,"" she said. ""It is the start of a new chapter for the entire streetscape.

360,Taj on Swan super block auction misses the mark,house-and-home,"  Perth's Taj on Swan land passed in at auction as bids fall short of reserve price Perth's most famous block of land, which was once home to the mansion dubbed Taj on Swan, has been passed in at auction. The asking price for the 6,582-square-metre parcel of riverfront land in Peppermint Grove was rumoured to be as high as $30 million, but bids fell way short of that mark. Plenty of curious onlookers gathered at the Bay View Terrace property, which is owned by Indian billionaires Pankaj and Radhika Oswal, but bids were few and far between. Despite that, realtor Vivian Yap and Auctioneer Mack Hall said there had been lots of interest from prospective buyers both local and abroad. ""It's one of the more important properties that we have here in Western Australia … certainly one of the biggest blocks in Peppermint Grove and one of the biggest in Perth,"" Mr Hall said. The auction asking price began at $20 million, with the starting bid coming in at just half of that before being passed in at $15.6 million. There are expected to be further negotiations with the highest bidders. ""If that fails to bring about the sale, we will then we will begin to take expressions [of interest] in individual lots, but that is not desired,"" Mr Hall said. The plot gained significant public attention by the Oswal's ambitious but ultimately futile effort to build their $70 million ""dream home"" on the site. The partially built mansion was abandoned in 2010 after the couple left the country following the collapse of their ammonia company, Burrup Holdings. The couple owed over $100,000 in unpaid rates to the council and the Australian Tax Office froze the land sale as the couple allegedly owed millions in unpaid taxes. The unfinished mansion become a haven for squatters, drugs and illicit parties before the dilapidated property was finally demolished in 2016 after a longstanding battle with Peppermint Grove council.

361,'The little guys really can win': Family wins Castle-style battle to save home from developers,house-and-home,"  Win for the Carters' Castle: Planning Minister tells local council it's dreaming in bid to throw family off land A family whose plight was likened to that of the Kerrigans in Australian movie The Castle have won a battle to keep their land. Five generations of the Carter family have lived at Marong, near Bendigo, for around 100 years, but for more than a decade they've been fighting the local council's attempts to compulsorily acquire 313 hectares of it to create a business park. Earlier this year, the City of Greater Bendigo voted six to two in favour of the acquisition and the decision was left with Victoria's Planning Minister Richard Wynne for final approval. Mr Wynne has now refused the council's request. ""In the absence of any agreement between the parties, the rejection of compulsory acquisition here, I believe, is the right outcome,"" he said. ""The independent panel that assessed this planning scheme amendment by the City of Greater Bendigo indicated that compulsory acquisition was not warranted. ""But the council continued to press and against, obviously, the very clear wishes of the Carter family that their land was not for sale."" Tamrie Carter, who lives in an 1850s former pub located on the land, said the whole family was thrilled by the decision. ""We are still in shock and have some disbelief that it is all really over,"" she said. ""But we are over the moon that good can prevail and the little guys really can win!"" Bendigo Mayor Margaret O'Rourke said the Minister's decision was ""extremely disappointing"". ""This decision will have a significant impact on our thriving advanced local manufacturing sector,"" she said. ""The lack of suitable industrial land remains a serious and pressing issue for Greater Bendigo. Without it we risk losing not just future but existing jobs for our growing population."" Mr Wynne said the State Government would continue to work with the council to find another site for the proposed business park. ""I've advised the CEO that the Victorian Planning Authority wants to work alongside the City of Greater Bendigo to locate an alternative site for the business park and they will consider that request,"" he said.

362,Place making: The simple idea behind giant games and adult playgrounds,house-and-home,"  Place making: The simple idea behind giant games, lots of chairs and adult playgrounds In the world of place making, walkability is paramount and children are described as ""fantastic binding agents"". Dean Cracknell admits it's a wafty term but a simple idea. ""[Place making] is like if you imagine moving into a new home, the whole house is empty and you walk in and work out where everything is going to go,"" he told ABC Radio Perth Focus. ""Place making is about turning a space into a place that people really enjoy, and they want to hang out there with friends and relax."" Mr Cracknell is the chief executive of Town Teams, a not-for-profit organisation that assists West Australian communities to build town centres. ""If you can imagine those beautiful town squares in Europe where people congregate and gather, that is really place making and in some respects we forgot how to do that."" But unlike deciding where to put the sofa and the TV in a new home, often urban place making has more urgent economic demands and involves a lot more furniture. Urban planner Ray Haeren said he regularly worked with large shopping centres that wanted to attract more visitors in a difficult economic climate. ""It's about understanding the way that people shop and work is changing,"" Mr Haeren said. ""If you want to bring people into your centre, you need to have a reason for them to go there. ""Competing with online shopping means that convenience is not going to be the key driver; you need to have an experience. ""It's not just about a place to sit, it's about whether you feel like you belong somewhere."" Mr Haeren said helping redevelop a shopping mall in Perth's northern suburbs meant making it a place to go out, rather than just go to the shops. ""They got in some more food and beverage outlets and a microbrewery, expanded the cinemas and put in bowling, so it became a place to go and recreate and then you might do some shopping while there,"" he said. ""It is not all about getting the chains; you need some bespoke local eateries and that sense of authenticity or it won't connect with the local population."" Universities are also embracing place making to attract students. ""We need a point of difference,"" Hillary Lambert, portfolio manager of place activation at Curtin University, said. ""It's become about recruitment and retention and liveability, and it has transformed the experience that people are having on campus."" Ms Lambert said she started with a food truck program. ""We have 130 different countries where our students are from, so we are tailoring those food types to what people are used to having at home. ""That gives them comfort and belonging and also gets them outside and talking to each other."" The university has also added bean bags outdoors and a giant human billiard table for students to kick a ball around. A sense of fun, with places for people to sit, talk and meet, are a key part of place making. So are giant places to play. Mr Haeren likes playgrounds because ""you get kids but also mothers. People start to meet and interact,"" he said. ""Kids are a fantastic binding agent."" David Snyder, from place making consultancy Spaced Out, has created a large-scale human foosball board that can be set up at street festivals. ""It's something that everyone can do, and it can go anywhere as long as it is flat space,"" Mr Snyder said. For Mr Cracknell, the Town Teams place making work is less about building profit and more concerned with increasing community interaction in town centres. ""You really want to be part of a community and know your local shopkeepers, to relax and see friends,"" he said. ""Everywhere needs to get better and that is where place making comes in. ""It doesn't have to be big or expensive either; often it might just be putting out chairs that are nice to sit in and are under shade."" Listeners to ABC Radio Perth said they most valued the opportunity to interact with people in their community and be closer to nature. Olwyn: ""Having just had a baby and still wanting to get out I have found the walkability of an area is important. I do not think I would have got out and about nearly as much if I wasn't able to walk with the pram to the post office, grocery shop, library. I also find I get to say hello to people along the way and have had more interaction with my neighbours."" Kate: ""I'd love community gardens to come into some of our parks."" Steve: ""I'd like adult playgrounds — basketball/netball half courts right beside the kids playground, bouldering walls."" Craig: ""This fascination with shopping centres and active consumption as recreation is sickening."" It might be simple, but as local high streets struggle with dwindling spending and reduced activity on the street, it's vital, Mr Cracknell said. ""This is not just nice to have, it's something we need to be doing. ""From a local government perspective, it's good for economic development, it's good for healthy communities, it's good for community development.""

363,Hobart losing grip as Australia's most affordable city,house-and-home,"  Hobart real estate is 'hottest in Australia' Hobart is losing grip of its title as Australia’s most affordable city, with the average house price now on par with Adelaide, according to research. The revelation was made by property website realestate.com.au's outlook report for the April quarter. Hobart and the surrounding areas dominate the list of Australia's 10 most sought-after suburbs, with Battery Point, North Hobart, Richmond and inner Hobart all featuring. Hobart's average house price for the April quarter was $470,000, up 19 per cent on the same time last year and by far the biggest increase of any other capital city. Report author and realestate.com chief economist Nerida Conisbee described Tasmania as ""booming"". ""Hobart continues to be red hot,"" she said. ""Tasmania is the hottest market at the moment in Australia, we've certainly never seen this surge in activity,'' she said. ""Hobart's so strong at the moment that we are now expecting the median house price for Hobart to overtake the median house price for Adelaide. ""We can really see that Melbourne is the number one audience for Hobart property and has a strong interest in it. ""When we have a look at the top interstate destinations people from Melbourne are looking at, the number one is Sandy Bay."" The average Hobart property received 10,000 hits on realestate.com, five times more than in since 2013 and double the national average view per property. Jobs growth and very little housing development were the two factors pushing up prices, according to the report. ""While property investors are likely to be a key factor in the price increases, strong growth in rental demand suggests that the market is being supported by people needing a place to live,"" it said. The report showed that in the past 12 months, there had been an increase of almost 50 per cent in online views of properties in Launceston and Devonport. ""What we are seeing is a pretty strong ripple effect in terms of demand in Hobart extending to other parts of the state."" Ms Conisbee said. The report said Launceston had seen the strongest price growth of any local government area in Australia in the past 12 months. And according to the Real Estate Institute of Tasmania (REIT), 2017 was Launceston's best year in the last decade. REIT president Tony Collidge said the report reflected Hobart's market, which is the strongest he has seen in his 26-year real-estate career. ""We're certainly getting multiple offers, we're getting upwards of 30 to 40 enquiries per property and its a very, very buoyant marketplace,"" he said. ""It's really hard to try and price property at the moment because of the strong demand that's out there. ""You put a property on the market for $500,000 and the next thing you're hearing its sold for $575,000, its sold for $550,000.""

364,Why putting your house on the market in spring could damage your chances of a sale,house-and-home," Updated 
    
      July 07, 2018 12:20:44 The real estate market traditionally experiences a lull during winter and picks up in spring when gardens are lush and the sunny weather attracts more buyers to the streets. But is spring really the best time to sell? Real Estate Institute of WA (REIWA) president Hayden Groves said while spring can be a popular time for sellers, it can also mean there is more competition. ""Generally speaking, there's a bit more optimism in the market, you do tend to see a bit of an uptick in sales activity once spring arrives, but it is also at the mercy of broader economic factors,"" Mr Groves said. ""If you are a would-be seller and it is winter, and you're thinking 'perhaps I'll hold off until spring,' you can damage your prospects of getting a great outcome … because suddenly you're in competition with a lot of other like-minded sellers. ""You have this influx of stock coming to market and if the demand from the buyers doesn't follow then you can actually end up over-supplying your market."" REIWA data paints quite a different picture than the common market perception. Sales data shows there have in fact been more house sales in Perth in autumn than any other season for the past five years.   Real estate agents report that home opens are usually quieter during rainy or stormy weekends, but Mr Groves said the wintry weather did not deter serious buyers. ""People tend to hibernate indoors but the genuine buyers are still out in force irrespective of the weather conditions,"" he said. ""But those that are really just entering the market or considering selling and are just looking at comparable stock that's currently on the market to determine the value of their own homes, they tend to stay away when the weather is bad.""  Limnios Property Group sales manager Dominic Ferraro agreed that there was less activity during wet and cold months, but said that could be beneficial. ""Winter is a time when there's less competition. It can be rainy or stormy, but if the property is priced well and it's presented well, the buyers will come,"" Mr Ferraro said. ""The serious buyers will come running to the doors with their umbrellas to see the right property, especially when it's the first time that the property is open."" Both Mr Ferraro and Mr Groves suggest taking advantage of a sunny weekend to hold home opens and auctions if it is an option, but days when major events are held — such as the AFL grand final — should be avoided. Once you've got your selling date sorted, a home's orientation and the sunlight it receives can be a crucial factor in determining the best time to hold a home open. Architect Damien Maxwell said most houses in Australia would benefit from their main living spaces and windows facing north, because in summer the sun passes directly overhead, while in winter those spaces capture as much light and warmth as possible due to the low angle of the sun. ""If you're having a home open and your house does face west or east, you probably want to try to avoid any of those extreme sunlight times which could put buyers off,"" he said. ""So if your house faces west you probably don't want to open up in the afternoon because the space is going to be glary and uncomfortable.  ""It is quite common in WA, because the coast is in the west, there are a lot of houses that face that direction. And you probably notice as you drive along West Coast Highway that all the blinds are closed in the afternoon, so you probably want to avoid that for a home open. ""If your house faces east, you're going to get a lot of direct sun in the morning but people don't tend to be put off by morning sun because the temperatures aren't as hot and it creates a brighter atmosphere."" Mr Maxwell said people who choose to build should give serious consideration to orientation because the right positioning can not only impact the feel of a home, it can also lower energy bills by minimising the need to turn on the heating, air-conditioning and lights during the day. Mr Groves's advice to sellers is to consider which features of their home are most appealing, when choosing the time of year to put it on the market.  ""The older-style properties in the established Perth suburbs that have got north-facing orientation, fire places, those sorts of things, they can be really lovely and cosy during those winter days and you can showcase a home really well in that regard,"" he said. ""And similarly if you were selling in summer, properties that have pools always sell a lot better when the summer months are on. ""As the owner of a property ,when you're thinking about selling it, try to think about the seasons that you enjoy living most in the home.""  Topics:

365,"Inside the eerie, empty 85th floor in Melbourne's tallest building",house-and-home,"  Level 85 of Eureka Tower in Melbourne is still empty, 12 years after building was completed Melbourne's tallest building, the Eureka Tower, was completed 12 years ago but there's still one floor that's as empty as the day the last builder walked off site. Level 85, only seven storeys from the top, is an enormous blank concrete canvas just waiting for a luxurious penthouse to spring up inside its glass perimeter. Metal pipes are still visible running along the ceiling and PVC pipes protrude through the floor. Aside from the enclosed central core of the apartment, which houses the elevator shaft, there are no internal walls. That means there's nothing to block the panoramic views from Port Phillip Bay to the MCG, Royal Botanic Gardens, the CBD skyline, Yarra River and out to the Dandenong Ranges. Architect Karl Fender helped lead the team from Fender Katsalidis which designed the 297-metre building, the second highest in Australia behind the Gold Coast's Q1. He said the 85th floor, still in its raw state, is owned by Melbourne property developer Elias Jreissati, who currently lives just a couple of floors below. ""His apartment was designed for him and his family, but as the family has grown and moved they find themselves in a very big apartment,"" Mr Fender said. ""This apartment has the opportunity to design around a lifestyle which is perhaps not so oriented towards housing family members. ""He no doubt has property in a number of places around Australia and he saw the value in keeping this and not using it to bring income; he didn't need to use it to bring income. ""He's in a privileged position of being able to wait and plan and get it right for the next stage of his life."" The incredible piece of real estate will be open to the public as part of Open House Melbourne on July 28 and 29. The bookable 30-minute visits will allow people to wander around the blank shell and admire the views and dream of their own penthouse lifestyle. ""This is quite unique because not very often does the general public see an apartment space before it has been fitted out,"" Mr Fender said. ""Here you see all the structural elements — you see cantilevered beams so we don't have columns in the apex of the windows, you see the mega columns that take the load of this whole building down to the ground, you see how the core works, how lifting works — before it has all been covered up. ""It's one thing to see a ceiling with lights and other equipment beautifully set out but this is the belly of it all. ""It's all very fascinating stuff I think and people enjoy to see that before it's all covered up."" Mr Fender said walking through the space allowed people to imagine how they would use such a remarkable apartment if it was their own. ""It can be quite intimidating because you look at this space and you think, 'Oh, how would I plan this?'"" he said. ""What it makes you do is interrogate your own view about your own living requirements, what your preference for view and aspect is, and how different spaces can engage with each other. ""There's a lot that goes into the designing of any apartment, but certainly one of a whole floor. ""In smaller apartments it's about efficiency of space, in bigger apartments it's about scaling it so the spaces do feel like home and suit your lifestyle."" To take a peek inside level 85 you must book a tour through the Open House Melbourne website. The first ticket release is on July 13 and the second is July 20.

366,'Worse than the cyclone': Debbie's victims still battling home insurers,house-and-home,"  'Worse than the cyclone': Debbie's victims still battling home insurers It is 15 months since Tropical Cyclone Debbie smashed Mel Deacon's north Queensland home but it's still so badly damaged it is unfit to live in — something she blames on a bitter fight with her insurance company. ""This trauma is way worse than having to deal with the cyclone,"" she told 7.30. ""I'd actually have another cyclone if I could — the frustration of thinking you've bought a product that will protect you, thinking that you'll be treated in a way that's fair and reasonable."" Next week, when the royal commission into financial services begins its fourth round of hearings, Mel Deacon will be watching closely as it investigates the conduct of insurers after Cyclone Debbie. Ms Deacon is calling on the royal commission to make urgent changes to the industry to protect other consumers from what she has had to endure. When 7.30 visited her home in Proserpine this week it was riddled with mould, had widespread water damage and gaps where the roof should be. ""Just watching my house die for 15 months, that's what I've been doing,"" she said. After the cyclone her insurer, Youi, paid to install a tarpaulin over her damaged roof, but Ms Deacon claims it caused more damage when it rained. ""The tarpaulin failed, it didn't fit,"" she said. ""So all the water started coming through and that's what caused extra damage."" Youi refused to fix all of the additional damage and Ms Deacon lodged a dispute with the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). In December, FOS found in her favour, ordering Youi to obtain new quotes to repair additional damage caused due to the failure of the tarpaulin. However, Ms Deacon's lawyer, Nikki Hancock from the Mackay Community Legal Centre, claims Youi failed to comply with the decision. A new dispute has now been lodged with the Ombudsman. ""What they did was get one quotation from one builder which was their cheapest builder they had used the entire time, and they weren't locally based in the Whitsunday area, and they put that sum of money into her account and said the claim was settled,"" Ms Hancock said. Youi has paid Ms Deacon approximately $161,000 and now closed the case, against Ms Deacon's will. Her local Federal Member of Parliament is the LNP's George Christensen. He told 7.30 he was disturbed by the way Youi had handled her case and would be taking it up with them. ""Youi have got a lot of explaining to do and I've heard this repeatedly about Youi,"" he told 7.30. ""To say I'm disappointed is an understatement."" The insurer declined to be interviewed but said in a statement: ""Ms Deacon has stated that she made a complaint against Youi with the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) and, to date, Youi has paid her approximately $161,000 pursuant to her claim. This matter is with FOS and awaiting further determination."" However, she said the actual cost of repairing her home based on a recent quote is more than the $270,000 it was insured for. ""It's really extensive, the actual structure its sagging, the floors have been affected, all the interior walls, it's riddled with mould, so the mould issue is really major,"" Ms Deacon said. ""I've been told, 'Give up Mel, give up it's hurting you, it's hurting your family, it's not worth it', and I just can't afford to give up."" Kristel and Rod Taylor have had a similar struggle against their insurer, Suncorp. Repair work finally got underway at their home near Airlie Beach this week, including on their damaged roof which was at the centre of their claim dispute. The Taylors allege Suncorp used expert assessments to avoid paying to fix their home properly. ""They ended up cutting the scope of works from $34,000 down to about $15,000,"" Kristel Taylor said. ""They rang me straight away and said we're putting the money in your bank account and I said, no, I want my house fixed to the way it was before the cyclone."" They say it was only after their local MP, George Christensen, got involved that Suncorp quickly increased its offer by an additional $100,000. Mr Christensen said it was one of many complaints he'd had about insurers after Cyclone Debbie. ""It shouldn't take coming to a Member of Parliament,"" he told 7.30. ""This is stuff that people are entitled to, they pay a premium, and a whopping premium at that, every single year, more than other Australians pay in North Queensland. ""When it comes time to access what you've been paying for there should be little to no drama whatsoever. ""But in the Taylor's case there's been a lot of it."" Suncorp declined to be interviewed and did not answer any specific questions about the Taylor's claim. In a statement it said it had received 20,000 claims after Cyclone Debbie and conceded it had let some customers down. ""Finalising all insurance claims for a major event of this scale takes time, and we work hard to help our customers recover as quickly as possible,"" a spokesperson said in the statement. ""However, we acknowledge that in a very small number of cases, our processes have let us down. We set high standards for ourselves and we apologise to any customer where our service has fallen short of expectations."" David Keane has decades of experience in the insurance industry and is now a professional advocate for people battling their insurers. He's worked on hundreds of claims from Cyclone Debbie and said while most claims run smoothly too many people in the Mackay and Whitsunday region have insured homes that remain unliveable. ""There'd be dozens (of houses) that I'm aware of, that I'm personally dealing with, and there would be dozens more that I'm personally aware of but not acting on,"" Mr Keane said. ""I would say there are well over 100 people in this area alone who still can't go back to their homes."" He's made a submission to the royal commission alleging some insurers are using expert assessments to unethically drive down the cost of claims beyond what is reasonable. Let's recap the events that led to the Government ending an on-again, off-again debate and announcing a banking royal commission. He acted in one case in the Whitsundays where an insurer initially offered $40,000 before the disputed claim was settled for half a million dollars. ""You have insurance companies who are using their own loss adjustors and in many cases they get the builder to be assessors, to save them a little bit of money again, rather than appointing an external assessor,"" he said. ""The assessor is not truly objective. ""The biggest exclusions in most policies remain pre-existing issues, wear and tear and defects, and so when you read some of these reports regarding consultants or engineers or loss adjustors, they'll focus on every tiny little piece of wear and tear or maybe a tiny little building defect, whether or not it relates to the overall damage, to say, well, that's not covered."" Kristel Taylor is calling for the royal commission to make structural changes to the way insurance claims are handled after natural disasters. ""The assessment process must be independent of insurance companies and of us as customers, that makes it fair for everyone,"" she said. ""Those insurance companies have gone to the model where their building supervisors are the assessors and I think that makes it an unfair system."" ""We went through that cyclone and 33 hours of hell, it's nothing compared to what those insurance companies have put on us,"" Rod Taylor added. ""The stress of the insurance companies, it was worse than the cyclone.""

367,Fears of housing 'fire sale' as interest-only loans roll into full repayment,house-and-home,"  Fears of housing 'fire sale' as interest-only loans roll into principal plus interest As property prices in Australia have climbed over the past few years, thousands of Australians desperate to get a foothold on the property ladder have used interest-only loans. But the interest-only period on these loans doesn't last forever. Over the next three years, interest-only loans worth a combined total of about $360 billion will roll over to interest plus principal — and that means borrowers will face higher repayments. ""The kind of nightmare scenario is where a lot of people need to sell at once, and that's when you see a kind of fire sale mentality, and could see very significant downward pressure on prices,"" said Professor Richard Holden from the University of New South Wales Business School. ""That puts the banks under stress, and their balance sheets under stress, and it could lead to significant financial instability."" A couple of years ago many pundits dismissed the idea of home prices falling significantly across the nation, now the debate is how much they'll fall. Six months ago Professor Holden said there was a risk the Australian housing market could face a US-style meltdown, and he maintains there is a risk that downward pressure on prices could lead to financial instability. According to ABS data released on Tuesday, residential property prices fell 0.7 per cent in the March quarter. Sydney recorded an annual price fall of 0.5 per cent, the first since the March quarter of 2012. Prices in Melbourne dropped 0.6 per cent, the first quarterly fall since the September quarter of 2012. For Queensland farm manager Hugh Mackey, 61, the switch to interest-plus-principal repayments may prove too much. He and his wife tried to build a retirement nest egg, buying two investment properties in the coal mining town of Blackwater in 2008, financed by almost half a million dollars in interest-only loans with ANZ. ""I'm not sure I can retire at 65 the way things are going now,"" he said. The town's rental market has slumped, the houses have halved in value, and Mr Mackey is struggling to meet his loan repayments. ""At the moment, with interest only, we're forking out I think approximately $30,000 a year of our own money, separate to the rental income, to not default on the loans."" Mr Mackey has never missed a payment so far, but this month his loans are switching over to principal-plus-interest. That means he'll have to find another $12,000 every year to cover the mortgages. He is yet to speak to his bank. ""If it gets serious and ugly, I presume they can probably bankrupt me,"" he said. ""I don't want that to happen, but I can't see an easy solution, and in the meantime I want to keep trying to pay the repayments."" Even if he sells both investment properties, he has zero equity and may still owe ANZ about $250,000. He says he regrets ever buying the Blackwater houses. ""It was probably the worst decision I've ever made in my life,"" he says. The Reserve Bank of Australia estimates that a total of $360 billion worth of interest-only loans will roll over to principal-plus-interest in the next three years — for the average borrower that means about $7,000 a year in extra repayments. Professor Holden says that will prove a stretch for many. ""That's a big strain for a lot of people, and in terms of cashflow that's very hard for a lot of people to meet, particularly if they're overstretched,"" he said. At the same time it has become harder to refinance, with banks applying greater scrutiny to people's debts and spending habits. By 2015, interest-only loans had grown to almost 40 per cent of outstanding housing credit in Australia. In March 2017, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority put the brakes on, limiting interest-only lending by the banks to 30 per cent of new home loans. The typical investor loan makes no sense at all given the recent targeted rate hike by the big banks, writes Stephen Letts Earlier this month, official data showed new lending to property investors had fallen to its lowest level in two years. But Australia is still exposed with these types of loans when compared to overseas markets. In the UK, 17.6 per cent of home loans are interest only. In the US, where interest-only loans played a role in the global financial crisis, lenders there have only recently started offering these types of loans again, but with extra safeguards. Heather Shaw and her husband Dave decided on an interest-only loan with ANZ when they bought their five-acre property outside Perth five years ago. It has meant they have been able to afford a much-needed new roof for their house and fencing for their property, while Ms Shaw was able to take time off from her job when her children were young. ""We decided to take interest only so I can take a full 12 months off work without having any sort of financial strain on us,"" she said. Their home loan will roll over to principal plus interest later this year, and their $1,900 monthly repayments will increase by about a quarter. ""This is a strategic move for us, we've planned for this,"" she said. Ms Shaw is returning to work, and she and her husband are already making extra repayments on their loan.

368,"WA couple escape mortgage trap by building dirt dome for less than $40,000",house-and-home,"  Earth bag building: WA couple builds dome for less than $40,000 to escape mortgage trap Dismayed by the costs of home ownership in Australia, a West Australian couple is building their castle out of earth bags to escape the mortgage trap. The unconventional technique involves building dome-shaped structures out of bags filled with earth and held together with barbed wire. Kate and Scott Ryan-Taylor, from Kendenup in WA's Great Southern, made the decision to build with earth bags after realising the conventional path to home ownership was too costly. ""We'd be in debt up to our eyeballs until we're 70 or 80,"" Mrs Ryan-Taylor said. ""We want to be able to have a place we can afford. ""We don't want to be retiring and then have no time to enjoy this place."" The couple estimate their home will cost less than $40,000 to build, and have invited volunteers from across Australia to stay on their 27-acre property and help with the construction. In exchange, volunteers learn firsthand how to build with earth bags. ""Within 10 years we should be pretty much debt free,"" Mr Ryan-Taylor said. ""We had to get a mortgage for the land of course, but other than that we don't owe any other money. ""The only way we can [live the life we want] is to build something that were not going to be paying off for 50 years. ""We'll be finished paying for this by the time it's built."" Earth bags are a little-known building material favoured by alternative lifestyle seekers for their low cost and environmental sustainability. After deciding against commonplace building methods, Mr and Mrs Ryan-Taylor realised they had a cost-free building material right beneath their feet. The bags are filled with a combination of sand, clay and gravel and laid in rows like bricks to build the walls of the dome-shaped structure. ""The easiest way to explain it is similar to rammed earth, but you're actually putting [the earth] inside the bag itself and [laying it] to form the wall,"" Mrs Ryan-Taylor said. ""You're filling up the equivalent of 40-kilogram feedbags and tamping it into shape on each layer. ""You put layers of barbed wire in between, which holds the two layers together … and slowly work your way up. ""From the bottom rows, we'll start moving in to create a dome shape. ""So the walls and the roof are essentially the same thing."" Mr and Mrs Ryan-Taylor described their home as Australia's first earth-bag home to receive full council approval for residential purposes. The couple purchased the original plans for their earth bag home from a US website, and then spent months studying building codes to ensure the original design met Australian standards. ""I found every little exception right down to the ways that the doors are facing,"" Mrs Ryan-Taylor said. ""We had to look at everything, from the energy efficiency to bushfire safety, an engineer to sign off on the foundations and structural integrity of the building, and a building surveyor to do a certified design compliance."" The couple said they dealt with plenty of scepticism along the way. ""To get to that point, we actually had to educate nearly every single [authority] about earth-bags,"" Mrs Ryan-Taylor said. ""The exception being the engineer, who had dealt with similar types of buildings in the UK."" After two years and several compromises on the original design concept, Mr and Mrs Ryan-Taylor had met Australia building codes and received full council approval. ""We actually had to get an expert review to show that this would hold temperature and be energy efficient … even though it's been proven that [earth bag homes] stay 21-24 degrees all year round."" The couple planned to continue construction on their home at a cracking pace, with more volunteers expected to arrive in Kendenup every Saturday for the next six weeks. ""I was managing to get one row of bags done every week or two,"" Mr Ryan-Taylor said. ""We're going to get one or even two done today alone."" Mrs Ryan-Taylor said in exchange for their time, volunteers learned how to cut through council red tape and saw how to build their own earth-bag home. She said the technique offered a path to a debt-free future. ""We've spent a couple of years going through the red tape and process, but in the end we're going to have something that we love and its going be really different,"" she said. ""Down the track, we won't be working full-time, because we will be paid off. ""So we can be semi-retired, if not getting an income from this place. ""We're not going to be burnt out and never able to enjoy our land. ""We're actually going to be able to retire in our forties or early fifties and enjoy life.""

369,"No property, no possessions, no problems. How full-time house sitters live for free",house-and-home,"  No rent, no mortgage, and no bills means financial freedom for full-time house sitters No property, no possessions, no problems. Chris and Rachel Bragg don't have a home to call their own, and they couldn't be happier. The 31-year-olds are putting off home ownership for now, and turning their back on rentals, to live around Australia as full-time house sitters. Stays can be as short as a couple of days up to a month or even longer. It's beneficial for both them and home owners — they're not paid but the Braggs get a roof over their heads for as long as the owner is away, and the home owner has the peace of mind knowing their place is being looked after, and save money on putting their pets in accommodation. When one stint ends, they load up the car with some essentials and head to their next four-week stay somewhere else. They're good enough at it that they have no need for a home of their own — they're able to jump from booking to booking, with occasional gaps in between spent staying with family or off on a holiday of their own. When you're not paying rent or mortgage, and don't have to worry about rates, internet, gas, or electricity bills, the savings are incredible. ""It's about $22,000 a year we can put away easily without even cutting down,"" Ms Bragg said. ""We travel quite a lot and happily to go out for dinner and do those other things as well."" The Braggs got into house sitting about two years ago when they found themselves paying two lots of rent while Mr Bragg was on placement for university. ""We thought, maybe there's another way,"" Ms Bragg said. ""We've been house sitting for a particular person each year at Christmas time, when we were renting a place. So we thought, 'Why don't we try do this full time?'."" When they realised they wouldn't go back to the way things were any time soon, they sold off the fridge, furniture, and a bunch of other possessions. ""It was weird initially, but now it's just normal life for us,"" Ms Bragg said. Since then they've stayed in just about every type of property from small cottages right up to mansions. Earlier this year they even had their first overseas house sit in the Gibbston Valley in New Zealand. They're currently two weeks into a month-long stay at a property close to the beach on the Gold Coast, and they've got their stays sorted through to the end of the year. But they say house sitting isn't for everyone. ""You definitely have to be a certain type of person. We're homebodies, but we're not too fussed on where the home is,"" Ms Bragg said. ""I know people want their house, their stuff, their everything, but we're pretty relaxed and cruisy so it doesn't really worry us."" So what makes the Braggs so popular as house sitters? Well they both have their own businesses they can run from home, so they're able to spend more time on the property. They've got glowing references from home owners they've dealt with in past. And they love animals. ""Don't do it unless you love animals, unless you're 100 per cent there for the animals and love them and cherish them, don't bother,"" Ms Bragg said. ""We've had cats, dogs, turtles, fish, horses, sheep, and a couple of cows. ""They [animals] can keep you up all night some times, but we generally are just animal lovers. It doesn't bother us but I know some people … might be super clean … and don't want a 50 kilogram slobbery dog all over them."" It's got to the point where they're able to pick and choose where they want to go next. ""We originally just went with whatever, but now that we've been doing it a bit longer we're only going to locations we want to go do."" The Braggs plan to give up the house sitting lifestyle in the next two to three years and settle down with a place of their own. Jo Herbert never saw herself as the house sitter type. But that changed when she and husband David Couton rented out their New Zealand home and came to Australia in 2016 for a year's stay in Brisbane. Not wanting to impose on family for 12 months, and not wanting to commit to a rental property, they opted for house sitting. They liked it, and they've since extended their time in Queensland so they can keep doing it. ""It's a really amazing way to live. And I never ever thought I'd be a house sitter. It's like an itinerant lifestyle, but also it's like an adventure,"" Ms Herbert said. ""There are times we look at each other and we say, 'Our lifestyle is just weird'. ""I don't think it's for everyone, but having said that I never thought I'd be able to do it and I love it."" She said she knows what it's like to be a homeowner and have house sitters over, having had friends care for their home in the past. ""It's nice to know that your house is being lived in and looked after and your animals are at home and they're happy,"" she said. Unlike the Braggs, Ms Herbert and her husband both have part-time jobs based between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, so any homes they care for have to be close by. Ms Herbert said house sitting duties can vary from property to property, but if animals are around they're the number-one priority. ""We've looked after a range of animals. You walk, feed them, cuddle them. It's pretty much how we'd treat our animals at home,"" she said. ""You look after the place like it's your own, sometimes there's a bit of gardening, mowing the lawn, scooping leaves off pools. ""If someone's away for any length of time they may ask us to start their car up and run them for a little while."" They also take the time to meet home owners before committing to a stay. ""That's for several reasons. It gives them a chance to meet us, suss us out, and see us interact with their animals, and it gives us a chance to make sure we'll feel safe and OK."" Ms Herbert said house sitting was a money saver for themselves and the homeowners. ""They can have their animals looked after in their own home and they save a heap of money on kennels,"" she said. But there are some downsides being a full-time house sitter. ""You don't ever get to establish yourself in a suburb. I quite like to join groups and do things like that, or go to the gym somewhere, but the next stay you're miles and miles away,"" she said. ""At the beginning of the year I had unexpected surgery and I was in a house sit after I came out of hospital and that was horrible, I just wanted my own home and my own bed. ""Sometimes you just think it'd be nice to be at home, but that's rare. While the positives keep outweighing the negatives, we'll keep doing it."" Kylie Fuad, who co-founded house sitting website Aussie House Sitters, said the key to becoming a successful house sitters is to make yourself stand out from the crowd as much as possible. Aussie House Sitters, which has been running since 2004, connects home owners with house sitters, and vice versa. Those wanting to house sit have to pay an annual membership fee, but it's free for homeowners. Her top tip for anyone looking at getting into house sitting — get some endorsements. ""If you're a newbie get references from people that show that you have experience with taking care of animals or a property, even a referee from a landlord who you've rented from … sometimes that can be really helpful,"" Ms Fuad said. ""Definitely house sit for friends and family to get experience, and get them to write something. ""Home owners will really look for someone who … even when you meet them and you seem good, most owners will still want to see some references to make them feel assured. If you're really serious about it, consider getting a police check. ""If you're looking to do a lot of house sitting sometimes it's not a bad investment because some house sits can be very competitive, especially depending on the locations,"" Ms Fuad said. ""And it just means it's something else that you can say you have, and again when people try to choose a house sitter and it's competitive, if you've got police clearance and the other person doesn't, you're probably more likely to get the job."" Ms Fuad said having a good sitter profile with a photo and write up that was ""professional but also friendly and warm"" also goes a long way. Also, don't be afraid to specify what kind of house sitting experience you're after. ""You might not want to live in a very expensive home where the level of house keeping expected is quite high, or you might like a house where [there is] just one cat,"" she said. ""It's good to find what the right balance is for you, then you're going to be able to apply for jobs you like, and you're more likely to be really successful."" Ms Fuad said there are those who get paid to house sit because they offer a specialised service, such as high-level animal care. ""Mostly it's people house sitting in return for free accommodation, unless if there's a lot of work involved, usually the owner will agree to pay the sitter something,"" she said. ""But there's definitely potential for it to become a job if it's something you're really passionate about and really good at.""

371,How to explain homelessness to children,house-and-home,"  How to talk to your children about homelessness in a way they understand Whether it is walking past someone living rough on the streets or seeing it through the news, it is only a matter of time before your children are exposed to the issue of homelessness. The question is: how do you explain this complicated and often misunderstood social issue to your children? It is a problem Maria Marshall faced when her six-year-old daughter began asking questions after she heard at school about a person who was homeless. ""It was a very direct question, 'Why do people become homeless?' and we tried to answer that in an honest but age-appropriate fashion,"" Ms Marshall said. ""So we talked about [how] a lot of people who are experiencing homelessness have experienced adversity throughout their developmental years."" Ms Marshall said talking about issues like family violence and housing affordability in a child-friendly way was difficult but useful. ""We're really honest with the kids about that,"" she said. ""We really try to foster a sense of compassion; rather than just seeing them as homeless people, understanding the story behind each individual, what they've been through [and] how they've ended up there."" A Victorian parliamentary inquiry has found that children make up 30 per cent of the 82,000 people waiting for public housing in the state. The waiting list is growing by 500 people every month. More than 100,000 Australians are homeless and they live in virtually every part of the country. Yet issues like housing affordability, the rental market, and other contributing factors to homelessness can be difficult for adults to understand let alone children. Monica Thielking from Swinburne University's Department of Psychological Sciences said while some homeless people may behave antisocially, it is important that children do not learn to blame them. ""More often than not their cirumstances are mostly the result of somebody else's bad choices, such as being exposed to family violence or having a history of abuse,"" Dr Thiekling said. ""These people have often not had the love and care that people need growing up, and this can cause people to feel bad about themselves and make bad choices, or not cope with normal everyday things like working or school. ""Parents can gauge how much their children can understand, and younger children do not need to be told about all the reasons that can cause a person to be homeless, which can be beyond their comprehension or even inappropriate for young children to know about."" Dr Thielking said when it is appropriate to do so, simple interactions with homeless people on the street can set a good example for children. ""Teaching by example such as smiling and saying hello or providing opportunities for children to interact in a safe and positive way. ""Like for example buying the Big Issue and stopping to chat with the vendor, or fundraising for a homeless service at school can teach children about the humanity behind the ‘scary’ images that they are seeing both on the streets and in the media. ""Although homeless people who are sleeping rough may look scary, they are still people who deserve to be treated with dignity and respect."" Chief executive of the Council to Homeless Persons, Jenny Smith, said common perceptions that homelessness was caused solely by substance abuse and mental illness were not accurate. Ms Smith said that many homeless people might not be living on the streets, but instead could be couch surfing or staying in temporary accommodation. ""People have to leave home because they've been hurt by someone they trust or [because of] housing affordability, which we can talk about [with children] as when there are not enough houses that people can afford to live in,"" Ms Smith said. ""It isn't about the failings of the individual. ""In the current circumstances, if you're on a low income and you get an unexpected health problem, you have an unexpected relationship breakdown, if you have to leave because of family violence, than you're really going to struggle to be able to obtain housing,"" she said. Ms Smith said using homelessness as an example to children of what would happen if they did drugs or did not go to school would promote fear rather than empathy and compassion. Instead she encouraged people to think, ""This is someone who is not that different from me, who is just like me, who sometimes made some poor choices at the time, but had a set of circumstances that led them into homelessness and wow, that could happen to me"". ""I think we need more programs in schools to do that,"" she said. Ms Marshall's daughter, Indy, and a group of her friends at St James' Parish School in Ballarat in Victoria's Central Highlands are running a fundraiser to support the homeless people in their area. The group are organising a garage sale to raise money for the local soup bus, which is a mobile kitchen that serves food to people living on the streets of Ballarat. ""They [the homeless] don't have money and they don't have a job, [and] some have disabilities and stuff, so it makes it hard for them to stay in a home,"" Indy said. ""It's actually quite sad to see them because they're cold and when it's cold that's the worse time to be homeless."" Her 10-year-old brother Isaac became concerned about homelessness and donated some of his own pocket money after seeing people living on the streets of Melbourne. ""I already have some pocket money but other people might not have pocket money and I don't think I really need it as much as other people do because I've already got a house,"" he said. Isaac said that while seeing some homeless people could be confronting he still wanted to help in any way he could. ""Sometimes they will look a bit scary because they're dirty but I don't think that's really their fault,"" he said. ""The sad thing is that I can't help them at the time.""

372,Victorian builder is creating Australian-first energy efficient housing development,house-and-home,"  Victorian builder chasing 10-star energy rated homes to give residents greener options A Victorian builder has his sights set on making Australian homes greener and more energy efficient than ever before with a landmark new development project that has seen him honoured with a medal on the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours list. Wodonga's Brendon Collins is aiming to develop Australia's first 10-star energy rated homes in a medium density development. So far Australia is home to just 14 accredited 10-star energy efficient homes, which are all free-standing — and none so far have been available to purchase ready-built or off the plan, as with Mr Collins' new homes. Mr Collins is hoping the seven homes he has designed for Wodonga's Elmwood medium density development will increase the total and make up a third of Australia's top energy homes, if the design meets the criteria under the Federal Government's Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme. The scheme looks at elements including orientation, layout, insulation and glazing, and construction materials. Most new houses in Australia have to meet a minimum six-star rating. The 115 homes at Mr Collins' Elmwood development currently range from seven to 8.5 star energy ratings, but he said it has taken years of planning to try and meet 10 stars. ""We haven't done it yet, but for the last five years we've working hard to achieve that,"" Mr Collins said. ""Trialling a lot of different building methods, it's obviously technical when you get to that level of building."" Most elements of a 10-star home have to be constructed differently from that of a lower energy rated house — from pouring slabs differently, creating special walls and roof design, to triple-glazing the windows and installing batteries and solar panels. ""The development has required close collaboration with the Wodonga council, and is being monitored by up to 60 architects, as they look at ways to achieve a greener and more sustainable future,"" Mr Collins said. ""It's very hard to achieve that status, it's why it's not done. ""We're hoping to be the first to do that in Australia, to have a 10-star off-the-shelf [home] that you can purchase."" After the years of development, Mr Collins said he is now within weeks of knowing if his plan will be signed off as 10-star. While Mr Collins said there is not an overwhelming demand for 10-star energy rated houses, he believes they are going to be a big part of the future. ""We're just building a model for the future,"" he said. ""You just need population, people who will buy them — and someone as crazy as I am to push it."" The design has led to Mr Collins being awarded a medal in the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours list.

374,opinion: What we learned from Australia's foreign real estate investment boom,house-and-home,"  Australia's foreign real estate investment boom looks to be over. Here are five things we learned Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) reported this week that foreign residential real estate approvals dropped significantly in the 2016-17 period. Whereas 2015-16 saw 40,149 approvals granted, totalling $72.4 billion, the figure for the following year was just 13,198 approvals, totalling $25.2 billion. On these numbers, the foreign property investment boom looks to be over. This is bad news for the property and financial industries, who are already feeling the pressure of weak household income growth, tighter lending restrictions on local borrowers, and a slowing in housing market activity in key Australian cities. FIRB suggests that declining demand from China is a factor in the overall decline in overseas approvals. Chinese demand may have been weakened by a range of factors, including the new FIRB application fees, Chinese overseas direct investment capital controls, and the changing global economy. But if the cycle is moving from boom towards bust, we have learned several things along the way. In 2014 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics undertook an inquiry into foreign investment in residential real estate. It acknowledged the growing public disquiet about the level of this foreign investment, adding that: … there is no accurate or timely data that tracks foreign investment in residential real estate. No one really knows how much foreign investment there is in residential real estate, nor where that investment comes from. Four years on, FIRB is still flagging the limitations of data collection and analysis. Without fine-grained data, it's hard to forecast how much, if at all, the injection of foreign capital can push up local house prices. The latest figures come with a caveat. The approvals data represent potential investment, rather than actual investment. There are key differences between the two. Potential investors might, for example, seek approval for multiple properties while only intending to buy one of them. We need the government to collect more extensive and detailed data on individual foreign real estate investment, and make it publicly available. This needs to cover more than approvals data at the city level, but data on investment levels in neighbourhoods or even individual housing developments. One of Australia's leading property analysts has changes his 2018 Sydney housing forecast from price gains to falls. Data from Sydney reveals widespread concern about foreign investment. Almost 56 per cent of Sydneysiders believed foreign investors should not be allowed to buy residential real estate there. Only 17 per cent of respondents in our study thought the government's regulation of foreign housing investment was effective. Just over half of Sydneysiders say they would not want Chinese investors buying properties in their suburb. And 78 per cent thought foreign investment was driving up housing prices in greater Sydney. Yet those who have real estate investments were more likely to support foreign investment than those who don't. This suggests that Sydneysiders with equity in the housing market, such as homeowners or investors, might view foreign buyers pushing up housing values as positive. And they might fear that the new decline in foreign investment might depress their assets. When Chinese real estate investment started to rise significantly in 2013-14, property developers scrambled to model this new emerging market. The real estate media rushed to map out where Chinese investors were keenest to buy, and how best to design and market property developments to this new foreign client base. In early 2012, Larry Schlesinger quoted the demographer Bernard Salt as saying: The growing numbers of Chinese and Indian migrants in Australia means property investors need to consider the cultural sensitivity of the residential property they purchase to ensure they maximise the resell value. Between 2013 and 2017, property developers, both local and foreign, regularly contacted me to ask if I had any up-to-date research on foreign investors' consumer preferences and market forecasts. I did not. But there was no shortage of advice out there, covering everything from feng shui-informed housing design to the key needs of foreign university students. Some global real estate agents suggested to their clients that they could buy an Australian home to accommodate their child while they were studying at an Australian university, and then use the capital gain from the property sale to pay back the tuition fees. Many property developers were formulating medium- to long-term development pipelines that included the foreign capital and consumer preferences of foreign investors. It is unclear, now, whether much of this housing stock will ever be built. If it is, will it suit the changing future needs of our cities, or address our ongoing housing affordability problems? In other words, what sorts of properties will be left as the legacy of the recent foreign real estate investment mania? We need to take care not to conflate domestic Chinese-Australian buyers with international Chinese investors. Much of the media coverage of the new report features stereotyped images of Asian families buying an Australian home. But given the foreign investment rules and logistics involved, these pictures are far more likely to depict Chinese-Australians than foreigners. Understanding the long-term migration and education plans of the investors is important too. Different investor groups will interact with the city in different ways, and their impact on society can be vastly different too. For example, super-rich absentee investors will have a different impact on neighbourhood life compared with that of middle-class migrants or international students. If the Federal Government wants to court foreign investment, then better education about the possible risks and benefits of individual foreign real estate investment is needed. Our research suggests that the Government's pro-foreign investment stance must be accompanied with strategies to protect intercultural community relations in Australia. In 1982, Maurice Daly wrote in his classic book Sydney Boom, Sydney Bust that the: … fluctuation in property prices recorded for Sydney have been caused by the forces linking the city to the Australian economy and to the remainder of the world. Daly charted the influx of foreign people and capital into Sydney between 1850 until 1981, as wealth was channelled through the financial services sector and into urban real estate. Along the way, he observed that one ""group to attract the abuse of the general population were the Chinese"". Domestic and foreign real estate investment have long been connected to the financial services industries, and the built environment is central to creating and storing surplus capital. Australian cities continue to be heavily influenced by global money today. A key lesson is that domestic and foreign housing booms, bubbles and busts are thus better understood as cycles within our housing and financial system, rather than as a set of short-term ruptures to this system. We need to think about the collective impacts of domestic and foreign real estate investment over the long-term in our cities if we are serious about addressing housing inequality.

375,Houseboats may be the ultimate way to downsize your home,house-and-home,"  Houseboats may be the ultimate way to downsize the family home and enjoy travel at the same time Thanks to tiny houses and micro apartments, the trend towards downsizing homes is gaining momentum in Australia, but would you live on a houseboat? Not only do houseboats offer a compact, flexible lifestyle, but they are free of many of the costs and regulations associated with owning a traditional bricks and mortar home, including council rates and strata agreements. And some are even smaller than tiny designer homes, which allow their owners to free up debt, spend more time with community outside of their own four walls, and travel. But when your backyard is a swimming pool and you do not need to pack up to move on, are there any downsides to living on a houseboat rather than in a traditional home? That was the question Cathy Ann Kruger wanted answered when she took to social media to find out whether she and her partner should take the plunge, given they spent all their free time at the river. Advice was offered that she should consider the availability of permanent moorings, maintenance, greywater and sewage disposal, and even the wash from wakeboard boats in summer. But perhaps the great tale of caution was from 2015 when a Riverland woman made headlines after being left homeless, broke and facing heavy penalties when her houseboat sank along the River Murray. Others said it was the best decision they had ever made. A lack of liquidity could drown investors when Australia's booming east coast real estate markets turn, writes Michael Janda. Rodney West has been living on his houseboat for 25 years. His vessel definitely wears the micro-living badge, with just 57 square metres of living under the roof. Mr West built it himself, drawing on his experience in the boating industry. Together with two other houseboat dwellers he bought a parcel of riverfront land at Lyrup, downstream of Renmark in SA. This allows him to permanently moor his vessel along a stunning stretch of the River Murray, while keeping a vehicle, shed, chooks and vegetable patch on his adjacent land. ""It's cheaper than a shack and I can build it myself, and if you don't like where you are you can just move on,"" Mr West said. ""I've travelled the length of the river a couple of times. It keeps me off the streets."" His boat is humble compared to some of the modern commercial houseboats, with their rooftop spas, expansive glass windows and many bedrooms. ""This is the first one I built. I've built half a dozen since then,"" Mr West explained. Like many who call a houseboat home, he enjoys being self-sufficient and living off the grid. A cosy pot belly fire keeps him warm during the cold winter months on the river, when temperatures at night can drop several degrees below freezing. But in summer his boat can become an oven, with the lack of air-conditioning making it hard to cool down. ""I open a window and luckily I've got a swimming pool out the back door,"" Mr West said. Despite his alternative lifestyle, Mr West does not feel isolated. He volunteers with his local Country Fire Service brigade, stays in touch with friends and family on social media, and is connected with fellow river users. ""I know all the boats that come past,"" he said. The experienced river-hand has no plans of moving into a bricks and mortar house. ""Who would want to live like that, cheek by jowl with everybody else?"" he said. ""How am I going to improve myself by selling up here and moving? This is it, they will take me out boots first."" Further downstream at a marina near the Berri Bridge are Steve Kitto and Joanne Seaton. The retired couple has lived on a custom-built houseboat for the past six years. After previously living on a catamaran Mr Kitto had built himself, the pair moved to the Riverland region to be closer to family. They love the freedom that living on the river offers. ""We just chuff across to the hotel over there in the dingy. Whenever we can avoid driving we just take the boat somewhere,"" Ms Seaton said. They agree that houseboat living requires a more minimalistic approach to possessions. ""You can't have four wardrobes full of clothes, but you've still got plenty of room for clothes and we've got two bathrooms, two toilets,"" Mr Kitto said. The couple said during high water events, they simply moored further up the bank. ""It's great when we get a flood or high water as we did a couple years ago. It's basically a long reservoir at the moment,"" Mr Kitto said. ""We just moved further up the bank, but we had a contingency plan to tie to higher trees and just bring the dinghy down. ""If we get to the top of the trees we are in trouble!"" The apartment blocks soaring above capital cities look like heading into oversupply, and that means prices will fall. Buying a houseboat is not like a bricks and mortar investment. They are more like a car in that they are expected to depreciate in value over time. This was one of the considerations for Lin and Ron Davison when they moved onto a custom-built houseboat at the start of the year. At 110 square metres of living area their boat, Linny's Tinny, is less than half the size of an average new build in Australia, according to a CommSec study. Yet they believe it offers them the perfect lifestyle for their retirement. ""How else can you get a location like this?"" Mr Davison said, gesturing at the river just outside his kitchen window. Mr Davison said living on a houseboat required an active lifestyle, with owners needing to be capable of pumping out greywater and effluent, and doing regular maintenance. They store rainwater for drinking, filter river water for laundry and bathroom needs, and generate and store power from solar panels on the boat. The couple paddles their kayaks every morning and enjoy the freedom of being able to travel the river. ""You can't beat waking up to this view, and in the evenings some of the sunsets are stunning, particularly when you move up the river,"" Ms Davison said. And if they want to go on a holiday, they do not need to worry about packing. ""Freedom, you can just untie and go, take everything with you,"" Ms Davison said. Which is why, after all the advice, Ms Kruger has decided that when the opportunity arises and she can secure the right boat, she is going to give the dream of living on a houseboat a go.

376,Schoolgirls turn big idea into tiny house,house-and-home,"  Ambitious Canberra school girls turn big idea into tiny house It's little more spacious than a caravan, but it is affordable, transportable, has a small environmental footprint and is all the rage. The tiny house under construction at Canberra Girls Grammar is the result of a collaborative class project idea from a group of Year 11 students. STEM teacher Murray Mckay said he was taken by surprise when they suggested building a house last year. ""The girls investigated the tiny house movement in light of housing affordability issues and the idea their generation might never be able to afford their own houses,"" he said. ""So we created a number of cut-off dates to make sure building a tiny house was achievable in our timeframe."" The group's 10 students are dedicated, meeting in school holidays and before and after school hours. Felicity Paterson said each of the students had brought something different to the project. ""We appointed an architect, a project manager, an innovation manager and a marketing consultant,"" she said. For Lily Simatupang, the experience has left her inspired to explore a career in architecture. ""We got to meet with some actual architects which was very useful for considering how we would power the house,"" she said. ""We've really learnt how much time goes into something like this. ""We've had to refine our plans so many times, with so many drafts and so many redraws."" And while the students have designed the tiny house with the idea of making it liveable, they're expecting it will be furnished as a cafe to keep on site at school. ""Our space is liveable to a certain extent,"" Lily said. ""We don't have a bathroom in there, but if we did, then yeah it'd be great to live in."" The micro-home fascination across Australia has grown in recent decades out of a need for affordable housing. ""It's really affordable, there's less heating required, so in turn your energy bill is going to go so much further down,"" Felicity said. ""Obviously we don't have a toilet, but if we did there'd be a lot less water required than for a typical house and a lot less piping in the walls. ""There's also a lot less maintenance needed to be done. ""If you need to move cities and you couldn't afford to live there, well you'd just take your house with you and you wouldn't even have to pack."" Drawings for the completed house include a kitchen, living room and mezzanine bedroom. ""It would be a reasonable size home for two,"" student Emily Chiew said. ""We didn't just want it to be functional but for it to look beautiful as well.""

377,'Six weeks to lose it all':  The shocking reality of sudden homelessness,house-and-home,"  Graham Lee's on a mission to unite crisis services in regional Australia It only took six weeks for Graham Lee's life to unravel. He was running a business on the Mid North Coast in New South Wales, employing a small team of people. ""I was working six days a week, 14-hour days, providing for my family,"" he said. ""We had a beautiful home in Bonny Hills that we built, overlooking the ocean. ""I drove away from that house with a ute, some work tools and $1000 after 25 years of hard work."" Mr Lee said his business collapsed after a few bad decisions five years ago. He didn't know what kind of support he could access, so at the age of 53, he found himself homeless. He lived in his car, a tent and at one point, a shipping container. ""There was a few dark times in that period, going from a successful lifestyle, to losing it all,"" he said. The experience inspired Mr Lee to help other people going through the same situation. ""You only fail when don't get back up, if you keep getting back up you haven't failed,"" he said. Mr Lee started a charity called Community @ 3, that helps people find crisis accommodation as quickly as possible, and provides food and other essential items. He said he was frustrated by the lack of services in regional Australia, and how difficult and bureaucratic it can be to find help. ""I got a phone call one day from a friend coming back from Queensland, he had stopped in Coffs Harbour and found a man living rough in the Maccas' carpark,"" he said. ""I didn't have any contacts [for crisis accommodation] in Coffs, the only people I could find said the man didn't qualify for emergency accommodation because he was from Western Australia. ""It really irked me, here's someone saying you have to qualify for shelter and warmth; just put him in there and sort it out later."" According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there were 320 homeless people in Coffs Harbour at the time of the 2016 Census. The charity organisation, St Vincent De Paul reports there are about 2,000 homeless people in its catchment area on the NSW Mid North Coast, between Tweed Heads and Port Macquarie. Senior Pastor at the Camden Haven Anglican Church Nathan Killick is working with Mr Lee to grow Community @ 3. ""Graham is a stubborn sort of guy, but that's his strength [he sees] barriers and just gets through them."" On June 21, Mr Lee will be hosting a meeting in Port Macquarie to discuss ideas with members of the community, and to try and get the ball rolling to build crisis accommodation in towns and cities across the region. He has invited members of local government and other charities in the region to attend. ""A little voice doesn't get heard, but if the organisations could get together, that's an army,"" he said. ""It only took six weeks for me to go from making my family happy, to losing it all."" Mr Lee said his goal is to grow Community @ 3. He has found accommodation with a young couple, renting out the garage in their home at Laurieton, about a 30-minute drive from Port Macquarie. For now, Mr Lee will continue to appeal to local councils around NSW to adopt the Community @ 3 program; forming small teams of volunteers that help sort through all the services avaliable and find crisis accommodation in the area. But he has got bigger dreams than that as well. ""I'm a very skilled person in the building game, it will happen; I will get my business back up and I will employ the people that are homeless, and give them an opportunity to get back into society.""

378,The secrets of a stately $50m Sydney home,house-and-home,"  Sydney real estate: Tresco trophy home's high-society stories match $50m price tag It's special, even by Sydney's sparkling standards — designed by a celebrity architect, in a blue-chip location with bedrooms to burn. Tresco, a stately sandstone home which dates to 1868, has stood the test of time on its original Elizabeth Bay site as the Harbour City exploded around it. It's also on the market for $50 million — more on that later — but the 150 years of high society stories this Victorian manor and its cascading gardens hold are priceless. Tresco was owned by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and used as the official residence for senior officers for almost 100 years until it was bought privately in 2004. While it has served as the scene of many glittering gatherings, its most famous visitor was in 1986 when Prince Philip was the guest of honour at the RAN's 75th birthday celebrations. For Sydney's society, Tresco's fabled parties — or ""at homes"" as they were known — were among the hottest invitations in town. They were a chance for naval bigwigs and their wives to hobnob with government officials and international diplomats. Newspapers gushed with details of flower arrangements and table decorations after every soiree or afternoon tea. Those descriptions were perhaps only surpassed in colour by the breathless recounts of guestlists and what they were wearing. But not everything always went to plan, and on Friday, October 1, 1937, a party for ""senior service"" was in full swing on the HMAS Penguin, and many of the highest-profile guests were assembling at Tresco, preparing to make the journey. However, the weather was deemed too bad to attempt the short journey, so the party had to stay on land. Meanwhile, those who made it to the ship were making the most of a very damp situation. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald revealed ""strenuous efforts"" to protect the decks from the rain with tarpaulins failed, with guests dancing ""anywhere that a dry spot could be found"". ""The most effective wet weather outfit was worn by Mrs G. I. D. Hutcheson, who covered her black gown and white coat with a transparent cellophane red riding hood cloak,"" the report said. It was not just adults having fun at Tresco. A report in The Daily Telegraph detailed how the mansion was ""practically given over to the small people"" for a children's party in July 1923. ""Potato races, slipper races, musical chairs (with prizes) for all, followed by tea served in the billiards room filled the hours very happily for the little ones,"" the report said. Some of the best parties were held by Jean Alison Showers — the wife of Rear Admiral Henry Arthur Showers — who lived at Tresco in the early 1950s. At one in November 1953 the manor's dining room was decked out to celebrate a Thanksgiving meal for high society. In contrast to the official RAN crockery and ceremonial stuffiness of such occasions, the Sydney Morning Herald noted a daring nautical-themed centrepiece of driftwood festooned with trailing ivy and red hibiscus. Tresco was built for entertaining and, in that respect, not much has changed in the past century and a half. The original fireplaces and towering ceilings are dominant features in its formal dining rooms and lounge rooms, while bay windows show off the stunning harbour views, particularly in the family room. Two renovated kitchens make catering for large parties easy, and more recently, part of what would have originally been stables has been converted into a large wine cellar. The heritage-listed house was designed by leading architect Thomas Rowe, who was responsible for several landmark buildings in NSW, including Newington College in Stanmore and Sydney Hospital in Macquarie Street. It was built by Italian stone masons and is widely regarded as one of the city's pristine examples of a Victorian villa. Mr Rowe lived in the home until 1884, when it was bought by George Westgarth, who was responsible for building a new east wing and landscaping the gardens — the only major additions and alterations. Cedar-moulded joinery is a feature of its expansive interiors, as are double hung sash windows and French doors. A slate roof, cast-iron balcony balustrading and a turned timber staircase highlight Tresco's enduring elegance. But while much of this residence reflects a bygone era, there is development approval for an extension to the house and a heated infinity pool. Although who would want to add to the house, which already has seven bedrooms, four bathrooms and two studies — not to mention a two-bedroom caretaker's flat above the garage — remains to be seen. The master bedroom, with its expansive harbour views and balcony, dressing room and marble bathroom, is particularly stunning. The property also has three deepwater moorings, a private jetty, a boat house and its own ocean pool. Aside from glittering social gatherings, tragedy also formed part of Tresco's history. On July 8, 1899, Thomas John Dwyer — a 23-year-old groom working in the house's stables — was killed after falling from a horse. ""He mounted, and rode up and down the road once or twice, when the animal slipped on the metal and fell, rolling on his rider,"" a report in the Evening News said. Mr Dwyer fractured his skull in the incident, and died after being taken to St Vincent's Hospital. Two decades later, Rear Admiral John Bryan Stevenson and his wife Olive called Tresco home, but their time at the house was tinged with sadness. Mrs Stevenson's mother, from Tasmania, was killed in a plane crash in France. A newspaper report at the time noted: ""So great was Mrs Stevenson's anxiety and distress that her hair went white in a single night."" The property, bought by the RAN in 1902 for £8,000, is back in private hands, and currently owned by Janette Waterhouse, who is married to businessman David Waterhouse. It is on the market for $50 million with two prominent Sydney real estate agents. If there is a question about whether that eye-watering price tag could ever represent value, perhaps Mrs Showers summed it up best, when interviewed by Sydney's now-defunct The Sun newspaper in December 1951. ""We enjoy the garden and swimming pool so much that we made no plans, but set out to spend Christmas quietly at Tresco,"" she said.

380,opinion: Forget the checkout: what about the plastic clogging supermarket aisles?,house-and-home,"  Plastic pollution: it's not just bags at the checkout, what about the plastic clogging supermarket aisles? Last week I received a marketing email from a major supermarket offering me bonus loyalty points if I purchased a product from its new range for kids' lunchboxes: apple slices and carrot sticks, pre-cut and packaged in plastic. I did a double take. What sort of environmental vandal came up with that idea? Since when has chopping an apple become so inconvenient that it needs to be done for us, and packaged in plastic? Our oceans and coastlines are drowning in plastic litter. Research carried out in 2013 found that the density of plastic in Australian waters is up to 40,000 pieces per square kilometre. In northern Australia, discarded fishing nets known as ""ghost nets"" entangle thousands of turtles each year. In April, nearly 30 kilograms of rubbish was found in the gut of a dead sperm whale that washed up on a Spanish beach. Supermarkets regularly defend their wanton use of plastic, claiming it's what customers want — despite the increasing clamour from unhappy shoppers on social media who clearly don't need their bananas wrapped in clingfilm. So, what's the answer? It's definitely not pre-packaged carrot sticks. Supermarkets and other retailers need to minimise the use of plastic on their side. It's reprehensible that they are being so slow to take action. WA's plastic bag ban is imminent, and the biggest question for many seems to be what to line rubbish bins with when the ready supply of free bags dries up. After sustained high-profile campaigns to #banthebag in the few remaining states where single-use plastic bags had not already been outlawed, in 2018 the major supermarkets finally announced the end of single-use plastic bags. Woolworths will phase out single-use plastic bags from June 20, Coles from July 1. ALDI has never provided its customers with single-use plastic bags. Customers who fail to bring their own bag can purchase, for 15 cents, a thicker plastic bag (a ""boutique bag"") made from a high percentage of recycled materials. Banning single-use plastic bags clearly has a positive impact. Woolworths says it hands out 3.2 billion single-use plastic bags each year, many of which end up in landfill. In the ACT a review revealed that the number of plastic bags thrown into landfill fell by 36 per cent after the ACT introduced its ban in 2011. But what about the huge volume of plastic found in the supermarket aisles? A quick look around the fresh produce section of the supermarket reveals plenty of plastic encasing apples, pears and bananas. It baffles me why something as hardy as lemongrass needs to be sold in a plastic packet. A spokesperson for Woolworths said the company knows it still has work to do in reducing plastic across the supply chain: ""In recent months, we have permanently removed plastic from produce lines such as avocado, organic spring onions, celery, kale and English spinach. These moves will help save more than 37 tonnes of packaging on a yearly basis."" Coles pointed me to its REDcycle program: ""[…] the biggest retailer-led recycling initiative of its kind in Australia. Since the program began in 2011, Coles has diverted more than 300 million pieces of flexible plastic from landfill across Australia."" As we contend with a recycling crisis in Australia, it all feels like too little, too late. China's recent ban on importing recyclable waste led to many waste contractors refusing to accept recyclables. Now, faced with soaring bills, some councils are considering dumping kerbside recycling — Ipswich City Council announced their intention in late April, but then retracted it following public outcry. Which type of bag should you use to take your groceries home if you're trying to have as little an impact as possible on the environment? Some, like the Greens, argue manufacturers and retailers need to take more responsibility for the lifecycle of their packaging. ""Product stewardship"" and extended producer responsibility (EPR) requires manufacturers to factor the disposal of packaging into its design and production. Other solutions to the waste crisis include charging more to dump waste in landfill or offering subsidies to increase the capacity of the local recycling sector. A better option is to consume less plastic. ""Precycling"" minimises waste by reducing consumption. In practice this means packing your shopping in reusable bags, using a reusable cup for your takeaway coffee, buying items free from packaging — and putting a whole apple in our kids' lunchboxes. One supermarket in the Netherlands recently introduced a plastic-free aisle stocked with 700 products including fruit and vegetables, meat and pantry items. Ekoplaza CEO Erik Does told the Guardian: ""We know that our customers are sick to death of products laden in layer after layer of thick plastic packaging. Plastic-free aisles are a really innovative way of testing the compostable biomaterials that offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to plastic packaging."" Retailers in Australia could show this sort of leadership. While we wait for supermarkets to catch up, as consumers, we must stop throwing out so much plastic. We can draw a line in the sand and make sustainability our priority, not convenience. Nicola Heath is a freelance writer.

381,"Forget downsizing, retiree share housing floated as affordability solution",house-and-home,"  Share housing in retirement, profit-capped apartments floated as affordable alternatives Share housing in retirement or buying an apartment where the profits are capped are just some of the ideas being floated as part of a housing affordability forum. Perth architect Meriam Salama is the founder of the Henry Project, which aims to convert existing large homes into dwellings that can house families, couples and single people under the one roof. Spaces including the kitchen, dining room, laundry and garden are shared. ""It involves co-ownership, so they each own a proportion of the title,"" Ms Salama told ABC Radio Perth's Focus program. ""People have their own independent spaces but there are also common facilities. ""That way it is improving the density of a single dwelling without impacting on the amenity of a neighbourhood. ""It's a much more affordable proposition than trying to buy an entire house."" Ms Salama acknowledged some people might recoil at the idea of opening up their home to additional residents. But she said her project idea could offer benefits to older people with large houses who did not wish to downsize. ""You can stay in your home, you can make some modifications that might have been long overdue, then you can bring others in for the purpose of having better social connection in your home environment,"" she said. Questions such as what would happen if one resident wanted to sell, or how the property would be run, would be set out in a co-ownership agreement. ""People have the opportunity to live more affordably, and with better social connection, and essentially that equates to a better quality of life,"" Ms Salama said. ""Some research indicates that people can live 15 years longer when they have better social connections and they can have better survival rates from illness. ""We should be able to design for that in our housing environment."" Why the people of Perth are incredibly resistant to apartment living is something that will create challenges as the population grows. Ms Salama said she had already amassed a database of people who were keen to buy into such a housing arrangement. Builder Don Fini is planning to add yet another apartment block to a city already grappling with a glut, but he is no ordinary developer. The complex he is looking to build in Fremantle is a Nightingale project — a development model that has been trialled in Melbourne that caps profits and cuts out many of the real estate and marketing fees usually associated with new dwellings. ""Nightingale housing is a development model that puts the end user at the centre of the development process,"" Mr Fini said. First, angel investors are sought to acquire the land. Then potential purchasers are consulted at the design stage, with each apartment tailored to the eventual buyer's wishes. ""We work at a capped profit of 15 per cent, whereas most developers might be making 20 to 30 per cent profit,"" Mr Fini said. ""We don't spend any money on marketing, real estate commission or display suits. ""That money goes back into providing a more sustainable building."" Nightingale apartments are not just more affordable to buy, but much cheaper to live in, with double glazing, high-quality insulation and rooftop solar panels reducing energy costs. The model also discourages investors. ""The building will have a covenant that limits you to selling your apartment for the price that you paid for it plus the real estate growth in your area,"" Mr Fini said. ""The idea is that if you do get it for below market price, you don't flip it to make the difference. ""Nightingale wants you to pass that initial affordability that you picked up from day one to the next person."" It also discourages owners from renting our their apartments. ""We are trying to build a community,"" Mr Fini said.

382,"Hobart rents hit record high, with online searches eclipsing those for Melbourne",house-and-home,"  Hobart rents hit record high, with online searches eclipsing those for Melbourne Hobart renters are now paying just $10 less weekly than they would be in Melbourne, with median house rents in Tasmania's capital surging to $420 per week, according to a new report. The Domain March quarter rental report showed Hobart had the strongest annual growth of all the capital cities, with median house and unit rents at a record high. Australia's once booming east coast markets started weakening in the second half of 2017, and most analysts tip more of the same. Domain data scientist Nicola Powell said Hobart experienced 15.1 per cent year-on-year growth. ""It was the only capital city to record double-digit annual growth,"" she said. ""There is a number of reasons [for the growth]. We are seeing the available rental stock levels become depleted. Tasmania and Hobart have also been subject to surging population growth which is also putting pressure on the housing sector. ""I think we are seeing investors sway towards short-term leases rather than those long-term leases. That really does put pressure on the long-term leasing private rental market. ""Annually, unit rents in the Tasmanian capital have been on the uptick since December 2013, and median house rents are now only $10 behind Melbourne."" Dr Powell said increasing the availability of affordable rental stock was the key to loosening Hobart's rental market. ""Further rental growth in Hobart is dependent on a rise in supply, as recent building approvals and affordable housing proposals offered by the Tasmanian Government start to take shape,"" she said. On Wednesday the State Government announced a pilot program that would pay homeowners up to $13,000 if they made their properties available to low-income renters. The incentive package would match low-income households with suitable, affordable accommodation while providing landlords in the south with a payment of between $10,000 and $13,000, and landlords in the north and north-west with $10,000. Dr Powell said the plan could help to ease the lower end of the market, provided investors were swayed by the incentives. ""What we have seen in Hobart is record-high tourism levels and so it is attractive for investors to opt for that short-term lease,"" she said. ""But what we are seeing is that when investors do offer those short-term leases, often the short-term gain in terms of dollar value is much higher than the weekly rent of a long-term lease. ""That is attractive for an investor. ""We are seeing one of the tightest rental markets in Australia in Hobart and I can see that those rental prices are likely to continue to rise."" Labor's housing spokesman Josh Willie described the State Government's plan as a ""thought bubble"". ""The private rental market at the moment is very lucrative for landlords and we also know that homestay accommodation is very lucrative for landlords,"" he said. ""There are serious questions here about the effectiveness of this scheme. We don't know any of the details, the Government doesn't know any of the details."" In a separate report released by the realestate.com.au website on Thursday, Hobart was described as the most in-demand capital city, home to half of the top 10 most sought-after suburbs in Australia. According to the property outlook report, Hobart listings on realestate.com.au averaged more than 4,500 page views per property, significantly higher than Melbourne's 2,267. Realestate.com.au chief economist Nerida Conisbee said the combination of a changing economy and low levels of development had increased buyer and renter demand. ""While the rest of Australia has had a development boom over the past five years, the level of development in Tasmania has remained fairly low,"" she said. ""We are not only seeing very high demand from buyers but we are also seeing higher demand from renters. On one hand it's great news, on the hand you do need to provide adequate housing and I think that is the challenge for the State Government. ""Although there's great news for home owners, it is becoming challenging for those wanting to enter the property market, as well as for renters. ""Hobart is still the most affordable capital city with a median house price of $425,000, however it is starting to get expensive and this is likely to remain the case in 2018.""

383,"There is a way to a plastic-free life, but those who do it offer a word of caution",house-and-home,"  As a plastic bag ban looms, some have opted for a completely plastic-free lifestyle A looming statewide ban on single-use plastic bags in WA is forcing many people to think about how they will break a long-established habit the next time they go shopping. So imagine not using any single-use plastics at all. No plastic straws, cups, plates, cutlery, cling wrap or takeaway containers, and no plastic packaging for chips, muesli bars, cereals, other foods and kitchen and bathroom products. It can seem daunting, overwhelming, inconvenient and expensive all in one. The message from people who are trying to live free of single-use plastics is that it is easier than it seems — but they say people should not try to cut them out completely in one go. Rather, take it one step at a time. Hannah Thomas has been doing just that over the last few months after making a new year's resolution to use less plastic. ""Since then, we've gone on to use the stainless steel straws, reusable cupcake cases,"" she said. ""I now have a Sodastream maker, so I don't have to buy soda water in bottles."" Ms Thomas, who lives in the Perth suburb of Bassendean with her husband and two young children, grows her own spinach and herbs to avoid supermarket packaging, and no longer puts packaged foods in her children's lunchboxes. ""It's actually a lot easier than you probably think,"" she said. ""To make a batch of 12 muesli bars probably takes me 10 minutes in the kitchen."" But it is far from easy to stop using single-use plastics altogether. WA's plastic bag ban is imminent, and the biggest question for many seems to be what to line rubbish bins with when the ready supply of free bags dries up. Some items, like punnets of strawberries, which she and her daughter Macie love and do not want to give up, are hard to readily find without packaging. To live completely free of single-use plastics takes time. Lindsay Miles took up the challenge six years ago after seeing a poster promoting a plastic-free July challenge. She said she reached her goal after a few years and it had become part of her routine. ""I guess some things are more expensive, some things are cheaper. For me, overall, it's balanced out,"" she said. Ms Miles said she made one change after another and never stopped. ""One of the biggest things if you want to avoid plastic is to buy stuff second hand, so you're avoiding the packaging,"" she said. Ms Miles also makes a lot of her own food from scratch, and buys local produce when she can. Bulk food shops are also becoming increasingly popular as people try to avoid being left with a bin full of plastic. Which type of bag should you use to take your groceries home if you're trying to have as little an impact as possible on the environment? Co-owner of The Wasteless Pantry in Mundaring, Jeannie Richardson, said people lived with much less single-use plastic 40 or 50 years ago — and they could do it again. ""It wasn't always like this. There is a way, and it doesn't have to be difficult and it doesn't have to be expensive,"" she said. ""Don't feel bad that you haven't gotten rid of it and you're not a zero waster and you can't put your waste in a jar at the end of the year. ""Choose one thing, look at what's in your bin and pick an item and think, 'OK, how can I get rid of that this week'."" And the following week, choose something else.

385,opinion: How last night's fight affects the way couples divide housework,house-and-home,"  How last night's fight affects the way couples divide housework Housework is traditionally understood as an economic exchange — housework for money — or as a form of patriarchy drawn along gendered lines. Yet our new study argues housework is also divided according to the previous night's fight and our knowledge of our partner's trigger points. For many couples, the notion that housework is a form of interpersonal tension and support is not surprising — we adjust our behaviours daily as a form of love, caring and compassion for our partners. However, existing theories assume our housework is divided based on four dimensions of our lives: our earnings, our time demands, our gender role attitudes and our gender. These concepts have been well supported in academic scholarship. Men do less housework, on average, than women; the partner with more resources (more work, time and money) spends less time in housework; and couples with more traditional gender attitudes have more traditional work and housework divisions. Time, money and gender are important, but we argue that for modern couples, the interpersonal knowledge developed over the duration of a relationship is increasingly important for the way couples negotiate housework. By introducing a new theoretical perspective, we argue housework research needs to expand data collection to understand these processes. We suggest a new explanation for the way couples divide housework — the ""diverse capital"" approach. According to this approach, over the duration of a relationship couples develop two distinct forms of interpersonal capital. These forms of capital can be described as ""emotional capital"", or a deeper understanding of one's partner's trigger points for conflict, and ""relationship capital"", or credit developed from previous conflicts or helping one's partner. Both forms of interpersonal capital are then used to divide housework between spouses and may change over the duration of the partnership. Let's start with emotional capital. The 2016 census shows the typical Australian woman is still doing the lion's share of housework. Over the duration of the relationship, partners become more intuitive to the others' needs, preferences and points of conflict. In healthy relationships, each partner uses some dimensions of this knowledge to adjust behaviours to maximise marital harmony, reduce interpersonal conflict and demonstrate love. Our study argues that emotional capital may also be used to structure housework allocations. For example, one partner may have higher cleanliness standards than the other, which is a source of relationship conflict. In response, the other partner may adjust his or her cleaning patterns to reduce relationship tension around these different standards. Or, if divergent preferences remain, a failure in consistency about housework may lead to marital conflict and divorce. In addition to the entire housework load, couples may also be particularly sensitive to specific housework tasks as sources of conflict. For example, he hates when she leaves food in the sink and she hates when his coffee grounds spill on the bench. In this partnership, these types of messes function as trigger points for conflict and, in response, each partner may adjust their housework behaviour to appease the other person. Alternatively, she may continue to leave food in the sink drain and, over time, this may be a perpetual point of conflict that could lead to divorce. The second form of capital — relationship capital — functions more like a bank account, with partners storing up capital to use at specific times. Relationship capital can be developed through two experiences — conflict and help. After a conflict, couples may use housework as gesture of love, compassion and goodwill. In addition to traditional gestures of love such as flowers, chocolates and sex, one partner may also clean the house or make a special dinner (shopping, cooking and clean-up) to ameliorate the conflict. In this respect, housework may be a form of an apology to the wounded spouse. Relationship capital can also be stored for the long term by helping a spouse at a critical juncture. One partner may assume a larger share of the housework during critical transition periods for the other — like when one partner has a major work project or is building a business — with the expectation the other will reciprocate later. This see-sawing of domestic work may be increasingly common among young dual-earner families, who are simultaneously balancing two careers and children. The failure of a reciprocal exchange of housework during pressing time periods may jeopardise the relationship and lead to divorce. Women may be more vulnerable to poor exchanges given that gender roles tie them to housework at critical time points (such as the birth of a child), endanger their careers, and contribute to gender inequality. That being said, young men today are more egalitarian than previous generations and expect more equitable divisions of housework, indicating trades across housework divisions may become increasingly equitable. Couples today are balancing more complicated interpersonal and work relationships than in the past. Our new theoretical approach suggests that relationship and emotional capital play an integral role in explaining who does the housework — which is more important than roses and chocolates.

386,Is land-sharing the solution to the housing crisis?,house-and-home,"  Could land-sharing be the answer for aspiring homeowners? While many young couples struggle to get a mortgage in the outer suburbs of Australia's cities, James Galletly and Alicia Fox have created their very own tiny mansion in a mini-suburb in the bush for around $100,000. The whole house is smaller than many suburban dining rooms, but this is their dream home — on a large piece of land they share with over 70 other families. The owner-builder couple cut costs, and got themselves into Australia's highly competitive housing market, by building small — on a land-share arrangement. The cooperative in which they now live is a remote community located between Port Macquarie and Crescent Head in New South Wales, about five hours drive north of Sydney. Goolawah Cooperative is a 'land-share' or Multiple Occupancy and Development, consented under NSW State Environmental Planning Policy legislation number 15, which allows for the 78 residential sites. The couple were attracted to the simple way of life, in a remote bush community, about 20 kilometres from the nearest town. ""Being off grid we don't pay for any water or electricity so we keep our costs pretty low and we grow as much food as we can which keeps our cost down as well,"" Mr Galletly said. ""Our basic living expenses are just petrol, food, phone and internet,"" Ms Fox said. ""The concept of locking ourselves into repayments for 30 years — which meant careers for 30 years, just didn't suit our lifestyle. ""We were travelling for 10 years before we decided to build a house, so we didn't want to let go of that freedom."" It was in 2013 that the community got development approval to build more than one dwelling on the entire property — so there has been a recent building boom in the last couple of years with more young families moving in. Although James and Alicia's portion of the land-share is a relatively large one and a quarter acre block, keeping things small helped them keep costs down. ""We spent years designing something really small and really simple,"" Mr Galletly said. ""We wanted it to be just enough and not too much. ""We didn't want to have a large environmental impact."" The house dimensions externally are eight by five and a half metres and are less inside thanks to the straw bale construction, which stand at a half a metre wide when combined with the earth render. ""All the clay and the sand that we used came from the land we cleared to build our house, we used all that building material in our walls and on our floor,"" Mr Galletly said. The ceiling is made from all pallet timber which is a very labour-intensive process, especially in the way that they approached it, with their goal to cause as little environmental impact as possible. ""We've used all reclaimed timber, so everything turns up as scrap, and we need to bring it back to its former glory,"" Ms Fox said. ""It takes a bit longer than getting something from the hardware store."" James and Alicia learnt most of what they know about building with natural materials from their travels around the world. ""For the straw bale and earth rendering we use a lot of friend labour, through workshops, so we had people come and help us build,"" Mr Galletly said. ""It's kind of a traditional way of doing it,"" Ms Fox said. ""I think everyone who comes in and builds with us enjoys getting their hands dirty, being part of something that's going to last, and just going back to basics. ""The fact that you can build your own house is very empowering. ""We've been camping out for a couple of years while we built our house. Which exposes you to a lot of things, mostly the weather, so when it's really windy or rainy, that can be tiring."" The couple have now been building for two years. It has taken this long because they want to remain true to their ideals of keeping their environmental impact as low as possible. ""We're hoping to be finished by Christmas — even though we said that last year — and the year before!"" Ms Fox said. While a land-share option is a fraction of the cost of living in Sydney, it is not for everyone. The dream of living a simple life can in reality be a lot of hard work. Source: Goolawah Cooperative Nitiyama Martin is an experienced land share occupant from the Northern Rivers who recently moved to the same co-op with her partner Sattwa. ""It's a different model,"" Nitiyama Martin said. ""You don't own this tiny little block like most people do, but you own a share in this very large piece of bush land so in a way you own the whole property."" Ms Martin said that financially, you can't get a mortgage from a bank to buy a share. ""It's no longer one of the very cheap options like it was in the 70s, so it's kind of low-cost but it's not no-cost,"" she said. To finance their own tiny mansion dream, Alicia Fox and James Galletly gathered the money when they were working in Melbourne, before they went travelling, so they had savings to come back to. There still was not enough money to build. ""It was just covering our living expenses,"" Ms Fox said. ""We continued working while living very frugally on the land."" ""In the northern rivers, land-shares started with the Aquarius festival — a big student festival,"" Ms Martin said. ""People who came for that liked the area and wanted to stay. ""It was old dairy farms — so it was cheap, and people could buy it and sub divide it and it became a multiple occupancy. ""Now the children who grew up there can buy a share for $200!"" Ms Martin is no stranger to community living. ""I've lived on communities most of my adult life,"" she said. ""I think the community is so beneficial for the kids. ""We moved to Goolawah co-op because we were up for a new adventure and Goolawah is a pretty young co-op. ""There are social events and gatherings of neighbours and friends, live music, pizza nights, there's a men's shed, a yoga gathering, archery, a golf course, a children's choir. ""It's a little village."" ""As the village grows, there might be a bread baking group or a little produce shop."" But there are other challenges that come with community living. Although Ms Fox and Mr Galletly moved out to this land-share for their freedom, part of the agreement to live on this particular cooperative meant accepting a new set of rules to abide by. ""No cats and dogs, no firearms, no violence, no fences and no cutting down the trees on communal land,"" were some of the rules, Mr Galletly said. ""You can do what you like on your acre and a quarter, but need to ask permission to develop communal land."" ""There is a framework for this village,"" Ms Martin said. ""It's a democracy — there's no leader. ""All of those rules and by-laws are voted and there has to be a two-thirds majority."" ""I see it like any club or group that meets together, there are always people who don't exactly agree on things,"" Ms Fox said. ""But we have a process where we can basically sort things out and come to a compromise and hopefully meet at a point where everybody's happy. ""And now that we're out here, the benefit of the sharing and living with the other people in the community far outweighs any financial gain which initially brought us to this."" Julica Jungehulsing is a member of the cooperative's media team. ""It's been really successful because there are a variety of people from diverse backgrounds, aged from two to 75 years old, bringing their different skills,"" Ms Jungehulsing said. ""Also we have a framework of adapted rules approved by the department of Fair Trading, and we have a set of by-laws we've worked out over the course of time which can be discussed in monthly meetings that we need a majority agreeing on. ""For example — no power tools after 6pm. ""The fact that everyone can be involved in the decision-making process is important for making everybody feel part of it.""

387,How to win a house at auction,house-and-home," RN Tips for home buyers bidding at auction Every weekend, hundreds of eager first home-buyers line up to try to make their housing dreams come true at auction. But buying a house or apartment can seem an impossible task. Does it matter where you stand? Should you open the bidding — or wait until the end to jump in? Ultimately, success comes down to how much you are willing to pay for the property, but there are ways to give yourself the best chance of winning. Start gathering information from the real estate agent the first time you walk through the door to view the property. Try and find out the buyer's motivation for selling and how much interest there is in the property. Sam Lally, a buyer's advocate who bids professionally at auctions, says buyers need to think about the competition. ""The biggest thing that people fail to realise is, you have to understand who your main competition is, just like a football coach,"" he told The Pineapple Project. ""Coaches watch past games to work out how certain people that they're up against are going to react to certain situations. ""Every buyer has a differing profile, so a first home-buyer is going to bid differently to a cashed-up downsizer who sold a bigger place, who doesn't have the bank restraints and will bid more freely. ""If you understand those profiles and how they work then you can actually place your strategy better."" Keep in mind though, the selling agent is working for the vendor and will most likely try not to reveal too much. The night before the auction, decide on the top figure you are willing to spend on the property. Write it down and put it in your pocket, says Sven Feldmann, an economist who teaches auction theory at Melbourne Business School. ""Once you're at the auction it's very difficult to keep your cool and make a rational decision,"" Professor Feldmann said. ""So holding the piece of paper in your pocket is a tangible reminder for when you've reached your limit. ""There is very little you will learn about a house during the auction that should lead you to decide it's worth $200,000 more than you thought the night before."" To prepare for the auction, consider your strategy for two different scenarios: one if the auction is a dud and you're the only bidder, and the other if there are many bidders and the prices soar quickly past your limit. ""No other scenarios should worry you,"" Professor Feldmann said. ""You should have a plan for each of these two cases and stick to it."" What about making the first bid? ""In most cases it doesn't matter if you open the bidding, but what is inadvisable is to make a high first offer,"" he said. ""Some people might say it's a good strategy to scare other bidders away, but it could also cost you a lot of money if you were going to be the only bidder."" However, there's no problem with making a conservative bid. In that case you're not giving away any information, so just go for it — just don't project too much eagerness. ""As long as the property is not on the market — do not reveal all your cards. At this stage you're just bidding against yourself,"" Professor Feldmann said. ""What sellers often don't realise is that real and credible bidding only occurs once the property is on the market and the bidders are playing for keeps."" Yes, according to Mr Lally. ""I'm in a black suit, white shirt, black shoes and it's generally what I wear every Saturday,"" he said. ""People who don't know about advocates generally think a well-dressed person at an auction has got money. And the way you bid is obviously with confidence and sometimes that can put others off as well. ""Generally everyone who stands with their arms folded at an auction is going to bid. ""That's why I stand with my hands behind my back, so I'm not giving up anything. You can generally tell when someone's running out of money because their shoulders drop."" He also stands in front of the property near the board so he can see the crowd of people and know what's going on around him. But Professor Feldmann said psychological tactics don't really matter. ""You can make a case for either standing at the back, jumping in towards the end of the bidding and surprising everyone, or dressing up and standing out the front,"" he said. ""It's more important to be comfortable in what you do and wear, rather than trying to put on a persona at the auction."" Want to learn how to demolish debt and save more? Listen to this new ABC podcast. You don't have to offer a bid as large as what the auctioneer is calling for. ""I try to break them down as quickly as possible, to save my clients as much money as possible,"" Mr Lally said. ""How I bid, when I bid, what I bid, is all determined on what's actually eventuating throughout the whole auction scenario. ""I'm trying to take control of the auction and how it plays out, so, if they go $10,000, I'll offer $5,000."" This is the most important tip — ask yourself, are you willing to walk away if the bidding goes past your limit? ""If the answer is, 'no this is my dream place' then you're likely to overpay,"" Professor Feldmann said. Stick to your strategy and your limit. Try to remember: there will always be another house.

389,'Worst decision we ever made': Why you should think twice before buying a slice of Pacific paradise,house-and-home,"  Gum trees or palm trees: The perils of investing in property in the Pacific Islands Some Australians dream of a home among the gum trees — others prefer the palms of the Pacific Islands. But retirees interested in buying homes in the Pacific are being warned they need to be very careful to avoid losing their money. There is little freehold land available, with much of it being leasehold, and complications can arise from collective land ownership by local communities. Rogue builders, some of them with little actual experience, can end up costing investors thousands. A couple from Melbourne, Alwyn and Robert, said they had been ripped off by the man they contracted to build their house in Fiji, and they know of many other expatriates in a similar situation. Alwyn said they could end up losing their retirement savings entirely. ""We've had our builder who has breached his own contract and walked off the job and left us with not even half complete buildings,"" she said. ""If we can't finish it ourselves, we could very well be in a situation where we're going to be penalised."" She said there seemed to be little that could be done when builders broke contracts in Fiji. ""When they do walk off the job, or if they take your money [and] don't finish the job, they're not punished,"" she said. ""With the Fijian Commerce Commission there's 150 complaints against builders."" Alwyn said there was not enough protection for investors in Fiji, and unless they have a lot of money they can afford to lose, expatriates should avoid building there. Construction Industry Council of Fiji president Gordon Jenkins said the best thing expatriate property investors could do was get a signed, legally enforceable agreement with their builder which would be recognised by a court. He said the construction industry in Fiji was trying to crack down on informal builders by introducing a licensing scheme. ""The construction industry is very proactive and it's trying as well with the Consumer Council people here trying to get all construction people licensed, which means they're vetted for competency,"" Mr Jenkins said. ""If they've got a shonky builder and he's not licensed, well it's on your own head if you use somebody like that."" Malcolm Gunning, president of the Real Estate Institute of Australia, suggested people who wanted to build a retirement or holiday home in the Pacific also needed to be very cautious about the difference between freehold, leasehold and tribal land ownership arrangements. ""It's a risky business buying in these countries, a lot of them are third world countries and their parliamentary system, particularly in Fiji, is really still run on a lot of tribal lines,"" Mr Gunning said. ""So a lot of the land that you're looking at is leasehold land, but there's tribal interests involved. ""You really don't have what we have in Australia and that's freehold. And you don't really have control over your land."" Mr Gunning said buying property in the Pacific was a speculative enterprise, and investors needed to be prepared to lose their money. He said while many people had taken that risk and were living very comfortably, investors should be well informed and wary of so-called 'advisors' who want money up front. However, Alwyn, a former Melburnian, said after her experience in Fiji, she would advise others thinking of following her example not to. ""It was the worst decision we've ever made. It's not a stable enough system here, there's not enough protection for investors.""

390,A different picture of Airbnb in Australia emerges in scraped data,house-and-home," Updated 
    
      February 24, 2018 13:14:16 Airbnb has always maintained it's about mums and dads renting out space in their homes for a modest profit.  But new data shows an explosion in the number of entire homes and commercial listings, such as serviced apartments run by property managers, on the platform. Airbnb rarely releases its own data, but the independent monitoring website Inside Airbnb — set up by New York-based Australian Murray Cox — has released its latest analysis of the platform's public listings. There has been an 87 per cent rise in total listings across Australia in the past 12 months. There's also been a massive jump in the number of entire homes available — from 43,610 in 2016 to 89,863 in December 2017, making up nearly 70 per cent of all listings, according to Inside Airbnb. Mr Cox, an unashamed data activist who's against urban gentrification, said the data showed Sydney and Melbourne were on track to become ""the playgrounds of millionaires and tourists"". In Melbourne, more than 12,474 entire homes are available for booking, making up 60 per cent of all listings.  There's also been a spike in the city's multi-listings, which are numerous listings by one user, up 107 per cent in the past 12 months. In Sydney, while the use of Airbnb appears to have slowed slightly on last year, there are currently 32,830 listings — a fifth of which are multi-listings — and the majority are entire homes. The use of the booking platform in Hobart remains small in comparison to the mainland, but according to Inside Airbnb the listings there have more than doubled and the majority are entire homes.  The Airbnb boom is fuelling discontent among residents who believe apartment blocks are becoming quasi-hotels, and short-stay rentals are changing the make-up of cities and chewing up would-be housing stock. While Airbnb says the majority of hosts rent their primary residence occasionally for a modest boost to the household income, Inside Airbnb figures suggest properties rented out for more than 60 nights across Australia are on the rise. Airbnb's Australian head of public policy Brent Thomas has rejected Inside Airbnb's analysis. ""Dodgy scraped data or the back-of-the-napkin analyses are grossly misleading and deeply inaccurate,"" Mr Thomas said. The booking platform said there was no reliable way to calculate how often hosts book out their properties or rooms, and multiple listings could be for the same property.  However, cities across the world, such as Barcelona, have been tightening regulation around short-stay accommodation. Mr Cox said Australia needed to catch up. ""Cities that have been grappling with it for 10 years are moving towards yearly permits, only allowing [listings] in primary residency, notifying building owners and neighbours of intent,"" Mr Cox said. ""The laws being proposed in Australia goes completely in the opposite direction than the rest of the world. A study of what the rest of the world is doing would be very appropriate."" After bad experiences in Canberra, Chris Clark was adamant he didn't want to buy an apartment next to any short-stay accommodation when he moved to Melbourne. ""We made it pretty clear that we were looking for a place not close to serviced apartments,"" he said. He bought into the New Quay complex at Docklands, but a short time later the apartment next door was sold and the new owners listed it as a short-term rental.  Since then Mr Clark said he had put up with blaring music at all hours, rubbish such as cans and cigarettes dropping from balconies, and chairs being thrown from a 14th floor into common areas. The latest owners-corporation figures show more than a third of all apartments in Mr Clark's complex are short-stay rentals. ""That's bringing people who are unvetted into the building. We had an incident in December where one of these subletting people had their apartment trashed and they wanted our security to throw them out,"" Mr Clark said. He said people were buying into what they thought was a community, but instead got a pseudo hotel. In Canberra, his owners corporation had the option of fining the owner of the apartment up to $500, but in Victoria he said powers were limited. ""These people can come in and cause total chaos, clear out the next morning, there's no consequences, simply because the owners corporation has no power to fine anybody,"" Mr Clark said. He said security problems were growing and general building rules followed by residents were being disregarded by tourists. According to Deloitte Access Economics, Airbnb guests contribute $1.6 billion to Australia's GDP, support more than 14,000 jobs, and create significant savings for tourists. The importance of the tourism dollar has left state governments grappling with the need to balance a complex mix of tourism interests, and property and consumer rights. Strata lawyer Tom Bacon said currently the laws provided little regulation over short-stay rentals. ""There is nothing. It is a real mess at the moment,"" he said. ""It's like the Wild West. You can do what you like — it's 365 days of the year for short-term letting."" Last year, proposed changes to Victoria's short-stay accommodation bill, which aims to deal with ""unruly guests"", was criticised for not providing any recourse or consumer protections for residents affected by short stayers.  There were also calls from the tourism industry to delay any changes to the law for two years. ""It is more of the day-in, day-out struggles that I see acting for owners corporations — it's the disenfranchisement of these communities which is leading to a downward death spiral for community engagement,"" Mr Bacon said. The NSW Government is reviewing more than 4,000 community and industry submissions on proposed regulations for short-term accommodation and building use. The state's Fair Trading department is also investigating allegations that real-estate agencies are promoting short-term holiday accommodation, in breach of development approval and building codes. Other cities across the world have imposed minimum stays, permits and licenses, fines for disruption, and are policing illegal listings. San Francisco has implemented a 90-day cap on entire-home listings, and owners can be fined for renting without a permit, but platforms like Airbnb also face a $1,000-a-day fine for illegal listings. ""The way the sharing economy is going and technology is developing, it is a hard task for regulators to keep up, but ... short-term letting and Airbnb and Stayz have been around for long enough now it's time for governments to catch up,"" Mr Bacon said. Airbnb said it wanted to work collaboratively with governments to ensure sustainable communities, but also wanted rules that worked for modern day homeowners.

391,Tips for dealing with clothes and pantry moths in your home,house-and-home,"  Tips for dealing with clothes and pantry moths in your home Clothes moths and pantry moths can be a real pest when they start eating your woollens and getting into your flour. They are commonly found around the home — and even Canberra's Parliament House isn't exempt. The Department of Parliamentary Services this month issued an alert to all Parliament House staff, declaring the house on the hill was suffering from an outbreak of case-making clothes moth. ""The moths feed on natural fibres and — despite various treatments late last year — the current infestation has already affected carpets, furnishing fabrics and personal items of Senators and Members. If not contained this has the potential to have a wider impact, including on items in the art collection."" So as Australia's biggest house deals with a moth infestation, let's take a look at how you can keep these flying pests at bay in your home. There are two main species of clothes moth found in Australian homes — the webbing clothes moth and the case-making clothes moth (of which there are about eight different kinds). ""They're very secretive as adult moths and you don't see them flying around very much at all,"" Ted Edwards, honorary fellow with CSIRO's Australian National Insect Collection, told ABC Radio Canberra. ""Usually the first indication that they're around is you find the damage that the larvae have caused."" The larvae eat natural fibres like wool, fur and silk. So you may first discover moths have moved in when you pull out a woollen jumper to find it filled with holes, or you move some furniture to find the carpet underneath has bare patches. Another sign is larval cases or sticky webbing on clothes or furnishings, which can sometimes be hard to spot because the larvae droppings take on the colour of the fabric they have been feeding on. Once you discover a moth infestation, you need to clear out all the moths, caterpillars and eggs. ""If it's in carpet, vacuum it up and expose the area to as much light and openness as possible,"" Dr Edwards said. ""They like nice dark corners, and if it's behind a piece of furniture or something like that, then move the furniture and expose the whole area."" If you spot them in your wardrobe, vacuum and wipe out the cupboards and, if you have the space, put affected clothing in the freezer. ""Freeze it for a week or two and that will kill all the larvae and eggs,"" Dr Edwards said. Wash all clothing before returning items to the wardrobe. Dr Edwards said use of insecticides or professional fumigation should be considered as last resorts. Once you get rid of the moths, it is time to look at prevention methods. Adding camphor hangers or balls is a good place to start when it comes to keeping moths out of your wardrobe. Traditional moth balls are also effective, but they contain toxic chemicals, so instead consider using natural alternatives like sachets of dried lavender or a mix of cloves and bay leaves. ""Moths balls and camphor and things like that, they're not poisonous to moths, they act as deterrents,"" Dr Edwards said. ""A space that is high with naphthalene or camphor or something like that will tend to keep the moths from going into that cupboard. ""But once they're in there, they're fine, it doesn't worry them."" So it may take more than a few camphor balls to keep moths away from your clothes. Between seasons, store woollen items in sealed garment bags or airtight containers. When regularly wearing such clothes, make sure they are clean when you hang them up, and free of sweat and food particles that make wool extra tasty for moths. Keep cupboards ventilated and regularly give your wardrobe a spring clean. ""Don't let the back of the wardrobe sit there for years without visiting it,"" Dr Edwards said. When it comes to carpet, consider periodically moving furniture and vacuuming those dark corners of a room. Also avoid moisture in the carpet, paying particular attention to areas where indoor plants are kept. Indian meal moths are the most common type of moth found in pantries, particularly during the warmer months. You may spot moths flying around your kitchen, find webbing on the surface of food or packaging, or worse still even find larvae in your flour, rice or muesli. If you have a pantry moth infestation, first you need to dispose of any affected food stuffs and give your pantry a big clean, wiping all shelves to make sure you get any remaining eggs. You could also put out a sticky pheromone trap to capture adult moths that have been flying around or hiding in corners of the pantry. Most of the time, pantry moths arrive onboard your groceries. ""These moths lay minute eggs in tiny cracks and holes in the plastic packing,"" Dr Edwards said. ""If you're concerned about a package that's come in from the supermarket or a package that you've got in the pantry, then freeze if for a couple of weeks to kill the larvae and eggs."" To prevent future infestations, keep dry foods in sealed containers, preferably screw-top jars. ""Certainly, a lot of people have pantry moths at the moment, even I have them,"" Dr Edwards said. While clothing and pantry moths can be quite destructive in your home, Dr Edwards said it was important to remember the positive contribution moths make. ""Moths in general are good for ecological services; we'd be overrun with weeds and things like this if there weren't moths,"" he said. ""The clothes moth, in there with a few beetles, are breaking down wool and fur and things like that; they're causing their share of biodegradability.""

392,"opinion: Retiring at 35 might be good for you, but it's bad for the rest of us",house-and-home,"  Retiring at 35 might be good for you, but it's bad for the rest of us In his recent opinion piece for ABC Online, Pat Seyrak describes his plan to forego home ownership and retire at 35 to a life of frugality and personal fulfilment. Many Australians, faced with ever-escalating work commitments, will doubtless find this narrative appealing, but I find myself wondering if Pat's idea of independence and freedom from debt is a little simplistic. As we move through life we continuously accrue and discharge debts, and not all of them appear on the balance sheet. Knowing nothing of Pat beyond what he mentions in the ABC piece or on his blog, it would be unfair to make assumptions about his past and future life, so for the sake of illustration allow me to introduce my imaginary friend, Frank. Frank grew up in an average sort of household with an average household income, and as an average kid he benefited from family tax breaks, free health care and education and, when the time came, a heavily subsidised spot at a public university. All this is as it should be; few in Australian society would argue against the wealth redistribution required to give our youngest citizens the best possible start in life. Pat Seyrak is skipping Sydney property and smashed avocado for another financial goal: being done with work by 35. The assumption is that Frank, upon graduation, will have a long career paying the income tax which will help fund his retirement and enable society to offer others the same opportunities afforded him. Unfortunately for society, Frank has other ideas. By working like a Trojan and living like a monk he is able to invest sufficient funds to retire on $40,000 a year after only one decade in the workforce. He's paid a fair bit of tax in doing so, but that's all over now. Time passes. Frank moves to North Queensland, meets someone special and has a couple of kids of his own. Due to his modest income, he's now paying virtually no income tax. The kids go to kindergarten, go to school, go to hospital, and society picks up the tab. When they move away to take up their own subsidised university places they get Austudy and rental assistance, because Frank's income is below the cut-off threshold. Frank drives on state-funded roads and enjoys the security provided by a state funded police force and judiciary. He does some volunteer work because he feels he should contribute. It does not occur to him that he is happily taking everything on offer while reserving the right to decide when, how and what to pay in return. Eventually Frank, retired for the past 40 years, reaches retirement age. His modest income means he is eligible for a part pension: only $4,500 a year, but just enough for an annual trip to Bali. Twenty years later, after an unfortunate illness that has required ongoing care in a public hospital, Frank dies. He has timed things perfectly; all he leaves behind is an empty bank account and a society ever so slightly diminished in its capacity to meet the aspirations of those who come after him. Of course, I have no reason to believe that Pat Seyrak shares the blithe sense of entitlement of my notional Frank, but during my years of working in the community services sector I have met many who do, most memorably an accountant who expected Centrelink to assume her mortgage repayments because she had neglected to insure against work-ending illness, and a clerical worker demanding funds to up-skill and move away from a soured workplace romance. I also know there are many more people who will experience lives of much greater frugality than the one to which Pat aspires, not through choice but due to disability or intergenerational welfare dependence. I would like to set a challenge for those who work their way early to a point where they need work no more. Before you walk out the office door for the last time, ask yourself: do I truly have sufficient credit, both ethically and financially, to turn my back on work, or have I funded my early retirement in part by neglecting my obligations to the society that makes my choices possible? If in all honesty your answer is no to the first part of this question and yes to the second, I suggest it is not yet time to put up your feet.

393,Feng shui masters put the 'chi' in Chinese New Year,house-and-home,"  How feng shui consultants are helping Australians prepare for Lunar New Year If Valentine's Day is a boom time for florists and the arrival of the Easter bunny pumps money into bakeries, the lead-up to February is richest time for practitioners of the ancient Chinese art of feng shui. Thousands of Australians invite consultants into their homes and businesses before the start of the Lunar New Year to find out how to control the positive and negative influences in their lives by moving furniture, replacing homewares and adjusting colour schemes. Mina Zheng has spent the last decade mapping sources of positive and negative chi within the home of her clients in Sydney. She said Lunar New Year was not just a time to clean and de-clutter your home, but to evaluate how the arrangement of your living and working spaces might affect your relationships, fortunes and health in 2018. ""When the year changes it affects every individual,"" she said. ""If the year brings a set of good elements to us, our year ahead will be really successful. ""But, if the element is really destructive to the person then we have to do something to harmonise it to enhance the year."" This year will be dominated by the forces of man's best friend — the dog. Ms Zheng said 2018 was likely to bring a mixture of good and bad luck for people depending on the zodiac animal that represents them and where their birth day and year sits on the Chinese astrological calendar. Feng shui consultants use a special compass, or Luopan, to map out the influences affecting a property before separating it into a number of sections. According to feng shui, the impact of each section depends on which of the five elements is active — water, wood, fire, earth or metal. Ms Zheng said the north, north-west, east and north-east sections of the home would harbour negative influences in 2018. Meanwhile, the south-east, west and centre was likely to provide more positive chi. ""The north has too much earth energy,"" she said. ""If there's any red things in this section — pillows or red paintings — we should move them somewhere else."" She recommended people swap red, orange or purple coloured objects in northern rooms for metallic colours and white. Brisbane business owner Chiu-Ling Lee has applied feng shui at home and inside her businesses for more than 10 years. She said she believed it made a difference to her life. Placing a water feature on top of a bar fridge in her family's garage was the strangest thing she had done to drive away bad energy. And she admitted her constantly changing decor choices could look unusual to the uninitiated. ""I do decorate the house according to the year,"" she said. ""That's why we do look crazy sometimes."" Updating her feng shui this year has been as simple as moving fire-coloured objects from one area of her home to another. Sunshine Coast feng shui master George Bennis said his clients reached out for advice as early as December ahead of the Lunar New Year. He described feng shui as a ""mapping system"" that monitored changes in chi — an invisible force he said influenced all life on Earth. ""Everyone has probably been to a house or location and felt really uplifted, inspired and comfortable,"" he said. ""Or, conversely, gone to a house where it feels heavy, thick and uncomfortable. ""If you have ever had that experience then you have felt chi."" He said homes or businesses would not end up looking like a Chinese restaurant if feng shui was applied correctly. ""Hanging red tassel-y things and having statues of dragons and tigers all over the place is totally unnecessary,"" he said. ""It should be a red rug over here, a water feature in this corner, a beautiful painting here.""

394,opinion: Why I decided to skip home ownership to retire at 35,house-and-home,"  Why I decided to skip home ownership to retire at the ripe age of 35 As a millennial living in Sydney, I am faced with an important choice: a house or my life. I've decided to choose the latter. I've made a decision to retire early. I don't mean at 55 or even 50 years old. I'm talking about hanging up my boots at the ripe age of 35 after a fulfilling, decade-long career. While early retirement is not for everyone, I truly believe that becoming financially independent — that is having the financial means to stop working if you choose to — is an achievable and worthwhile goal for most Australians with a decent-paying job. My own yearning for financial independence has grown over time. The inhuman waking hours and long days filled with hours of overtime has slowly eroded the feelings of satisfaction and accomplishment I get from my work as an engineer. More importantly, I feel that by working so much, I'm missing out on the rest of my life. Unlike my peers, buying a home is not a priority for me. Contrary to many people my age, who are driven by ever-rising property prices and the fear of missing out, I wasn't willing to mortgage myself to the neck. I rent with my partner and a flatmate. Instead, I decided to invest in the share market to work towards my goal of early retirement. Should you sacrifice lifestyle to buy? Or just rent forever? Are there other ways? My decision led to some raised eyebrows from friends and family. My colleague Matt nearly choked on his coffee when I told him I had $250,000 in the share market. ""That's crazy,"" he said. But I'll tell you what I think is crazy: spending 30 years of servitude paying off a mortgage, just to own a very expensive material possession, when I could be doing other things like spending time with my friends and family. By buying income-producing assets such as shares, I will soon have enough income to make work optional. By saving aggressively and investing aggressively in exchange-traded funds, I plan to have $1,000,000 by the time I am 35. This will produce an income of about $40,000 per year for the rest of my life. Now, that amount of money would not go far if I were to continue living in Sydney, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world. That's why I have aspirations to live in other parts of Australia and the world. Cities like Cairns, Adelaide, Ballarat or Hobart (just to name a few) offer extremely affordable real estate and idyllic lifestyles away from the constant rat race of the larger cities. Slowly travelling through south-east Asia or South America can also be done at a far cheaper price than it costs to live in some of Australia's large cities. While many imagine a life of poverty on $40,000 a year or less, I have found that you can have a truly rich and fulfilling life by ensuring you spend your money on the right things. Yearly upgrades to the latest iPhone and smashed avocado at the local café several times a week are out, while lots of outdoor time with friends and beautiful home cooked meals are in. Being completely open and honest about these aspirations has meant that my friends and family know what my motivations are when I make decisions around spending. I still remain social and see them regularly, giving myself a small social spending budget for meals out and other small incidental costs. The key here is smart spending: I could waste one month's social budget on one meal, or I could forego the fancy meal and have every weekend filled with day trips to places such as public pools, the beach, hiking spots or free outdoor cinemas. None of this is much different to what a young couple would do to save a house deposit. Even with a very conservative strategy of withdrawals from my share portfolio to cover living expenses during retirement, I must admit there are still risks. The prevailing risk is underperforming investments. The share market is an unpredictable beast in the short term. Another risk is the possibility that I come to need or want to spend more on living expenses than I had planned. If returns are not what I expect them to be or if I fall victim to lifestyle inflation, then I will need to adjust my plan to include more paid work and/or be more flexible with my spending. I am content with the possibility of needing to work a bit longer or transitioning to a couple of days of casual work in a fun, low-stress job if I need to give my investments some time to grow. Far from being the death knell of my retirement, these are challenges that I expect and am prepared to overcome by remaining flexible with my work and spending. While, I must admit, the prospect of getting my hands dirty in the garden at 8am on a weekday while everyone else is rushing to work is alluring, I don't intend to drop everything once I reach my goal. Juggling full-time work and child-rearing sounds painfully difficult and full of unfortunate compromises. By getting the business of earning money out of the way early in life, I can focus 100 per cent of my energy on what will be my most important commitment: family and children. Besides spending time with my family, I want to travel, learn a language and play music. Hard work, achievement, productivity and contribution will always have an important place in my life. But it doesn't always have to be for money. I hope to do some meaningful work in retirement that's not motivated by money. I'd like to volunteer and work on personal projects — but on my own terms, not those of my employer. As Peter Adeney, who blogs about financial independence under the pseudonym Mr Money Moustache, points out: ""If you can free yourself from the need for money, you have no choice but to do work that is better for you, and better for the world … If you're doing it for love instead of money, you'll have no choice but to do a better job."" It's all too common to hear people who, at the end of their lives, regret working too much. Like most, I don't want to be one of those people. Unlike most, I'm willing to do something about it.

395,Tips for dealing with ants invading your house,house-and-home,"  Ants invading your house can be controlled with these handy suggestions Got an ant problem? Join the club. If having ants in your house is really bugging you, we've got some tips on how to keep them at bay. Richard Goodfellow runs a pest control business in Hobart and said summer was boomtime for ants. He said numbers had been particularly bad this year. ""I think mainly because of the dry weather, it's extra hot,"" he told Helen Shield on ABC Radio Hobart. ""With a little bit of rain they'll flare up and start coming inside."" Ants are looking for two things in your home: food and water. ""Toilets, bathrooms are often areas where you'll get a lot of ants,"" Mr Goodfellow said. ""A bit of water in your kitchen or syrups, they'll soon track inside to it."" Even the cleanest of houses can have ant issues. ""I go to houses where there's cupboards that are spotless and there's ants for some reason going in there,"" Mr Goodfellow said. Of course there are plenty of ant baits and sprays on the market, but there are also natural products you can use to at least reduce the number of ants walking across your benchtops. Ants are drawn to sugary and fatty foods. Keep your syrups, sugars and anything that attracts ants in airtight containers or put them in the fridge. Create a moat of water around pet food bowls so the ants cannot cross the water to get to the food. Put outside food bowls away from the house and only feed your pet what it can eat in one go. Ants do not like acidic things, so using lemon or vinegar to clean your benches can put them off. The insects leave a chemical trail behind when they find a food or water source to tell others where to go. Wipe away an ant trail with something like lemon juice to break the chain. Filling any holes you find that are letting ants get into your home will ease your problems also. Ants tend not to like chalky substances, such as actual chalk, baby powder or baking powder. A line of powder can stop them from entering your home. But killing off a nest is the only way to get rid of them entirely. If you do not want to use commercial baits and chemicals, mixing borax with sugar or syrups can do the job. The ants will carry off the sugary treat back to the nest where the borax will kill the ants. If you find a nest in your yard, pouring boiling water on it can also kill a lot of ants, but beware the nests can be very deep and the water might not get through it all. The nests can hold tens of thousands of ants and there can be multiple nests. ""Some houses, if they're nested in a wall cavity ... it could be a couple of years [to get rid of ants],"" Mr Goodfellow said. ""A lot of people will persist with baits then eventually they'll call the pest control guy or girl.""

396,The fight to stop a growing wave of waste from 'green' electric cars,house-and-home,"  How lithium-ion electric car batteries could still power your home once they've run out of zap Less than five per cent of lithium-ion batteries sold in Australia are currently recovered and recycled. The rest end up in landfill. That's prompting the question — what will happen when the volume of battery waste grows as more electric vehicles (EVs) start driving on our roads? Most existing battery waste comes from small electronic devices like phones, laptops and power tools, so it is not yet a major problem. But according to a report prepared for the Federal Department of Environment by Randall Environmental Consulting, the scale of waste is predicted to soar. It found battery waste would grow at a rate of 20 per cent a year once the first wave of electric car batteries and home storage systems run out of zap towards the middle of the next decade. Electric cars are expected to add the most to waste volumes, with a predicted yearly growth rate of 50 per cent. The estimate does not include major pledges like the one Elon Musk made last week to give 50,000 homes in South Australia solar panels and batteries which is likely to blow out predictions. ""Once [those batteries] come to the end of their life … we're going to have very large volumes of batteries which will end up in landfill,"" CSIRO researcher Anand Bhatt said. ""That's when the environmental problems will start [but] industry is talking to us now, they've recognised this is a problem that is coming and they want CSIRO's help."" Dr Bhatt is leading a team of CSIRO researchers working alongside companies to improve battery storage technology, and is also looking at ways of reusing batteries once they run out of steam for an energy-intensive car engine. ""Once a battery in an electric vehicle reaches its end of life, it still has 80 per cent of its capacity still available for other applications,"" he said. ""If you transfer that to a home with energy storage, you can get another 30 per cent out of that battery pack."" It is a concept EV enthusiast and Australian Electric Vehicle Association vice chair Chris Jones has already tested out at his home in Perth. He has built his own electric bike using lithium-ion cells, and also recovers old lithium-ion batteries which he recharges using solar panels to power his shed. ""The main thing you can do once they've passed their usable life in the car is to use it for stationary energy storage,"" he said. You'd use it for stationary energy storage for your solar panels at home and that will easily get another 10-15 years out of them to run your house. ""After that, they really need to be taken to a dedicated plant where they are disassembled and separated into their components and recycled."" Melbourne-based company Relectrify has developed technology which improves the so-called ""second life"" potential of lithium-ion batteries using hi-tech monitoring software. ""When you take a used battery out of an electric car, the challenge is that [it] is made up of many individual batteries that don't perform evenly"", Relectrify CEO Valentin Muenzel said. ""When one of those batteries starts to get weaker, the entire battery starts to suffer. ""What Relectrify does is ensures that when you get a collection of used batteries out of one vehicle … you get the maximum out of every single one."" Mr Muenzel said the process generated a 30 per cent increase in the lifetime of the batteries along with a 20 per cent increase in their performance. ""You can reuse them without it but then you have a much shorter lifetime,"" he said. ""So even after that first use, they can be repurposed into what is called a second life — as household energy storage or grid scale storage or other applications beyond that — and still offer 2,000 discharge cycles. ""[That] in a home is maybe five to eight years, depending on how often you charge and discharge."" Mr Muenzel said his company was in talks with several global car manufacturers and had signed a deal with Volkswagen. Beyond a second life, the batteries can also be recycled, with 95 per cent of the components able to be reused. That is a solution Perth-based lithium miner Neometals is pursuing, with the company building its own recycling plant in Canada. ""It's really a cradle-to-grave solution — at Mount Marion [mine], we are producing the lithium units and then recycling,"" Neometals managing director Chris Reed said. ""We are taking them back at the end product, unscrambling the egg, recovering the valuables and reinserting them and basically making a more sustainable business model. ""Our plan is to locate the plant alongside an existing facility, so we take the scrap in the production process and then we can scale the plant up as the batteries come back to end-of-life."" The solutions are all feasible options being considered to ensure the industry does not add to the world's ever-expanding landfill problem. The challenge for governments and industry is making sure they are ready for when the first influx of batteries arrives. Randall Environmental Consulting director Paul Randall said more planning was needed. The ABC test drives an electric car from Perth to Augusta to see if it can go the distance on Australia's vast regional roads without running out of juice. ""Wherever it is viable, waste batteries should be collected via take-back schemes,"" he said. ""Investment will be required for waste battery collection infrastructure at transfer stations to manage batteries that are not effectively captured by any future take-back scheme, as not all sites are currently well set-up to manage waste batteries. ""We also need to ensure that our waste collection infrastructure … [is] set up to safely collect waste batteries to ensure that risks of electric shock, fire and contamination of the site are appropriately managed."" But analysts believe the bulk of the recycling will happen offshore, close to battery manufacturers. ""In your current battery technology, you've got lithium, you've got colbalt and you've got nickel sulphite, and all three of those commodities potentially could be recycled out of your existing battery"", Guiliano Sala Tenna from Bell Potter Securities said. ""So we think you'll see recycling that will look to separate the compounds and then perhaps do the blend with fresh ore as well, to produce future batteries. ""We think the natural participants in that market will be the manufacturers of the batteries themselves … we will see them invest in that in due course, but that's still five to 10 years off.""

397,How to keep your home mould-free in rainy weather,house-and-home,"  Mould can menace your house, clothes and car after heavy rain, so what can you do about it? First there is rain and then there is mould. It is a feature of Darwin's wet season as regular as heavy rain: patches of mould growing in corners, covering car seats and giving old clothes new designs. And while the dark patches are unsightly, they can also pose a number of health risks that often fly under the radar. In many instances the symptoms are so broad they can only be attributed to mould if they diminish when a person leaves a mould-infested environment. ""We can get very irritable; people get either depressed or aggressive, so behavioural changes,"" mycologist Dr Heike Neumeister-Kemp said. ""It can be irritable bowel syndrome, it can be fatigue and all kinds of headaches. ""In a nutshell, all type of fungi should be avoided because there's a possibility that they cause severe health effects."" Why is Darwin dominated by air-conditioned concrete houses with small backyards? To help mould-proof local homes, ABC Radio Darwin enlisted the help of Troppo Architect co-founder Phil Harris. When it came to the question of throwing windows and louvres open to the elements, Mr Harris laughed off the suggestion that a breezy tropical house could be insulated from the conditions outside. ""You've got to keep them open, surely,"" he said. ""The more open everything is, the less chance it has to build up the mould and mildew."" But some listeners begged to differ. Ben: ""I've been a cleaner in Darwin for over 20 years. Experience tells me keep things closed when you're not home and fans low or off."" Helen: ""I lived in Darwin 21 years. Closed louvres and cupboard doors always worked for me in a pre-cyclone elevated home."" Dr Neumeister-Kemp said keeping a house open in the warm daytime air before closing it to the cold moist night air was an effective mould-fighting strategy. But in Darwin, where the variations in temperature can be small and the wet season rain fairly constant, you should choose one option and stick with it. ""If you start shutting things, then you need to shut the house completely and you need to do something for humidity control,"" she said. If you're leaving everything open and inviting draughts through the house, then even a high relative humidity won't yield mould. ""If you think about tropics, like Bali, where they constantly have monsoonal rain, they don't have mould because absolutely everything is open and every single door is louvred."" Fans effectively keep mould at bay by improving ventilation in a room and drying it out. In the typically southern type of bunker-like brick housing, air conditioning can work well in conjunction with a sealed environment and well-insulated walls and ceilings. ""An energy-efficient box that's well sealed up and creates a totally internal environment is an answer,"" Mr Harris said. ""But it's a highly energy-efficient answer, and besides, it's bloody great fun when it's raining isn't it?"" But if the system is too cold the air conditioning can create conditions in which the mould can thrive. ""Even if it's at 24 degrees, if the outside humidity is too high and the air conditioning is not equipped to strip enough moisture out, you still can have problems,"" Dr Neumeister-Kemp said. This is because of the dew point, the temperature at which water droplets condense and dew can form. It correlates directly with humidity. The question of how light might affect this equation was raised by one listener. ""Leave the light on permanently in the bathroom. Mould grows in the dark,"" George said. But Dr Neumeister-Kemp disputed this, saying that both sunlight and artificial light were largely irrelevant because mould's outer cover protected it from UV light. ""It's much more important to keep the entire house out of dew point,"" she said. Because the dew point is tied directly to humidity, Darwin houses with higher temperatures can form mould if the air is also filled with moisture. If you've returned from weeks on holiday to find a wall populated with mould, what's the best antidote? In the Goldilocks-like range of potential products, a vinegar solution is just right. ""Bleach bleaches. It takes the colour out of mould and feeds it so it's absolutely not recommended,"" Dr Neumeister-Kemp said. ""Clove oil works but it leaves an oily residue so mould can grow on the oil later. It's also very expensive. ""But there are many, many publications that say an 80 per cent vinegar solution works because it's an osmotic pressure that pressurises the fungus and makes it explode."" This isn't as dramatic as it sounds, but it is a cheap, environmentally friendly solution to annual wet season mould.

398,"Barry's last stand: 81-year-old wins legal fight against developer, but is it too late?",house-and-home,"  Wantirna Caravan Park resident wins legal fight against developer, but is it too late? At 81, Barry Bedwell didn't expect to take on a corporate giant in court — never mind winning. Last year, after he was given notice to vacate his home for the past 14 years, the Wantirna Caravan Park in Melbourne's east, he took a big punt. ""It was a worthwhile gamble,"" he told the ABC. ""All my money is in the house. ""I thought I'll either get an extra 12 months or will have to walk away from the house."" In 2016, development company Longriver bought the land for $35.6 million, forcing the eviction of 153 permanent residents from the park. The firm plans to build 294 medium-density townhouses. Wantirna's residents were devastated, but most packed up and left. But in a David-and-Goliath fight, Mr Bedwell challenged the eviction notice in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). Mr Bedwell found the eviction notice in his letterbox, but it was not sent by registered post, and while it was also emailed to him, he had never agreed to use email to receive notices. Last week, the VCAT found the notices to vacate did not comply with the Residential Tenancies Act. Now, Longriver will have to re-issue a 365-day notice to vacate or buy his home. The company declined to comment on the VCAT ruling. They were homeowners who invested their life savings. Now many of the residents of Wantirna Caravan Park are walking away with almost nothing. And it's all legal. Unlike in New South Wales and Queensland, those living in residential parks in Victoria are not entitled to compensation when the land is sold from underneath them. The state's Residential Parks Act has been under review for the past two years. ""We considered this case could provide Barry and other vulnerable residents in the park with significantly more time to negotiate before being evicted,"" Victoria Legal Aid lawyer Joel Townsend said. Currently, Wantirna Caravan Park's streets are full of rubble or half-demolished homes, with furniture strewn around the site. The amenities have either been bulldozed or shut down. The pool is empty and locked. Mr Townsend said the park owners should continue to maintain the upkeep of the park, including keeping common areas, pool and BBQ facilities, gardens, roadways, paths and recreation areas clean and in a safe condition. It was a major win for Mr Bedwell — even though he does not live at Wantirna anymore. With eviction looming last year, Mr Bedwell moved into public housing to be closer to his wife after she was admitted to an aged-care home. The pensioner estimates his home is worth $160,000 but he has struggled to sell it, as it is too difficult to dismantle and relocate. ""We had planned to stay here for the rest of our lives,"" he said. ""This was a community. I knew 99 per cent of the people in the place. ""Now it's a ghost town."" However, Mr Bedwell's legal win paves the way for the last three residents still living at the park to also challenge their eviction. David Philliponi said his daughter was handed the eviction notice while he was away. ""It's wrong the way it's all been done,"" Mr Philliponi said. He bought his home in the park two years ago for $130,000. ""I don't have the option of moving [from] this place,"" he added. Patricia Broomhall's daughter and grand-daughter still live at the park. She said they received their eviction notice in the mailbox and now plan to get legal advice. ""She said, 'Mum they can come and bulldoze it with me in it',"" Ms Broomhall said. Peter Gray, from the Wantirna Residents Action Group, said for other residents it was too late. ""There would have been quite a few people that could have stayed here another 365 days,"" Mr Gray said. ""But we didn't know and people went into survival mode when time started to run out. Many have lost tens of thousands of dollars, selling their homes for just $1,500 in desperation.""

399,Is moving to the country the answer to housing affordability?,house-and-home,"  Moving to the country the answer to housing affordability for some, but prices are rising Real estate agents are reporting strong interest in regional property sales as first home buyers and retiring baby boomers realise the savings that can be made by a move to the country. Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce's advice to aspiring city homeowners a year ago was blunt. He told would-be buyers if they could not afford Melbourne or Sydney prices, they should stop complaining and 'go out west' to rural and regional Australia. And while his comments came in for a fair deal of criticism, Real Estate Institute of Australia president Malcolm Gunning believes the message resonated with many Australians. ""The combined regional average [house price] in Australia is $355,000, compared to the capital cities [average] of $656,000, which is a $300,000 difference,"" Mr Gunning said. ""Your average price in Sydney is just on $900,000, $895,000. Melbourne $720,000. ""It's an absolute no-brainer. It's half [the price in regional areas]."" Mr Gunning said while the market in regional Western Australia was down in 2017 and regional South Australia remained flat, agents in other areas reported strong interest, with high prices in Sydney and Melbourne spurring would-be buyers to look further afield. Figures compiled by CoreLogic for the 12 months to December 2017 showed strong price growth in regional New South Wales, up more than 7 per cent, while regional Tasmania was up 5.5 per cent, regional Victoria increased 4 per cent, and regional Queensland 1.3 per cent. We asked if you would move to the country as a way to get into the housing market. Read the discussion below. Living for decades in an inner-city Sydney neighbourhood where properties sell for more than $2 million, buying a house was not on Rebecca Noonan's radar. But after moving to the regional New South Wales city of Goulburn, she realised for the amount she was paying in rent she could be paying off her own home. She paid $420,000 for her home and moved in three months ago. ""It's a three-bedroom house in Goulburn. It's on a block of land which is about 700 metres square, so it's got a really big backyard,"" she said. Ms Noonan said given its proximity to Canberra and Sydney, property prices in Goulburn were on the rise. ""The market here has gone ahead really fast in the last three years and so people who are locals here would think that [$420,000] was a very high price,"" she said. ""But obviously those kind of judgements are very relative to what you are used to, and so my friends in Sydney think it's completely unbelievable."" While it was a job opportunity that brought Ms Noonan to Goulburn, for others wanting to make a tree change to a country town, finding employment in a rural or regional area can be a challenge. Should you sacrifice lifestyle to buy? Or just rent forever? Are there other ways? ""When you look at the drivers of why people move, affordability is one part, but typically employment is an even bigger factor for a lot of people,"" Kim Houghton, Regional Australia Institute general manager of policy and research, said. Mr Houghton said population statistics showed regional towns where residents could commute back to cities for work were reporting the strongest growth. ""When we look at some of the population growth rates across different places, they do seem to be stronger where there's an airport with a scheduled service or where there's a good train connection."" Mr Gunning agreed career opportunities in regional areas could be limited, but he believed the changing nature of work and the rise of telecommuters who could work remotely and travel to major cities when necessary would see the popularity of regional living increase. But Mr Houghton said while the National Broadband Network had opened up opportunities for professionals in the country, a reliable service remained elusive for many. ""Outages are a big issue in a lot of our more remote regions still,"" he said. ""There are communities we know who have had for whatever reason quite good ADSL services on landline. ""There's a real concern amongst some of those places that with the switch over to NBN, they may get lower quality access because there's not enough density of subscribers there for a quality NBN one. ""So the risk is that they'll lose what was quite a high quality landline-based service."" In regional Victoria, the historic gold rush town of Bendigo is witnessing steady population growth, with at least some of it spurred by the affordability of local housing. City of Bendigo regional sustainable development manager Trevor Budge said the local government area had been averaging an extra 1,700 residents per year in recent years, although the most recent statistics for 2015-16 showed a slightly higher rate of more than 2,000 new residents. Mr Budge said more affordable housing in Bendigo, compared to the capital cities, was a lure for some new residents. ""They can get a bigger house, they can get more land and they can perhaps get some features like a swimming pool, which would be beyond them financially in a metropolitan setting, or they'd be looking to go to the absolute fringes,"" he said. But he believed it was just one of a handful of drivers that included strong local employment, good health and education facilities, a lack of traffic congestion, regular train services and an upgraded highway linking the region to Melbourne. Back in Goulburn, Ms Noonan was still adjusting to life as a homeowner. Regulators finally admit Australia has a property bubble, but is it too late to deflate it without popping it? asks Ian Verrender. ""It does seem really strange to find myself in this situation where I kind of have a very generous and comfortable family home in a regional area,"" she said. ""But that also feels nice because it was really achievable and I don't feel over-stretched financially, and that's a really lovely way to have been able to do it."" She said regional living was an attractive option for those who could make it work, with several of her Sydney friends recently making a move to regional areas. ""To be able to get enough space to accommodate a young family in the inner city in Sydney is extremely costly, so lots of people are making those decisions just about quality of life and what they want their financial commitment to be. ""Things are much easier in the regions. If you are able to resolve the issue of employment, there are lots of advantages of being in a regional area.""

400,Does vinegar really kill household germs?,house-and-home," Health Does vinegar really kill household germs? Looking for a cheap and green alternative to the cleaning products on supermarket shelves? Plenty of people swear by vinegar. It's certainly inexpensive, non-toxic and biodegradable and has been used as a common disinfectant for thousands of years. But especially if you want to clean your kitchen or your bathroom, you might be wondering about household germs. Does vinegar really kill them? It seems the answer is a qualified ""yes"". It's not as effective as commercial cleaners — but it's still a useful disinfectant. Vinegar, be it white or malt or rosemary-infused, is about 5 per cent acetic acid. The acid kills bacteria and viruses, by chemically changing the proteins and fats that make up these nasties and destroying their cell structures. Some products take a long time to break down, and have unforeseen toxicities. When US researchers tested commercial cleaning products against alternatives like vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, they discovered that neat vinegar killed a range of household pathogens. Science also tells us, for example, that vinegar will kill off the flu virus. As part of research aimed at preparing us for a flu pandemic, UK researchers found that malt vinegar, much like bleach and washing up liquid, can rapidly inactivate the flu virus. More recently, US researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine found that vinegar efficiently killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis — the bacteria that causes tuberculosis — after 30 mins of exposure to a six per cent acetic solution. Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician at the Australian National University's medical school, says: ""TB is a hard-to-kill bacteria, so the fact that it works against them means most other bacteria will likely be killed by vinegar as well."" Indeed, it could even be an effective and economical solution to laboratories and hospital settings in resource-poor countries. We asked if you used vinegar as a household cleaning agent. Share your tips in the comments. Nevertheless, when it comes to cleaning the house, keep it simple. Rather than concentrating on disinfecting surfaces or exterminating all those nasty bugs, Professor Collignon says we should focus on cleaning with hot soapy water. ""You've got to clean the surface first and that's usually enough. Then you have to ask yourself whether you need to disinfect at all,"" he says. Good old-fashioned elbow grease is the trick to cleaning effectively, Professor Collignon adds, because you are ""physically decreasing the number of bacteria present and washing them down the sink"". What risk do the chemicals in your home really pose? The act of rubbing and scrubbing breaks down a slimy matrix around certain types of bacteria, allowing disinfectants, such as vinegar, to get to work. ""Disinfectants work by having a 99 per cent kill [rate] in say 10 minutes,"" Professor Collignon says. ""That means if there were 1,000,000 bacteria present, there would still be 10,000 left afterwards."" But if you did some basic scrubbing first, you might well reduce the bacteria present to say, around 1000. If you then use vinegar to take out a further 99 per cent, you could end up with only 10 bacteria: much fewer than the 10,000 you'd still have if you'd relied on vinegar alone, Professor Collignon points out. As for commercial cleaners, he says we don't always need the level of disinfection in the home that these products provide. ""We over-use chemicals. Instead of using one unit, we use 1000 units, and the benefits are marginal,"" he says. ""All of us would like to use a magic potion so that we don't have to use the elbow grease. But that's a false premise."" If you are going to use a product when cleaning, how do you decide which is best?

401,Doctor had to plead for boy with lung problems to be moved out of mouldy rental house,house-and-home,"  Doctor had to plead for boy with lung problems to be moved out of mouldy rental house Jemima Balhas and her young son lived in a rental home with a serious mould problem for seven years, despite pleas from their doctor for them to be rehoused. She is now fighting for compensation after losing all her belongings due to the risk of contamination. Lawyers said the case highlighted the need for minimum standards for rental properties to protect people's health and safety. Ms Balhas said she first noticed mould spots in 2011, six months after she moved in. She said a contractor, who came to the house when she reported the problem to Aboriginal Housing Victoria, told her it was due to her weight and was condensation due to heavy breathing. Eighteen months later, she said the mould had started to grow on her baby son's bassinette. ""[It had] dots like someone had gone to it with a marker. It was pretty shocking,"" Ms Balhas told the ABC. She said repeated complaints led to a few repairs, but the flaking walls, mould patches, and water stains kept returning. ""I would clean it away, I tried everything, but it would come back thicker,"" she said. Her now five-year-old son Tobias has asthma and bronchiolitis, and when his health deteriorated this year, she got legal advice. ""Him breathing in the air is making his little lungs weaker,"" Ms Balhas said. ""It's not fair on him."" Last month, lawyers acting on Ms Balhas's behalf took the matter to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. A mould inspection ordered by the tribunal uncovered some inside walls had up to 90 per cent moisture levels — well exceeding the allowable limit of 15 per cent. The cause was identified as lack of waterproofing in the shower, a possible roof leak and a broken exhaust fan. ""This property is seriously contaminated and not habitable,"" the report stated. ""No-one should enter this property [until] a clearance certificate is provided."" Ms Balhas and her son are now staying in temporary housing at a caravan park in Bairnsdale, in Victoria's east. Tobias's Christmas and birthday presents remain at the house with all their belongings, due to contamination fears. Dr Jane Greacen said the mouldy conditions left Tobias in danger of developing a fungal pneumonia. Since 2013, she has written three separate letters to Aboriginal Housing Victoria stating the health risks the mould posed to the boy. In September, Dr Greacen wrote it was a matter of urgency he be removed from the house. ""Tobias's asthma with his history of bronchiolitis is being aggravated by living in this house,"" Dr Greacen wrote. ""The house is full of mould … it is clearly unsafe for any person living in it."" Aboriginal Housing Victoria said it did provide a range of assistance to Ms Balhas, including applying a mould treatment, repainting, and the servicing of a heater. However, AHV said more recently the mould problem had escalated and Ms Balhas and her son would be rehoused. AHV is now investigating the cause of the problem. ""Aboriginal Housing Victoria will pay for the removal and cleaning costs for the furnishings that can be restored,"" director of strategy and performance John Templeman told the ABC. The housing body has offered her $1,000 to replace her soft furnishings and will remediate her electrical appliances. ""These commitments are made on the assumption that the damage caused to the building are a result of structural defects in the building and not related to any tenant related damage or neglect,"" Mr Templeman said. ""There are a number of claims in the ABC story that AHV cannot verify, such as the claim that letters from Jemima's doctor were ignored. AHV has no evidence that this occurred."" The Housing Officer Manager at the housing organisation will now ensure Ms Balhas is properly signed up to a new rental property. Microbiologist Dr Cameron Jones said mould in buildings was a widespread problem and the serious health risks were not being recognised. ""The first signs of water damage or mould need to be gotten on top of quickly. Mould will quickly grow on any building product that contains a carbon source or a food source,"" Dr Jones said. Dr Jones said dangerous situations arise when the mould was growing unseen in a wall or ceiling, becoming ""a toxic hazard"". Mould can cause respiratory risks in people with asthma or allergies, and long-term health impacts can include chronic inflammatory syndromes in people with poor immune systems. The ABC showed Dr Jones photographs from inside Ms Balhas's rental, along with the recent mould report. ""I would be very concerned not just because of the spores that are in the indoor air but from the viable mould, the whole home would be a toxic hazard,"" he said. ""It's negligence permitting anyone to remain in a home with such obvious visible defects."" He also doesn't believe the level of water damage could have been caused by the tenant. ""This is years of damage,"" he said. Joel Townsend from Victoria Legal Aid said one of the most common complaints from tenants was about mould, and the default position of most landlords was to blame the tenant. He said Ms Balhas's case pointed to the need for minimum standards in all states and territories, to ensure buildings have proper ventilation and are structurally sound. Currently, specific minimum standards for rentals exist in only Tasmania and South Australia. ""We are not talking about providing the Taj Mahal. We are talking about providing tenants with that basic minimum set of standards so they can enjoy their property without worrying about the risk to their health and safety,"" Mr Townsend said. ""The international experience and so far in Tasmania and South Australia is that it doesn't reduce housing stock and it doesn't drive up rent."" Ms Balhas is expected to be rehoused five days before Christmas. Editor's note December 19, 2017: This story initially reported that an AHV housing officer made the statements about Ms Balhas' weight. However, documents tendered at VCAT state the comments were made by a contractor sent to the house by AHV.

402,opinion: Renters should be allowed to list their homes on Airbnb,house-and-home,"  Renters should be allowed to list their homes on Airbnb As a tenant who goes away for work trips or short holidays once or twice a year, one of my plans to bring me closer to buying my own home is having someone stay at my place. Airbnb has given me this flexibility and provides host protection insurance. However, it always comes at an anxiety-riddled cost where I don't fully understand what my rights are. My current rental agreement stipulates that permission must be sought to sublet, which the landlord must not withhold unreasonably. But when I asked I was denied. Devon LaSalle from Tenants Victoria told me there is nothing definitive under the Residential Tenancies Act that defines if services such as Airbnb are considered a sublet and that this is currently under review by the Victorian Government. She says: ""The question of whether Airbnb could be considered a sublet is difficult to answer, as it may depend greatly on the case involved. There was a case last year where the Supreme Court ruled that a sublet was undertaken in that particular instance, which may give precedent to future cases of that nature."" Camping on beaches, crashing with friends and living out of their cars. Local residents say housing affordability in Byron Shire is at crisis point. In that case, a tenant was issued a notice to vacate for using Airbnb. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal found the landlord could not evict the tenants because they ""had technically not sublet their apartment"" and that the Airbnb platform ""provided merely a licence to occupy"" without ""exclusive possession"" and ""the nature of the legal relationship between the tenants and Airbnb guests was not a tenancy"". But that decision was overturned in the Supreme Court. However Justice Clyde Croft warned against the appeal being used as a test case for the legality of Airbnb in Victoria and said this case was about the particulars of the lease in question. We asked if you thought renters should be allowed to list their homes on Airbnb. Read the discussion below. A spokesperson from Airbnb said that hosts should familiarise themselves with local regulations but that those regulations are ""difficult to understand and outdated"". LaSalle says: ""Some of the recommendations put forward are designed to restrict tenants from using services such as Airbnb. However, Tenants Victoria is concerned that the way these proposed changes have been written is so broad that they could be used against any guest a tenant has staying in their home if that guest contributes to the household in any manner. This includes short stays by family members, having someone housesit for you, or receiving overnight childcare."" When I quizzed my real estate agent on my rights, including unreasonably withholding consent, my refusal was downgraded to a ""we prefer you don't but we leave it to you"". Barcelona is cracking down on short-term tourist rentals amid rising rents. ""Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for renters to avoid speaking up about issues for fear of retribution in one form or another,"" LaSalle tells me. ""The best thing any renter can do to avoid any issues with their tenancy is to know their rights and responsibilities."" If I am allowing someone to stay at my place, I make sure they have an impeccable rating because all my belongings remain in the house. Policy Officer Yaelle Caspi who appeared in the VCAT case for the tenants said, ""We don't see why this is any different to a tenant having a friend or family member stay as a guest"". I couldn't agree more. LaSalle elaborates: 'Tenants Victoria believes that the tenant's grant of 'exclusive possession' of the rental property gives them the right to make their own decisions about who they have stay in their home, regardless of whether payment or consideration is received. 'The landlord is in no way disadvantaged when a tenant chooses to participate in services like Airbnb. The landlord still receives their rental payment from the tenant as usual, and the tenant is still ultimately responsible for any potential damage that could occur from guests they have in their home.' Australians are embracing the sharing economy, but there are concerns websites like Airbnb are exacerbating the rental affordability crisis. Airbnb has been accused of worsening housing affordability by soaking up residential properties for tourist accommodation, while detracting from the available rental stock and pushing up rents. But Airbnb says that in Australia, more than two-thirds of the listings are sharing the home the host lives in. A report by the Tenants' Union of NSW found that the home sharing did not appear to be pushing up rents, even in areas where this is prevalent. Using Airbnb is a win for me and a win for the suffocating rental market, because using it will help me get out of it faster. First home owner's grants are great, but the flexibility to use Airbnb is a great way government can support potential home owners. This includes making it illegal to add Airbnb-type clauses into rental agreements. Earlier this month, the Victorian government decided not to allow apartment buildings to limit Airbnb use, thus protecting apartment owner rights. While tenants have welcomed recent reforms in NSW and Victoria including the right to have a pet, we'd love the government to do more to protect our rights. As the Tenants' Union of NSW report stated: ""Tenants experience significant extra hurdles to enjoy their homes in the way that owner occupiers do. If Airbnb is accepted as a legitimate use of premises for occasional personal use, then there should be no restriction on tenants' use of Airbnb which is not equally applied to owner-occupiers"".

403,A tale of two cities reveals Australia's vast gulf in housing affordability,house-and-home," Updated 
    
      December 05, 2017 20:08:59 New data reveals just how long it takes you to save for a home in every area across Australia — from the good, to the bad and the very ugly.  The stark contrast between Australia's east and west coast housing markets has been laid bare in new data which reveals it now takes Sydney first-home buyers twice as long to save a 20 per cent deposit for a median-priced home than punters in the post-mining boom city of Perth. The data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the census and property monitoring firm CoreLogic, and compiled by Bankwest.  The figures used in the study, compiled for every Local Government Area (LGA) in Australia, have been calculated based on ABS income data of the average combined salary for two people aged between 25-34, saving 20 per cent of their pre-tax income in a high-interest savings account. The study tells a tale of two cities, with Perth now the most affordable mainland state capital, taking just 3.9 years for first-home buyers to save a deposit. It is a far different story in Sydney, where buyers require 8.2 years to save a deposit — well above the national average of 4.6 years. Just five years ago the situation was the reverse. Perth property prices were booming, fuelled by the state's mining industry. But since the sector stalled in 2012 values have been in decline, falling a further 4.3 per cent over the past financial year alone while Sydney prices have jumped 11 per cent.  New South Wales is home to eight of the nation's top 10 LGAs where it takes a first-home buyer couple the longest time to save. Sydney buyers need on average 8.2 years to save the $215,133 deposit required to purchase a median-priced house, three years longer than the national capital city average of 4.9 years.  When regional areas are included, the average saving time reduces to six years. New South Wales boasts the lowest proportion of first-home buyers, who account for just 8.1 per cent of total sales.  Across the country in Perth, more than a fifth of total buyers in the 2016/17 financial year were purchasing their first home, fuelled by falling house prices. It now takes around 3.9 years to save the $103,046 deposit for a median-priced home, one year less than the national average.  When the entire State is taken into account, the saving time falls to 3.6 years. Despite a post-boom economy in decline, Perth retains the title of the most unaffordable LGA — Peppermint Grove — where it would take 21.2 years to save a deposit of $673,000.  Melbourne remains the second-most expensive property market in the country, but is rapidly gaining ground on its northern neighbour with prices rising 14.2 per cent during the 2016/17 financial year. First-home buyers looking in the city need to save for 6.4 years to amass the $153,008 deposit for a median-priced property, an increase of eight months on last year.  Despite strong prices and weak wages growth, the introduction of stamp duty concessions on properties up to $750,000 boosted the first-home buyer market, recording a 3 per cent rise in buyers for the year to August 2017.  Queensland's market has remained relatively stable but has recorded a massive 11.2 per cent jump in first-home buyer purchases, driven by the extension of a $20,000 grant for new homes until the end of the year. Brisbane buyers take on average 4.5 years to save the $105,950 deposit for a median-priced property, largely in line with last year's figures.  The holiday town of Noosa trumped Queensland's State capital, reporting a 13.6 per cent rise in house prices during the period.  It takes just over $90,000 to lay down a 20 per cent deposit on a house in Adelaide, the lowest of any mainland state, but only one in every 10 properties are sold to first-home buyers. That is driven by the state being home to the oldest population demographic after Tasmania, and the fact people aged between 25-34 have the second-lowest average wages in the country of just $51,629.  Adelaide first-home buyer couples require 4.2 years to save the $90,665 deposit on a median-priced property, a figure largely unchanged from last year. Just under $78,000 will secure you a 20 per cent deposit on a house in Hobart, while a little over $60,000 will be enough to help you buy outside of the city. Prices in Hobart rose 8.6 per cent over the period, but the average saving time of 3.8 years to save the $77,812 deposit remains the lowest of the state capitals. Perth couple Dirk Black and Isabelle Southern have been putting money away since finishing university. ""[We started saving] once I had stable work, not necessarily with the intention of buying a house, but making sure I had some sort of savings together,"" Mr Black said. Four years on, and at just 26 years of age, they pooled their funds to snag their first property five kilometres east of Perth's CBD, taking full advantage of Perth's plummeting house prices.  ""I think [the market] definitely had a positive influence. I guess it pushed us to act a little bit quicker rather than wait another 12 months [or] a year and a half down the track,"" Mr Black said. ""It took roughly four years because we pooled our funds together,"" he said. ""I went back to uni and then I got a part-time job last year, so that's when I was putting more aside. We're not really big spenders so that's helped,"" Isabelle Southern said. More than 20 per cent of total purchases in Western Australia were made by first-home buyers during the past financial year, while in New South Wales they only accounted for just 8.1 per cent.  ""Across the country we're seeing very different markets and across the 421 local government [areas] we're seeing very different markets,"" Bankwest general manager of personal and small business banking, Donna Dalby, said. ""The accessibility for first-time buyers to get into the market varies greatly."" ""Western Australia, or Perth in terms of capital cities, is one of the most accessible markets. ""Some of the reasons for that is that house prices have fallen in the Perth market … we're coming out the other side of the boom, we're in the production phase of the mining boom which isn't as labour-intensive.""  Alistair and Penelope Clifton are part of the small minority in Sydney making their first purchase, but to get into the market they were forced to team up with family. ""We formed our little syndicate with the two of us and my young brother,"" Mr Clifton said. ""I consulted Tom — my younger brother — and said, 'Are you keen to buy a property?' ""He was keen and it made it feasible for us if there's three people paying off a mortgage rather than two."" They chose to buy an investment property first with the plan of eventually using the property's capital growth to purchase their own home. ""We will get to a point where … we're renting no more, but I can't see us buying a home in the next 10 years,"" he said. ""That's why we bought this investment property and hopefully we might be able to buy another one in the next 10 years and then maybe sell them. ""Then we both split up and and then we might be able to have the money to buy our own house.""  Topics:

404,"House prices lower on streets with silly names, study finds",house-and-home,"  Property prices lower on streets with silly names, high school students find If you are looking for an affordable home in your preferred suburb, it may pay to find the street with the silliest name. House prices on streets with silly names are significantly lower than houses on nearby streets, a study by Victorian school students has found. High school girls at Sacred Heart College (SHC) in Geelong conducted the research with guidance from the school's head of science, Adam Cole. The students identified 27 streets in Victoria with silly names, including Butt Street, Wanke Road and Fanny Street. ""We looked at them on Google Maps and found two adjacent streets with relatively normal names,"" Dr Cole told ABC Radio Melbourne's Jon Faine. Working with staff from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the University of Sydney and a Melbourne real estate agent, the girls analysed house sales on the streets over the past 47 years. They found that property prices in streets with silly names were about 20 per cent lower than properties in the normally-named roads. As the report notes, that amounts to a $140,000 saving on a median-priced Melbourne house. We asked if you would live on Wanke Road or Fanny Street if it meant paying less for your house. Read the discussion in the comments. To explore the reasons behind their findings, the girls surveyed 323 adults about their attitudes towards silly street names. One third of those surveyed said they would not be happy living in a street with a name like Beaver Street, Willys Avenue or Grogan Court. Dr Cole said it was likely this affected the supply-and-demand equation for properties on those streets. ""We think that there is a proportion of people that would not be comfortable living in those streets, so they don't compete for those properties and that would drive prices down,"" he said. ""We think it's probably got to do with a proportion of people being embarrassed by the address when they have to give it out."" The silly name effect was more prevalent in the capital city suburbs than in regional areas, Dr Cole said, which was ""probably because there's more supply, there's more choice in Melbourne"". The price discrepancy was also greater in lower-priced properties than more expensive ones. The team behind the study analysed more than 4,500 property sales totalling nearly $1.5 billion to reach their findings. The research was conducted by members of SHC's Bradbury Club, which students can elect to join to pursue long-term science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) projects. ""We don't talk about science, we don't talk about coding or geography or anything like that,"" Dr Cole said. ""We just have a project to do, and we get it done, but along the way the girls will be learning.""

405,The House Detective: Uncovering Brisbane's home secrets,house-and-home,"  Meet the Brisbane house detective uncovering histories of people's homes Imagine if the walls in your home could talk. Marianne Taylor, aka The House Detective, is on a mission to research the history of Brisbane's old homes and reveal their stories. Ms Taylor has looked into large Victorian mansions through to small, humble fibro post-war cottages throughout south-east Queensland. ""Each home has a story to tell,"" she told ABC Radio Brisbane's Craig Zonca. ""I discover [stories about] families and people that are often long forgotten in Brisbane. ""There can often be an attitude where people don't think the house is old enough, but every house has a story and the people that live in them."" Growing up, Ms Taylor was interested in the mysteries hidden in old houses. The self-proclaimed history nerd now spends her days trying to track down their histories. ""Newspaper articles play a big part,"" she said. ""It's time-consuming as you have to go to so many resources. ""I go and visit the State Library, the State Archives, for the certificate of title for the land, for the owners' names and the like, as well as online. ""It depends on the house too, as clues from the house I follow like a detective."" Ms Taylor said she was often called on when people uncovered something such as a newspaper clipping or unidentified item in their home. ""One lady called when she heard odd noises and sounds and felt a presence in her house,"" she said. ""She had paranormal investigators out who said they felt the ghost of an old man that died suddenly in the house, and a young girl. ""She wanted me to see if the history of the house matched those two spirits. ""The man's name was Jack, which is a common name, but there was an owner of the house named Jack too but he didn't die in the house."" Last year Ms Taylor undertook a project in which she researched houses built between 1940 and 1970. ""It was fascinating as you got to see changes in houses that also reflected social changes during the time,"" she said. ""For example, in the early 20th century people stopped having servants, so smaller kitchens became the centre of the home and small discreet rooms became open plan, which we still have today."" She said it was always exciting to present her findings to home owners and to help them connect with the history of their houses. ""It's amazing to see the links of the current owners to the past ones, like if they both liked sailing,"" Ms Taylor said. ""I've had a run of houses this year where I've been able to link the current owners of a house with past owners. ""It's amazing because you see them share the stories of the house and bond over the house ... it makes the house bigger.""

406,Architect shows how small home can replace McMansion,house-and-home,"  You don't need a McMansion: Perth architect builds 170sqm environmentally-friendly home Amid a streetscape of densely packed, double-brick and tile suburban homes, House A stands out — it is tall, grey, has a high-pitched roof and looks strikingly different to the infill housing nearby. Architect Kate Fitzgerald's aim is to show the people of Perth how they can have spacious houses without building yet another McMansion. ""I'm not a typical property developer. I'm trying to introduce some new ideas,"" Ms Fitzgerald said. In partnership with her father, Ms Fitzgerald bought an old house in the beachside suburb of Scarborough sitting on a 600 square metre lot. House A sits on just 170 square metres; Houses B and C will follow. ""It is a single-bedroom lot dwelling on 170 square metre block, which is a lot smaller than the other lots in the area,"" Ms Fitzgerald said. ""It's a living area of 70 square metre on top of a garage — so it is small living, but it's tall."" In addition to the bedroom, there is ""a study/dining room/spare bedroom — whatever you need it to be"". ""I think that's a really important thing to have in a house if it's a one bedder,"" Ms Fitzgerald said. We asked if you would live in an environmentally-friendly home over a ""McMansion"". Read the discussion below. The house is a classic house shape, with square sides and a tall, pitched roof. There is a mezzanine floor for the bedroom and bathroom. The living area is just 3 metres wide, a size Ms Fitzgerald has long tried to convince her clients is enough if you have the right design principles guiding you. ""There are things about doing your own project as an architect … I know this is going to work,"" she said. ""I'm going to do it and show people that you do not have to have project home-sized rooms. ""It's actually a tiny living space, but it's about having the best connection you can have between outdoors and indoors that makes it such a liveable house for the size that it is."" Ms Fitzgerald hopes House A will show people they can build a liveable house on a small piece of land. She said it was vital Perth be infilled and densify without people feeling squeezed. ""I recently did an analysis of a project home design, and out of 139 square metres on the ground floor, almost 100 square metres of it was unusable small spaces — dog legged corridors, water closets, an internet room, linen cupboards,"" she said. ""Just 39 square metres was for kitchen, dining and living. ""In this house our wasted space is around 10 to 15 per cent, so we need a lot less square meterage to achieve the results we have. ""You can get a smaller block of land and you can build a smaller house and you can live in the suburb that you want."" Ms Fitzgerald has also tried to make the house as environmentally-friendly as possible. ""It's 2017 and it's time to accept that buildings do damage to the environment,"" she said. ""As an architect, it's a really hard thing to get your head around, that the thing you love doing and embrace doing is a thing that does cause damage. ""If you use recycled bricks then you are supporting sustainability and also the local economy and small business."" House A not only uses recycled brick, but the kitchen cabinets have come from the old house on the block, which in the future will be renovated to become House B in the triplex. ""We have a rain tank under our deck,"" Ms Fitzgerald said. ""We made the concrete using 65 per cent recycled content. There are some solar panels."" And the house also has no air conditioning. ""We don't need it,"" she explained. ""Our walls have big, 70mm-thick foam panels in them, and the roof has almost 150mm of foam. ""We have oriented the house to get really amazing sea breezes during the day. ""Why would you want an air conditioner if you don't actually need one?"" House A will be open to the public as part of Open House Perth on November 11 and 12, and Ms Fitzgerald said she was looking forward to showing people her home. ""I'm a firm believer that design is for everyone and I think that's what Open House is about,"" she said. ""Every day, the designers I know are trying to make our work more accessible to the public. ""It does cost more money to build a house like this but you're building less of a house, so we're trying to get that message out there — that architecture is something that is affordable to everyone.""

407,Living in a home the size of two parking spaces,house-and-home,"  Tiny houses: What it's like living in an apartment the size of two parking spaces Could you live in an apartment that is just 24 square metres? That is one-tenth the size of a tennis court, or just two parking spaces. Clare Davidson found her tiny space for sale in the heart of Fremantle's historic west end two years ago. ""It was just under $300,000 and that put it as one of the cheapest properties in Fremantle that I have ever seen,"" she said. ""For property in Fremantle at the moment that [figure] seems like a good deal, until you look at it per square metre. ""But they say buy the worst house on the best street."" The space faces directly onto Pakenham Street. When Ms Davidson found the apartment, it had no kitchen and ""the bathroom was kind of a cave"". It had previously been used as a storage room by a local café, and it was attached to an old warehouse that has since been converted to luxury apartments. In fact, part of the neighbour's staircase juts through a corner of Ms Davidson's space. The façade of the building is heritage-listed, and that meant enlarging the windows or changing the small front door was impossible. But Ms Davidson was not perturbed. Here's what some of our readers said about whether they could live in a house this tiny. ""It provided a design challenge which really appealed,"" she said. ""There is something very precious about the size of it and how it is right in the centre of Fremantle, but it feels somehow secret. ""You come in through these two tiny little glass doors and it's right off the street front, but no-one would even know that it's here. ""So when you are inside you kind of feel like you are tucked away safely from the street, but still in amongst it."" The space had one big redeeming feature — a double height ceiling. That meant friend and architect Emerald Wise was able to create a mezzanine floor above the kitchen for Ms Davidson's bedroom. There is an open living space on the ground floor complete with a shower bathroom. A large bathtub sits on the mezzanine level. ""I like to tell people that it's a one-bedroom, two-bathroom place,"" Ms Davidson said, laughing. Ms Davidson and Ms Wise did a lot of the build work themselves, using second-hand and recycled materials throughout. ""I love the kitchen a lot because it was all made with recycled marri and blackbutt and put together by an incredible carpenter,"" Ms Davidson said. ""Lots of things that ended up being part of this build were from the side of the road. ""I found a Smeg oven on the side of the road. That's my pride and joy; an electrician friend got it working."" The finished space is something the architect and the home owner are incredibly pleased with. ""Clare brought me down here when they were selling the place and said 'What do you think — we could do something couldn't we?'"" Ms Wise recalled. ""And I though 'Oh, here Clare goes again'. ""But I thought it was a really great opportunity to do a little infill project, and it's worked out really well. ""I personally strongly believe that Perth needs to densify, and I guess this is a prime example of how that can work beautifully."" Ms Davidson said opening her apartment to the public for the Open House Perth festival would give people the chance to see that 24 square metres really is a liveable space. ""I'm really looking forward to hearing what people think,"" she said. ""And to talk to people about whether they think they could live here, because it's such a tiny space and not really how most people consider a residence."" Keanu Breeze is open to the public on November 11 and 12 from 10:00am to 2:00pm. The ABC Perth building will be open on Saturday, November 11 from 9:00am to 3:00pm as part of Open House Perth.

408,Ten years of back-breaking work worth it for home builder's grand design,house-and-home,"  Open House Perth: 10 years of back-breaking work sees carpenter's grand design come to life Ten years, a broken back and a sewer running through the main living area would not, and could not, stop Pat Gaffney from building his very own ""grand design"" in Perth's South Fremantle. Mr Gaffney has a background as a carpenter. He said he had always wanted to build a modern house, and settled on the perfect place — a block of land next door to the historic house where he had lived with his family for decades. ""We had lived next door for 30 years and really like the community, so there was no point in moving,"" Mr Gaffney said. The 320-square-metre plot had been the family's garden for 20 years. ""We had the land, so it made sense to do it here,"" he said. Mr Gaffney worked with architect Dimitri Kapetas to draw up the plans, but he was determined to build the house himself. Even in the design stages, the project — a three-bedroom, double storey family home — proved complex. A main sewer runs underground diagonally across the block, from front to back. ""The sewer is buried underground but you can't actually build over it, you have to build around it,"" Mr Gaffney said. ""So we had to design around that, and that's what has created the interesting shapes in the house."" Most of the rooms sit diagonally on either side of the sewer, but the house is not divided into two buildings. ""We have a tunnel through the house that is a room, but it is virtually demountable,"" he said. The design satisfies access requirements, but Mr Gaffney admitted there was a ""slim possibility"" one day his central living area could be dug up for sewer maintenance. ""I'm confident that they will never have to do it,"" he added, smiling. The plans alone took five years to draw up, then Mr Gaffney began building. ""Dimitri drew the plans to a stage where I could build it, and a lot of the interior detail I have just done myself as I went along,"" he said. ""I didn't really know at the start what I wanted. ""Money was probably the main thing,"" he said of deciding to do it himself rather than employing a builder. ""And I just wanted to do it. ""I'd be the worst client. I think I'd be too fussy."" Mr Gaffney also runs a catering business that mainly operates on weekends. He said that business, and the fact he lived next door to the building site, had given him the flexibility and time to build the house to his standard over the past five years. Despite the long haul, he said he never got tired of the project. ""I've maintained my energy and didn't lose interest,"" he said. ""I had a bit of disaster one year in. I fell off the top storey and broke my back. Also broke my kneecap. That set me back for a bit. I was in hospital for about 10 days. ""Everything's fine now. My back is 100 per cent better. My knee is still a bit sore but I can still get on and do most things."" The finished house is a modern, angular mix of concrete flooring and highly crafted timber detail. The walls are made from a material called R9, which is fairly lightweight but highly insulated. ""R9 is polystyrene and CFC sheeting, and it's about 200mm thick, making the house like an esky,"" Mr Gaffney said. ""It has double glazed windows and Bondor roofing, which is a sandwich panel of metal and foam. ""It's a self-supporting roof so the whole structure upstairs is really cool in summer and warm in winter."" Having finally finished the house, Mr Gaffney is now opening it up to the public as a part of the Open House Perth festival on Sunday, November 12. ""I'm really satisfied with it,"" he said of the finished product. ""Just going through the process, it was really difficult at times, working out how to do things, so to get to a stage where you have achieved all your goals and gotten through it is really satisfying."" The Silver Street House is open to the public from 10:00am to 5:00pm as part of Open House Perth.

409,Local demand fuelling real estate sales boom in Tasmania,house-and-home,"  Local demand fuelling real estate sales boom in Tasmania, report says Tasmanian buyers, not interstate investors, are driving the boost in the state's real estate sales, according to the latest industry report. The Real Estate Institute of Tasmania (REIT) said three quarters of all sales in the September quarter were local buyers, while mainlanders snapped up just 23 per cent of properties, and foreign purchasers bought only 13 properties, or 1 per cent of sales. REIT said its data suggested several of the major real estate analysts were wrong to suggest the market was being driven by mainland investment. REIT President Tony Collidge said Tasmania's real estate and rental markets continued to be driven by strong local demand. ""Favourable economic conditions, a robust tourism market, and consumer optimism are encouraging positive growth within the state,"" he said. ""I think everyone on the Big Island thinks they affect everything that happens down here, but quite to the contrary, we are our own island, we have our economy and that's what's driving things in the marketplace,"" he said. The REIT's quarterly report revealed sales in the three months to the end of September reached a total of more than $914 million, compared with $756 million in the same period in 2016. Sales will gross $3.8 billion for the year if the momentum in the latest quarter continues, representing an 11 per cent increase on last year. The report highlighted Launceston as this year's ""shining light"" with sales up more than 20 per cent. Agents in the north-west also experienced an increase of more than 14 per cent to a record 176 sales. The report found the market continued to tighten, with vacancy rates falling statewide. In Hobart the rates are at historical lows. Mr Collidge said rental vacancy rates were the lowest they have ever been. ""We're now finding that Launceston is starting to impact up there as well, the vacancy rate, they're now down below 3 per cent,"" he said. ""I've been doing real estate for 23 years and I've never know anything like this to happen before. ""The conundrum in Hobart is that as soon as the property is listed we could literally sell it, any real estate agent could sell a property listed, probably within 24 hours, which makes it really hard for the buyers, and rental vacancy rates are at 2 per cent. ""Normally your rental market is high and your real estate market is low, and then the converse happens, now they're both at a stage where there's not a surplus on either side, they both have shortages and that creates a real dilemma. ""I have an office which has 430 rental properties, we have about three or four vacancies in that office at the moment, and we've got 380-odd people waiting, with their names down, to try and find a rental property.""

411,The tiny house revolution told in pictures and floorplans,house-and-home,"  The tiny house revolution told in pictures and floorplans The micro-home fascination is building in Australia as those driven out of the traditional housing market turn to alternative designs. Author and researcher Catherine Foster has travelled Australia to document how 21 architects have made functional living spaces in 90 square metres or less. ""We're not inventing the wheel, we are repurposing the wheel,"" she told News Breakfast. ""A few generations ago here in Australia, 90 square metres was a family house. ""It is only in comparatively recent decades that it has crept up and crept up and crept up."" Ms Foster has now released a book, Small House Living Australia, to showcase her findings and outline the floorplans that work. A CommSec study found the average new-home build in Australia in 2015/16 was 231 square metres — just shy of the US average of 249sq/m. A recent study by Griffith University research fellow Heather Shearer also found a growing interest in small homes in the past two years. She found people were primarily drawn to the concept for economic reasons, rather than an aesthetic desire. Take a look at the comments to see what our readers had to say about building a tiny house. ""In a possible reflection of the strong demand for urban living, the most important driver was, 'Too expensive property in preferred area',"" Ms Shearer wrote. ""Then came: wanting to reduce overall debt, not wanting a mortgage, wishing to downsize, and housing too expensive in general."" Ms Foster said she found people were seeking flexibility as well as affordability, and that lifestyle was a big factor. ""Young people are [saying] 'get me a home' and 'we would rather it not be out in the suburbs an hour along the motorway, we would rather be close to our community',"" she said. ""Older people, perhaps downsizing and Baby Boomers are going, 'We want to free up ourselves. We want to go travelling. We want to have a small place where we can go for coffee at the end of the street'."" When it came to successfully creating a smaller living space, Ms Foster said they key word was ""multifunctional"". ""No longer do you have a dedicated room for a laundry or a dedicated room for a TV or whatever. You are going to have those shared,"" she said. ""The dining room would be an integrated thing within the living space … they are all there.""

412,Are northern-facing solar panels the best for your roof?,house-and-home,"  Are northern-facing solar panels the best for your roof? The northern side of a roof is the most common place for solar panels to be mounted in Australia, as that side gets the most sunlight over the course of a sunny day. But while the panels might get the most light, it doesn't necessarily come at the right time for all families, ShineHub solar consultant Alex Georgiou told ABC Radio Adelaide. Mr Georgiou is working with South Australian charities, including the National Trust SA, SA Conservation Council and the Australian Solar Council, to help them get better returns for their solar systems. Although current systems are aligned to get the best energy input during the day, with dropping rebate rates for electricity sent back to the grid, Mr Georgiou suggested it was time for many people to rethink their set-ups. He told ABC Radio Adelaide the smartest financial choice was once to feed the power back in, but now it might be better to produce power when you need it most. ""Instead of wanting to get this high feed-in tariff credit, [now] you want to use all of the power in your house,"" he said. Mr Georgiou said the traditional solar panel mounting on the northern side ensured most of the power was produced in the middle of the day — when we are not home to use it. ""If you are working and not home, all you are doing is buying solar and giving all that power back to the grid,"" Mr Georgiou said. ""The bills don't go down and [people] think '[solar] doesn't work'."" Mr Georgiou said you can get the best panels and system, but if it is not working the most efficiently when you need it, you're not getting the benefits. ""If the panels are on the east face in the morning, you are able to use that power when you wake up,"" he said. ""On the west face, in the afternoon, when you are running the aircon in the summer, getting ready for dinner — that is when you are going to see a big [electricity] bill reduction."" Mr Georgiou said although it was cheaper to install all the panels on the northern side, it was often more beneficial financially for users to go east-west. ""Once you start out with that right panel placement … then you can still add a battery to capture the extra power during the day and use that at night."" He said it was also a good idea to consider what you wanted to achieve from installing solar panels, then tailor the installation to that specific need, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all approach from installers. ""The common belief that northern-facing is the best in all cases [means] it's cheaper to install, easier to train staff. Overall it's a simpler way of doing things,"" he said. ""But that benefits the solar companies and the grid, but not the person buying the system.""

413,The Brisbane suburbs where it's about to get harder to buy an apartment,house-and-home,"  Brisbane suburbs where buying an apartment will require large cash deposit up front Buying an apartment in some Brisbane suburbs will soon become a lot more difficult after major banks released lists of suburbs deemed risky, where they will require a deposit of up to 20 per cent for a home loan. Some banks have already imposed the restrictions, but from Monday Suncorp is set to red flag almost 40 locations. It comes after the inner-Brisbane unit glut saw prices slump to their lowest in three years, with a recovery not expected for at least 12 months. At least four major banks are refusing to loan more than 80 per cent of the cost of a unit in Brisbane's CBD, Fortitude Valley and the inner-north suburbs of Bowen Hills, Newstead, Herston and Albion, citing problems such as in influx of new apartments and ""weakness in the investment market"". Fortitude Valley mortgage broker Caroline Jean-Baptiste said the changes were impacting first home buyers and people looking to downsize, such as divorcees. ""Where the apartments are going up, that's where lenders are considering a higher risk area,"" she said. ""It does make getting into the market much more difficult, but sometimes you need to find a more creative solution."" Ms Jean-Baptiste said it was mortgage insurers rather than the banks themselves demanding the restrictions. ""Quite often mortgage insurers will not insure in high density postcodes where the risk is higher,"" she said. ""Every bank that uses a certain mortgage insurer will be affected by this lender's mortgage policy."" The ABC has obtained data from four major banks revealing suburbs where loans will be more difficult to secure: * Westpac more commonly assesses mortgage applications based on the apartment block rather than the postcodes. Postcodes here indicate areas where Westpac has restrictions on apartment blocks. Finance and mortgage broker Julie Bammon said any ""high-risk"" borrower would be affected by the growing list of red flagged postcodes. But she said not all banks would turn down a loan in high-risk areas. ""There would most likely be a bank or a lender where that borrower would be able to fit because different lenders concentrate on different things,"" she said. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the National Australia Bank said its move to red flag more suburbs was necessary for the bank to remain a responsible lender. ""We still lend across all areas, however in some geographic regions we may apply a lower maximum loan-to-value ratio on applications,"" she said. ""This is the right thing to do for our customers, for our business, and for the Australian property market."" A Westpac Bank spokeswoman said they worked slightly differently, assessing whether to mortgage a unit based on the building rather than the suburb or postcode. ""As a prudent lender, we have controls in place to prevent us becoming overly concentrated in a single address, however we don't auto-decline in these circumstances,"" she said.

414,Selling the Sydney unit for a Bundaberg sea change,house-and-home,"  Cost of living in Queensland: Why people are selling and moving to Bundaberg City dwellers are flocking to Queensland's Bundaberg region to snap up houses for half the price of what they would pay in a capital city. With a median house price of $280,000, there has been a boom in interest by house hunters from across Australia. It is the third-lowest median house price in the state, less than a third of the Sydney or Canberra median and about half that of Brisbane and the Gold and Sunshine coasts. The affordability and lifestyle is attracting families who otherwise would not be able to afford their dream home. After 20 years living overseas, Shane and Pascaline Emms ended up buying in Bargara on Bundaberg's coast. ""Beyond cost effective, it's just a bloody good lifestyle,"" Mr Emms said. ""If your day is up at 5:00am and home at 7:00pm every day and huge hours of commute, struggling to make ends meet because of the cost of a mortgage — why? ""You can just cash that in, move up here, buy something that's well priced, probably much bigger than what you've got … and start something new."" Ms Emms said she initially loved the vibrancy of Noosa on the Sunshine Coast. ""But the prices were way, way out of our budget, we had to make too much compromise,"" she said. ""So here we finally found something that was in our budget — we integrated the cost of the renovations and we said 'that's it, we can really turn this place into something really fantastic'."" As well as renovating a home for their family, they also created an accommodation business on the property that they said likely would have been out of reach if they had bought elsewhere. Mr Emms said they found the region had a lot to offer that other areas did not. ""What we can do here with the surfing, golf, kite surfing, the food, brewing … there's just never any end really of the things you can do,"" he said. ""It's not just unique on the coat of Queensland, I think its globally unique."" Ms Emms said Bargara was the ""perfect spot"". ""If the lifestyle is something which is important, if nature is something which is important in your life if you're seeking quality in your life, I think it's the perfect spot,"" she said. Phil Oakley and his wife Marlies moved to Bundaberg after living in Sydney for 10 years. Mr Oakey said they were looking for a change from the big-city life. ""We managed to sell our two-bedroom unit in Sydney and for the proceeds we bought and house and a business so you can't really get much better than that,"" he said. ""Now we've got a quarter-acre block, three-and-a-half bedrooms, a big art studio downstairs … so it's really nice. ""It makes things a lot easier, it means you get home from work earlier and just the lifestyle is just a lot more relaxed and easy-paced."" His advice to others thinking of making a change — just ""go for it"". ""It's a big change but I think the benefits generally outweigh all the negatives of not living in a big city,"" he said. Bundaberg zone chair for the Real Estate Institute of Queensland (REIQ), Le-Anne Allan, said there had been an influx of city buyers over the last few months looking for a change. ""Each weekend at our open homes we have people from the Sunshine Coast, Brisbane, Gold Coast — even South Australia, Sydney and Melbourne,"" Ms Allan said. ""I haven't seen that interest in our market for about eight to 10 years."" Local real estate agent Paul Beer said he had also noticed a huge spike in the number people looking to buy in the region. ""We've probably been the busiest we've been in the last seven, eight years,"" he said. ""We're selling units, houses, land, it doesn't matter what it is it's just been very, very busy the last probably four months."" Ms Allan said while prices were some of the lowest in the state now, they represented a sound investment. She said the Bundaberg market was strengthening — the median house price grew 1.5 per cent in the 12 months to June 2017. It was the only regional centre to see an increase. ""Anyone that's sort of been standing on the sidelines of looking to buy that first home, buy that investment property, buy it now whilst you've got the chance,"" she said.

415,Is buying an apartment a wise investment for young people?,house-and-home,"  House prices: Is buying an apartment a wise investment for first home buyers? With Australian property prices at all-time highs, it is little wonder first home buyers are looking beyond the classic quarter-acre block. You might think investing in bricks and mortar is a one-way bet, but that's not the case for many Australians — look at Brisbane. Buying an apartment — particularly one off-the-plan — can be a tempting option for young people in particular, offering proximity to the CBD or town centres, brand new finishes and more time to save for a deposit. Those factors helped entice sisters Emily Ebsworth and Jess Reed to purchase an apartment in the Canberra town centre of Belconnen. The pair paid $436,500 for the two-bedroom, off-the-plan apartment back in 2010. ""It was fun, it was exciting. We went to the gym there, we went to the mall, it was close to everything,"" Ms Reed said. It worked for a while, before the pair decided to part ways and attempted to rent the property out. ""There were heaps more apartments going up in the area, so ours wasn't the newest anymore,"" Ms Reed said. ""When we went out to look for tenants we found that it was harder than we thought it would be, because there was so much supply."" Even after finding a tenant, they struggled to cover expenses like rates and levies and, after some negotiation, decided to look for a buyer. But that proved even more difficult. Should you sacrifice lifestyle to buy? Or just rent forever? Are there other ways? ""It was putting heaps of strain on our relationship and the whole family,"" Ms Reed said. ""I think that's why I eventually ended up agreeing [to sell], because I didn't want it to ruin our family, ruin our friendship."" After almost a year on the market, the apartment eventually sold for $30,000 less than they had paid for it seven years earlier. The sisters said the experience convinced them to be wary of buying with family and to know if and when your home might become an investment. ""We were so young — our circumstances were always going to change,"" Ms Ebsworth said. Ms Reed and Ms Ebsworth's story is just one, and does not speak for all apartment owners or first-home buyers. But it does reflect a sizable minority of homeowners who resell their units each quarter for a loss — a figure crunched into the Pain and Gain report from research firm RP Data. The report found, with its extraordinarily tight property market, Sydney sellers fared best, with just 1.8 per cent of unit sales making a loss between January and March this year. Melbourne's figure sat much higher, at 11 per cent. While in Canberra — where Ms Reed and Ms Ebsworth's apartment was located — that number was 21.8 per cent. But all capital cities pale in comparison to the mining centres of Perth and Darwin, where losses hit 35.9 and 51.6 per cent respectively. BIS Oxford Economics Property analyst Angie Zigomanis said middle-of-the-road units — largely targeted at investors — are more likely to go backwards than premium property. ""If owner-occupiers are investor-type stock, then often the owner-occupier won't necessarily make a big capital gain there,"" he said. ""If they buy something perhaps a bit more boutiquey or better-located, they might do a little bit better. But if it's purely investor-stock, they won't necessarily see the gain."" Changing the federal tax policy to encourage build-to-rent housing could fill affordable housing funding gaps, Matthew Palm writes. Canberra developer Nick Georgalis said surveys did not tell the whole story and that those in the industry knew what was happening. ""Analysis is all retrospective and not at the coalface ... [it] isn't an analysis of what's selling today, but what is settling today,"" he said. ""We see, year-in, year-out, 3 to 5 per cent growth in what we're delivering."" Instead of an oversupply, Mr Georgalis argued there was an undersupply in apartments — particularly in rentals, which in Canberra sit at less than half the national average. ""In Canberra, we aren't really seeing international investment, and nor are we seeing the national investment from other major cities,"" he said.

416,Perth's repair cafes teach people to make do and mend,house-and-home,"  Repair cafes aim to reduce waste by teaching people how to make do and mend In a culture where make do and mend has been replaced by the impulse to throw away, a popular new concept is encouraging people to repair their broken possessions. Repair cafés not only reduce the volume of waste going to landfill, they also build community, according to Michelle Fisher who established a cafe in Melbourne's inner west two years ago. The movement that began in Amsterdam has now spread to Perth with a location in Victoria Park joining more than 1,300 cafes worldwide. ""It connects neighbours with neighbours and values and skills we all have and can share,"" Ms Fisher told ABC Radio Perth. ""People bring their stuff along, they sit down with a volunteer fixer that has specialist skills and he or she teaches them how to repair their things, or unscrew things or have a look under the bonnet to see how things look inside."" The Melbourne Repair Café operates out of a range of coffee shops and community centres and there is no charge to take part. Broken items range from Moroccan banjos to dolls with decapitated heads and ""a little girl's cuckoo clock where the cuckoo didn't come out anymore"". ""Some [volunteers] are current tradies, some are retired,"" Ms Fisher explained. ""We have engineers of various sorts, we have sewers, teachers, sustainability experts and backyard tinkers. ""No money changes hands. We invite donations, but the service is free, it is a gift of the heart and hands."" The International Repair Café Foundation was formed in 2010, but Ms Fisher said the desire to keep appliances out of landfill had gained momentum. ""I think the ABC's War on Waste has really lifted awareness around the need to consume and throw away less,"" she said. In Perth, the Repair Lab in Victoria Park had its first successful day of operation on October 8, while a monthly repair café in North Perth will launch on October 22. Repair Lab organiser Flavia Pardini said the first event had exceeded all expectations. ""We had 55 items come through ... some couldn't be fixed but most could and we had more than 100 people come through the lab,"" she said. ""You do get those electronic items like keyboards and computers, but we also get umbrellas — items that people like to use but that break down and you don't know what do with it."" Ms Pardini said people who came to the event gained not only a newly functional item, but confidence and a connection with their neighbours. ""It's the skill set we have lost and also that confidence. Sometimes you need to open something up but you feel intimidated,"" she said. ""There is another aspect that we saw very clearly last Saturday and that was community coming together and doing things ... connecting."" Elle Gonzalez-Skuja, who is coordinating the upcoming North Perth event said they already had many volunteer fixers and plenty of interest. ""I think people are just fed up with living in a throwaway culture and I think people are concerned about the amount of items that are going into landfill,"" she said. ""It's really quite overwhelming that 6,000kg of fashion waste goes into landfill every 10 minutes in Australia. ""We are bringing back that culture of repair that we are losing.""

417,Meet the man whose home speaks to him,house-and-home,"  Google Home and Amazon Echo: Meet the man whose smart home speaks to him When Stuart Waite wakes up each morning, the first name he says might be ""Alexa"". That's not his wife, it's the Amazon Echo smart home device that is connected to appliances around his house. When Stuart says: ""Alexa, turn on the lights"", the small object responds ""OK!"" and the room is suddenly lit up. In the kitchen he turns to a similar smart device, Google Home, and asks: ""OK Google, what should I make for breakfast?"" ""Scrambled eggs,"" the female voice responds, and finds him a list of ingredients and a step-by-step recipe to follow. The start-up founder and investor admits he's an early adopter — Amazon Echo isn't even available in Australia yet — but Stuart believes networked devices known as the Internet of Things will be much more prevalent in homes of the future, even if right now, many consumers are uncomfortable with the idea of an object that is listening to them all the time and storing their data. ""It's kind of a hands-free, all-pervasive, always-on around the house,"" he said. ""Once you get over the stigma that something's always listening to you, for that watch word or keyword, then it becomes part of normal living."" On his way out the door Stuart activates a home alarm system on his phone and checks in on his dog Oscar. Thanks to a GPS wi-fi collar, Stuart knows Oscar slept a healthy eight hours last night and can even track his movements during the day in real time. For all the novelty and hype around the Internet of Things, Australian consumers have been slower to adopt the technology than countries like the United States and experts say one reason could be scepticism about how the devices use and store data. ""I think we're not as aware as we ought to be about some of the risks,"" said Frank Zeichner, the director of the Knowledge Economy Institute at the University of Technology Sydney. He said the law is lagging when it comes to securing users' data and privacy. ""Governments and lawmakers are scrambling because the technology capabilities are outstripping the ability to make law."" Stuart agrees that it is up to consumers to do their research and be aware of the risks before they fill their home with the talking, listening objects. ""We have the big companies like Amazon and Apple and Google telling us that these are the things we have to have in our home,"" he said. ""But really it's another device for them to have in our home that's connected into their ecosystem, another way for them to generate revenue and capture a lot of your personal data.""

418,Seniors more likely to spend savings than leave inheritance: survey,house-and-home,"  Seniors more likely to spend savings than leave inheritance for their children, survey finds Conserving money to pass onto their children is no longer a high priority for today's seniors, a new survey has found, with many opting to spend their cash on travel or future aged care needs. Karen Rees, a research fellow at National Seniors Australia, said the organisation surveyed 5,770 of its members about their retirement income and plans. The survey found that while a substantial proportion of seniors hoped to leave their children some money, their biggest priority was funding their own essential needs in retirement and making sure their money lasted. ""They want a regular, constant income throughout their retirement,"" Dr Rees told ABC Radio Perth. ""They know they might live longer and they are planning for that longer life financially, for their health and medical costs and also for lifestyle and travel. Take a look at the comments to see what our readers thought about seniors putting away money for their children. ""One of the major comments to me was: 'We don't have a crystal ball.' ""It is an unknown and people are doing the best they can."" Only 3 per cent of those surveyed planned to preserve all their savings for the next generation. Ten per cent expected to have spent all of their savings in retirement, 41 per wanted to spend most of their savings, and 46 per cent intended to spend only some. Dr Rees said there had also been a shift towards parents helping their children financially earlier on in life. ""One woman said to us, 'I helped out on the deposit on the first home for both children so that they could get established in a home of their own. The children received a good education and were able to step into well-paying jobs. My current income does not cover the cost of running a home and so there will be nothing to leave the children'."" Responses from the ABC Radio Perth audience revealed there a wide range of views on inheritances. Deborah: ""I'd sooner take more basic old age care than leave nothing for the kids. The kids and spouses disagree wildly and want me to spend it all on me — but really, I can't."" Helen & Barry: ""We're in our late 60s. We didn't get anything from our parents so why should we pass on anything to our kids?"" Karen: ""The parents of both my husband and me were frugal in their own lives and left good inheritances for us. It behoves us to be good stewards and we do plan to ensure our children are beneficiaries."" Trisha: ""Our lovely daughters are happy for us to spend whatever we want and to enjoy our retirement. They will inherit the house. That's about it."" Jennifer: ""When I was a kid, the parents didn't need ... aged care, and now they do. What are the kids actually expecting?"" Modern-day Australians are also more likely to have expenses close to home later in life than previous generations. Research by IPSOS has found that one in five 50 to 59-year-olds have children under 18 living at home, and one in 10 have children under 12 living at home. Seventy-seven per cent of people aged 60 to 69 were renovating their homes, with one in four doing home improvement every three months. ""I don't think that [declining inheritances] necessarily comes out of selfishness, stinginess or leaving the kids out of the picture,"" Dr Rees said. ""I do think people feel like they have done a really good job by their kids and they have now hit retirement and they should have some fun with it and make sure they can afford their care later on.""

419,opinion: Key to a good relationship? Sharing housework and parenting equally,house-and-home,"  The key to a good relationship? Sharing housework and parenting equally The quality of women's relationships with their partner is diminished if they view their parenting division as unfair or want to spend more time working, our new study of employed parents in Canada has found. Emerging research shows women's larger housework share deteriorates relationship satisfaction and leads to divorce. Our study shows inequality across the domestic sphere — housework and parenting — jeopardises relationship quality. Women consistently do more housework, even when employed full-time. They do more when they are married and after the birth of a child. Women also perform more of the least-pleasurable households tasks, like cleaning the bathroom. The 2016 census shows the typical Australian woman is still doing the lion's share of housework. Although men have increased their housework time since the 1970s, they more typically perform the least-urgent chores, like changing lightbulbs or car maintenance. Our study found working mothers assumed a larger parenting share, and this inequality deteriorated relationship quality — but only under certain conditions. It deteriorated when mothers perceived their parenting division as unfair, or when they felt trapped in their primary carer role. Specifically, mothers who performed a larger parenting share and worked part-time had the lowest relationship quality. This pattern was also evident for mothers who preferred more time at work. These paradoxical findings — mothers with part-time employment and preferences for more time at work reporting worse relations with their partners due to their larger parenting burden — suggests feeling trapped in the role of mother. Mothers are expected to be fully available to the demands and whims of children around the clock. They are expected not only to provide primary care, but also to carry the mental load for the household. The mental load captures all of the planning work that is required to keep the household functioning, from organising after-school care to ensuring there is enough milk for breakfast. The demands of this role are intense. It leads many mothers to reduce to part-time employment when children are young. Yet many women may be dissatisfied with the pressure to assume the bulk of the parenting at the expense of their employment and, as a consequence, relationship quality suffers. So mothers can be trapped between gender role expectations of a ""good"" mother and their desires to be more engaged in the labour market. This dissatisfaction bleeds into the marriage. Relationship quality is better among some couples, such as those who equally share the parenting even when mothers work part-time, full-time or overtime hours. Simply, men's equal parenting participation, regardless of mothers' employment status, appears to be the linchpin for relationship quality. Australian mothers have some of the highest part-time employment rates in the world. The Government offers little in terms of parenting or parental leave, meaning Australian families must find individual, rather than government solutions, for the care of young children. Faced with expensive childcare, many mothers reduce to part-time work or drop out of the labour market altogether to look after children. These employment decisions make mothers economically vulnerable if couples divorce, and in older age one in three women retire with no superannuation. For many Australian families, the solution is mothers' reduced time in employment. Want to know more about the mental load? Listen to the new ABC podcast Ladies We Need To Talk. Moreover, Australian parents become more traditional in their gender role attitudes after having a child, meaning more couples view mothers as the ideal carer for children once becoming parents. Our study suggests this combination of factors — preferences for mother-provided childcare and reductions in mothers' employment — may deteriorate relationship quality among Australian couples. Close to half (47 per cent) of all divorces in Australia are among couples with children, and women are more likely to file for divorce than men. The results from our Canadian sample suggest one reason women may experience lower relationship quality in their marriages is the unequal division of the domestic work — parenting and housework. Men's more active participation in the home and family-responsive policies, including the availability of universal government-subsidised child care, may have a two-fold benefit; increasing mothers' labour market attachment, and improving relationship quality.

420,Chinese property hunters get royal treatment as agents woo 'Golden Week' investors,house-and-home,"  Chinese property buyers face tighter rules as real estate agents go for broke in 'Golden Week' Cashed-up Chinese property hunters will be treated to helicopter rides and ""money-can't-buy"" experiences when they flock to Australia next week, but higher taxes and tighter regulations have forced many of them to slash their budgets. The Chinese national holiday known as Golden Week is a lucrative time for many Australian real estate agents, who have been lining up some of the east coast's best homes to show. One agent is hoping to ink more than $100 million worth of contracts after the week-long holiday, which has been extended to eight days this year because it coincides with China's mid-autumn festival, also known as the Moon Festival. Chinese travel company Ctrip estimates about 6 million Chinese tourists will go abroad during the holiday, and Australia is one of the top five destinations. Many of the travellers combine tourism with property hunting, and some have already been working with Australian real estate agents to source the perfect property. Monika Tu, the director of Sydney-based real estate firm Black Diamondz, said she had undertaken a four-week campaign in local newspapers and on social media to find properties for her buyers because of a shortage of prestige properties in the $10–25 million bracket. Her advertisements lists individual buyers' budgets and their criteria. For example, a buyer with a $60-million budget wants a waterfront house in Sydney's eastern suburbs, with Harbour Bridge and Opera House views. Another buyer, also interested in the eastern suburbs, has a $3-million budget to buy a two-bedroom apartment with two car parks. Ms Tu said she had 17 prospective buyers booked during the holiday and they all had visas — mostly 188 significant-investor visas. Higher stamp duty and land tax, Foreign Investment Review Board application fees and China's crackdown on money leaving the country have all affected offshore buyers, agents say. As Australia tightens regulations and hikes taxes, Chinese property investors are shifting their focus to other parts of the world. So where are they investing? In 2016, the Victorian Government more than doubled the foreign-buyer stamp duty surcharge from 3 to 7 per cent. NSW also doubled its foreign-buyer surcharge to 8 per cent, and Queensland implemented a 3 per cent surcharge. RMIT lecturer in property Peng Wong said ""Australian governments are smart"" to not immediately impose a 15 per cent tax like Singapore, Vancouver and Hong Kong had done. He said the 15 per cent surcharge was effective and dampened foreign buyer demand. Dr Wong believes the Chinese Government's ongoing crackdown on capital outflow would have a more significant impact than Australian governments increasing taxes on foreign buyers. The managing director of Gold Coast-based Kollosche Prestige Agents, Jordan Williams, said restrictions on money transfers out of China would soften the marketplace. However, he said there were alternative ways for Chinese buyers to access funds if they had the appropriate type of visa. Ms Tu said she had found buyers with $3–$5 million budgets needed a longer settlement period, and one client who had a budget of about $20 million reduced their criteria and budget to about $15 million. Melbourne-based Ray White Balwyn director Helen Yan said even though buyers had money, they could not send it here. It had already affected the market above $4 million, she added. Buyers will be visiting Chinese buyer hotspots in Melbourne including Balwyn, Glen Waverley and Kew, and Sydney's eastern suburbs such as Rose Bay, Point Piper and Bellevue Hill. On the Gold Coast, Mr Williams pointed to Monaco Street in Broadbeach Waters, Paradise Waters and Sorrento as favoured areas. He said Chinese buyers liked big blocks, northern aspects and main river locations. Source: Juwai.com Biggin and Scott Glen Waverley director Ming Xu has arranged helicopter rides for his premium buyers so they can get a ""big picture"" of other suburbs they could invest in. He said the premium buyers would have a few million dollars to spend or had an existing relationship with the agents. ""The helicopter tour can give them a good understanding of the Melbourne market in 20 minutes,"" he said. ""Otherwise it's going to take at least two or three hours to drive all around these suburbs."" For many local Chinese buyers, like Hongqing Zhu — who splits his time between Melbourne and Wu Xi on China's east coast, where his ceramic manufacturing company is based — Golden Week is an ideal time to inspect properties because business slows down. Mr Zhu, who migrated to Melbourne a decade ago, was recently given a helicopter tour to help him make his next investment decision. Although he enjoyed his tour from Williamstown's beaches to Toorak's large blocks dotted with tennis courts and swimming pools, Mr Zhu said he was interested in Glen Waverley because it had a strong Chinese community and was near Monash University with its many potential tenants. The Australian head of Chinese international property portal Juwai.com, Jane Lu, said sellers and agents appealing to Chinese buyers could expect about a 20 per cent increase in activity during the holiday. Source: Juwai.com, Ctrip ""Golden Week purchasers are more often higher-end buyers,"" Ms Lu said. ""Some buyers will use the opportunity to sweep in and snap up listings in markets they have researched online from home. ""Most have been researching for months. To the vendor and agent, it's as if they dropped in from the moon and snatched up a property."" It is now common for agents to chauffeur Chinese buyers to and from the airport, and some also arrange their accommodation. Mr Xu said he sometimes also helped buyers with arranging school enrolments or buying a car. ""These people have been well treated in China, so when they come here, they want to have some special treatment,"" he said.

421,Fears for safety after hearing-impaired smoke alarm subsidy ends in NSW,house-and-home,"  NDIS: Fears for safety after hearing-impaired smoke alarm subsidy ends in NSW When Apenisa Matairavula goes to bed at night in his Sydney home, he can rest soundly knowing his smoke alarm will wake him if there is a fire. But it's not an ordinary smoke alarm. It uses a bright strobe light and a shaker pad that vibrates under his pillow to wake him up. Mr Matairavula is deaf. A standard noise-based alarm would be useless. ""I can see the flashing light, and I can also feel the tactile vibrations,"" he said through an Auslan sign-language interpreter. ""I definitely feel safer."" Mr Matairavula had the device installed through the Smoke Alarm Subsidy Scheme in New South Wales. Over the past six years, the scheme has helped more than 2,000 deaf and hard-of-hearing people purchase specialised alarms. It ended in June as part of the state's transition to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). For those who aren't eligible for the NDIS, they may have to pay the full price for the specialised alarms. They cost up to $700 — more than 20 times the cost of a standard one. ""I think that all deaf people, and people who are hard of hearing, need to have the smoke alarms in their houses,"" Mr Matairavula said. The Deaf Society helped administer the subsidy scheme in NSW and it now fears many who aren't eligible for the NDIS will miss out. And it says others, like those who are hard of hearing, don't know how to access a subsidy for the alarms under the federally run My Aged Care program, which is for those over the age of 65. ""Our concern is those people who aren't able to access the NDIS or My Aged Care, to be able to get the specialised alarm,"" The Deaf Society CEO Leonie Jackson said. ""And if they don't have access to these devices, they potentially could die."" The NSW Department of Family and Community Services has told the ABC $2 million was allocated to pay for the scheme in 2011, and implementation was completed in 2016-17. ""Under the NDIS, people who are deaf or hard of hearing will be able to have adapted smoke alarms included in their plan,"" a statement said. But advocacy groups such as Better Hearing Australia are worried many people won't be able to get a subsidy. ""I do worry a lot that the people that I meet working in Better Hearing … have not got a lot of money,"" said Sue Daw, who is hard of hearing and works with the organisation in Canberra. Ms Daw has a specialised alarm in her home, paid for through a subsidy in the ACT. She worries about the impact the end of the subsidy scheme will have in NSW. ""A lot of [hard-of-hearing people] may find that buying an expensive smoke alarm may not be their top priority,"" she said. Advocates said this was just the latest example of disability services being harmed in NSW in the state's rush to transition to the NDIS. Disability Advocacy Network Australia (DANA) said from changes to residential care in group homes, to ending funding for regional disability advocacy, and now to cancelling the Smoke Alarm Subsidy Scheme — they were all suffering as NSW shifted to the NDIS. ""The NSW Government is wilfully ignoring the fact that this loss of funding will have a direct damaging impact on NSW residents with disability,"" DANA CEO Mary Mallett said in a statement. Other organisations worry this is just the beginning, and other states that currently subsidise specialised smoke alarms will also eliminate their subsidy programs when they transition to the NDIS. ""It's about life and death,"" Ms Jackson said. ""As a community, we're responsible for this.""

422,opinion: Is it better to repair or replace broken washing machines?,house-and-home,"  Is it better to repair or replace broken washing machines? A jet plane is landing in my laundry. Or taking off, so loud is the noise coming from my least favourite room in the house. It's my 13-year old front loader washing machine that has accompanied me through four house moves and two kids. As the machine still works, I suspect a minor ailment. ""Probably an underwire from a bra stuck under the drum"" is the provisional phone diagnosis over the phone from the first repairer I contact. But it turns out to be a more serious condition. ""Worn bearings."" A textbook case. Join Craig Reucassel and Wendy Harmer, as they explore the big issues in waste management, talk to those behind change, and learn how every little bit can make a difference. The quote for repair — $400-500 — is quickly accompanied by the advice that has become so commonplace for appliances, gadgets and devices: ""It's not worth repairing, it'll be cheaper to buy a new one."" The logic is simple. An equivalent new machine is currently on sale for $535 (interestingly, almost half the price I paid for mine back in 2004). Given my machine's age, if I do decide to spend the equivalent money on repair, there is a significant risk that something else might go wrong soon A second opinion costs me $55 to obtain and the quote is even dearer — $500-600. ""It's done well, 13 years is a good innings for a washing machine,"" is the consensus of everyone I speak to in the industry. Inspired by the ABC's War on Waste, I consider using a repair cafe. This fabulous initiative, which encourages you to work alongside skilled volunteers, opens the prospect of a repair taking significant time and elbow grease but less money. A spare parts supplier confirms that the bearings are still available for my model — $90 (plus postage). My local repair cafe tells me they are willing to have a go. But they are only open on Saturday mornings, when my husband works and I morph into a soccer mum. And I'd need get the 65-kilogram machine down a steep flight of stairs and into a non-existent trailer to get it there. I have doubts about how achievable a repair is. I turn to that mainstay of self-help, YouTube, and settle in to watch a surprisingly entertaining video showing how to replace washing machine bearings. I start optimistic, despite the clear warning: ""This is a big job, not for the feint hearted."" Eight minutes into the 17-minute video, I am decidedly feint hearted. The skilled repairer has removed nine different components, each requiring differently tricky manoeuvres. I am painfully aware that each step then will need to be reversed to rebuild the machine at the end. But for environmental reasons, I'm still reluctant to ditch my machine, especially after seeing the impacts of our throw-away culture on the War on Waste and Four Corners recently. The manufacturer of my current model (and likely the brand I would buy again) speaks confidently of the water- and energy-saving aspects of their products but has less to say about issues created by their disposal. Their advice on the question of repair versus replace is that this an individual decision. Unsurprisingly, they strongly discourage non-authorised repair attempts. My machine is not their problem. Manufacturers don't have to deal with their products at the wrong end of their lifespan. The store where I am likely to buy a new machine offers to take my old machine away for $20. They are uninterested in telling me what happens to these discarded appliances and I am told, surprisingly rudely, by the head office that they can't help. Do you know what happens to your empty bottles and jars once you've recycled them? Industry insiders say they are forced to stockpile hundreds of thousands of tonnes of glass. I ask the warehouse of my local store how they dispose of ditched whitegoods. ""They are picked up and go to landfill,"" one staff member tells me. Another gives me the names and numbers of two people who come to collect the waste. This leads me on a murky goose chase. Their main collector hangs up on me more than once after I identify myself as a writer and doesn't return my call. But the other is happy to talk: ""We take them away, remove any plastic contaminants and the rest, which is mainly stainless steel, is crushed up and sold to a metal recycling company."" I speak with this next company in the chain. They say are one of the world's leading publicly traded metal and electronics recyclers. Sounds promising but then again, so did the big waste companies featured on Four Corners who ended up disposing recyclable materials into illegal landfill dumps. Will my old washing machine get recycled if it is taken away by the deliverers of a new one? I estimate the likelihood is less than 50 per cent. Even if it is recycled, the energy needed to do this — as well as produce a new washing machine — will result in a considerable impact on the environment. Environmentally, repairing is clearly the sounder choice. But on cost and convenience, it makes more sense to replace the machine. The numbers speak and my decision is made: I will buy a new machine and hope that my old one will be recycled. I wish I could be more certain about the implications and I hope that next time I will make a different choice. The hope for next time includes the possibility of Australia following the lead of Sweden where, thanks to legislation introduced earlier this year, I could have claimed half the cost of the repairs as a tax-break and in doing so, tilted us all away from our throw-away culture.

423,opinion: The gap between the haves and the have-nots keeps growing,house-and-home,"  The ABS is wrong: Inequality is getting worse in Australia The Australian Bureau of Statistics announced this week that ""inequality has remained stable since 2013-4"". Given that economic inequality has been increasing since 1980 and the widespread view that it has reached unacceptable levels, the ABS's report came as a welcome respite. Or did it? Most public discussion about inequality focuses on income (an economic flow), but wealth (an economic stock of assets) is a more fundamental indicator of people's social position and opportunities, and its distribution goes to the fairness and stability of a society. The ABS reports that the share of Australia's household wealth owned by the richest quintile (the top 20 per cent) has increased from 62.1 to 62.5 per cent since 2013-14. An increase of just 0.4 per cent looks small, until you realise that's equal to half the total wealth owned by the poorest 20 per cent of households, whose share of the total wealth has fallen from 0.9 to 0.8 per cent. Wealth inequality thus continues to increase at the extremes. The share owned by the second richest quintile has fallen very slightly, from 20.5 to 20.4 per cent, while the middle and second lowest quintiles are unchanged. Read through the comments to see what some of our readers had to say on wealth inequality. These shifts were not large enough to change the size of the Gini coefficient, the basis on which the ABS concluded that inequality has stabilised. The ABS's latest survey shows we're spending more on the basics and are deeper in debt. Here's how to buck the trend. The Gini coefficient is a statistical artefact that aims to rank the distribution between complete equality (where everyone owns the same wealth) and complete inequality (where one household owns the lot). It's a widely used index but it can hide as much as it reveals. In this case, the stability of the Gini appears anomalous, given the large rises in the value of houses in Australian cities during recent years and the fact that few among the poorest 40 per cent own one. Most of the wealth the ABS apportions to the bottom of the distribution comprises non-income earning household durables (such as cars, furniture and clothing), assets that are valued at zero in the national accounts (which treats durables as consumed when they're bought). So, what's really going on? The best glimpse provided by the ABS's survey is a figure called the P90/P10 ratio. This refers to the wealth of those households at the 10th percentile (measured from the bottom of the range) divided into the wealth of the 90th percentile (the 10th percentile measured from the top). In other words, it compares the comparative wealth of the quite poor and the quite rich, but not the most extreme cases. The ABS reports that the wealth of those on the 90th percentile is now almost $2 million, about 60 times the wealth of households at the 10th percentile. The multiple is up from 52 times in 2013-14, a rise of 13.2 per cent, which is the biggest jump in this ratio since the ABS began surveying wealth (in 2003-04, when the P90/P10 ratio was 45). The increase in this ratio implies that the gains of the wealthiest 10 per cent of households have been greater than those accumulated by the top quintile overall, a scenario reinforced by the facts that the top quintile's average wealth rose by a lower 12 per cent, and this average was itself almost a cool million higher than the $2 million entry point for the top 10 per cent ($2.9 million). In other words, despite the apparent stability of the quintile distribution, the survey results are compatible with other evidence that the wealth of the top 10 per cent, particularly the top 1 per cent, is continuing to race away from the rest of us. The limitation of the ABS survey is that it ignores what is happening to the wealth distribution beyond the 90th percentile, which is precisely where most of the concern about growing inequality lies. The methodology lags behind international best practice, which now routinely shows data for the top 1 per cent, the top 10 per cent and the bottom 50 per cent. Last year when we prepared a report on Australian wealth inequality for the Evatt Foundation, we adopted the global standards, using OECD data and, ironically, ABS data supplied to the OECD not published in Australia. On conservative assumptions, we found that the top 10 per cent of households owned at least 50 per cent of the total wealth, and the top 1 per cent owned at least 15 per cent. There is nothing in the ABS survey that leads us to conclude other than that the concentration of wealth in Australia is probably still increasing. If our official statistician thinks inequality has stabilised, he should adopt the methodology to prove it.

424,Where does your money go? Survey shows cost of essential living a burden,house-and-home,"  Where does your money go? Spending survey shows cost of essential living a burden The rapidly rising cost of essentials like housing, energy and education is pushing households deeper into debt, according to the latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The 2015-16 Household Expenditure Survey shows the average family spent about $1,425 a week — $190 more than six years earlier. Household debt had also doubled since 2003-4, with the average family owing $169,000. Property debt accounted for nearly 90 per cent of this. The largest weekly expense for families was housing — such as rents and mortgages — followed by food and then transport. However, the amount spent on power and energy had jumped 26 per cent since 2009-10 — an increase of 11 per cent in real terms. Emily Maron and Peter Gagliardi have five children under the age of nine and balance their weekly budget down to the last cent. They have amassed a $6,000 power bill debt, despite using a payment plan. ""Most of the money goes on rent. Food is a big one and school, and then the bills are huge,"" Mr Gagliardi said. The family lives on $597 a week, less than half the average income. ""It comes to the point where it is ridiculous,"" Mr Gagliardi said. According the latest ABS figures, the largest proportional increase of any spending category was on education — jumping 24 per cent in six years. Ms Maron said money needed for school trips could blow their budget, with their eldest children needing iPads for class, and constant demands for special school days and trips. ""Things are always coming up at school that they can't participate in and that separates them from the rest,"" she explained. The ABS's latest survey shows we're spending more on the basics and are deeper in debt. Here's how to buck the trend. Going back further, in 1984 it was food and non-alcoholic drinks that most people spent their money on, and housing was the third-highest category, making up just 13 per cent of spending. The proportion spent on education has more than tripled over the past 32 years, while money spent on clothing and footwear has more than halved. Across Australia, the Northern Territory and ACT spent the most on goods and services, despite Western Australian having the greatest rise in median weekly household income, from $1,111 to $1,782 over the past 10 years. Tasmania saw the smallest rise in average weekly income, from $950 to $1,209, and had the highest number of low-income families. The ABS said nearly 30 per cent of Australian households were over-burdened with debt, with mortgages the driving cause. New data shows that even a small rise in interest rates could tip one million Australian households into financial stress. Not surprisingly, higher-income households were more likely to be swimming in debt, given their access to credit. A quarter of the households in the top income bracket were over indebted, compared to one in six low-income families. More people in Sydney amassed more mortgage debt than Melbourne, with Sydneysiders owing on average $269,000 more than their Melbourne counterparts. However, the ABS said the gap between rich and poor remained stable. ""The wealthiest 20 per cent of households in Australia has remained stable since 2013-14,"" ABS chief economist Bruce Hockman said. Yet figures showed inequality in net wealth was higher than income inequality. However, the St Vincent De Pauls Society said over the past three years, more and more low-income families had come to them needing help. Dismal incomes, shrinking savings and an economy largely underwritten by consumers is a worrying mix, writes Stephen Letts. ""They are seeing mounting bills and have to make choices every week as to what they can pay and can't pay, and always have that sense of dread about the next bill,"" the charity's Victorian CEO Sue Cattermole said. ""So they may ask us for food but in fact it may be something else that is a stress for them."" While Mr Gagliardi struggles to make ends meet, he remains confident he can clear his mounting debt and get his family back on track. ""I have worked out a 10-years plan, just give me another five years,"" he said.

425,"Asbestos spread through their share house, but these women had to fight for compo",house-and-home,"  Asbestos spread through their share house, but these women had to fight for months to get compensation It's a tenant's worst nightmare; after complaining for more than six months about a leaking tap in their bathroom shower, Ella Gleeson and Morgana Russell finally had a plumber turn up. But it was no easy fix. The repair job wound up exposing them to potentially deadly asbestos-laden dust for a week. It was the beginning of a four-month battle to get compensation, and a stark reminder of huge gaps in the law in some states when it comes to protecting tenants from potentially hazardous risks. The 26-year-old students didn't suspect anything when the plumber finished his work on April 20. ""I just assumed he knew what he was doing,"" Ms Gleeson said. ""When he was finished, the hole he had cut in the tiles above the bathtub was still there. ""He was like, 'that's for the handyman to fix'. There was just a giant hole in the wall. There was dust everywhere."" Ms Russell added: ""I saw a hole in our shower wall. I saw dust all over."" They waited — but no handyman came to seal up the wall. After three days, they decided to clean up the mess. ""The dust just spread around the house,"" Ms Gleeson said. On the fourth day her brother, a carpenter, visited. ""I showed him and his face dropped. 'That's asbestos'. So then we just panicked,"" Ms Gleeson said. The women say they were initially dismissed by the property manager. The manager denies that. But all agree it took a further 48 hours for a test for asbestos to be carried out. The results were what they feared: asbestos. The women were told not to re-enter the house and removalists were called in. ""The house was locked down, [there was] tape over it saying 'asbestos, do not enter'. Bags of our stuff were out the front of our house,"" Ms Russell said. After receiving alternative accommodation at a hotel, the women were told a clearance certificate had been issued. It declared the areas that had been inspected were safe for re-occupation. They could move back in. But there was one problem: work on the shower hadn't finished. ""There was a giant hole in the wall, and they just expected us to go back. And when we questioned them with that, they dumped a portaloo shower in our driveway,"" Ms Gleeson said. The tenants didn't feel safe returning to the house. They questioned the clearance certificate, which was only based on air monitoring in three rooms. They knew dust from the work in the bathroom had spread throughout the property. They went to Victoria's Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) to force the landlord to do more testing, and remove carpets they say had been covered in asbestos dust. They lost. To challenge the clearance certificate, they would have had to pay up to $500 to hire their own expert. ""Tenants are really on the back foot with that,"" said Mark O'Brien, CEO of Tenants Victoria. ""If you want to establish your own evidence, quite often you've got to pay a specialist to come and give you a report. And those kinds of expert reports can be very expensive."" When the legal challenge failed, the women donned their own suits and respirators to salvage what they could from the share house. Furniture and appliances that had been exposed to dust were written off. All the while, the women received contradictory advice from government departments. Because the asbestos exposure happened while work was underway, the house was classified a worksite. The agency that regulates asbestos on worksites, WorkSafe Victoria, did visit the premises — but by that stage, it told the women in an email it did not have authority because work had finished. The tenants also contacted Consumer Affairs Victoria. It told the women it was responsible for landlord and tenant issues — but not asbestos. ""It was just a merry-go-round of talking to different agencies,"" Ms Russell said. ""They all didn't have any clear picture of whose jurisdiction this was. No-one knew anything really about asbestos."" Victoria's Minister of Consumer Affairs Marlene Kairouz told the ABC in a statement it was ""a very concerning case and I understand the frustration and anxiety of the tenants involved in this incident"". ""I have instructed my department to review this case and we'll actively consider any changes needed to better protect tenants against exposure to this dangerous material,"" she said. In June, the women launched a second claim to recover rent and money for some of the possessions they'd lost. They received a settlement offer that included a clause asking them to release the landlord and contractors from all claims arising from the discovery of asbestos. Fearing they were now at risk of the deadly disease mesothelioma, they refused to sign. ""Potentially it prevents the girls in the future from bringing a claim if, God forbid, anything happens to them,"" said Tracy Madden, one of the country's leading asbestos lawyers. ""The difficulty with asbestos-related conditions is they often don't turn up for decades. ""I would always urge people to get these sort of releases looked at to make sure they're not inadvertently giving away rights."" Eventually, the women accepted a settlement offer they received just days before their compensation hearing. The new settlement means they don't have to give up any future asbestos claims. Renters in Australia are putting up with poor-quality housing for fear of being thrown out. ""They really underestimated that we had nothing left to lose,"" Ms Gleeson said. ""So we just decided to fight instead."" Both tenants said they were worried about what might happen to the next tenants who rent their former house. In some states, landlords are required to inform potential tenants about hazards like asbestos in a property. But not in Victoria. ""At the moment in the tenancy law there's no obligation for anybody to disclose to the tenant a past situation in the rented premises,"" Mr O'Brien said. ""So this is a very significant gap in the tenancy law that needs to be addressed."" Ms Madden said tenants deserved to be protected. ""It all comes down to: would you want your family living there? You need to be safe in your own home,"" she said.

426,"This man made a DIY powerwall from scrap batteries, and says 'anybody could do it'",house-and-home,"  Australian man's DIY powerwall made from scrap batteries A Brisbane man spent 18 months collecting and wiring together thousands of discarded batteries to create his own ""homebrew"" version of a Tesla Powerwall, Elon Musk's home energy storage system, because he ""was bored"". ""[I needed something] to get my ideas out of my skull and onto the bench, so to speak,"" Pete Matthews told The Link. The self-taught computer repairman now uses his backyard invention to power his family's off-grid household appliances, excluding his hot water, air conditioning and stove, which are still connected to the grid. He says his invention can store 40kwh, or 2.8 times the capacity of Tesla's newest 14kwh Powerwall 2. ""My power bill came down from about $1,700 to around $400, so this is significant savings,"" he said. Mr Mathews said his system cost him $10,000 and is made from 4,480 18650-type lithium-ion batteries, a generic battery, commonly found inside laptops and other rechargeable consumer devices. The batteries, which are sold by the kilo by recycling companies, are about 8 cents each, while his other componentry was purchased on eBay. ""You buy stuff off the old interwebs and you solder it up and it actually works,"" he said. The US science and technology website Motherboard recently called Mr Matthews ""one of the most central figures of the DIY powerwall scene"". It's a scene where backyard hobbyists around the world share ideas and their experiences scavenging for batteries and designing their home energy storage systems and even cars. ""There's a large emerging community on the DIY powerwall forum and the Facebook group. We're global, everywhere from third world countries to first world countries,"" he said. ""There's blokes in their sheds, their basements, in their back pergolas, all doing these projects, all having fun, all learning together, all growing as a community. Anybody could do it."" Mr Matthews told The Link he used a licensed electrician to ensure his system was safe and up to code. He said the projects showed great potential for the energy needs of the third world, where power security is unreliable, recycled parts are available and the need for green energy is greatest. Dozens of struggling miners have moved to reinvent themselves as lithium companies. Why? But Mr Matthews said the bigger global energy picture did not occur to him while building his home project. ""I never once considered the environment,"" he said. Mr Matthews is cautious of comparisons to Tesla's product. ""Being realistic, mine's not going to last as long as a Tesla Powerwall,"" he said. ""I've used recycled cells, they have been overheated, have been overcharged, over discharged. ""[They have had] a hard life by the time I've gotten to them.

427,"Higher prices, reduced services, stricter rules: Retirement village residents pan Lendlease",house-and-home,"  Lendlease accused of hiking prices, reducing services at retirement villages One of Australia's largest property developers has been accused of raising fees and downgrading services at its retirement villages. Lendlease describes itself as ""Australia's largest owner, operator and developer of senior living communities"". But current and former residents who have contacted the ABC say that after Lendlease bought their villages, services decreased, rules became more strict, and fees went up. Most of them would only speak on condition of anonymity, afraid of a backlash in their villages if they spoke out. One 85-year-old woman, who has been living in a retirement village on the Sunshine Coast since 2003, said services declined after Lendlease took over, but fees kept rising with inflation. ""It just increased every year but we didn't get so many facilities and help,"" she said. The resident said when she first moved into the village, it employed a registered nurse as well as carers. ""If you were sick they would come at any time, it was a 24-hour service,"" she said. ""You could just press your buzzer and it would go straight to them and they would help. ""Now we have to ring triple-0 to get an ambulance."" Lendlease said in a statement that residents are consulted with and ultimately steer the decision on the services offered at a village level and the service fees reflect this. It said it was always disappointed when its residents felt let down. It said it had introduced a dedicated residents' hotline to manage issues, and was calling for retirement industry reform, including improved standards and increased transparency. No system is 100 per cent secure, but the Signal app uses end-to-end encryption and can protect your identity. Please read the terms and conditions. The great-grandmother said there also used to be a full-time maintenance man in the village who would do odd jobs for the residents, but Lendlease stopped hiring him. ""There is what is called Home Assist and you can ring them up and they will do certain things in the house, and they don't charge you for their time, just for any parts, but usually you have wait two or three days to get them to come,"" she said. Should you help Mum and Dad stay home, move them into a retirement village or residential aged care? We asked some experts. The 85-year-old said she was now forced to do maintenance herself — including climbing up on chairs to replace lightbulbs. She wants to leave, saying the rules and regulations of the village are too restrictive. ""We are told, 'we can do this' and, 'we can do that', and I would rather have my own house and be independent, more independent,"" she said. The woman paid more than $290,000 to buy her lease in the village. She has asked Lendlease about leaving but would have to pay an exit fee of nearly $85,000, plus $1,000 to cover Lendlease's legal costs. She would also have to pay for her unit to be refurbished and pay a ""general services charge"", but said Lendlease did not tell her exactly how much that would be. ""I just can't afford it. I would lose about $100,000 if I left the village,"" she said. One couple who have managed to leave a Lendlease village are Ferne and Kenneth Fyfe. When their retirement village in Bundaberg was taken over by Lendlease, they say the company imposed too many rules and restrictions. ""We could not hang a pot plant, we couldn't put up anything like a frame to put up plants and things, or anything like that,"" Ms Fyfe said. ""They had their own gardeners and they came round and chopped down anything they didn't like. I hated it because we had no control. ""It's the first time we'd ever felt like that because we'd always owned our own home and to suddenly find that we couldn't do the things we wanted to do — it was awful."" The Fyfes said Lendlease also increased their general service fee from about $300 a quarter to about $500 a quarter. ""All they were worried about was how much money they could make out of us, I think,"" Ms Fyfe said. The nest eggs of older Australians are being whittled away as they experience lengthy delays in sales of their homes in retirement villages. The Fyfes said they began to grow concerned as they saw how long it was taking some of their neighbours' units to sell. ""One unit in our street took five years to sell,"" she said. ""I was terrified that we would die and the kids would be left trying to sell the unit, and having all these legal battles with Lendlease and having to pay fees on it. ""That was really really worrying me because none of them were in a position to be able to do that."" The Fyfes found another retirement village nearer to their children in South Australia and sold their Bundaberg unit. Their original contract said their exit fee would be a percentage of the money they invested at the beginning. But Lendlease changed that, charging the couple a percentage of the amount the unit sold for. ""We worked out that in the end it cost us just over $100,000 because we had to pay exit fees,"" Ms Fyfe said. ""Then just to add insult to injury, just as we were about to leave to come down here [to South Australia], we got a bill from Lendlease for their legal fees for the sale and really … that was the last straw."" Another couple who live in the Fyfes' former retirement village came to the ABC separately with similar complaints, but they said they could not afford to leave. Lendlease said in Queensland it had invested $21.5 million since it purchased some villages in 2013 out of receivership. ""This money was spent on improving quality-of-life amenities and to increase saleability and occupancy in the villages,"" it said. Problems with retirement villages have been raised before. A 2007 federal parliamentary inquiry into older people and the law recommended the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), together with state and territory Fair Trading offices, form a working party to examine the nature of retirement village contracts, with a view to improving consumer protection provision. It recommended the working party review all aspects of exit and other fees associated with such contracts, including whether they should be abolished. That review never happened. Federal Liberal MP Tim Wilson said there was a case for the ACCC to review retirement village contracts. ""Looking at what best practice should be, to ensure that there are proper protections in place for people who may experience problems as a consequence of going into retirement villages, and making sure people are protected at a vulnerable stage of their life,"" he said. The 2007 inquiry also recommended that federal, state and territory consumer affairs ministers consider appointing a statutory supervisor, such as an ombudsman or commissioner, so retirees have someone to investigate and resolve disputes. There is a meeting of consumer affairs ministers in Melbourne on Thursday and Federal Small Business Minister Michael McCormack said he would raise the issue of retirement villages. The industry has been under scrutiny since June when a joint Four Corners-Fairfax investigation revealed operator Aveo was stinging retirees with complicated contracts, oppressive rules and crippling fees. Editor's note August 31, 2017: This story has been updated to correct an error. The original story quoted the Fyfes as saying their general service fee had been increased by Lendlease from $300 a month to $500 a month. The couple actually said their fees had increased from $300 a quarter to $500 a quarter.

428,'A total rip-off': Alice Springs one of the worst places in Australia to rent,house-and-home,"  Alice Springs one of the worst places in Australia for renters, struggling residents forced to leave For landlords, Alice Springs offers one of the best deals in Australia, with high returns on relatively cheap properties. But for renters, it's one of the worst. The cost to rent a house in the iconic outback town is on par with Sydney, leaving many tenants struggling to find an affordable home and skipping town altogether — or slipping into homelessness. Liz Fitzgerald is a health professional who moved from the Sydney suburb of Edgecliff to Alice Springs earlier this year for work. She said she was shocked by the price and condition of rental properties in town, describing it as ""the worst renting deal in Australia"" where landlords had all the power. ""I thought when you moved to the country, you got space and big backyards and you'd get something that was value for money, but you can't get value for money here, you have to go with whatever you can get,"" she said. ""In Sydney, I had a beautiful, art deco harbour-view apartment… here I've got a two-bedroom flat with car-park views."" She said she, like many others, struggled to find an affordable place to live which was in good condition. ""I have a friend who is paying $300 a week for a granny flat which is just a room with a bathroom and a sink attached… and she was happy to pay it because it was in a safe area and she needed somewhere to live,"" Ms Fitzgerald said. ""That's a total rip-off."" Compared to capital cities across the nation, Alice Springs has the highest rental yield, meaning landlords generate a higher return on rent compared to the value of the property. On average, house rental prices are the same in Alice Springs as they are in Sydney, yet the cost to buy a house is half the price — and falling. In Alice Springs the value of houses dropped almost 12 per cent over the June quarter, and the cost of units was down nearly 16 per cent, yet rents climbed by up to five per cent. ""From an investor's point of view, [Alice Springs] is phenomenal,"" said Quentin Kilian, CEO of the Real Estate Institute NT. But he disputed claims that renters in the red centre were getting a raw deal, saying a rental yield did not factor in the cost to maintain properties or mortgage repayments. ""The yield itself doesn't really have an impact on the renters,"" he said. ""The rental price that a renter is going to pay is dependent entirely on how much stock is available in the market, and therefore what a landlord is able to charge for that property; it's also going to come back to quality of the property. ""The balance has been very much in favour of the tenants; many landlords have been operating at major losses for the last 12 months by not being able to recoup even to the level of their own mortgage in their rent."" The latest REINT report showed vacancy rates dropping to 4.2 per cent in Alice Springs. As the availability of rental properties tightens, renting granny flats has become common practice, with some homeowners charging up to $400 a week for a furnished, one-bedroom unit in their backyard. There's also reports would-be renters are offering above the asking price to secure a rental property, or negotiating deals with landlords before a vacant property is even advertised. Rental affordability in Alice Springs was approaching crisis point and worsening the region's homelessness crisis, said Sally Langton, CEO of Central Australia Affordable Housing. She said those with fewer ties to Alice Springs were simply leaving town. ""Many of the granny flats are almost as expensive as a one-bedroom unit and I've seen the inside of some of the places… they're shabby and old and not got up-to-date amenities,"" she said. She said working families often couldn't afford to rent a house, and were looking for flats or townhouses instead. ""For people on extremely low incomes, like Centrelink, they're just squashed out of the market altogether,"" Ms Langton said. ""As this community grows, there is just nowhere to place people."" When Markus Hartmann retired four years ago, he could no longer afford to pay $300 a week in rent for a sub-par granny flat, but couldn't find a cheaper alternative. He turned to regular house-sitting, looking after people's homes and pets for a few weeks at a time when the owners are away in exchange for free rent. ""The last place I rented was a granny flat on Gap Road and I paid $300 a week for that; that was one bedroom extension of the house and I had to pay the power and gas on top of that,"" he said. ""[I paid] $1200 a month which is what I got on the pension, so regardless of what I did, work or not work, I was always a bit short. ""Rent is just too high; when you live in Sydney or Melbourne, you pay that kind of money there, you sort of expect it, but a little backwater like this, you don't expect it."" Mr Kilian said the price of rent was based on basic supply and demand and the condition of the property. Rear Vision takes a look back at the national obsession with home ownership. ""You're seeing a diminishing supply, and simple economics would tell you when your supply goes down but demand goes up, you're going to increase the cost of that rental,"" Mr Kilian said. ""The rental price is dependent entirely on how much stock is available in the market and therefore what a landlord is able to charge for that property. ""Unless there's more supply coming through, then there is a possibility that it would tighten even more so the key to balancing it out is to increase the supply."" Ms Langton said more needed to be done to address the ""homelessness crisis"" in the Northern Territory. ""There haven't been terribly many developments over the last few years so as the demand is growing our supply has actually remained static,"" she said. ""If you want to grow the economy here and if you want to grow as a regional town, you need to have a good housing supply to attract and keep people in the community.""

429,Take a look inside one man's $120m gift to Australia,house-and-home,"  James Fairfax's $120m gift to Australia: Inside his mansion and art collection The late newspaper scion James Fairfax owed his fortune to the great publishing company founded by his great-great-grandfather, but his life's legacy is a lesson in fine art and public largesse. Before Fairfax died in January at the age of 83, he bequeathed to the National Trust his sumptuous Victorian estate in the NSW Southern Highlands to be opened as a house museum. Valued at $18 million, the pink, furnished Italianate mansion Retford Park in Bowral and its ornate topiary gardens, modern swimming pool and emu run, is the most generous gift the NSW Trust has ever received. During his life Fairfax donated artworks to all the nation's big public art galleries, but it was his $30 million gift of old European masterworks to the Art Gallery of NSW in the 1990s that stole headlines and underpinned the James Fairfax Galleries at Sydney's sandstone temple of art. Even after this lifetime of giving, Fairfax has left behind an unrivalled personal collection of Australian modern and colonial paintings and more European old masters. There is also a collection of antiques and furnishings, some 517 lots, which have been retrieved from his properties in Sydney, England and from Retford Park, which provide insight into the taste and intellect of a very private public figure. Fairfax's personal art and decorative art collection will go under the hammer at three public auctions in Sydney next week with a total $6 million reserve, but with expectations of raising significantly more than that. Both auction houses handing the auctions, Deutscher and Hackett for the art and Leonard Joel for the decorative arts, report having received unprecedented interest in the collection. Unlike most single-owner art collections previously dispersed in Australia, such as the $19 million-grossing Reg and Joy Grundy collection sold in 2013, Fairfax worked without a professional curator. He made all his own choices, drawing on personal expertise. Henry Mullholland is an art specialist with Deutscher and Hackett, which is selling 54 of Fairfax's Australian artworks. Mr Mulholland also worked with Fairfax for 20 years, helping run his Sydney household, so he observed at close range how his former boss approached art collecting. ""When James Fairfax would buy a picture it was often the first one sold in that exhibition, and because he got the first choice, it was considered to be the best,"" Mr Mullholland said. ""He certainly considered his choices to be the best, but then that picture would become the touchstone for all the others in the collection and other collectors would follow his example."" Fairfax habitually made his collection available to art curators at the big public galleries, so paintings and sculptures would not only rotate through Fairfax's properties but also go off on tour around Australia and occasionally abroad. Fairfax's commitment to loaning artworks encouraged artists to continue to give him first choice. It established those artworks in the public conscience and contributed to scholarship about them because they would come to be featured in catalogues. But it also enhanced his reputation as a collector. John Olsen's The Bicycle Boys Rejoice is a case in point. Inspired by children in Centennial Park and painted in 1955, the oil on canvas which hung in the sitting room at Retford Park is on pre-auction display at Deutscher and Hackett with a $70,000 reserve, having come directly from loan to the Olsen retrospective You Beaut Country at the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW) and the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV). Bicycle Boys has been publicly exhibited at least five times during more than half a century in Fairfax's collection, and like most of the modern artworks offered for sale, it was only ever owned by him. Fairfax's colonial paintings are what the auction industry describes as ""museum quality"", and they have been repatriated to Australia from his historic Standbridge Mill estate in Dorset, England, where the Oxford graduate used to spend several months each year. ""At the house in Dorset he had predominantly Australian paintings and he very much saw that as an outpost of Australian art, and when people would come to him it was a little bit of an art embassy in a way,"" Mr Mullholland said. The art auction catalogue cover painting, Eugene von Guerard's Mr John King's Station, plus Arthur Streeton's Minaret's Cairo, which are listed for $800,000 and $300,000 respectively, are the jewels of Fairfax's colonial collection. ""Mr Fairfax saw the importance of having really good A-grade pictures still available to private collectors, even though he gave numerous colonial masterpieces to the NGA [National Gallery of Australia] over many years,"" Mr Mulholland said. Fairfax's nephew Edward Simpson is a director of the James Fairfax Foundation, which will continue to fund ""in perpetuity"" his uncle's favourite charities with income from a fund of more than $100 million, enhanced by the land surrounding Retford Park having been sold to developers for housing and by the sale of Fairfax's chattels this week. Fairfax's remaining European old masterworks — including a painting by Giovanni Canaletto, Giovani Francesco Romanelli's The Three Marys of the Sepulchre and Titian's Portrait of a Nobleman — have been dispersed between the NGV, AGNSW, NGA and the Queensland Art Gallery, but those galleries have not yet revealed the gifts. Mr Simpson described a man raised in the war-era who took seriously the responsibilities his family's immense wealth conferred on him. In 1987 Fairfax stepped down after a decade as chairman of the media company and sold his share of the family business to his half-brother Warwick. ""In '87 he was 54 and for the first time in his life he was free,"" Mr Simpson said. This increased wealth spurred his art collecting and subsequent art donations, but Westmead Children's Hospital, the Children's Medical Research Foundation and Worldwide Fund for Nature top what Mr Simson described as a five or six A4 page dossier of charities his uncle supported. ""James was very ill early in his life, so there is a personal thread to his support of children's medicine,"" he said. The National Trust received the keys to Retford Park this month, a new manager moved in last week and the property's conversion into a house museum has begun, with public opening expected within months. Beyond the small garden grotto where Fairfax's ashes were sprinkled around a small headstone, and those of his pets and friend art publisher Mervyn Horton, the single most intriguing aspect of the house is the dining room murals painted by Donald Friend over four months in the late 1960s. The legendary murals depict Fairfax's family history; there's a diner party with tiny portraits of actual guests Fairfax encountered at the table and a riff on the seasons which is likely to receive significant scrutiny once the public showings begin.

430,"Households reap huge power bill savings, but those who need it most miss out",house-and-home,"  Households reap huge power bill savings but renters and the poor miss out: Curtin report The rooftop solar power revolution may be helping millions of Australians bring down their power bills, but a new report has warned that the people who need it the most are missing out because they cannot afford the technology. The report from Curtin University suggests poor households are being bypassed by the shift to renewables. The benefits of solar panels and batteries could also bypass renters whose landlords are reluctant to invest in solar technology, a double-whammy for poor households — who are more likely to rent — and people living in buildings unsuitable for solar panels, such as old apartments. The problem is especially acute in Western Australia, where the Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre report shows that just 7.4 per cent of its most disadvantaged citizens have rooftop solar, compared to the state average of 27.3 per cent. ""One of the conclusions of the report — and one of the calls to action — is to make sure that the lower socioeconomic groups aren't missing out on the solar revolution,"" report author Professor Alan Duncan said. The findings of the report did not come as a surprise to Bunbury-based Anglicare financial counsellor Kate Rich, who said solar panels were ""a luxury"" for her clients. ""Would it benefit people? Absolutely. Is it a luxury item? Unfortunately, yes,"" she said. ""Forking out for solar when you can barely pay your mortgage is not really going to happen."" The report comes after census data showed millions of people were being locked out of the benefits of solar due to a rise in apartment living and declines in home ownership. Professor Duncan said governments could help ensure the benefits were shared equally by offering better incentives for landlords to invest in solar technology. He was also supportive of the potential of ""citizen utilities"" projects, including a project in White Gum Valley where a strata company is managing the solar power generated at a group housing development. When you think of solar you probably think of large-scale solar farms. But Australia's real solar engine is much more humble. Professor Duncan said the worst-case scenario of a failure to act could see people who could not afford solar having to pay more for their power to financially support the electricity network. ""If more people move off the grid, then fewer people are having to support that same cost that's absorbed into the energy price,"" he said. Western Australians have been keen adopters of rooftop solar technology in a bid to capitalise on their 300 days of sunshine a year, with the third-highest uptake in the nation. But the report showed the trend was being driven largely by middle-income households, saying they were behind a 37 per cent growth in rooftop capacity in the past 18 months. The report said collectively, WA rooftops would soon become the biggest electricity provider in the state. ""Solar PV capacity is predicted to reach more than 2000MW by 2022, making it the largest quasi-power plant in WA,"" the report said.

431,A brief history of Australia's obsession with home ownership,house-and-home," RN Australia's home ownership obsession: A brief history of how it came to be Over time, the Great Australian Dream has meant different things to different people. But for the better part of a century, any reference to Australian aspirations — great or otherwise — meant buying a house. A recent ANU poll found more than three quarters of Australians viewed home ownership as part of ""the Australian way of life"". Yet, for housing experts, this fixation on owning a home of your own is curiously specific at best, and harmful at worst. ""Do you need to own?"" urban designer Peter John Cantrill asks, with the emphasis on ""need"". For Mr Cantrill, the operative question is: can you be secure where you live? Countries such as Germany and Sweden have far lower rates of home ownership, he argues, offset by controlled rents or tenancy insurance. Now, with many Australians facing mortgage stress or rental stress, the great Australian dream has become a nightmare. But is this a crisis of our own making? For some 60,000 years, Australian land was occupied by Indigenous people. Many were displaced by white settlement. New South Wales' first Governor, Arthur Phillip, somewhat naively assumed the British government would own all the land in his newfound colony. ""But what happens very quickly is that people take land without permission,"" Graeme Davison, professor of urban studies at Monash University, says. It wasn't all anarchy: freed convicts were granted land in the hope they wouldn't return to England, and retiring officers were gifted land, as were free settlers. And by the time Governor Ralph Darling arrived in 1825, a more orderly system was implemented. ""From about that point on you begin to get a more systematic freehold land system,"" Professor Davison says. ""By the 1830s, owning your own piece of property was an attainable objective."" In English cities, land tenure laws and vast church-owned estates precluded many from ever owning their own plot. This was not the case in Sydney and Melbourne. Melbourne in particular experienced quite rapid subdivision in the 1850s which, combined with the gold rush, lead to the establishment of shanty-towns. ""You get quite high rates of home ownership in relatively poor parts of Melbourne from quite an early age,"" Professor Davison says. Prior to South Australia's introduction of universal manhood suffrage in 1856, landowning was a way to attain a vote in the political process. It was a line that continued, even after colonies ceased to apply to property qualifications for suffrage. ""Right into the end of the 19th century, you find people promoting home ownership saying, 'It will make you a citizen in a fuller sense than if you didn't own your own house.'"" Figures collected early in Professor Davison's career suggest 44 per cent of Melburnians owned their own home in 1881, with similar rates in Sydney and Adelaide. These are not figures matched anywhere else in the developed world at the time. ""Most other cities don't get anywhere near it,"" he says. From the turn of the 20th century, Australian houses did something quite unusual: they fed the families who lived in them. ""The house wasn't just a place to live [in Australia], but it was a place to grow your food,"" Mr Cantrill says. Other countries, he says, would place their farmland outside of town centres. Citizens would walk to the farmsteads, and vice versa. But that's not what happened in Australia. ""We had the agriculture and the house together, and this established … the so-called quarter-acre block,"" Mr Cantrill says. For Mr Cantrill, the effect his had on Australian cities cannot be overstated. ""This gives shape to cities which are extremely low density and occupy vast land,"" he says. These kind of cities were also formed by the availability of motor vehicles, cheap oil, and an expanding economy. The dominance of the quarter-acre block led to the low density sprawl seen today: with double garages and media rooms taking the place of these early vegetable plots. During the Cold War, Australian governments looked to housing as a means of keeping communism at bay. ""Citizens committed to mortgages,"" ran one wartime advertisement, ""tend not to be revolutionaries."" The Menzies government tinkered with the housing mix. ""There was quite a move away from public housing,"" Lionel Frost, an associate professor of economics at Monash Business School, says. Menzies' government created incentives for renters to purchase their houses, if they rented from the Public Housing Authority. ""It was a very much hands-off approach by the Commonwealth government at the time,"" Associate Professor Frost says. After World War II, waves of migrants came to Australia from England, Ireland and Europe. Greeks and Italians, in particular were keen to own their own homes. ""They have a very strong preference for having their own home, because it provided an opportunity not available in Britain or Europe,"" Associate Professor Frost says. By the mid 1970s Australian home ownership had reached something of a saturation point: 70 to 75 per cent. The 80s was a time for structural changes around Australian homeowning. The finance industry was deregulated. Dual income households were the norm, making mortgages easier to attain. Rising interest rates were followed by dramatically tumbling interest rates. ""Changes in the availability and the cost of finance had really big implications for the housing market in particular,"" Nicole Gurran, a professor of planning at the University of Sydney, says. Prior to deregulation, the housing system was geared around owner-occupiers, and property investors loaning from the bank would incur a considerable rate penalty on their loans. But the equalising of interest rates moved the goal posts of home ownership. Homes were increasingly purchased for their exchange value — used as leverage, as a vehicle for wealth accumulation. ""We certainly have seen an increase in people investing in housing, including their own housing, with a view to accumulating wealth,"" Professor Gurran says. ""This certainly increased in the 1990s and the 2000s."" By the early 1990s, Professor Gurran says, property prices rose faster than inflation, while interest rates decreased. With the proportion of public housing at a low, a strong private rental market was needed to do ""the heavy lifting"". Rear Vision takes a look back at the national obsession with home ownership. ""We start to see things like negative gearing,"" she notes. That made investment in the private rental market seem attractive for landlords — thus expanding the rental market, and their portfolios. For Professor Davison, this was a seismic shift in conceptions of the Australian dream. ""In the 60s and 70s … home ownership was a democratic ideal,"" he says. ""[But] increasingly, I think, people came to look at the house not just for its use value but — to use the Marxist jargon — its exchange value.""

432,Designing the perfect house to treat insomnia,house-and-home," RN Treating insomnia with architecture: How a house is helping heal childhood trauma For 50 of his 61 years, Brett Lockwood has kept odd hours. He rarely sleeps before 3:00am and the slightest human sound can jolt him fully awake. So when Mr Lockwood and his partner Jennifer started planning house extensions on their California-style bungalow in Brunswick, Melbourne, it was the moment he'd been waiting for. ""Part of it was always my desire to have, for the first time in my life really, a room that was reliably quiet,"" he said. ""The key word for me would be reliable."" Mr Lockwood's specific needs are borne out of trauma. In 1965, when he was 10 years old, he was raped on the way home from school by a stranger. His sleeping difficulties began soon after. ""I'm afraid to go to sleep because I can't monitor my environment,"" he said. ""And that would go back to the sexual assault. I imagine that would resonate with some other people as well."" In contrast to his need for quiet, Jennifer wanted this new part of the house to be a social hub, where her family of 14 could sit down comfortably for Christmas. Serving the competing needs for this space was one of the greatest challenges architect Anthony Clarke had faced. ""They're two completely different clients, essentially,"" he said. ""We wanted to ensure it didn't read as two separate ideas … that it read as one project inside and out."" The result — the Garden Pavilion — is extraordinary in both its simplicity and its effectiveness. The combination of Mr Clarke's design, and Mr Lockwood's research into materials and techniques, won an award for sustainability at the Houses Awards, announced earlier this month. The Garden Pavilion is aptly named. On the outside a long set of curved windows and folding doors arch into the back garden, ending at a sharp corner of glass. At that point, the windows are enclosed with hinged four-metre-high shutters of western red cedar that have been charred black with a blowtorch. When closed, these imposing blackened panels seal Mr Lockwood's bedroom against outside light, and sound. ""Brett comes outside when he wakes and he undoes the tarp straps and the carabiner hooks, opens up the big panels and then gets connection to the garden,"" Mr Clarke said. ""The beautiful thing about the charred timber is that it leaves a mark, so the ritual signifies two different states: from awake to sleep or sleep to awake."" As the architect talks, he demonstrates how the heavy shutters open and close. By the time he's finished, his face and hands are streaked with black. From the garden, you enter a wide long room with a new kitchen at one end, and Mr Lockwood's bedroom at the other. Ceilings vary in height from the kitchen to dining to a reading nook. Uncharred western red cedar lines the skylight because of its ability to absorb sound. Despite a polished concrete floor, lots of windows and an exposed concrete brick wall, when people speak there is no echo. The living area is an acoustically dead space. The space is warm in winter and cool in summer. It's large enough to accommodate a modern restaurant, but with none of the exhausting sound reflections that plague contemporary dining. ""Jennifer can be right down one end of this space and speak quite quietly, and I will hear what she says,"" Mr Lockwood said. So how could Mr Lockwood's adjoining bedroom possibly be quiet when friends and family come for a drink or a meal? This is where the Garden Pavilion's clever design comes in. The bedroom is small, high-ceilinged, with no parallel walls. On one corner are the double-glazed windows, enclosed with the charred shutters. Another window looks down the side fence. When Mr Lockwood wants to shut out the sound, he shuts not one, but two doors. ""I did a lot of thinking about it and came up with a second door: a 45mm solid timber door that closes on magnets,"" he said. Once the door is shut, even raised voices in the room next door cannot be heard. And once the light is turned out, the room falls into utter blackness. The living space is only a metre away, but it may as well be a separate country. It's been a little over a year since extrovert Jennifer and introvert Brett moved into the extension. It has the spaces they need, but allows them to be with each other at a moment's notice. But breaking a 50-year pattern of wakefulness from childhood trauma will take time, Mr Lockwood said. ""Once I'm asleep I sleep for longer. It's changed my life, really … the one word is confidence. It's something I've never had before,"" he said. For Mr Clarke, this deep collaboration turned friendship has broken new ground for the architectural firm in which he works. He's now working on creating better living spaces for people dealing with dementia and autism. ""Now we're talking to psychologists, anthropologists, ethnographers … all these people we need to talk to, to apply a much better physical result,"" he said.

      August 23, 2017 12:09:49 Australia's housing market has reached a unique point in its history: household debt at a record high, interest rates at an all-time low.   It's a ""perfect storm"" that means mortgage stress will spread swiftly, even with small increases in interest rates, according to mortgage industry expert Martin North. Already, one in four mortgaged households are in stress — meaning they do not have enough income to cover mortgage repayments and other living expenses. North's modelling shows how this figure would rise — and which neighbourhoods would be hit hardest — if interest rates were raised. It is based on research by his highly-respected consultancy, Digital Finance Analytics, which has surveyed the finances of 52,000 households a year for more than 10 years. The current interest rate, also known as the official cash rate, is at a record low 1.5 per cent. (The rate charged on home loans is generally 3-4 percentage points higher.) Most experts agree that, sooner or later, interest rates will have to rise, although it is not clear by how much or how quickly. The Reserve Bank has signalled that a ""neutral nominal cash rate"" is 3.5 per cent, implying that there could be a 2 percentage point increase in the cash rate to balance inflation and economic growth. At current interest rates, more than 820,000 households are in mortgage stress, with those in regional and remote areas more likely to affected. This chart, based on Digital Finance Analytics' modelling, shows how mortgage stress would spread if interest rates were increased by up to 5 percentage points. While an interest rate rise above 2 percentage points is widely seen as unlikely, the official cash rate topped 17 per cent in 1990 and most recently reached 7 per cent in 2008.  The line climbs steeply at the beginning, showing how quickly stress spreads, even with small rate increases. This is North's ""perfect storm"": the combination of flat incomes, soaring house prices, high household debt and low interest rates. ""You only need a small consequential change … to actually really create that pain point,"" North said.  ""We've got households in some degree of difficulty already now, so it doesn't take much to see the tipping point. Then we get this downward spiral and, if it goes, it could be as bad as Ireland or the US. It's a house of cards, I think."" The potential economic ripple effects could go beyond homeowners and investors as millions of households cut back their spending and load up on debt, dragging down the wider economy, North said. Some will scramble to refinance or sell. Others may lose their homes. If interest rates rise by just half a percentage point, mortgage stress would jump from an average of one in four mortgaged households to one in three. That's more than one million households. If interest rates rose by one percentage point, mortgage stress would be as common in cities as it in the country, according to Digital Finance Analytics' modelling.  Across the country, nearly 40 per cent of mortgaged households would be in financial stress, while in some postcodes, the figure would climb past 80 per cent. These include: A rise of two percentage points would push half of all mortgaged households — or 1.6 million households — into financial stress.  Mortgage stress would become almost as widespread in wealthier neighbourhoods as in mainstream suburbia or the low-income urban fringes. In more than a dozen capital city postcodes, 90 per cent of households or higher would be in stress. These include: In Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's postcode, 2027 (Point Piper, Darling Point), 11 per cent of households would be in mortgage stress.

This is a higher threshold than in most analyses. At current interest rates, more than 820,000 households are in mortgage stress. That's an average of one in four. But averages hide a lot. At one extreme are postcodes where less than 10% of mortgaged households are in stress. At the other, are those where at least 90% are in stress. Most of those postcodes are in regional and remote Australia. Mortgage stress is worse here than in major capital cities. Let's see what happens if interest rates rise by 0.5%. (They were last at this level in May 2015.) Mortgage stress jumps from one in four mortgaged households to one in three. The combination of flat incomes, rising costs and large mortgages means stress spreads quickly, even with small rate changes. More than 170 grey postcodes slide further into stress, taking 330,000 mortgaged households with them. Nearly half are in cities. This is what a 1% rise on current rates looks like. (Interest rates were last at this level in August 2013.) The number of metropolitan postcodes with more than 40% of mortgaged households in stress nearly doubles. In some, at least 80% of mortgaged households are in stress. A 2% increase from current rates throws half of all mortgaged households into stress. (Interest rates were last at this level in June 2012.) Both rich and poor are now under pressure. The burden shifts away from regional Australia. In the country, stressed households are more likely to be in the minority in their postcode. The opposite is true for cities. In Melbourne, Fawkner becomes the largest postcode to hit 100% mortgage stress. It is home to nearly 1,400 mortgaged households. In Sydney, Silverwater and Kurnell also hit 100%. In these areas, virtually every mortgaged household is in stress. Let's see what happens if interest rates rise by 3%. Most analysts think rises above 2 percentage points are unlikely. They were last at this level in November 2011. These metropolitan postcodes represent 65,000 mortgaged households. At least 90% are in stress. These represent 5,000 mortgaged households. Only 10% or less are in stress. A 4% increase above current rates would bring interest rates roughly in line with the average over the past two decades. (They were last above this level in October 2008.) More than two million households are in stress. Mooloolaba becomes Queensland's first metropolitan postcode to hit 100% mortgage stress, while Buranda and Northgate are close behind. In many of the nation's largest postcodes, more than 80% of mortgaged households are in stress. In some of the worst-affected areas, there are more than 10,000 mortgaged households. This is what mortgage stress looks like at 5% above current rates. The last time interest rates were close to this level was March 2008. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's postcode, 2027, is among 20 metropolitan postcodes with less than 20% of mortgaged households in stress. Meanwhile, across the nation, more than 170 metropolitan postcodes have at least 90% of mortgaged households in stress. How will your neighbourhood cope if interest rates rise?      Topics:

434,Retirees spending thousands waiting for retirement village properties to sell,house-and-home,"  Retirees spending thousands waiting for retirement village properties to sell The nest eggs of older Australians are being whittled away as they experience lengthy delays in sales of their homes in retirement villages. Many retirement village operators act as real estate agent, vendor and buyer in such transactions, which experts have warned could lead to a conflict of interest. Retirees are often required to pay maintenance fees for months, even after they've moved out. For some, their deferred management or exit fees increase the longer they own the property. ""There is a real incentive there to drag out the sales process to maximise the fees that they can charge residents and their families,"" the Consumer Action Law Centre's Katherine Temple said. In June, the ABC's Four Corners program revealed how one retirement village operator, Aveo, was stinging retirees with complicated contracts, oppressive rules and crippling fees. But experts say problems are industry-wide, and retirees will be ripped off until the whole sector is overhauled. Four years ago, Jan Smith and her husband Harry paid nearly $700,000 to move into a unit owned by the Village Retirement Group in the Brisbane suburb of Yeronga. After Harry died, Ms Smith decided to move closer to her son in Victoria. The 78-year-old reserved a place in a retirement village in Bacchus Marsh a year ago, but hasn't been able to move because she's waiting for the money from her Brisbane unit. Retirement village contracts are complex. Ms Smith, like many retirees, didn't buy her unit — she bought the right to lease it. The only way she can escape the lease is if someone else takes it over. ""I did not think it would take 12 months, not in my wildest dreams — three months, I thought. My financial situation has deteriorated considerably just to keep going,"" she said. Since August last year, Ms Smith has spent $6,800 for the contents of her home to be kept in a storage facility, and $6,125 in payments to the Village Retirement Group for electricity and monthly maintenance fees for her unit. ""Financially it was a burden, a big burden,"" she said. ""Any money that I had has just dwindled to almost nothing."" The Village Retirement Group has told the 7.30 the monthly maintenance fees cover ""the operational cost of management and administration of the village"". It also said it had tried to make Ms Smith's unit more saleable. But the retiree said that meant her unit looked like a construction zone for months. Tired of living out of a suitcase, she eventually decided to sign a lease for a house in Bacchus Marsh while she waited for her unit to sell — and her children are paying the rent. The Village Retirement Group said it had not dragged out the sale of Ms Smith's unit to maximise the maintenance fees it could charge her. One former resident describes Aveo's business practices as ""totally rapacious, I don't know how they get away with it"". It said after six months she could have appointed her own real estate agent. The company offered to get in touch with the Victorian retirement village Ms Smith wants to move into, to see if they can do a deal. But, she said, after the frustrations she has experienced trying to deal with the company, she doesn't want them to have anything to do with her new property. Now, Ms Smith has learned the Bacchus Marsh retirement village can no longer wait for her. It's cancelled her reservation, but has put her name down for a new unit — but that isn't even built yet. ""I've lost control of my life completely,"" she said. ""It's very unsettling, I feel I don't belong anywhere, it's limbo."" The Consumer Action Law Centre said firm data on average sale times for retirement units was hard to come by because it was not disclosed by the industry. A 2014 report by the Property Council of Australia said, ""while a dwelling can sell in nine months, much longer times of 18 or even 24 months are not uncommon"". Dr Tim Kyng, from Macquarie University, is an expert in complex financial contracts and is currently working on a project to help retirement village consumers. ""I believe the retirement village operators are all operating within the law, but the problem is that the legal framework itself has many problems and it needs to be reformed,"" he said. ""It is a flawed model for a range of reasons, in many ways it acts as a trap for the unwary. Once they're in, it's very difficult to escape."" Since the Four Corners report in June, Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales have flagged changes to clean up the sector but the details are yet to be released. The Consumer Action Law Centre said that was a step in the right direction but the whole industry needed a shake-up. ""Governments need to seriously look at the appropriateness of real estate agents being the retirement village operators in these sales,"" the centre's Ms Temple said. ""But we also need to look at the fundamental problems with this industry — the complexity of fees, particularly exit fees that trap residents in these arrangements, and access to appropriate dispute resolution. ""At the moment, residents and their families simply have nowhere to go when they encounter these kinds of problems so we need to see some big changes there. ""If the state governments aren't willing to step up, then the Federal Government needs to step in. We need consistency across Australia, particularly given a lot of these operators are nationwide.""

435,Mehajer mansion looking for its next king,house-and-home,"  Salim Mehajer's Sydney mansion looking for its next king Salim Mehajer's Sydney mansion, with its six bedrooms, five bathrooms, jacuzzi, solarium and 10-car garage, is packed with eyewatering opulence fit for a king — or at least a former deputy mayor. The 31-year-old, who first rose to prominence when his elaborate 2015 wedding to Aysha Learmonth shut down Frances Street, is renting out his palatial Lidcombe residence. The former Auburn deputy mayor's glittering home includes a heated pool and its own lift to help you navigate the four levels and a sunny rooftop with city views. But perhaps the most striking feature is the curved marble staircase in the entrance, which frames a crystal chandelier. The property was last sold in 2007 for $565,000, but would be worth significantly more than that now. Mehajer is fighting fires on several fronts. He is facing 128 charges over the 2012 Auburn Council elections he is accused of rigging. In a separate incident, Mehajer has pleaded not guilty to assaulting a taxi driver and stealing an EFTPOS machine in March.

436,Prolonged pain for Perth unit owners amid sluggish market,house-and-home,"  Perth unit owners in for prolonged market pain as oversupply predicted to last years Too many apartments and too few buyers means there are a couple of years of pain ahead for Perth unit owners wanting to sell. It's the perfect storm, according to property adviser and valuer Rod Davidson. Slowing population growth, a decrease in investor lending, reduced rents and a large number of apartments under construction mean properties will not sell quickly or profitably, Mr Davidson warned. The problem is particularly acute in Perth's inner-city suburbs where hundreds of apartments sold off the plan during the mining boom are now coming onto an already crowded market. ""At the beginning of the year in East Perth, Perth and West Perth there were 541 units for sale and another 1,172 due to come out of the ground, so we are going to end up with another 1,600 units there,"" Mr Davidson said. The Real Estate Institute of Western Australia (REIWA) reported that last week just 43 rental properties were leased in East Perth, while another 275 remained available. Average unit rents across Perth have fallen from an average of $395 in September 2015 to $330 in June 2017. Perth is no longer getting the influx of new residents who arrived during the boom. ""We had about four to six years of population growth of about 75,000 per annum,"" Mr Davidson said. ""The long-term trend is about 35,000 to 40,000 a year; we are now at about 25,000. ""We have lost about 10,000 people last year back to the eastern states and they are tipping this year it is going to be about 5,000."" During the boom, the high demand for rental properties attracted investors and property developers alike; it was a market in which rental returns were strong and values were increasing. In that period, many apartment buildings were planned, some of which are only now reaching completion. But the owners and developers are finding there is little interest from either buyers or tenants. And for owners of existing units who want or need to sell, it can mean waiting months for a buyer to come along — and possibly selling at a loss. Last week, rating's agency Moody's reported that for the first time, investors outnumbered owner-occupiers in mortgage defaults and that in the first three months of 2017, one quarter of Perth properties sold at a loss. Average selling days have risen from 40 in September 2013 to 68 in June 2017. ""The overall Perth market is made up of about 80 per cent houses and 20 per cent units,"" Mr Davidson said. Last week in Perth there were 7,836 houses listed for sale and 2,824 units, with units making up 27 per cent of properties on the market. Sales data shows that only 15 per cent of properties that sold last week were units. ""If we are about 30 per cent oversupplied in the unit market, it gets even more exacerbated when you look at the rental side of things,"" Mr Davidson said. Last week there were 10,646 properties for rent in Perth, 4,102 (39 per cent) of which were units. ""That should really be about 2,000 and it's 4,000,"" Mr Davidson said. Rapidly rising property prices in Sydney have also had unfortunate consequences for Perth. ""The banks, in trying to slow Sydney down, have changed their investor loan guidelines,"" Mr Davidson explained. ""To get investor loans it has become significantly harder, and that does have a roll-on effect. ""It's just another barrier to the market operating efficiently."" On the upside, Mr Davidson said there was still interest coming from investors from the eastern states. ""It's just a time thing,"" he said. ""I think units are going to be oversupplied for three years, particularly in the CBD.""

437,Here's why you should keep spiders and insects onside,house-and-home,"  Bug warfare: Making good insects and spiders work against the bad bugs around your home A house crawling with spiders and insects sounds like a bad nightmare, but a choice selection of bugs around the home can work to your benefit. Sarah Bonney, a PhD candidate at Charles Darwin University and organiser of the Darwin Insect Festival, said most people gave insects and invertebrates a bad rap. ""Insects actually play a very big role in our world,"" she said. ""Without them we wouldn't have a lot of food, they keep our soil healthy, and they basically keep the world turning."" But as well as doing their bit for the environment, beetles, bugs and other invertebrates can also work for us. And according to Ms Bonney and Macquarie University researcher Dr Lizzy Lowe, the first step is to put down the pesticide and understand which bugs are best to have around. Because of the wide variety of species that can live both inside and outside your home, spiders can be a very effective means of controlling insect populations. And if you are able to live with the knowledge that you are sharing space with spiders, they can make excellent housemates. Dr Lowe specialises in the study of spiders and their role in urban environments. ""There's basically only two spiders [in Australia] that you don't want around — the redbacks and the funnel webs,"" she said. ""They are probably best to be controlled, but every other spider will have a benefit in your house. ""They eat pests, they actually control the numbers of other spiders, and the more different types of spiders you have around the more balanced your back garden or your house's ecosystem will be. ""You'll have less cockroaches, you'll have less mites and other small critters crawling around and it will benefit the whole household."" Insects that eat other insects can be among the most advantageous creatures to have around the family home. And encouraging them to stick around can be as simple as letting nature take its course. ""Try not to use too many pesticides to kill unwanted insects,"" Ms Bonney said. ""The problem with them is that they affect the good bugs just as badly, if not worse, than the bad ones."" In the garden, carnivorous or predatory insects are adept at controlling pest species that you may not want chewing on your plants. ""Praying mantis are absolutely fascinating insects, they're really honed predators that are fantastic at catching things like bugs, flies, beetles and all sort of things that are eating your plants,"" Dr Lowe said. She said lady beetles, often revered for their prettiness, were also great predators. ""We call them biocontrols because they're a way of controlling pests in your garden without using pesticides, by using other insects."" Having swarms of flies buzzing about inside the home is far from healthy, but in the garden and around your home they have an important role to play. ""Flies are known as the world's pooper-scoopers,"" Ms Bonney said. ""They actually break down a lot of the poo and detritus that gets left around in the ecosystem, and all those nutrients are released back into the environment."" For Dr Lowe, flies serve a very different purpose around the home. ""To me, the most important role of flies is in the ecosystem, in the food web,"" she said. ""They are a really important source of food for a lot of insects and spiders as well. ""If we got rid of them in our ecosystems we'd basically be in a lot of trouble because a lot of things would be going without food.""

438,What price are we paying for our blitz on backyards?,house-and-home,"  Backyard blitz having an adverse impact on our health, planning expert warns Amid regular talk of the need for higher-density housing and less urban sprawl, there are concerns that the loss of backyards is bad for our health. Planning expert Linley Lutton, an adjunct senior teaching fellow at the University of WA, has told ABC Radio Perth that the suburban backyard was vanishing. ""We are building the world's largest project homes; they are massive, and at the same time we are reducing the land area on which they sit,"" he said. ""I recently did some aerial photography looking at what is happening in Perth in the outer suburbs, and I found that houses are effectively going from boundary to boundary. ""There is no useful open space where you can plant a tree or a child can play in the garden."" Dr Lutton is questioning the impact for city dwellers' health and wellbeing of not having nature available on their doorstep. ""There is a lot of research now beginning to show that urbanites are very stressed and this is having a direct impact on their mental and physical health,"" he said. ""Then there is another body of research which talks about biophilia, the relationship between plants and people and nature, and that's really mind-blowing. ""A number of studies confirm that people do a lot better mentally when they are able to look at trees, plants and recreate in open space."" While Dr Lutton said he was not arguing against higher-density housing developments, long advocated by the state government and local councils as the solution to Perth's expanding population, but that he questioned the preference for building surplus bedrooms over outdoor space. ""I am not arguing against higher density, but these are massive houses which are occupied by an average of 2.5 people. ""That is not increasing densities at all."" Public parks are only part of the solution and do not give children the opportunities of unsupervised creative play, he said. ""The argument is that the kids can go to the park, which we still provide although they are very minimal. ""But that is a problem when they are very young; parents have to go with them. ""There is a really strong argument that kids develop a more agile brain if they are able to work out their own games, build cubby houses and do their own private play that they do in gardens. ""I am trying to reawaken this idea that we need to be having a debate about the healthy city, not the compact city."" Developers are generally required to reserve 10 per cent of new subdivisions for public open space and recreation, a ratio that was set in the 1950s. Gordon Stephenson, a planner from Liverpool who along with Alistair Hepburn created the master plan for Perth's suburbs in 1955, assumed that residents would continue to have large backyards when they set the 10 per cent requirement. ""What [Stephenson] argued was that we could reduce the amount of public open space, the amount of parkland, because he argued that the health benefits of public parks would be taken care of by the backyard. ""So now we still only need to provide 10 per cent but we are losing the backyards."" Julie says: ""I am distressed by the loss of green space in our yards and suburbs, but I understand the need to contain urban sprawl. We are possession obsessed, and that includes the size of our homes."" Dr Lutton also questions the push to shift Perth residents into inner-city apartments and high-rise developments. ""They use the word 'vibrant' all the time, they talk about cafes, apartments, public transport,"" he said. ""That's all really good for people who want to live in apartments and are physically fit and resilient and so on, but it's really not necessarily a child-friendly approach to planning. ""When you look at the whole planning push at the moment it really treats people as if they are one homogenous type of individual."" Penny says: ""So many flats in the city — how the heck was Elizabeth Quay allowed? All those trees and parkland gone. Still breaks my heart."" Ultimately, Dr Lutton said he would like to see politicians lead the way in mandating backyard space in the city. ""For a change to be brought about, the consumer is not going to push it. ""Someone needs to regulate this. ""It is not going to be planning departments; politicians actually need to wake up to this issue.""

439,Perth park home owners on firmer ground after law reform,house-and-home,"  Perth Park home owners on firmer ground after law reform Long-term residents of caravan parks in Western Australia are hopeful that forthcoming changes to the laws governing their tenure will give them more protection from eviction. After a lengthy review, which began in 2014, the State Government has announced it will reform the Residential Parks (Long-stay Tenants) Act and give people who own their homes but not the land on which they stand more security of tenure. Ken Mann is the president of the Park Home Owners Association of WA (PHOA) and has lived in a park home in Woodman Point, south of Perth, for seven years. He is delighted at the changes in the law, which appear likely to go through after years of lobbying by PHOA and Shelter WA. Mr Mann told ABC Radio Perth that for many retirees, living in a demountable house in a long-stay caravan park was a way to achieve a comfortable lifestyle on a modest budget. ""We love it. We are not far from the beach and we have tuart forest right on our boundary line. ""All these parks have pretty active social clubs so there are always activities going on. ""There's a really strong sense of community and it frees up some funds so that we can do some caravanning or travelling."" For many retirees, park homes, which can be bought for as little as $35,000, are an attractive and low-cost option, especially if they are located in an otherwise unaffordable suburb. But the downside is that the parks can close, change hands or be redeveloped, leaving residents without a patch of land to place their house on, sometimes at short notice. Minister for Commerce Bill Johnston said changes to the law would prevent tenancies being terminated without grounds or automatically when a park owner sold or went into receivership. Park home owners won't have an automatic right to compensation if they have to move their home off the park, but they will be able to apply to the State Administrative Tribunal for the costs of moving their house onto another lot if a park owner terminates their tenancy before the end of the lease. For former park home owner Wendy Morris the changes come too late to help her, but she said she was pleased the Government was continuing with reform. She lost half her superannuation and had to move into a rented granny flat after her park was sold. In 2012 Ms Morris bought a park home at a park in Carine, in Perth's northern suburbs, for $75,000. ""I had been renting for quite some time and occasionally living with my daughter for the past 15 years after a marriage break-up which didn't leave me with enough to buy a house,"" Ms Morris said. At that time Perth was still booming on the back of the mining industry, and rents had become very high and were continuing to climb, and at 65 Ms Morris could access her superannuation. ""I couldn't afford to rent any longer, so I decided to access my super and I saw this park home on the market for an amount that I could afford."" The rent on the land was $225 a week. ""It suited me fine. It had two bedrooms and a nice little kitchen,"" she said. ""It had good air conditioning and it was perfect for me; small and close to a lot of conveniences."" But the park's location in a leafy Perth suburb also made it attractive to developers, and in 2015 the park was sold and the other 160 residents were given nine months' notice to leave. The closest site Ms Morris and her neighbours could find with space available was in Moora, 180km north of Perth. And although the homes are technically mobile, it was going to cost around $20,000 to dismantle and transport the house to a new location. She listed her home for sale but only attracted offers of around $10,000 to $15,000 as the deadline to leave the park approached. ""I couldn't put my name down for public housing because of the fact that I am on a pension and have a bit of super left; they wouldn't put me on the list, which is seven years' long anyway."" Ms Morris moved out and now lives in a rented granny flat in the Perth hills for $220 a week, close to the wildlife rescue centre where she volunteers. ""I live on the pension with a little bit of super that is rapidly declining."" She donated her park house to a resident of the South West town of Yarloop which was all but destroyed by a bushfire in January 2016. Members of the Maritime Union of Australia volunteered their time to dismantle the house and a moving business offered to transport the home at a significant discount. ""I thought that rather than sell it to someone for $10,000 or $15,000 and have someone make money out of it, which people were attempting to do, I decided to try and donate it to someone down in Yarloop,"" Ms Morris said. ""I felt good about it, it was sort of an inspiration. I'd lost $75,000 on it anyway, it seemed right at the time."" Mr Mann said the Government's planned changes, which also include the right to sell your own park home and the right to appeal rent increases, would make a big difference to the thousands of people who called caravan parks home. ""It's very hard to know how many people are in this situation but we estimate between 5,000 and 20,000 people in WA."" ""It gives us independent living in a really nice community environment, where we are not imposing on the state housing. ""If what the government is proposing finds its way into legislation, we will be much happier little vegemites."" Mr Johnston said the amendment would ""strike a fair balance between protecting the rights of tenants and ensuring the viability of the residential parks sector is maintained"".

440,Derelict Melbourne house transformed by street artist,house-and-home," RN Street artist Rone transforms derelict Melbourne house for 'Omega Project' A derelict federation-style house in Melbourne has been transformed into a beautiful piece of artwork — just days before it is set to be demolished to make way for a new housing development. ""I've always had my eye on the house — it was more than just painting one wall in there, you needed to have the whole thing done,"" Rone said. Rone has spent the last few years painting abandoned houses. He said he was approached by the property developer behind the large residential development on the former Amcor paper mill site, who was also a collector of his work. ""He approached me and said: 'You know, I've got this huge site and a lot of stuff is being knocked down, there could be some opportunities for you there,'"" Rone said. Rone then spent a month painting the interior of this lonely house sitting on a vast empty space. ""It's quite kooky inside,"" he said. ""One room is painted half green and half blue, and then other rooms are purple on the roof and cream on the walls. ""I also used the house for a lot of the inspiration of the colours that I'd paint things — I'd just work with what was there."" The end result is a series of striking portraits of a young woman. ""For me, the way I'm using her image is more a representation of beauty,"" he said. ""It's just this contrast of beauty and decay and you can see how she is so fragile. She is the house, in a sense, and she's on the brink of collapse."" Amongst these stunning portraits, dust and decay gathers on classic Australiana 70s furniture styled by interior designer Carly Spooner. ""I've got no idea about the history of the house,"" Rone said. ""I've tried to make it more stuff that anyone can connect to, that lets a lot of people put their own story into it."" On a dreary Monday afternoon, there is a stream of people waiting to enter the house. Rone says he's been amazed by the public interest in the project. ""You think it's going to be the cool kids into street art and graffiti, that are 18 to 24,"" he said. But instead the visitors have ranged from the very young to the very old, and he says it is appreciated most by those who grew up in the 70s. ""People who are probably over 40 are really connecting with the space because they often grew up in homes like this, especially people who live locally,"" he said. Even families who used to live in the house have made their way to the exhibition, sharing their memories of their life in Alphington. ""I've had granddaughters telling me about how they remember having Christmas here,"" he said. ""They told me that in the front room they used to have a piano and her grandfather used to play the banjo and they used to have singalongs."" As construction progresses on the site of the Alphington redevelopment, the abandoned house is ultimately destined for demolition. ""As of next week it's supposed to be demolished, which kills me in one way, but I think I would have been really heartbroken if no-one got to see it,"" Rone said. It is a common experience for the renowned street artist, who often paints in temporary spaces. ""As a street artist you put your work out there and you're back the next day and it's been painted over,"" he said. ""I guess you get thick-skinned about letting your work go when it's done. It's forced me not to be too precious about something and to live a little bit in the moment."" He said The Omega Project also told a bigger Australian story about how communities are dealing with the housing affordability crisis. Explore performance, writing, music and visual art every day. ""This is what we're losing. A lot of people blame the developers, but I think we're all responsible for it,"" he said. ""Most people don't want to live in a house like this. We don't want to live this way anymore."" We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

441,Meet the woman who feeds her family for $40 a week,house-and-home,"  This money saving expert feeds her family for $40 a week. Here's how she does it When Penina Petersen calculated that she could feed her family dinner for $1.02 a serve, she was not happy. ""I said to my husband, 'I am so upset about that two cents,'"" she told ABC Radio Melbourne's Clare Bowditch. The Melbourne-based blogger and author learned her extreme savings methods while living in regional Western Australia. She and her husband lived there for a year in 2004, after finding themselves $50,000 in debt. ""We packed our whole flat that we were living in at the time into a van ... and drove across the Nullarbor,"" she said. She said the move broke them away from the temptations of Melbourne living. ""In the city, we were spending, we were going out every weekend,"" she said. Ms Petersen says her Savings Room blog contains thousands of tips for keeping the household budget under control. But the main way she saves money is by avoiding the supermarket. ""I'm shopping once every five weeks at a supermarket,"" she said. She said the ""biggest killer"" of household finances was trips to the shops for milk. ""Supermarkets make you walk through a million aisles to get to milk, and in that process they make you spend your money,"" she said. ""I am the guru of not spending. I have my blinkers on, and I still buy too much at the supermarket if I go."" In between her big supermarket shops Ms Petersen visits local shops for fresh fruit, vegetables and milk. By spending one weekend a month cooking, Ms Petersen's family of four are able to feed themselves for $40 a week. ""We're cooking in bulk, so we're putting together freezer meals for the entire month,"" she said. ABC Radio Melbourne's Clare Bowditch speaks to money-saving blogger Penina Petersen. Her family eat the frozen meals five nights a week, with ""cook fresh"" nights on Friday and Saturday. She makes meat dishes more economical by bulking them out with beans and blended vegetables. Not only does she save money by pre-preparing meals, she also reduces the stress of the work week. ""On week nights when you're busy, coming home from business or work and stressed, you pull that little shepherd's pie straight out of the freezer into the oven,"" she said. ""We're saving an hour a night — no washing up dishes, no cooking.""

442,opinion: The simple change that would make life fairer for mothers,house-and-home,"  Introducing use-it-or-lose-it leave for fathers would make life fairer for mothers It is still the prevailing view in Australia that child care is a woman's responsibility. We have the baby, take maternity leave, and if we go back to work it is usually part time. When a man becomes a father, his working life goes on unchanged. These gender roles feel entrenched, but a simple change in policy could turn them on their head: introduce a use-it-or-lose-it paternity leave scheme, like the one available to families in Norway. In the 10 years before we had kids, my partner (who is now my husband) and I studied at university, travelled, worked full time and split the chores fairly evenly. The birth of our daughter was like a grenade landing in our gender-neutral utopia. Suddenly, our roles diverged. I was on maternity leave, breastfeeding around the clock, not sleeping much and now expected to do the housework. Managing this domestic upheaval was one of the hardest parts of becoming a mother. Women are expected to manage their family's domestic life and it's reflected in the census data: one in five men say they do zero hours of unpaid domestic work each week, while about 12 per cent of women say they do more than 30 hours. When I went back to work after 12 months at home with my daughter, who is now four, it was part-time. My experience is common: according to ABS data from 2013, mothers in Australia take on average 32 weeks maternity leave, and 84 per cent return to work in a part-time role. Meanwhile, 70 per cent of partners who take leave are back at work in two weeks. A growing number of parents are choosing to delay when their child starts school but the decision is also causing them stress and anxiety, a major Queensland study finds. It means that in Australia, female workforce participation in relatively low by global standards at 59.3 per cent. What's more, men earn more. Women make up 71.6 per cent of all part-time employees, which means they are more likely to be overlooked for promotion. And men far outnumber women in leadership roles. I was very glad to receive paid parental leave from the government (and yes, I double dipped). Money is the last thing you want to be worrying about when you're caring for a newborn. But the current system makes the birth mother the primary carer by default. Dad doesn't get a look in. Under the PPL, the primary carer is eligible for up to 18 weeks' pay at minimum wage, nine times more than Dad and Partner Pay, which is two weeks at minimum wage. The birth mother can transfer her more generous leave to her partner — but this rarely happens. The situation is different in Norway. A ""paternal quota"" allows fathers (and co-mothers) 10 weeks of non-transferrable leave after the birth or adoption of a child. An equivalent quota exists for mothers, with the rule that the first six weeks comes from the maternal quota. What exactly do we know about the causes of parental guilt, and how can you turn feeling bad into a change for the better? In total, both parents have access to a share of 49 weeks paid at 100 per cent of their income at time of birth, or 59 weeks at 80 per cent. Norwegians see paternity leave as a normal part of life. I asked a uni friend who is raising his family in Norway about his experience. Ben moved to Oslo in 2007 with his Norwegian girlfriend, now wife. They have three kids aged seven, five and five months. He loved having 10 weeks off, plus an extra month, to care for his kids and has nothing but praise for the system. ""All dads I speak with really enjoy their time,"" he says. Ben's wife, a landscape architect for the government, is in the middle of 10 months' leave to care for their baby. ""Her boss doesn't bat an eyelid,"" he says. But now that he owns his own business, Ben acknowledges that having employees take long periods off work can be a pain. ""But again, people accept and deal with it,"" he says. I ask about the housework split at their place. Ben says he does 70 per cent, his wife does 30 (she says it's 50/50). Both answers are a far cry from the heavily gendered status quo in Australia, and Ben agrees that gender roles are more even in Norway. ""Most women are back to work 12 months after having kids. Rarely do mums stay at home until kids are three or four,"" he says. To help parents go back to work, every child in Norway is guaranteed a childcare spot from 12 months, the cost of which is capped (Ben says they'll pay about $500 a month, food included). Here in Australia, many families find that mum's part-time wage doesn't cover childcare costs. It's not easy to acknowledge our limitations when it comes to juggling motherhood with a career, but we must if we're to keep our sanity, writes Michelle Stacpoole. These measures are so simple, yet so effective. It's no surprise that Norway ranks third on the WEF 2016 Gender Gap Report index (Iceland and Finland are first and second), and Australia languishes at 46th on the list. Yes, generous parental benefits and subsidised childcare are expensive, but they result in more women working and paying tax. And besides, Norway can afford it, thanks to the country's government-held sovereign wealth funds, made enormously rich from the profits from oil and gas production. If only we had something similar in Australia … If we recognised fathers in the same way as Norway, it would help level the gender playing field. Men would be empowered to take on more responsibilities at home. Workplace flexibility would stop being a women's issue if it applied equally to men. Employers would be more open to promoting part-time workers to senior positions. Women would feel more supported and dare I say it, less stressed. For me, four years and another daughter later, my partner and I are back to sharing duties — that is to say, we're both exhausted. I don't think he'd be too upset if I said the split is roughly 60-40, my way. We'll keep working towards 50/50.

443,Critics decry 'unsustainable' new Hunter Valley town as residents move in,house-and-home,"  Huntlee, town built from scratch in Hunter Valley, draws first residents and critics alike Midway between the coal fields and the coast, the new town of Huntlee is taking shape. ""A project of this scale is 30 years in the making,"" says Stephen Thompson, the development's project manager. ""Then you get the next 25 years to build it. ""We're looking at 25,000 people living here, on a railway line and on a high-speed freeway road link."" Mr Thompson says more than 500 home sites have now been sold. Katherine's Landing is the first stage of the development. Building the road into the town was a multi-million-dollar project. Once the town was laid out, the infrastructure for lighting, electricity, water and broadband cable was installed. ""There is an enormous amount of work that goes underground to produce a town like this,"" Mr Thompson said. ""It's a bit like an iceberg: 70 per cent of it's underground and 30 per cent of it is seen."" That cost is passed on to the town's new residents in the purchase price of their blocks of land. Angela and Jason Workman and their three sons are among the town's new residents. They baulk at the term ""pioneers"" but that's what they are. They are among the first to arrive and are living in a town that is being built around them. ""I think it's a great atmosphere for the kids — there's a lot of wide open spaces for them to play, a safe environment,"" Mr Workman said. ""[It] gives them the chance to explore and be kids."" But not all are so happy. For years, a group of nearby residents fought to prevent this development going ahead. James Ryan, a former Greens councillor on the Cessnock City Council, argued long and hard that this development should not proceed. ""As a community, as a society, overall it makes me very sad that we keep on with this urban sprawl,"" he said. ""It is an environmentally damaging development."" Huntlee's location was initially viewed by the New South Wales Government as the least favourable option for a new town. ""Situating it here, clearing endangered bush land and having an isolated location, which is really poorly serviced with public transport, it just sends the wrong message, it is unsustainable,"" Mr Ryan said. Local environmental campaigners fought the project, with the Land and Environment Court twice ruling against the developers. However, in 2011, a decision by the NSW Court of Appeal put plans for Huntlee back on track. ""So we had an opportunity to obtain all of the land under one ownership, which allows you to really plan where services are going,"" Mr Thompson said. The town is now firmly on the map. More than 100 homes have been built. And work is expected to begin soon on hundreds more. The neighbouring town of Branxton is half a kilometre from Huntlee, on the other side of the freeway. The main northern train line runs alongside the town. But questions are being asked about the creation of a car-dependent town when the possibilities for rail transport are so close at hand. ""Most of the new developments that are being planned in cities around Australia and around the world are designed around mass public transport systems — specifically rail systems,"" said Martin Fallding, a spokesman for Two More Trains, a lobby group calling for more passenger trains to be added to the line. Coal trains pour through neighbouring Branxton like clockwork but passenger trains are few. For the Workmans, the lack of public transport is not something that worries them. ""We both work, so we both have to drive for our work,"" Ms Workman said. ""It may affect some people at some time, but at this point in time, it's not really an issue for us.""

444,Energy-saving hobbit house in WA's South West,house-and-home,"  Energy-saving hobbit house in WA's South West Nigel Kirkwood, who fondly calls himself a modern-day hobbit, is living in his dream home in WA's South West. This earth-sheltered house in Quindalup, around 20 kilometres from Busselton, is far from a typical home. There is almost 1,000 tonnes of dirt on top of the house, which helps it maintain a consistent temperature all year around. Mr Kirkwood said he saved up to $100 a cycle by not having heating and cooling. ""As we're sitting in here now it's about 17… it's the coldest I've seen it in here,"" he said. ""Normally milder winter days are about 18 to 19 degrees. Summer 23, worst case."" Mr Kirkwood's home is not dark and dingy, as one might expect from a half-buried home. It has large windows and wood on the walls and floor. In summer the roof is expected to be covered with flowers, which Mr Kirkwood hopes will bring all sorts of birds and insects to his home. The house is held together with almost 19 tonnes of high quality steel and covered in Polyurea water-proof coating, which makes it incredibly fire-proof. Mr Kirkwood spent 25 years in the WA mining industry and he said this was his inspiration for the home. ""I've seen these huge tunnel structures when in Karratha and moving around the Pilbara there were quite a few of them around and I thought 'Wow, what a cool structure',"" he said. Director of Solar Dwellings Griff Morris said there were a number of homes in the eastern states that were earth-sheltered like this one, but he said the steel frame made this house particularly unique. ""Using this material is very new, not the building form but using these corrugated structures,"" he said. Mr Morris said it was not the kind of house for everyone but said it was ideal for some people in regional areas, particularly where bushfires were common. ""If you're out in a very hot, dry area, when you are protected underground you don't have major moisture problems or seismic problems,"" he said. ""You have to be careful about moisture, you have to seal the buildings and also you have to make sure you get good ventilation."" He said this style of home was likely to become more popular as people started to understand the technology behind it. Mr Kirkwood is opening his house to the public on Sustainable House Day in September and hopes to inspire others to think differently about building.

445,The realities of renting for people in Hobart,house-and-home,"  Hobart rental market: Three case studies of why people call their place home While people debate the pros and cons of negative gearing and the price of avocados, for many Tasmanians renting is the better, or only, option for having a home. Some rent to prevent being tied to a mortgage, while many chose to rent in an area they want to live over buying in an area they can afford. Matthew Stolp has owned properties in the past but currently rents a single-room apartment in the city which he shares with his two teenage children. ""I never thought it would work, and when I said I was moving into a one-room apartment with two kids, [people] said, 'No way, we'll give you three months', but we've been here three years,"" he said. ""I think it works because we're in the city, so it's an easy place to get out and go about and go to cafes or whatever and not feel stuck to the house."" A Hobart-based realtor says 60 to 70 per cent of buyers in the local market are interstate investors. Mr Stolp said he had recently looked at the rental market but was reluctant to pay more than $300 a week and found a lack of affordable central options. His children spend half their time at their mother's place in Risdon Vale on the eastern shore, commuting to their schools in Hobart. Despite the slightly cramped conditions, Bridie, 17, and Miller, 15, said they liked the ease of living close to the city centre and the services it provided. Mr Stolp said he was concerned about the trend of rising rents and interstate buyers purchasing investment properties in Hobart's relatively cheap market. ""To me it's sort of a way of capitalising on other people's basic needs for housing,"" he said. ""I grew up here, I was born here, and this is where my home is and where I intend to live out the rest of my life, and there are people who don't even live down here who are making it harder for me to find places to live."" Lara van Raay rents a fairly large house 15 minutes' drive from central Hobart with her partner and two young children. ""I work from home, so it's really important that we have at least three bedrooms so I can have a study and ... we've got enough space for the children to be kids, have a place to play,"" she said. ""Everything closer to town, even nicer properties around here, it's all above $500, closer to $600 [per week]. ""To find anything under $500 is really difficult for a three-bedroom property."" Ms van Raay took on her current lease about three months ago, taking over a break-of-lease property, which meant she was not able to inspect the property properly before signing. ""We had no idea how bad this property was because it was a break-of-lease and we weren't able to have a really good look around,"" she said. ""We didn't know what state the property would be in when the person left, so there's been heaps of problems. ""The last two people who lived in this property, there were literally holes in the wall and they lived here. ""They didn't complain, or if they did nothing happened about it. ""The last tenant told us that whenever she asked for anything to be done, [she was told] 'the landlord's not going to be investing anything into the property, it's an investment property'."" Ms van Raay said she had to threaten court action to get things fixed to bring the place to up standard and meet the Tenancy Act. ""We've been very squeaky and we've gone down the path of court and gone down the path of health inspectors and all that sort of stuff to make sure that this property is secure,"" she said. ""We've had to really fight to get it up to a basic decent standard."" Ms van Raay's property is owned by a company rather than an individual, which she said had made it harder to get action to fix problems. ""It's actually owned by a Pty Ltd company so you can't even know who owns it,"" she said. ""It means that they can have nothing to do with the property, let it go completely, and you won't even know who to go to because there's no name on that lease, it's just a Pty Ltd."" Emesha Rudolf rents a central one-bedroom apartment in Hobart on her own after living in shared accommodation for years. ""This is the first time living as a single and it is amazingly good,"" she said. ""I do a few gigs around Hobart, a bit of stand up and a bit of theatre, so it makes it so much easier; I can walk everywhere. ""I think probably living alone is going to be hard no matter where you are."" Ms Rudolf said the decision to live on her own was a tough one as she had to weigh up if it was going to be affordable. ""I pay $220 a week, which by mainland standards is just amazing. Every time I tell someone from Sydney or Melbourne, they just lose their minds at how cheap that is,"" she said. Good urban planning and design could have a positive social effect on the broader community, as one ""village"" shows. She is hoping to move interstate and said she had been looking on social media to find share housing options. ""With things like social media, you can find better deals with more of a personal feel,"" she said. While she is happy in her small flat, Ms Rudolf said the standard of housing in Tasmania — with poor insulation a common issue — could make life difficult. ""I get really bummed out because it is winter in Tassie at the moment and it is freezing, and the cost of heating is just exorbitant,"" she said. ""You go to Europe and everything's double-glazed and all the buildings make sense and are insulated and we just have the worst things here.""

446,NSW tenancy agreements potentially unenforceable against interstate landlords,house-and-home,"  NSW tenancy agreements potentially unenforceable against interstate landlords Thousands of renters in New South Wales could discover their tenancy agreements are unenforceable if their landlord lives interstate, following a ruling by the state's highest court. The legal loophole emerged after the Court of Appeal declared in February that the NSW Administrative and Civil Tribunal, which handles a range of small civil disputes, has no jurisdiction if one party lives in another state. The ramifications of the decision have cost Sydney couple Anna Jacobs and Sefton Darby thousands of dollars after they were forced out of their rented Paddington home in April because of toxic mould. The couple took their landlord to the tribunal's tenancy division to reclaim rent paid in advance as well as damaged property including a bed and clothing. But they discovered they were powerless to seek the thousands of dollars they were allegedly owed. ""The landlord's agent showed up and announced the landlord wanted the case dismissed because the tribunal isn't able to enforce any law against him because he lives in South Australia,"" Ms Jacobs said. Ms Jacobs said the tribunal members told the agent to try and negotiate a settlement regardless. ""The agent's response was that he had no authority to do so and his only instructions were to dismiss the case immediately,"" Ms Jacobs said. ""There is no question about whether it's open to being exploited by agents: we were exploited by an agent."" She said their only alternative avenue to seek compensation was to launch a claim in the local court for breach of contract. ""This increases costs, there's different standards of evidence and is incredibly difficult to do so without legal representation,"" she said. The decision, known as Burns v Corbett; Gaynor v Burns, also has ramifications for interstate landlords looking to settle disputes with NSW tenants. Real Estate Institute of NSW chief executive Tim McKibbin said both parties may now be exposed if they cannot resolve issues themselves. ""People can't disregard their contractual obligations but ... if parties are in dispute, if either party wants to bring the proceedings then that becomes very difficult when the judicial authority that has the exclusive jurisdiction to hear the matter is unable to do so,"" he said. ""[There are] 800,000 rental properties in NSW and there would be a significant number of these properties that would be outside those jurisdictions."" He said the institute had written to the NSW Government, suggesting the legislation be changed to reflect the situation in Queensland, where civil tribunals are classified as a court. ""So in Queensland they wouldn't be suffering this problem as far as I'm aware,"" he said. ""We've said to government that this should be, and believe [it] is, a priority for government to resolve. We're also aware the Government is fully cognisant of just how serious a problem it is."" NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman said only a small amount of cases heard in the tribunal were affected by the decision. ""In the last financial year, NCAT received almost 30,000 applications to resolve residential tenancy disputes. The number of matters potentially affected by the Court of Appeal's judgment in Burns v Corbett; Gaynor v Burns makes up 0.2 per cent of those applications,"" he said. ""In the interim, the NSW Government is examining a number of options to enable NCAT to continue delivering informal and affordable dispute resolution."" He said the High Court was expected to hear an appeal in the Burns matter later this year. Mr Darby said real estate agents should be required to tell renters if the landlord lives interstate. ""Until there is a change, they need to actively disclose if your landlord is out of state, I think tenants should be aware and it should be disclosed,"" Mr Darby said. ""I can't understand how you could have an entire set of tenants, an entire set of landlords and as we understand it, a whole load of other tribunals not just tenancy issues, where the most basic level of resolving disputes is not available to people. ""The whole point of these tribunals is that normal people can turn up, without lawyers, just on a small claim and get resolution quickly and that's now not available to people."" Ned Cutcher from the Tenants' Union said the ruling could have ramifications for landlords. ""Probably the biggest grey area that this has thrown up is whether or not landlords now have the ability to affect an eviction through due process using the Residential Tenancys Act,"" he said. ""There is a question as to whether or not a termination proceeding can be commenced in the local court whether or not the residential tenancy act allows that. ""That's a big concern I think, huge concern for landlords and I guess a concern for us that we might start seeing landlords take matters into their own hands.""

447,'I think we've hit the peak': Hobart housing market's 'perfect storm',house-and-home,"  Hobart property market's price surge stoked by mainland interest Investors from interstate seeking to capitalise on Hobart's ""perfect storm"" of high rental returns and affordability are the driving force behind the city's price growth surge, says leading realtor Nat Downton. Last week the Tasmanian capital leapt into the world's top-50 cities for property price growth, rising to 34th on the Knight Frank Global Residential Cities Index (GRCI) from 77 last year. Ms Downton, director of Hobart real estate agency Downton, told ABC Radio Hobart the price growth was driven by interstate buyers who saw Hobart property as a relative bargain with superior rental returns. ""Probably 60 to 70 per cent of my buyers at the moment are investors from interstate,"" she said. ""A lot of them are investors because the rental market down here is the driving force of our prices and I think investors are the driving force of prices heading up."" Ms Downton, who was in March named Australia's best residential real estate agent, said in the past investors were mostly inclined to capitalise on the high demand for short-term rentals using sites like Airbnb and Stayz. But that had changed, with a drift towards buyers making their properties available to longer-term tenants because high rents delivered very favourable returns. Ms Downton said the rental yields in Hobart were about 6 to 7 per cent compared with 4 to 5 per cent interstate. ""Because of the shortage of opportunity for people to rent ... the rental prices in Hobart are now through the roof,"" she said. In the increasingly competitive rental market, Ms Downton said some would-be tenants were proposing to bid for properties, which is illegal in Tasmania. The Knight Frank GRCI tracked the performance of house prices across 150 cities globally up to March 2017. It showed Hobart had seen an 11.3 per cent increase in price growth, compared with 4.2 per cent the same time last year. This put Hobart only 11 places behind Sydney and 10 places behind Melbourne in the ranking. President of the Real Estate Institute of Tasmania, Tony Collidge, described the Hobart real estate market as the ""perfect storm"". ""We've got a genuine shortage of residential property for sale, we've got a genuine shortage of residential property to rent,"" he said. ""This is putting pressure on the market."" Mr Collidge said positive economic improvements and liveability have played key roles in drawing potential property owner's from across the country. Last year Mr Collidge said 800 people from the mainland bought property in Hobart and relocated there. ""If you look at all the capital cities in Australia, Hobart is still the cheapest place to come, and that's one of the attractions,"" he said. ""It really surprised me that when I was looking at the growth of median house price in Hobart over the last 17 years they were actually second to Sydney."" But Ms Downton believes the Hobart market has reached its peak. ""I think we've hit the peak. I don't have a crystal ball but I think we're right at the top of it,"" she said. Ms Dowton said while her loyalty was with the owner it was sad to see property being pushed out of the reach of local would-be buyers. ""It is really heartbreaking to see a family walk in with their two children and they're like, 'Mum, I want that bedroom', and you really see them living in that property, and then all of a sudden an interstate investor will come in and trump them by 20 or 30 grand,"" she said. The fact that some agents were underquoting in order to attract local interest was peddling false hope. ""They have building inspections done and things like that and then miss out by up to $80,000 or $90,000 dollars,"" she said. ""It makes that story of the [local] buyer even worse.""

448,Picture this: Your camera could be the key to reducing clutter,house-and-home,"  Clear clutter in a snap and let go of treasured items with the help of your camera, experts say The dress you wore to your high school formal. Your child's first pair of shoes. That threadbare t-shirt you wore when you won a sporting final. Our stuff isn't just stuff, it's our memories. So when it comes to decluttering, it can be very hard to get rid of things that hold sentimental value but we no longer use or look at. Rebecca Reczek is a consumer psychologist and an associate professor of marketing at Ohio State University. She studied ways to help us get rid of things with sentimental value after she and her colleagues found it was a problem for them too. ""One of my co-authors said she had a pair of basketball shorts that she hadn't worn in over a decade but she couldn't bring herself to get rid of them,"" Dr Reczek told ABC Radio Perth. ""She was trying to think about why, and she realised that it wasn't the shorts themselves. ""She realised that it's the memory that is tied to this possession and the identity of herself as an athlete that she didn't want to let go of."" Dr Reczek and her colleagues began to investigate whether people could hang on to these memories but get rid of the clutter by taking a photograph of the item before disposing of it. They did a set of experiments involving students at Ohio State University and donors to a local charity shop. You are left with a house full of a lifetime's clutter when a parent dies. What do you do? On the university campus they held a donation drive at the end of the semester when students were moving out of their dormitories. ""In one set of dorms we did a traditional donation appeal,"" Dr Reczek said. ""We said, 'Don't pack up your clutter and take it home, donate it'. ""In the other experimental condition, we did a different promotion and encouraged people to take a photo first. ""We said, 'Don't just pack up your sentimental clutter, take a photo first, then donate it'. ""We found that significantly more items were donated in the dorms where we encouraged people to take a photo."" At a charity shop, they stationed a researcher to speak to people dropping off goods. Some of the donors were offered a photograph of the thing they were giving away. ""Then we asked everyone: 'To what extent do you feel like you lost a piece of yourself by donating this item?',"" Dr Reczek said. ""The people who got a photo of their item when they donated it felt significantly less identity loss."" She said taking a photo of sentimental items could help people begin to tackle their clutter issues at home. ""We all have possessions in our home that have sentimental value, that are tied to these special emotionally significant memories,"" she said. ""These can often be the barrier to people even starting the cleaning out process, because they don't want to think about getting rid of things that might feel like pieces of themselves. ""So sometimes getting rid of those things that have more emotional value can actually be the starting point to do a more thorough cleaning process. What help is available if you're concerned about a friend or relative who's hoarding? ""We recommend taking a photo first, and when you do that it reduces the sense of loss that you would otherwise feel when taking that possession in to donate it."" It was a technique Dr Reczek said she planned to use over the course of her own life. ""I am a parent of a toddler and I'm already dreading when I will have to get rid of some of the toys and clothes that she has stopped playing with. ""I am planning to use this when it's time to deal with the baby things, where I have a lot of emotionally significant memories but I just don't need to keep them around my house.""

449,"When life gives you lemons, clean your horse",house-and-home,"  How to use, and preserve, lemons in times of plenty It's a cruel irony that most lemon trees bear their fruit in the middle of winter, leaving the green thumbs among us stuck with a surplus. Home cleaning guru Simon Bailey told ABC Radio Perth's Afternoons there were ""a million things you can do with lemons"" around the house, aside from just making lemon butter or giving away your excess. ""Lemon is wonderful to refresh your fridge,"" Mr Bailey said. ""A spritz of lemon juice in a freshly cleaned fridge makes it come alive and makes it smell deliciously lemony."" Lemons can also be used to clean the microwave. ""Cut a lemon in half, put it in the microwave, put it on high for one minute,"" Mr Bailey said. ""The acidic steam from the lemon softens all the crusty bits on the inside and it's easy to wipe clean. ""It's the quickest and easiest way to clean your microwave."" A mixture of lemon juice and vinegar makes an ideal cleaning fluid for mirrors, tiles and stove tops, while boiling up lemon juice in the kettle can be a quick way to clean it. ""Lemon is great deodoriser,"" Mr Bailey said. ""With plastic cutting boards, rub lemon on them and leave them in the sunshine, it just freshens them up. ""Pop a few tablespoons of lemon juice in a bucket of water, soak your clothes before you put them in the wash and that will get some of the stains out."" ABC Radio Perth listeners have a few uses of their own. ""If you have a palomino and she's been rolling in the dirt (like mine does), a spritz of lemon juice in her mane and tail before you give her a bath will keep her looking like someone loves her,"" Ally suggested via SMS. ""Use a peeler to peel off the rind, let it dry and put it in your drawers and that keeps away moths and other insects from nibbling on your clothes,"" Mr Bailey said. ""If you are trying to cut down on salt, a squeeze of lemon is a nice substitute for seasoning your food,"" he added. Other listeners said they had added lemon rind to bolognaise sauce, fried rice, breadcrumbs and salad dressings. Dumpy said he used lemons to get the smell off his hands after going fishing. ""Lemon is also good for getting the petrol smell off your hands,"" Marty shared via SMS. Talkback caller Kirna said she used lemons in place of hand cream. ""You cut a lemon in half and leave it on the sink and every time you have to clean your hands in the kitchen, instead of putting hand cream on you put lemon juice on instead,"" she said. ""At this time of year there are lemons and limes aplenty and they are cheap, if not free, but come summer time you are going to be paying $12 to $18 a kilo for limes,"" Mr Bailey said. Either juice the lemons and limes and freeze the juice or slice the fruit up and freeze it in plastic wrap, he suggested. ""In summer you can put the frozen slices straight into your drink.""

450,Queensland's worst and best performing resale suburbs,house-and-home,"  Property price report reveals Queensland's worst and best performing resale suburbs About 9.2 per cent of Brisbane homes were sold by their owners at a loss in the first three months of the year, the worst result in almost two years, a new report reveals. The capital was middle-of-the-rung compared to other states — Sydney and Melbourne were again the best performers. CoreLogic has released its Pain and Gain report for the March quarter, which compares the most recent sale price to the previous one. Across the country, 9.6 per cent of dwellings sold for less, a worse result compared to the 8.8 per cent in the previous quarter. It is still a case of safe as houses when it comes to investment in Brisbane. Loss making sales were driven by the unit market, whereas houses were actually trending slightly lower. Almost a quarter of units, with thousands being built in the south-east in recent years, went for less than was originally paid. The units were more than six times more likely to go for a loss compared to houses, which saw only 3.8 per cent lose money. For all Brisbane dwellings, 9.2 per cent were sold at a loss, which was slightly higher than the previous quarter. The Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast markets did well, recording 9.9 per cent and 8 per cent of sale losses. Regions west of Brisbane did not fare well, with the Lockyer Valley and Somerset performing poorly in Queensland's south-east. Over the quarter, houses across Australia which resold at a loss had typically been owned for 6.3 years, while units resold at a loss has been owned for 6.9 years. Of those that sold for a profit, they were owned for 9.1 years compared to 7.6 years for units. Owner-occupiers did better in general than investors, who were 2.5 per cent more likely to resell at a loss in Brisbane. That is still below the 9.3 per cent average for all the capitals combined. In regional Queensland, 16.6 per cent of houses were sold at a loss, compared to 21.2 per cent for units. ""Areas linked to mining and resources sectors continue to be some of the weakest housing markets across the country,"" the report said. A massive 53 per cent of units and houses in Mackay were sold at a loss in the March quarter, the highest level of loss making in Australia. Townsville came in at 44.7 per cent. There were signs that in some of the weakest markets that conditions were improving from poor resale rates. Mackay had peaked at 61.8 per cent in previous quarters and Townsville 47.3 per cent. ""Although there has been a moderate improvement in a number of these regions, it is anticipated that the instances of resales at a loss will remain elevated,"" the report said.

451,Council demands infrastructure plans for new town at Wilton,house-and-home,"  Fears about housing development south of Sydney due to lack of infrastructure A rural council is threatening to withdraw support for a major new housing development at Wilton, south of Sydney, if it does not get infrastructure plans. Critics say new suburbs constantly appear in the race to meet Sydney's housing demand, often lacking the infrastructure needed. The Wollondilly Shire Council and local residents are concerned plans to build the new town from scratch could be disastrous for the already underserviced area. The Shire is the same size as the Sydney metropolitan area but has no hospital, poor transport and most residents have to travel outside of the region for work. Resident Anne Herne is a full time carer for her two children who have special needs. They have to travel from the Wollondilly Shire to Sydney to access basic services. ""The children just can't cope [and] by the end of the day they are absolutely shattered,"" Ms Herne said. ""We have to leave here 6.30 in the morning and we don't get back 'til 7 o'clock at night. ""We need the health services, road maintenance, new roads, police stations — vital services that our community does not have."" The local council fears the development will become another Lego-land, putting more pressure on western Sydney and adding to commuter gridlock. ""We want our people to be able to have jobs and schools and social inclusion so they don't have to travel hours and hours on the road each day,"" Wollondilly Shire Mayor, Judith Hannan said. The council recently handed a report outlining its concerns to New South Wales Premier, Gladys Berejiklian. ""That includes electrification of the rail, medical facilities, schools, jobs, road upgrades — we want a detailed plan ensuring will be delivered in a timely manner,"" Ms Hannan said. ""Future residents don't need to live with the consequences of bad planning now. It needs to be done now. ""We need a great town or no town at all."" This year's state budget features a $1 billion allocation for Western Sydney roads but that does not extend to Wilton. However the region is getting a new high school at Wilton Junction and the existing school at Picton is to be upgraded. Member for Wollondilly Jai Rowell is confident infrastructure will be forthcoming. ""I share a similar vision with the council, in that we get the much needed infrastructure and services delivered whilst maintaining the uniqueness of this area,"" Mr Rowell said. ""That's why we haven't rushed it. This is a major game-changer for this area [and] that's all part of the planning."" A report on land use and infrastructure by the Planning Department will go on public exhibition shortly. For Anne Herne's family, having access to basic services would be life changing. ""It would be outstanding, it would take our stress levels down, our days wouldn't be anywhere as long, it wouldn't be as expensive — so yeah, there would be a lot of pluses,"" she said. Land releases are set to roll out from 2018. In a statement the Department of Planning and Environment sait it was working to ensure Wilton could be ""a great new town, with opportunities for jobs and a vibrant culture"".

452,Renovating your rental for winter warmth,house-and-home,"  Tips to renovate your rental to keep warm this winter It's chilly, the nights are long, and there's still plenty of cold weather left before spring — so how do you keep your rental warm? While homeowners have the option of renovating to make their homes more comfortable and energy efficient, it's harder for Australia's growing number of long-term renters. ""But there's still a fair bit they can do, particularly if you think about a renter being in a place for a long time,"" said Damien Moyse from the Alternative Technology Association. Older rental homes can be draughty because of gaps around ceilings and doors. Mr Moyse said renters could stop draughts by covering these gaps with removable sealing strips, which can be purchased from most hardware stores. ""They're sticky on one side, you whack them on,"" he said. An even more rental-friendly solution is the door snake, although Mr Moyse warned renters to choose a snake that was up to the task. ""[Make sure] when you look at it you are totally sealing up that gap and ensure it's made of a significant substance that will prevent heat transfer,"" he said. Installing quality curtains can stop heat escaping from a room. ""Curtains are best used with pelmets so you're covering the top part of the curtains,"" Mr Moyse said, adding that it doesn't necessarily mean attaching anything to the wall. ""There are temporary structures you can place above the top of the curtains which block off that air movement from the window into the room and circulating out again."" Polished floorboards can be a popular choice for renters — no worrying about staining the carpet — but older floorboards can leave you exposed to the cold outside. ""You can have gaps straight through the floor, you can see the ground,"" Mr Moyse said. If you have safe access to underneath the house, under-floor insulation can be an option especially if you're ""a bit handy"". ""You can install it yourself, it's just a foam or similar type material that you squeeze together and place in between the joists,"" Mr Moyse said. Saving electricity can also help free up your energy budget, leaving more money to spend on staying warm. ""Lighting is a classic; it's about 10 per cent of your electrical load,"" Mr Moyse said. Tenants can make long-term savings by swapping incandescent and halogen bulbs with more energy-efficient alternatives such as compact fluorescent bulbs and LED lights. When it comes time to buy new whitegoods, spending a little more for an efficient model will save you money in the long term. Also, check the plate on appliances which came with the house, such as heaters and hot water systems, to see when they were installed. Mr Moyse said most hot water and heating systems had a lifespan of 10 to 15 years. ""If you think it's coming up for replacement, talk to your landlord about co-investing a small amount to subsidise the purchase of a more efficient, higher star rating appliance.""

453,Washing a Tassie tuxedo takes balls,house-and-home,"  Washing a puffer jacket yourself takes balls – tennis balls As winter dawns, the city streets of the southern states become a walking parade of people wrapped in fabric trying to stay warm and dry. In Tasmania, the humble puffer jacket — a sort of mini sleeping bag you wear — is one of the most popular options for keeping out the cold. Dubbed by some as the Tassie tuxedo, puffer jackets come in many shapes, sizes and colours; cheaper ones are usually filled with synthetic layers and the more pricey ones filled with down feathers. A synthetic-filled jacket can be washed pretty easily without worrying about destroying the fill, but those down feathers are a bit more fussy about their treatment. Many people take their puffer jackets to dry cleaners rather than risk their expensive garment losing its fluff. A quick search online finds list after list of advice on how to wash a down-filled jacket, and one method in particular keeps popping up involving tennis balls. At the risk of personal loss and plenty of embarrassment, ABC Radio Hobart producer Tahlea Aualiitia took on the challenge to clean her jacket at a local laundromat with the help of some discount store tennis balls. The method followed was simple: Put the washing machine on a gentle cycle and wash the jacket with ordinary washing powder. Once washed, the important part was to dry the jacket in a way that will puff up the feather again. This was where the tennis balls came in. By adding tennis balls to the low-setting tumble dryer, the balls knock about the filling, bringing back the puff to the puffer. And yes, it worked a treat.

454,Apartment life redefining the 'village' it takes to raise a child,house-and-home,"  Future cities: How one Australian 'village' raises a child As an Army brat, Michelle MacFarlane went outside to play and usually only came home when it got dark, also known as when dinner was ready. Ms MacFarlane grew up surrounded by military personnel and their families, on safe streets that were constantly filled with a platoon of kids riding bikes, kicking balls and otherwise spending every waking moment outdoors. It's a familiar lament from her generation: that the sense of freedom they enjoyed as children no longer seems to exist. Ms MacFarlane — now a mum of two boys — lives in Bulimba, a quiet riverside pocket of inner Brisbane where apartment blocks and townhouses have sprung up between rows of boxy McMansions and renovated Queenslanders. It's an urban setting arguably more suited to SINKS and DINKS, many of them renters. A multitude of foreign accents, courtesy of the state's resource industry boom, which has brought with it many highly paid foreign executives and their FIFO families, lends an international flavour. The local state school is bursting at the seams, preferred over nearby private schools as it achieves better results and the socio-economic mix is the same. Yet here, walking distance from the busy bars and restaurants of Bulimba's aptly posh-sounding Oxford Street, thrives an unassuming community of likeminded parents and knockabout kids, a group as diverse as it is cohesive and transient as it is enduring. Their lowset townhouse and unit complex features communal pathways and gardens, as well as a big pool and small fitness centre. There's nothing to suggest child's play is either welcomed or prohibited, but rarely does a day pass without some conspiratorial gathering of little people on the pathways out back. If things get rowdy, there are several playgrounds within walking distance, and usually a parent free to take them. The complex qualifies as a ""gated community"", though it is largely devoid of the pretence that implies. As cities densify and the choice is between going up or going out, this complex and others like it offer an adult inner-city lifestyle with all the nearby parks, schools and sporting clubs a child could need. Australia's population is set to double in the next 50 years, with most of the population growth expected in our cities. In her recent TED talk, American architect Jeanne Gang referred to herself as a ""relationship builder"", and said good urban planning and design could have a positive social effect on the broader community and reduce stress and polarisation in urban environments. ""Cities are about people; they are places where people come together for all kinds of exchange,"" she said. Building relationships should continue to be a key driver of design, she said, and aim to break down barriers between groups, blend nature and city, and provide spaces for cultural exchange. Ms MacFarlane bought her two-storey, three-bedroom townhouse here 10 years ago, when married but childless, and said she didn't move to the neighbourhood with firm aspirations to raise kids there. However, she said, she began to form closer connections with other families in the complex after she had children, and later as she went through a divorce. ""Once you have kids, we're all in the same situation. You have your [wider] family, and you live with a family, but you are somewhat isolated,"" she said. ""It's great to have others that are that close and in a secure area, that you can meet and have something in common with straight away, then also you know that the children can meet, and play, and have something in common. ""I think that's probably the driving force — the kids meeting and having something in common, playing — that's a beautiful thing."" She said her upbringing helped open her mind to separate yet communal living. ""My dad was in the Army, so we always lived in what was called Army barracks back then. They were individual houses, just suburbs of Army people. And because of the age group we always had a multitude of kids to play with, and to be around. ""It was safe, you'd know the neighbours if you got into trouble, fell off your bike … so that's how I grew up. It was beautiful, and although I haven't looked for it that's something that's appeared here, probably because I could recognize it and am open to it."" Her eldest son, who has autism, thrives in the close living environment, whereas he can struggle to cope in other social settings. (Ralph, the family's Australian terrier, provides him with constant companionship, and has become something of a celebrity in the neighbourhood, the residents joke, with most passersby stopping to ask how his day has been). ""My son gets to interact with other kids — [the girl] next door, she's only two and he's lovely with her. He wouldn't have that interaction with that age if not here. And he can be so nice with her,"" Ms MacFarlane said. ""It takes a village — over the years we've had many neighbours, but there's been critical times. During [my] separation and divorce, I had to say to those neighbours, 'you've really helped, been part of our village'."" She stressed that the regular contact with neighbours did not always constitute personal close relationships, and while there was an open invitation but no pressure for new tenants to socialise it was rare for them not to, and she encouraged it by inviting them to semi-regular sausage sizzle or any kids' birthday celebrations. Ms MacFarlane's immediate neighbours describe her as the cohesive element in their loose-knit domestic social scene. Anna Lidstone said the parental focus in her household included independence and conflict resolution, both of which her two girls are able to practise within the safe confines of the complex. ""I'm a strong believer that to keep your kids safe you have to give them freedom. The less freedom they get, the less safe they are as they grow up,"" she said. ""What this gives them is an independence that is a safe risk. They can feel like they're independent. ""The things parents get worried about are traffic and stranger danger, and here you can avoid the traffic problem, and there's a certain level of predictability about the people here."" Ms Lidstone said the transient nature of a housing complex threw up challenges, but also taught valuable lessons. ""There's a certain acceptance that it's a bit of a revolving door. The kids work out pretty quickly that they'll meet kids, they'll play, and sometimes they'll leave,"" she said. ""My kids have learnt that friends come and go. They used to get really upset about it, but now they know there'll be others and they're OK with it. There are other relationships that they hold onto as permanent and stable. ""It's understanding that other human beings can become friends for short periods of time without necessarily being deep friends, and that's great."" As in any domestic setting, problems arise, but Ms Lidstone said even those could be used as a teaching tool, while the adult residents had learnt to coexist without living in each other's pockets. ""The kids fight a lot. There's a lot of conflict, although that's part of the reason why it's good for them,"" she said. ""And some of the parents have very little contact with each other, so it's not like this profound, deep community commitment. It's actually quite ephemeral. ""So while it fulfils a deep need, it's not this deep-seated commitment, a long-term chosen community that you've decided to share your life with. It's still random."" Anmar Aydami is a GP who grew up in Baghdad, Iraq before migrating to New Zealand then Australia. He and Welsh-born wife Rachel, a lawyer, and their two children had recently moved to the area, drawn by the cafe culture and family-friendly surrounds. ""It's the like-minded people, families … the street culture here. I'm sure there are other microcosms like this, but it's something you stumble upon, after you move in you discover it, rather than a place being famous for it,"" said Mr Aydami. ""If people are not at this stage of their life, or they're past it, they're not going to see the beauty of it. ""We don't have any family in Australia, so where normally you would go over to a cousin's house or a parent's, grandparent's, auntie's place, that's not really an option for us. We're pretty excited when [one or other daughter] goes with her friends, watching cartoons, or just sitting and eating watermelon. Mr Aydami said the diversity among his neighbours had been an unplanned bonus. ""There is diversity … because we all come from different backgrounds … but we find the common ground is actually the values,"" he said. ""I'm from Iraq, grew up in New Zealand, then there's Canadians around, Australians, and we all have different opinions about things, but we find comfort in some of the common values that we have, that we resonate with. ""In Baghdad, we had that kind of culture, where you knew everybody on the street. There was a high level of trust, almost territorial — if you were in trouble, people on your street identified with you. I think it was brilliant, playing soccer. There was something to belong to."" Mrs Aydami said while ""overall, it's a positive"", the distraction of having kids around can interfere with family life. ""I think it's good for them, they develop those relationships,"" she said. ""When it's difficult is when it's time to come home, and Olivia (aged 4) won't because the other kids are still out playing, or they're out playing at a time I don't want her to play. It can end up being stressful. It's quite hard to cut off from it sometimes."" Nicole Toaldo said selling up and moving her family out of the complex several months ago, to avoid the ""ridiculous"" body corporate fees, only served to highlight what the family had lost, particularly when given frequent reminders by her children. ""The kids miss not being here. Here, I could be in the kitchen cooking dinner and they could still be out here with their mates, whereas now they're on their iPads or watching TV. We haven't met very many kids [at their new apartment complex several block away], and it's not like this, with the gates and communal area. ""This was easy — you knew where [the kids] were, and definitely social … the barbecues, and you just walk home, no getting in a car. ""My eldest, who is old enough to be a bit mouthy and express his opinions (8), says 'why did we move, I hate this new place'. They don't get what parents have to do."" Ms Toaldo said she and husband agreed it harkened back to their own childhoods, spent roaming the streets during Brisbane's age of innocence, before iPads and any semblance of big city life. ""I grew up in Brisbane. I'd get on the bike, my brothers and I, and go down to the park, and my parents would be fine with it. And it's just not like that at the moment — there's no way,"" she said. ""My husband, Anthony, and his mates would get on their bikes all day, go suburbs away to the creek and the park. We often talk about that, and how unheard of it is now."" Ms Toaldo said while the residents maintained separate lives and did not impose on each other for childcare, the arrangement harked back to a more co-dependent era in the suburbs of Brisbane.

455,How to reduce water waste around the family home,house-and-home,"  War on waste: Top tips for reducing water waste around the family home Vital to all life on Earth, water is widely regarded as our greatest natural resource yet many of us are unaware of how wasteful we are with it. And people living in the Northern Territory are among the worst culprits. ""In Darwin and Alice Springs water use is two-and-a-half times the national average per capita,"" Jethro Laidlaw told ABC Radio Darwin's Lyrella Cochrane. Mr Laidlaw is a program manager for Living Water Smart, a Power and Water Corporation initiative designed to reduce water wastage across the NT. He said the bulk of the average Territorian's water use could be attributed to garden irrigation, but it need not be so. ""If you water your garden every day, try and water every second day for 20 per cent longer,"" he said. ""By reducing the frequency of watering you can encourage your plants to grow deeper roots that reach down into the cooler ground below."" Leaky water pipes, faulty fittings and a defective dunny can also be major contributors to water wastage. Mr Laidlaw said most people were unaware of hidden water leaks in their homes and often put rising water bills down to external causes. ""Even a leak you can't see yet, just a trickle down the back of the toilet can be 50,000 or 100,000 litres a year,"" he said. ""We recommend people go to their water meter and do a three-step leak check."" Another of the biggest users of water in the family home can be washing dishes by hand. ""Your sink, if you fill it to the top, is about 30 litres, halfway might be 15 or 20 litres, and very often you'll do a bit of rinsing beforehand and you might use two or three sink loads,"" Mr Laidlaw said. ""Some modern dishwashers use as little as seven litres per load, so as far as water goes the dishwasher is actually cheaper."" Mr Laidlaw is often asked if washing clothes in cold water has any merit when it comes to saving on water or electricity. ""It really depends on what kind of water heater you have, but an electric water heater costs somewhere between 1.5 and two cents per litre to actually heat the water,"" he said. ""So if you're using 50 or 60 litres on a load of washing, or if you've got a top loader that might be 100 litres, that can be $1 or $2 just for the water heating."" He said the choice to use hot or cold water to wash clothes ultimately came down to what was dirtying your clothes. ""If you're a mechanic you probably need hot water, but if you work in an office then cold will probably get you out of trouble. ""If you try and wash your dishes with cold water you're not going to have much luck cleaning the Sunday roast pan — you need a bit of hot to loosen those oils, and it's the same principle with your clothes.""

456,Community effort builds hempcrete 'Miracle' house,house-and-home,"  Modern barn-raising: friends and strangers help build 'Miracle' hemp house for country family in need Bucket by bucket, a hempcrete house is being constructed by volunteer labour in a small New South Wales town to provide an accessible and clean-air environment for triplets with muscular dystrophy. Putting the hempcrete on the walls is a labour-intensive process and therefore could be very expensive, but the Read family of Canowindra in central-west New South Wales has been overwhelmed by help from friends, community members and complete strangers. ""It's pretty humbling and pretty exciting at the same time,"" said Jemimah Read, mother of the triplets and with her husband Ben, owner of the project dubbed the 'Miracle' house. Ten-year-old triplets, Anwen, Mahalah and Gideon Read all have meroisin deficient muscular dystrophy and have been in wheelchairs since they were two years old. But the family's current house in Canowindra is not big enough or has the modifications to accommodate three increasingly large powered wheelchairs or give the triplets independence. The Reads decided they needed to build a fully accessible home on a block just outside town. With both parents as carers for their children, money has been an obstacle so the Reads have had to take a leap of faith and rely on community help to make the 'Miracle' house a reality. Now that the house is at the stage of putting the hempcrete on 120 metres of walls there was a need for a large number of labourers, so the call went out for volunteers. The chairman of the Raising a Roof for the Reads support group, Mark Ward, said a week into the project and at least six volunteers, mostly from Canowindra but also further afield in NSW have come each day. ""Once you ask them to come and help and tell them what you're doing; I don't think I've had a knockback,"" Mr Ward said. ""It's a great feeling on the building site, everyone's enjoying it, laugh a minute and very busy."" Ms Read said she hoped the enthusiasm on the building could be maintained because putting hempcrete on the 120 metres of walls was a ""marathon"" race that would take four to six weeks to complete. However she was buoyed by the response so far. ""I just met two strangers this morning who came from Millthorpe [a town about an hour from Canowindra]. They just turned up. It's just incredible,"" Ms Read said. The work is not difficult but it is time consuming but many hands are needed to mix the hemp material with a binder of lime, sand and water. It is then ferried from the mixing machine, person to person in colourful, flexible buckets to the walls where it is poured into the formwork and tamped down to create walls 300mm thick. The Reads chose hempcrete because the triplets have reduced lung capacity and so need a clean and stable air environment. ""The hempcrete is breathable so the moisture can actually go out through the walls and still keep things really nice and warm in winter and cool in summer,"" Ms Read said. The house is being built by a local building company that for the past two to three years has specialised in hempcrete. Builder, James Isaacs from Belubula Hemp Homes at Canowindra said there were usually a few raised eyebrows when people learnt a house was being constructed of hemp. ""It's always the first thing that comes, 'Do you smoke it? What happens if the house burns down, will the fire brigade be stoned?,"" Mr Isaacs said. However he said once people learn of the benefits of the building product, both for homeowners and hemp farmers, most people were positive and it was becoming more popular. Mr Isaacs said while its use was relatively new in Australia, it had a rock-solid history elsewhere and hemp buildings have been built over the past two or three centuries in Europe. ""Where buildings have been turned to a petrified state just like wood does in the bush and they're virtually a solid stone house, two or three hundred years after construction,"" he said. The Read family hoped to move into their new fully accessible house by Christmas or at the very latest, next winter.

457,These millennials are building a house out of straw,house-and-home,"  Straw bale home: Couple dodges housing and energy crisis with age-old building technique Sam Ryan and Dani Austin are tackling rising housing and energy prices by building their own home made of straw. The couple are in their late 20s, first home buyer/builders and have been living with Mr Ryan's mother for the past four years. ""It took us a while to figure out where we wanted to live and the kind of house we wanted to build,"" Mr Ryan said. The couple purchased a block of land south of Adelaide and are currently building their two-bedroom home. The decision to build with straw bale was taken due to its low-cost construction, high insulation properties and environmental benefits. ""It means if you are going to have a passive house — no heating or cooling — then straw bale is one of the best materials you can chose,"" Mr Ryan said. ""You end up with these lovely thick walls,"" Ms Austin said. ""They are 450 [millimetres] wide and very huggable."" The walls are covered with an earth/lime render and the two have also experimented with two cob (a mixture of earth and straw) internal walls. With an ongoing interest in straw bale home construction, Mr Ryan and Ms Austin said a community of helpers soon formed to learn and help. ""If anyone tells me they are going to build in straw bale, I've got to go, I've got to help them,"" Mr Ryan said. ""I have to give back because I am just so grateful to the people who have helped us build this."" The couple plans to store 30,000 litres of rainwater on their property and fit a large solar panel array. Their budget is $350,000 for the home and land and hope to be moved in within a few weeks.

458,Airbnb a step closer to getting statewide green light after NSW Government decision,house-and-home,"  Airbnb: NSW Government gives qualified support to lifting bans on short-term rentals Airbnb is one step closer to getting the green light throughout NSW, but more time and consultation is needed to properly regulate short-term letting, the State Government says. Overnight the NSW Government handed down their response to the Inquiry into the Adequacy of Regulation for Short-Term Holiday Letting, largely supporting the recommendations. But they will release an options paper next month to further consult with the public and industry on how services like Airbnb should be regulated. Airbnb has more than 40,000 listings throughout NSW, but regulation varies from council to council, with bans existing in some. Planning and Housing Minister Anthony Roberts said the extra time would be worthwhile as the public would get to have their say. ""This is an opportunity for people that live in strata, for people that rent out their rooms to actually participate in policy,"" he said. ""I make no apologies for listening to the people of New South Wales in the development of policy."" The NSW Government gave qualified support to short-term rental accommodation as well as eight of the 12 other recommendations handed down by the inquiry, with the three other recommendations given full support. Sydney accounts for more than 25 per cent of the nation's Airbnb listings, but not everyone is celebrating the website's success Down Under. Airbnb's country manager for Australia and New Zealand Sam McDonagh welcomed the response, and said further regulation would ensure certainty for the company's customers across the state. ""More than 83 per cent of the homes that are shared on Airbnb are the homes that people live in, we know that 76 per cent of all Airbnb listings are outside hotel districts,"" he said. ""We'll continue to provide information to regulators and stakeholders so that we can come up with an informed decision and regulations."" Mr McDonagh said Airbnb would support any moves by the Government to crack down on bad behaviour. Tourism Accommodation Australia chief executive Carol Giuseppi said she was pleased the Government was giving the issue further consideration. ""They recognised that because of its complexity they need to weigh the benefits against the far-reaching and potentially negative consequences,"" she said. ""We definitely feel that while there was extensive reference in terms of amenity issues, it didn't deal with other sorts of issues like employment, insurance and taxation requirements."" Ms Giuseppi said while the sharing economy had been shown to be profitable, it was still not as important as mainstream accommodation services. ""When you look at it in the context of the contribution of the commercial accommodation sector which contributes $4.4 billion in consumption, $2.3 billion in economic contribution and directly and indirectly employs over 80,000 people across NSW that contribution pales,"" she said. But Mr McDonagh said Airbnb was not competing with mainstream hotels. ""The vast majority of listings in NSW are located outside of traditional hotel districts,"" he said. ""It means Airbnb guests spend money in neighbourhood cafes, shops and restaurants.""

459,Is rent control the answer to Sydney's housing affordability crisis?,house-and-home,"  Sydney squeeze: Is rent control the answer to the housing affordability crisis? Karen Ward has been renting in Sydney for 25 years. Until a year ago she was leasing a rundown house in Mascot with her son Charlie for about $450 per week. ""I found having a private landlord, he seemed to be able to put the rent up whenever he felt like it,"" Ms Ward said. ""There was no monitoring of repairs. Once when the toilet broke down, he said he didn't have time to fix it and said to me, 'use a bucket'. ""For myself and my son I needed something more stable, more secure, where rental prices were monitored."" Ms Ward and Charlie now live in a modern two-bedroom apartment in Zetland which was built last year exclusively as an affordable housing block by not-for-profit developer City West Housing. Since its creation in 1994, City West Housing has built more than 730 homes and is expecting to provide 1,045 affordable apartments by the end of next year. The complexes are managed like a private rental property and City West Housing expects the project cost of each development should be paid back within 30 years from the rent received from tenants. While the rent Ms Ward is paying now is similar to that of her previous home, it is capped to be no more than 30 per cent of her gross annual income, which includes any family tax benefits. She works as a planner with the National Disability Insurance Agency and has a salary of $85,000. A quick search for two-bedroom apartments in Zetland shows weekly rental prices ranging between $700 and $900. ""I most definitely have been able to save more,"" she said. ""I know exactly what I have to pay, whereas with private rental there is no benchmark on that."" But Ms Ward is on the higher income band of affordable housing residents. Most applications come from those earning between $33,000 and $55,000, like 27-year-old Alice Anderson who pays $250 a week for a studio apartment in Eveleigh. ""I have definitely been able to save a good chunk which is just such a peace of mind,"" she said. ""It's definitely motivated me to stay in jobs I haven't necessarily felt like they were right jobs for me. ""Obviously you can't quit jobs or you're risking losing your accommodation."" The human resources employee said that while a room in a sharehouse might be slightly cheaper, she valued the certainty of having an ongoing lease. Eligible residents are reviewed every six months and must be earning less that $94,274, work in the City of Sydney Local Government Area, have no other assets or savings and be living in inadequate or unaffordable housing at the time of applying. If a tenant's income is found to have increased and exceeds the maximum income band, they are given 90 days to find alternative accommodation. If they lose their job, City West Housing gives them a grace period of three months to find another job. City West Housing is the main community housing provider for the City of Sydney and also has properties in Eveleigh, Glebe and Alexandria. The council's Affordable Housing Policy requires developers in Green Square, Ultimo, Pyrmont and the southern employment lands including Rosebery to pay either a monetary levy or allocate a portion of finished homes to affordable housing. On Monday, a proposal to expand the policy to other suburbs including Potts Point, Darlinghurst, Camperdown and Erskineville was submitted to council. The Federal Government is also working towards establishing a government bank to fund community housing. The City of Sydney has a target that by 2030, 7.5 per cent of all housing in the local area will be affordable housing. It says it is ""committed to working with other governments to address the chronic shortage of affordable housing in the local area"". Rene McKenzie-Low, community engagement manager for City West Housing, said that without rent control in Sydney, low to mid-income families, nurses, teachers, shift workers and public servants would find it ""impossible"" to live close to work and maintain employment. She cited one story she heard of police officers forced to sleep in their cars overnight between shifts because they lived too far from work to make the commute worthwhile. It echoes a report by ABC's 7.30 program in which staff at Sydney Airport's international terminal said they had been sleeping at work because they could not afford to go home between shifts. Ms McKenzie-Low said supporting long-term renters was just as important as the current conversations about schemes to help first-time home buyers get into the market. ""If focus is always on affordable purchasing, you're missing a gap in the housing continuum if you ignore affordable renting,"" she said. ""We're capturing the mid market. ""Our niche is to make sure that people who keep our city running have quality of life."" The Sydney Squeeze is a week-long focus on the changing face of Sydney.

460,Take a tour inside a Sydney micro apartment,house-and-home,"  House prices: Take a tour inside a Sydney micro apartment With housing affordability a huge concern for many Sydney residents, one organisation is offering low- to middle-income earners the opportunity to live more cheaply in smaller spaces. Evolve Housing's initiative has already seen single people and couples making the switch to one-bedroom, one-bathroom places that are close to work but do not hurt the hip pocket. But can people actually live in a tiny apartment? The ABC took a tour inside one to see what it would be like. The apartment building on Parramatta Road at Camperdown includes spaces from 12–16 square metres for singles, to 25m2doubles for singles and couples, excluding the kitchen and bathroom areas. Stepping into a 20m2 double room, which is available for $300 per week including utilities and designed for someone with a disability, it is surprising to see how much has been packed into the micro apartment. There is a clear space for the kitchenette, a bathroom and a bed — but is it worth the $250-$300 price tag? The chief executive of not-for-profit organisation Evolve Housing, Andrea Galloway, said based on all the inclusions, it was. ""It includes … electricity, as you see it comes fully equipped — so you've got the fridge, you've got the TV, you've got all the cooking environment, even the utensils. If you work backwards, it is quite a reasonable cost,"" she said. Rachel Barabas, 25, has lived in a micro apartment in Camperdown since November last year. ""This is really everything I need for someone that's living by herself. At my previous place in Sydney, at Glebe, the rent was through the roof and didn't include utilities,"" she told the ABC. After a few of her roommates moved out, Ms Barabas was faced with having to find alternative and affordable accommodation. ""This place is perfect, it's got everything I need for one person. Tiny girl, tiny apartment. It's convenient,"" she said. ""Some people might find it a little bit cramped, but I really don't mind it. It's fully furnished, so it saves me a bit of money. ""My parents haven't actually seen my apartment except for the photos I've taken. They like that it's affordable and that bills are included, like gas and electricity. They are happy as long as I'm in a comfortable environment. ""There is CCTV and, especially as a young woman in Sydney by myself, they wanted to make sure I was in a safe location."" Ms Barabas said everyone in the building was ""really polite"" and ""really chilled"". ""The only other thing I was worried about was the fold-down bed. I was worried that it might bounce up in the middle of the night and give me a concussion, but it's all good and I haven't fallen off of it!"" Ms Galloway said the apartments were ""very liveable"", with some tenants having lived in the building since 2013. ""It's a great spot and that's the key to affordability, is being close to where you work and having the amenities,"" she said. A common room is also available to residents who might like a bit more space. The whole point of the initiative is to make affordable housing available to lower-income earners, so the micro apartments are only on offer to those under a certain income threshold. ""The income levels are very important. You can enter around $48,000 and you can earn up to $144,000 if you are [an existing tenant] married with [three] kids,"" Ms Galloway said. ""We assess everyone's individual income on an annual basis, and they have to provide us with payslips and all those kinds of things. We assess them quite accurately, it's not like you're in here and that's forever. ""The key is that these are key workers, so they have to be able to live close to where they work to create that diverse community. ""It is obviously not for everyone, but it does offer those with smaller incomes the chance to live in the CBD at a lower cost.""

461,Food growers feeling the 'Sydney squeeze',house-and-home,"  Sydney squeeze: Food producers losing land to developers, fresh food declining When fruit grower Ed Biel set up his orchard 30 years ago in Oakdale, it was at the height of apple growing in the area with some 70 farms across the south-western district of Sydney. Today, there are only two. He attributes the decline firstly to the changing industry, such as the introduction of controlled atmosphere storage, changing seasonality of apple production and increasing cost structures. The second reason though is due to ever-increasing property values and astute developers who have pushed up rates and compounded the financial woes of growers. ""The prices have skyrocketed,"" Mr Biel said. ""I think back to what I paid for this 40-acre block, now you'd be paying 30 times what I paid for it. ""The returns don't justify the level of investment unfortunately."" Mr Biel said most of his neighbours and fellow growers had simply opted to sell up and move out. What were once quiet rural communities, Camden and Oakdale are now fairly urbanised and further development is likely as town centres expand. Sydney's west is expected to bear the brunt of more than half of the population growth in Sydney in the next 20 years. Areas that have traditionally been used to grow food are now slated for housing, particularly around the Camden region where the population is expected to grow from 88,000 in 2017 to more than 226,000 by 2036. Mr Biel said when he started his business three decades ago, there were only 18,000 people living in the area. A search on one real estate website showed 16 housing estates either new or in development between Prestons, Leppington, Campbelltown, Oran Park and Spring Farm. Research published last year by the University of Technology Sydney found that if the city continued to develop agricultural land, it could lose more than 90 per cent of its current fresh vegetable production. Total food production could shrink by 60 per cent. In 2016, the Sydney food bowl had the capacity to feed 20 per cent of the city's population, but the UTS research suggests that could slip as low as 6 per cent. ""I think the value of retaining farming ... having that sort of system retained on the fringes of the city provides a level of freshness,"" Mr Biel said. ""I can pick my fruit in the morning and deliver it to Flemington markets tonight and you can purchase it tomorrow. ""But it's not only the freshness, it's the connection the city will lose to its agrarian beginnings."" While Mr Biel has not had a developer come knocking on his door yet, his former neighbours could not refuse the offers which saw them pocket millions of dollars per acre. He said he did not blame those who sold up. ""They work seven days a week, 14, 18 hours a day sometimes and for very little return, so if a developer comes knocking on your door with a big bagful of money, even I'd be tempted. ""Well I think I'm a bit crazy but I'm very passionate about what I do. ""I provide food for the people of Sydney. ""I do it because I love it and I feel I'm doing something worthwhile.""

462,Moncrieff Land Rent Scheme offers first home buyers step onto property ladder,house-and-home,"  Land Rent Scheme release at Moncrieff offers first home buyers step onto property ladder It's no secret that Canberra's housing market is one of the most expensive in the country. In an attempt to ease the pressure, in 2009 the ACT Government introduced the Land Rent Scheme. But now a community home provider has adapted the scheme to try to get more people out of the ""rental roundabout"" and into home ownership. For the first time in the ACT, this month Community Housing Canberra (CHC) will release 31 home and land packages in Moncrieff aimed at lower-to-middle income earners. The standard Land Rent Scheme offered by the Land Development Agency (LDA), means lessees do not have to buy the land. Instead, they rent it from the Government at a discounted rate of 2 per cent of the unimproved value and only have to get a loan for the value of the actual house, which means upfront costs are lower. But unlike the normal scheme, CHC will cover the cost of the rental payments until the dwelling is built on the property. And there are other benefits too. ""We can take on all the risks of construction, that is, finding a suitable builder. We understand design. We've got development experience,"" CHC chief executive officer Kim Sinclair said. ""We've got sales experience and we've got our operations. So we know what designs work for our tenants."" The has been a such a strong interest in the first release, Ms Sinclair said the organisation was now looking to offer blocks in other Gungahlin suburbs. ""Our next offering will be in Throsby and after that we are negotiating land rent sites in Taylor,"" she said. ""Our mission is to provide affordable housing ... and this is an avenue we have identified as helping people move off our rent roll and into home ownership."" Current rental tenants of CHC will get first choice, before they are released to the wider public on March 18. The Land Rent Scheme has been active for the last seven years and is at aimed at first home buyers. Tyson Astill and his fiancee Ilecia Longford said making use of the Land Rent Scheme was the only way for them to get into the market. The tradie and social worker have been saving to buy a house for the last two years. ""Buying an already established house was not going to be an option because it was a bit too hard to save that amount of money and then we just sort of heard about the Land Rent Scheme,"" Mr Astill said ""We only needed 10 per cent of what the build was going to be, which is a lot more affordable than what it would be to buy a $600,000 to $700,000 four-bedroom house here in Canberra."" They are one of more than 2,000 first home buyers who have utilised the scheme to enter the market. Simon Tennent from the ACT Government's Economic Development Directorate said ""by simply renting the land and channelling their finances into the build of the property it takes around about $700 per month off a typical mortgage [of $474,000]"". The LDA and CHC are the only two providers of the scheme in the ACT. ""Allowing land rent among community housing providers has really freed up capital for CHC to be able to build more properties and supply a high number of properties to the market,"" Mr Tennent said. In 2013, the scheme was tightened to ensure packages were going to families on lower incomes. The LDA are offering land in Moncrieff and Taylor under the scheme by ballot at or below $300,000.

463,opinion: In defence of the humble Australian lawn,house-and-home," RN In defence of the humble Australian lawn Is the Australian lawn dead? In summer it might look that way, and you could argue that a gorgeous green lawn in any season is an anachronism for modern Australia. By not establishing a lawn in your new home you can, apparently, ""shake off the cultural cargo bequeathed to you by European dukes, capitalist moguls and the Simpsons"". The Permaculture Research Institute in northern NSW begins its encyclical on lawns with the same revolutionary cry, reminding us that the origin of lawn growing was with the ""fabulously wealthy"" — and perhaps worse still, the English wealthy. The arguments about the undesirable impacts of lawns on our natural world are numerous. They typically lead to fewer plant and animal species than natural vegetation, attract the use of ""weapons against nature"" (lawnmowers, trimmers and chemical sprays to control pests and diseases), and result in the overuse of a limited resource — water. Then there is the yoke of caring for the lawn, eating into our precious ""two days of freedom"" each week. So, does that make it an open-and-shut case? What does the defence have to say? Lawns in parks and public gardens are a magnet on hot days. Oak Lawn in the Melbourne Gardens, a woodland with large mature trees and mown turf, is as cool in summer as the nearby Fern Gully, with its running water and lush vegetation. Both areas are up to six degrees cooler than the surrounding city when temperatures rise above 30 degrees. It's better for the environment that you cool off in the park than in your air-conditioned bungalow. There are also good design reasons to have lawns, or something like a lawn. They create what landscape architects like to call the void, within the mass of shrubbery. You can sit on them (in Australia at least), in comfort, and they absorb air pollutants and noise. Then there is the provocative argument, put to me by Peter Symes, the senior curator of horticulture at Melbourne Gardens, that if the gardens wanted to save more water we would remove all our trees and garden beds, and replace them entirely with (warm-season) lawns. Neil Perkins, the coordinator of horticulture at Melbourne Gardens, says you can have a green lawn in Melbourne for 10 to 11 months of the year without resorting to irrigation. The best approach is to plant kikuyu grass and keep the trees to a minimum: any tree will compete with grass for water, whether from the sky or soil. There's no need to fertilise, says Perkins, unless you have heavy foot traffic or want to keep your lawn particularly swanky. That said, a little extra nitrogen will help kikuyu perform better. Leaving the lawn clippings on the lawn will help in this regard. There are other considerations, depending on where you live. Kikuyu can be weedy and you should avoid letting it spread into native bushland. Buffalo grass is another alternative, particularly for shading areas, although it's less tolerant of foot traffic. A native grass lawn is worth considering, particularly if you don't mind a more unkempt look. The Australian species tend to require less watering and fertilising, and, particularly if inter-planted with indigenous wildflowers, can attract local wildlife. Weeping grass (Microlaena stipoides) is good for shady areas and will spring back to life after drying out. It can also be mown if you desire. At Cranbourne Gardens, we are trialling Australian mat grass (Hemarthria uncinata), which is a bit like kikuyu, but it does require a lot weeding to keep it at the quality we want for a public space. For a very different kind of lawn, taller Australian grasses such as wallaby and kangaroo grass or poa create a rustic and more natural look, although you can mow some of them down to 4cm or so. So I like to think the jury is out, perhaps reaching its verdict on a shaded lawn near the courthouse. If that lawn is mown high, unwatered, unfertilised, and contains grasses suited to the local climate and soils, then the 12 good men and women are in the perfect place to decide.

464,Watersun debts owed to creditors likely to be $20m: administrators,house-and-home,"  Watersun Homes debts owed to creditors likely to be $20 million administrators say Debts run up by collapsed Victorian construction firm Watersun Homes are likely to hit $20 million, double the original estimates, the administrators say. ""Across the board — employee entitlements, sub-contractor claims, tax office claims and other statutory claims — it's in the order of $20 million,"" Rodgers Reidy director Mathew Gollant said after a creditors meeting in Melbourne. The hundreds of homebuyers affected by the collapse were told they should find out within a matter of weeks if other building firms are willing to complete about 300 unfinished homes. Rodgers Reidy, installed as administrators two weeks ago, is negotiating with construction firms. ""We are hoping that we'll have interested parties to take over the majority if not all of the housing contracts in the next few weeks,"" Mr Gollant said. ""If we get somebody to take over the contracts and complete them within the original build price then they [homebuyers] won't have suffered much of a loss. ""Of course they've got the emotional side — that's not optimal but hopefully they won't come out of it too far in reverse. ""There will be occasions when they'll have to rely on the VMIA (Victorian Managed Insurance Agency) to satisfy the unpaid portion of their claims."" In all there are 800 creditors — including 90 employees who have lost their jobs. One employee, who did not want to be named, said she knew there were problems and warned of a ""ripple effect"" across the industry. ""They were good at sales, but bad at management,"" she said. By far the biggest group owed money are the suppliers of building materials and services to the 300 housing projects across Victoria that have been halted as a result of Watersun's collapse. ""They are unsecured creditors unfortunately. The priority of course is for employee entitlements. They rank ahead of unsecured creditor claims and we made them aware of that today,"" Mr Gollant said. ""They took that on board. They wouldn't be happy about it."" Bendigo excavation contractor Bill Keeble is owed $10,500. He told the ABC he had problems late last year with Watersun paying his invoices. ""They've been pretty ordinary for while,"" he said. He does not hold out much hope of getting his money back. ""My accountant seems to think it's a lost cause,"" he said Another creditors meeting is planned for April 7. ""The next step for us is to investigate the affairs of the company and report substantively to creditors,"" Mr Gollant said.

465,Housing affordability: Is it time to move to Adelaide?,house-and-home,"  Sydney and Melbourne housing affordability woes: Is it time to move to Adelaide? ""Housing out of reach"", ""The death of the Australian dream"" — if you're a young adult living in Sydney or Melbourne such headlines might be enough to make you give up trying to own your own home. House prices in Adelaide, however, remain affordable and with international travel guide Lonely Planet laying praise on the city in recent years, along with economists, perhaps it is time for a closer look at the festival city. Cameron Kusher, CoreLogic's head of research in Australia, said Adelaide's median house price was $455,000 at the end of February. Sydney by comparison was $895,000 and Melbourne $680,000. ""We're talking Sydney prices almost double what they are in Adelaide, but you certainly don't get double the wage for the same level of job in Sydney,"" Mr Kusher said. In fact, to service an 80 per cent loan in Sydney, it would cost a homeowner 44.5 per cent of their annual median income, compared to 37.9 per cent in Melbourne and 33 per cent in Adelaide. Just saving a 20 per cent deposit in Sydney will cost somebody 168 per cent of their median annual earnings. In Melbourne it will cost 143 per cent but in Adelaide it is a relatively smaller 125 per cent. ""It's much harder to get into the market in Sydney, and it's a similar story in Melbourne,"" Mr Kusher said. ""And once you're in the market, you've got to dedicate a lot more of your income to paying off the mortgage."" The housing figures make an isolated argument for an interstate move, but mention Adelaide to any parochial Sydneysider or Melbournian and it is more often than not met with scoffing, invariably by those who have never travelled there. ""The big brother or big sister will always knock the little one into place,"" Melbourne-based Lawrence Mooney said, an Adelaide fan who visits regularly. ""People need to feel superior in some way or another. That's why Adelaide's picked out. ""People couldn't be bothered going to the trouble of discovering the place. They took a quick look and just go, 'it's small and shit and boring', and that's incorrect."" They might call Adelaide a sleepy town with a disproportionate appetite for weird, headline-grabbing murders; an ageing place full of baby boomers who block innovation and refuse to retire; or a town full of hardcore football fans who harbour a chip on their shoulder for losing the grand prix to Melbourne. Such descriptions are correct, of course, but unbeknown to Sydneysiders equipped with blinkers, or Melbournians reciprocating an unassailable football rivalry, Adelaide has transformed significantly over the past seven years: The transformation has not gone unnoticed overseas. Lonely Planet recently listed South Australia fifth on it Best of Travel 2017 list, citing its wine regions and beaches as drawcards, just three years after it endorsed Adelaide as one of the top 10 cities in the world to visit in 2014. And in 2016, the Economist Intelligent Unit listed Adelaide as the fifth most liveable city out of 140 cities surveyed worldwide. Melbourne was listed as number one; Sydney dropped four places to move out of the top 10 altogether. Rita Horanyi, 34, moved to Adelaide from Melbourne in 2010 to do postgraduate study and now lives there. ""It's true that Adelaide didn't have a great reputation when I first moved, and back then it was understandable why that was the case,"" she said. ""In the last five years the city has improved significantly. Adelaide's bad reputation lingers, but friends of mine from interstate who visit for festivals and so on do notice the changes and are pleasantly surprised."" Warner Music media manager Bret Woods, 35, moved back to Adelaide about four years ago after spending his adult life in Sydney. ""Working in the music industry, I'm seeing there's more than enough stuff going on,"" he said. ""To me, it almost feels like when Sydney had that small bar scene five or six years ago. Adelaide's in the same situation."" Having recently bought a house in Adelaide, Mr Woods simply laughed at the idea of buying a house in Sydney. ""Buying a place in Sydney is impossible, let alone anywhere we wanted to live or used to rent."" He added that perceptions of Adelaide interstate were starting to change, with several friends from the UK and Sydney having recently visited for the Fringe Festival and the Clipsal 500 car racing carnival. ""And obviously our wine regions are pretty highly regarded, and at least do their bit to hold up SA to the rest of SA [outside the festival months]."" News Limited journalist Stan Denham moved to Adelaide from Sydney five years ago. ""The kind of lifestyle you can have in Adelaide is not attainable in Sydney, unless you are earning megabucks,"" he said. ""I was up there last weekend and was struck again by the beauty of the city, but then very few Sydneysiders get to really enjoy that. ""Most of my time was spent working and commuting."" Dubai-born surgeon Annika Mascarenhas, 27, moved to Adelaide from Perth in 2013, having visited the year before. ""I've been here while things have started to boom,"" she said. ""I think the misconception exists that Adelaide's a sleepy city. It exists in Perth as well. ""The Oval opened, the Fringe got a bit bigger, more wineries are advertising good weekends ... there's plenty to do."" Before Adelaide can expect a major influx of young adults chasing the homeowner's dream, however, it does lack in one area that Sydney and Melbourne has in spades — job opportunities. ""Since the end of 2008, most of the growth in the housing market has been in Sydney and Melbourne, but those two cities between them have created about 66 per cent of all jobs created since 2008,"" Mr Kusher said. Most of those jobs have been in the services sector, financial services and the health care sector. ""But unfortunately for the rest of the country, the jobs growth story hasn't been as strong,"" Mr Kusher said. Until recently, South Australia suffered the highest unemployment rate in the country, due largely to a downturn in mining and the decline of large-scale manufacturing. Start-up businesses and small bars are unlikely to produce the same levels of employment, but the State Government has been working hard to transition the city's employment base. This includes securing major, long-term defence contracts, spending big bucks on a medical research hub, and courting emerging industries such as self-driving cars. But Melbourne and Sydney also benefit from being the headquarters for the big end of town in businesses, multinational companies, banks and financial institutions. ""It would be hard to move them away from those cities for somewhere like Adelaide or Brisbane or Hobart,"" Mr Kusher said. ""Those cities need to look at ways to attract different types of business or to find ways to attract big businesses to move part of their functions to other parts of the country."" Mr Kusher added, however, that as more and more businesses started to allow their employees to work remotely, there could be a shift of workers moving to places where the housing is more affordable, ""in markets like Adelaide"".

466,MP disagrees with CBA boss's housing affordability comments,house-and-home,"  House prices: Commonwealth Bank boss and Government at odds on affordability The Federal Government appears to be at odds with the head of one of Australia's largest banks over housing affordability in Sydney and Melbourne. Commonwealth Bank chief executive Ian Narev told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday many young Australians did not believe property was overpriced. ""I am not sure they are saying it is overpriced, I think they are saying that it is difficult to afford it and we share that view,"" he told the inquiry. ""That should be a matter of national concern and it certainly is to us."" But Federal MP Michael Sukkar has told the ABC he doesn't understand that statement given his conversations with prospective first home buyers. Mr Sukkar, the assistant minister to the Treasurer, said wage growth had not kept up with the increase in property prices over the past two decades. ""I am not sure how Ian Narev has made that statement as it's not consistent with the feedback that I get,"" he told Radio National. ""I think first home buyers feel property is extraordinarily expensive, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. ""The dozens and dozens, if not hundreds, of conversations I have with prospective first home buyers are pretty different to that statement he made."" The pros and cons of some of the top suggestions to make buying a house more doable, along with the likelihood of them ever actually happening. Mr Narev said the Commonwealth Bank was comfortable with its lending practices in all parts of Australia. ""We understand the laws of supply and demand in the whole sector and [as for] the view on whether any given house is overpriced or not, I'm not going to pronounce on that,"" Mr Narev said. Mr Sukkar said Treasurer Scott Morrison had already acknowledged the merit of a shared equity scheme being trialled in Victoria, which would assist those without substantial deposits. ""The Treasurer is on the record in highlighting his admiration for a policy such as that,"" Mr Sukkar said. ""It was something that was appealing, so in that sense we applauded the Victorian State Government for doing something, it is a very interesting idea."" The Victorian Government has also moved to abolish stamp duty for first home owners purchasing a property valued below $600,000. Tax breaks or grants to first home buyers have been tried before and just make homes more expensive, explains Michael Janda. While Mr Morrison praised the Victorian Government ""for having a good crack"", he said the stamp duty concession would not work unless more homes were built. ""But at the end of the day, if that just means people bid up more in the auction because they can borrow more because they don't have to pay stamp duty, well obviously, that will just take prices in one direction,"" the Treasurer said. ""So you can't do that without addressing the supply issues at the end of the day."" Housing affordability has been a thorny issue for the Federal Government, with the Opposition using it as part of its campaign to paint the Turnbull Government as out of touch.

467,Why are we still buying houses we can't afford?,house-and-home,"  House prices: When will we get to the point that we just say NO? House prices can't keep rising forever. At some point, everyone will just calm down and refuse to pay way too much for a tiny place that isn't even in the area they really wanted to live. Right? We talked to two experts about how prices can keep rising, if a price drop is inevitable — and whether it will cause a US-style collapse. Any rational person might look at what's happening in the housing market on face value and refuse to buy. The housing affordability debate is increasingly becoming the home of wacky ideas ranging from dangerous to disastrous, writes Michael Janda. But this just isn't the case. The latest house price figures for February shows prices — particularly in Sydney and Melbourne — rising. Again. ""We're in a pit of irrational exuberance,"" LF Economics property economist David Lindsay says. Basically, he thinks people aren't acting in the way you would normally expect and so, despite house prices becoming increasingly unaffordable for most Australians in some areas, people are still buying property. Why? Mr Lindsay says the problem lies squarely with the banks. ""[Not only] have you got a very irrational, exuberant population when it comes to housing, [but you've also got] a banking system that is running like a Ponzi finance scheme,"" he says. ""These things keep on going until a) these banks cannot keep lending to speculative home buyers or b) we get to a point where people say 'this is crazy, I'm not going to buy in this housing market'."" But it is important to note that not all economists are agreed on this point. RMIT property economics professor Chris Eves says the situation is not the catastrophe that some say it is. ""One of the things that sets Australia apart is that there are sectors that are currently oversupplied [too many houses] and there is potential that there won't be much market demand for those types of properties, which could lead house prices to fall,"" he says. ""But it's not going to be across the board."" Instead Mr Eves thinks this is just a part of the nature of housing prices — which go through ups and downs. He says the Gold Coast is a typical example of an area where there are regular changes in demand. When foreign buyer demand goes down because prices have maybe gone too high or there is not enough supply, buyers withdraw from the market. This can have some impact on the market, which then forces developers to pull back for a while, but once prices have fallen you get people coming back into the market and prices rising again. This is known as the housing cycle. It is mathematically impossible to predict when this housing boom will end, according to Mr Lindsay. A lack of full-time job prospects, ballooning house prices and an increasingly tense world has young Australians feeling bleak about their future. The problem so far is that while first-time buyers have been priced out of the market, investors are able to use their existing house to get another loan. That is, if you buy a $1 million house and you're not making a profit from it and the bank re-values your house and says it is now worth $1.1 million, that extra $100,000 of your unrealised capital gains can be leveraged against now. You also have foreign buyers who may be seeing the boom in Australian housing prices as an investment opportunity. If, as some have called for, the banking regulator steps in and tightens the investor market and the foreign buyer market, this might see a slowing in house price growth. In this case, Mr Eves says that those pockets of cities where housing prices are too high will be balanced out by more reasonable prices in other suburbs. ""It's not going to be across the board. If you look at a lot of the areas where house prices have gone up, they've gone up in relation to people's ability to afford and repay,"" Mr Eves says. ""There will always be high-priced areas that will remain high priced. We've seen some movement in middle-priced suburbs through trends that some may become less popular, but again if something becomes a little less popular what you see is a bit of movement in the market."" Mr Lindsay warns this has the potential to be like what happened in the US — maybe even worse. The pros and cons of some of the top suggestions to make buying a house more doable, along with the likelihood of them ever actually happening. ""In Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne it's nothing but a speculative, credit-fuelled housing bubble. It's what happened in Ireland and what happened in a lot of parts of the US in the past decade,"" he says. ""A lot of people thought the housing market was invincible and it could only go up and one day it crashed and it burned a lot of people, and the financial system along with it."" But Mr Eves offers a more tempered view. ""No, basically the underlying factors in Australia when compared to the US are completely different,"" he says. ""One of the biggest differences is the fact we don't have no-default loans. There were developers in the US building stuff willy-nilly and banks even giving unemployed people loans before the housing price collapse there. ""So what happened with no-default loans is that if you owed the bank $400,000 and you purchased a home for $450,000 and then that value dropped to $350,000, then you could just walk away and the bank couldn't chase your remaining debt. ""That doesn't happen here."" Absolutely. A lot of property is still being developed, particularly in CBDs and inner-city areas, for the foreign investor market. ""The issue there is that if they leave the market, would the domestic market be able to take over that demand?"" Mr Lindsay says. ""And the bottom line there is, it's not."" If there are fewer people buying properties, and more supply, then it follows that prices will go down. This is problematic if you own a property in one of these areas — it is basically worth less. The problem also extends to those suburbs where housing has become unaffordable, and not just because of the gentrifying process that is going on in some Australian cities. Eventually prices will reach a point where people won't buy and then you will see a slow-down in growth. But this might not happen for some time and, as Mr Eves suggests, what it means for first-time homebuyers is that they may be renting for the foreseeable future.

468,The bittersweet decision to downsize and sell home of 46 years,house-and-home,"  Downsizing: Selling the family home after almost half a century Gerry and Rosemary Franklin have made a bittersweet decision that empty-nesters right across the country are faced with each year. The Canberra couple will move into retirement accommodation later this year and sell the family home where they have lived for almost half a century. At 83, Mr Franklin is determined that he and his wife, 82, downsize together while they are both fit and well. It was 1971 when the Franklins bought land and built the first house on Wenholz Street in Farrer. ""The house itself cost $17,000 and the block of land we bought at auction,"" Mr Franklin said. ""We said we wouldn't go beyond $1,500 for the land, but we actually went to $1,900. ""A very expensive block,"" he added, chuckling. Moving from their small ""govie house"" in Dickson, the Franklins were in need of a bigger home to accommodate their six young children. ""Farrer was a lovely neat little suburb and we were pleased to be here,"" Mrs Franklin said. ""To us, this place was ideal."" Over 46 years the house has undergone numerous additions and renovations to accommodate the family's changing needs. ""For a time there was our family of eight living here and now it's just the two of us, so it's a big house to be in,"" Mr Franklin said. Sitting in their flourishing backyard, the Franklins joked that they would not miss having to weed the garden. ""The garden that we planted, we've enjoyed the garden, but as we've got older, it is harder to do the gardening,"" Mrs Franklin said. ""Although I will miss being able to go outside every morning and pick a bunch of flowers from my garden."" ""It's been a real family home with so many big celebrations here for the children and grandchildren,"" Mrs Franklin said. ""Now our children have been through school, been through university, married local girls and boys and most of them have settled here. ""They've loved the house as much as we do."" For the Franklins, leaving the family home will be ""tinged with sadness"". ""Rosemary's mother also came and lived with us here for the last six years of her life, before she died at 101,"" Mr Franklin said. ""Those memories are all part of the house. ""With Rosemary's heredity behind her — her father was 97 when he died and her mother at 101 — I figured she might be a widow for a few years and I couldn't see her rattling around in here on her own. ""If we're going to move, it's better that we move together. ""Our new home will be a lot easier for one left alone to feel secure."" The Franklins will also leave behind their much-loved neighbourhood community. ""We love the street,"" Mrs Franklin said. ""We've had such a friendly number of neighbours and we're going to be grieving at leaving the street."" Encouraged by friends who have already moved into retirement villages and smaller homes, the Franklins are proud their decision is one they have been able to make for themselves. ""All the people that we know who have been through this say it's like going overseas — it's like sheer hell to go through, but when you get there, it's marvellous,"" Mr Franklin said.

469,Mushrooms in the shower: Australians share their rental nightmares,house-and-home,"  Rental nightmares: Australians share their worst renting experiences The first national survey of housing tenants has revealed renters in Australia lack the power to demand standard property maintenance. Tenants are putting up with poor-quality housing and many fear being evicted or blacklisted if they complain to their landlord, according to the researchers. Many renters have contacted the ABC to tell of their experiences of being discriminated against for their age, pet bans and abusive landlords. Many other people who talked to the ABC did not want all of their details disclosed for fear of retribution. Here are some of their experiences. After a series of maintenance issues — including mould — at their rental home in Hackham, South Australia, mushrooms growing out of the shower were the final straw for Leisa Yanner and her family. Along with her husband Aaron and their three children, Leisa began looking for a new home — only to constantly be turned down. It was only when they were inspecting another property, the 34-year-old voiced her suspicions to the prospective agent that her old agent would try and prevent them from leaving. ""The new agent called us later the next day and told us that our old agent was giving us a bad reference,"" she said. ""I was able to prove that none of that was true, and this land agent gave us a chance! We love our new house, and have had no problems!"" Anne, 24, was renting an old Queenslander-style house in Brisbane during the 2011 floods. While luckily the house was spared from flooding, it didn't stop the house from water damage which led to a leaky roof that dripped through the asbestos ceiling, and from the rear stairs falling in, leaving a 3-metre drop. ""Shoddy workmanship"" meant the phone lines had been severed and when the real estate agent ignored her emails, Anne said she ""had to bodge job it ourselves with electrical tape"". Anne's lease came to an end and the house was marked for demolition — but that wasn't the end of her problems. ""The real estate still demanded we had the entire unit steam cleaned, and asked us to go back twice to clean dust off the windowsills and fix the oven — which next week we saw get tossed into a dumpster as we walked past."" Ellen found it hard applying for her first property. ""The landlord came out and basically said, 'You're too young, don't bother applying'."" The real estate agent told the 25-year-old to use her parents on the application form, even though they were not tenants in the property. ""I mean that's fraudulent so it really opened my eyes that we were basically being told to break the law."" On a separate occasion, Ellen was told the landlord did not want students. ""I found that really odd because what if you were 40 and you were a student? I mean if you went into a store and someone said we don't serve students that would just be outrageous but here were landlords saying they didn't want students."" Since becoming a pet owner, Ellen's rental problems have shifted to landlords who don't allow pets — something she believes is unfair. ""It just creates a stratified society — where the chance to enjoy the companionship of a pet really depends on whether you own your own property or not."" Mat Skewes moved from Melbourne to the Gold Coast in October 2016. Mr Skewes, 31, found work but struggled to find accommodation because of his two dogs, Choc and Missy. ""The rental market up here is crazy. No-one accepts pets. We found it really hard to find somewhere liveable and affordable to bring the dogs with us, which unfortunately we couldn't find. ""The houses that accept animals are really expensive or they're … not derelict but definitely questionable. ""Unfortunately we had to leave our dogs behind, and now we're in a struggle to try and find somewhere affordable for us to purchase to get them up here."" In southern Sydney, Kelly Donnelly found the rental market extremely competitive. ""It was just very difficult — you'd go to a place and there would be like 50 people there. ""I went to one house in Woolooware and it was queued from the door all the way up the street, and everything turned into bartering wars."" Ms Donnelly, 45, said she also had issues trying to rent a large house as she is a single woman. ""I was asked by one agent, 'why do I want such a big house for myself? How can I afford it?'"" In one instance, Ms Donnelly signed a lease for a property only to discover the owners would be still living in it. ""I tore up the lease, sent a pic to the agent and said I didn't sign up for this shit and left the keys and torn up lease at the local pub, as he had left the real estate office,"" she said. ""It really is a nightmare out there trying to rent something — especially long term."" About a week after Naomi moved into her house, she started to have issues with the plumbing, which had backed up. First there were constant sewage leaks from the ensuite bathroom which made her bedroom smell, then the second bathroom blocked up and overflowed sewage up the shower drain and all over the floor, before the water system completely blocked up and water filled the kitchen sink. ""Every water outlet was blocked, overflowing and unusable. Not one toilet was usable,"" Naomi said. ""All the landlord did for a whole week was to come and plunge one of the toilets, and make a stinking mess when he did it a few times."" Naomi said she was cleaning up sewage for three weeks and had to take time off work. ""I had to get the local council to send someone to do a health inspection report, to try to get the landlord to do something about it all."" ""In the end, we had to move out, as he was also going crazy and shouting at me, and said it wasn't his responsibility to fix it and that we should just go to the toilet in the neighbour's yard!"" ""It was such an ordeal and so upsetting, as we had to move so suddenly and we lost money.""

470,How small is too small? Perth's housing micro-blocks,house-and-home,"  How small is too small? 80sqm housing blocks to go on sale in Perth A house on a quarter-acre block, with enough space to play cricket in the backyard and host a Hills Hoist, was once the Australian norm. But soon blocks as small as 80 square metres — the size of a modest two-bedroom apartment — will go on sale in Perth. The Urban Development Institute of Australia defines a micro-block as a lot that is less than 200 square metres. Six months ago they were almost non-existent in Western Australia, the institute's chief executive Allison Hailes told ABC Radio Perth. ""We know that at the moment 4.3 per cent of lots that are expected to be released into the market in the next six months are micro-lots,"" she said. ""There are a number of areas where micro-lots are being planned as part of developments — Cockburn, Kwinana, Wanneroo, Canning and Subiaco."" While a block of land as small as 80 to 120 square metres may seem extremely small, Ms Hailes said it could work if a multi-storey or terrace house design was used. ""The houses that are being developed for these micro-lots are using very clever design. ""The house floor space might be 200 square metres. ""So we are seeing two-bedroom or even three-bedroom houses being built on micro-lots. ""Other designs that I think will emerge more in the Perth market are where you have a home office on the ground floor and then living space and a bedroom on the first floor."" Some listeners to ABC Radio Perth were very keen on the idea of scaling back their living space. Bev: ""You don't need much space to grow your veggies and parks can be used as outdoors space. This seems like a great idea. It might get people more involved in their communities if they can't fit a three-metre big screen in their house."" Gill: ""The idea is becoming more and more appealing as I look around at all the 'stuff' we have and use only such a small proportion of."" Janelle: ""Not everyone wants a four-bedroom, two-bathroom, two-garage, media room and everything else. Builders need to look beyond this."" But others felt micro-blocks would be just too small and were not necessary in a city like Perth. Tolla: ""No way. People need space. Children need areas to run free and teenagers and young adults need their own areas. We live in this wide brown land so let us enjoy it."" Belle: ""Tiny house? Yes. On a tiny block? No. You need some outdoor space to compensate for the tight living quarters."" Lin: ""I worry about privacy and noise issues living so close [together]."" The micro-block concept could be a boon for people who want to downsize but dislike the idea of apartment living and shared spaces. ""Some people don't want to move into an apartment or a unit development with strata fees and common or shared spaces,"" Ms Hailes said. Research by Curtin University's Department of Urban and Regional Planning found that while people accept the idea that Perth needs high-density housing, many dislike the idea of living in apartments. Researcher Shohreh Nematollahi surveyed residents in Perth's southern suburbs and found they wanted to keep to themselves and had an aversion to the prospect of unexpectedly running into neighbours in the corridor, garden or other common areas. ""They were prepared to have very narrow houses, perhaps with just three or four metres frontage, as long as they are not sharing with other people,"" she said. ""That's a big concept for an architect, to make high-density housing without any shared space.""

471,Using bubble wrap on your windows to keep your house cool,house-and-home,"  Using bubble wrap to 'double glaze' your windows to keep your house cool in summer Bubble wrap is commonly used to protect breakables or — for a childish few — popping. But it can also act as a cheap alternative to double glazing, according to a scientist that specialises in designing homes to suit Canberra's climate. ""I know a lot of people have heard that you can put bubble wrap on your windows in winter to improve things, but you can also use it in summer,"" Jenny Edwards told ABC Radio Canberra's Lish Fejer. ""You can convert a single glazed window into something that is much more like a double glazed window by simply putting bubble wrap over the glass."" Ms Edwards said the bubble wrap should also cover the metal window frames, which are ""really conductive"". She said many houses in the ACT were poorly insulated. Bubble wrap works by increasing the isolative value of the window, making it effective in keeping the heat out in summer and preventing heat loss in winter. ""The still layer of air trapped in the bubbles gives a cheap double-glazed-type effect,"" Ms Edwards said. While bubble wrap may not be a glamorous solution to keeping the house cool, it was not unreasonable when facing a house-sized sauna, Ms Edwards said. Ms Edwards said awnings and shade sails were both good solutions to keeping the sun off windows during summer. However, they would not always be an option for people living in flats or apartments. Ms Edwards said surrounding your home with deciduous plants, if possible, was another way to cool the place down cheaply. ""Not only do they shade beautifully and let the warming sun through in winter, but they also have this lovely cooling effect through transpiration,"" she said. ""Plants lose water vapour through their leaves and that creates this extra cooling effect, which is really effective. ""We've all felt it if we've walked through leafy areas at the botanic gardens; you feel much cooler. ""It's not just the shade. It's also that cooling moist effect from the transpiration."" Ms Edwards said a lot of people thought they could cool their home down by simply closing the internal window dressings. ""But they're sadly mistaken,"" she said. ""Once the sun hits that glass it travels through that glass into the house. ""The house absorbs that heat in all sorts of different ways, and you don't lose that heat very easily."" Ms Edwards recommended using ceiling or pedestal fans to take the edge off during the peak of summer.

472,Home-schoolers concerned about changes to legislation,house-and-home,"  Home-schooling parents concerned about proposed changes to Victorian legislation New proposed draft regulations are expected to change the way home schooling is delivered in Victoria. Currently about 4,500 children are home-schooled in the state and not everyone is happy with the new regulations. Coordinator of the Home Education Network, Susan Wight, said the government had not produced any evidence of a problem in home schooling to justify changes in the legislation. ""The normal practice to increase regulations is to identify a problem and then propose a solution; they haven't identified a problem,"" Ms Wight said. She said the concern was that there was less of an emphasis on education and more on compliance. ""The problem with this is that it goes a long way beyond checking that children are being educated,"" she said. ""[It] gives the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority (VRQA) the power to dictate how they're educated, which is quite a different thing."" The review of home schooling is part of a wider review of the Education and Training Reform Act of 2007, which requires regulations be reviewed every 10 years. Under the proposed changes, families will need to submit a one-off learning plan, with the VRQA given powers to review a family's arrangement for home schooling. The learning plan will have to demonstrate delivery on eight key learning areas, including English and mathematics. According to Ms Wight, submitting plans creates additional paperwork and gives the VRQA a new level of power. ""They have the complete power to accept or reject a plan without any limitations placed upon them,"" she said. Castlemaine parent Caithlin Meave has been home schooling her 11-year-old daughter Iskhar for the past four years, after she experienced bullying at school. ""I was having a bit of trouble finding a way to be heard in the system and there were just too many kids to deal with,"" Ms Meave said. Based on the UK's Summerhill School democratic approach, Ms Meave follows the free schooling child-led approach to teaching after initially following a more traditional approach and said her daughter had ""flourished"" and they had not ""looked back"". ""The children direct their learning so they choose what they are interested in and they choose their projects themselves,"" she said. Ms Maeve said free schooling did not work for everyone but did tend to suit inquisitive people with a ""voracious appetite for wonderment"". Despite understanding the rationale behind the submission of a yearly learning plan, Ms Meave said it would be ""problematic"" because of its limitations in restricting a child's curiosity to learn certain things. ""It will take some of the joy out of it, for sure. It will be limiting, it will feel tedious and somewhat frustrating,"" she said. Samantha Rowe chose to home-school her daughter Daisy — mainly at the kitchen table — after her daughter's additional needs were not being met at a local primary school. In addition, the pair attends weekly group lessons with other Castlemaine Waldorf Steiner home-schoolers. Although flexible in her approach to education, Ms Rowe largely follows the enquiry-based learning of Rudolph Steiner. She is concerned the VRQA authorities will not be familiar with alternative forms of education even though she follows what she called a ""strict"" curriculum. ""They might want me having Daisy reading and writing earlier or not allowing me the freedom to educate how I want to,"" Ms Rowe said. While she agreed there needed to be some accountability, Ms Rowe said there also needed to be some flexibility and understanding and was concerned about the potential for home ""spot checks"". She said she enjoyed the flexibility of the home environment, which allowed for teaching outside of school terms. ""It concerns me that if they walk into my house in April and we're not doing any work for that month, they might think that were sitting around and doing nothing."" In a statement, Education Minister James Merlino said there was no requirement to provide home schooling in accordance with a specified curriculum. His statement also said there would be no mandatory home visits and registration would be ongoing rather than having to be renewed regularly as in some other states. ""Assessment will be done by education experts who have experience in different learning styles, including home schooling,"" the statement said. Sarah Nicholson, from Myrniong near Ballarat, lives on the same street as the local primary school but has home-schooled her two children, Kenzie, 10, and Katelynne, 7, for the last four years after her eldest was identified as possibly being on the spectrum. ""By the end of the year, we could see there were not only very big gaps in his general education but his very specific needs were not being met,"" Ms Nicholson said. Ms Nicholson uses a combination of Montessori and other methodologies to teach her children. Along with sharing other concerns about the inflexibility of the draft legislation, Ms Nicholson said she was not in favour of the 28-day period of approval before withdrawing a child from school. She said ordinarily this would be fine, but if the child was in a ""stressful situation"" at school, such a being bullied or feeling suicidal, they might require immediate withdrawal. ""Expecting people to plan and organise things when they've got a child in that kind of stressful situation is just ridiculous,"" Ms Nicholson said. According to Mr Merlino the proposed 28-day wait period will be an extension to the current 14-day wait period. ""[It] will give the VRQA sufficient time to properly review each learning plan,"" he said. Ms Wight said the group would be more than happy to deal with the Department of Education and Training in developing something that worked for both sides. ""They seem to want to impose this without proper consultation and without taking into account the research,"" she said. The group has been told they can make a public submission on the draft legislation.

473,Zuckerberg drops lawsuits seeking to buy Hawaii land,house-and-home,"  Mark Zuckerberg drops lawsuits seeking to buy land from Native Hawaiians on Kauai Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he is dropping lawsuits seeking to buy out Native Hawaiians who own small pieces of land within his sprawling estate on the island of Kauai, promising instead to work with the community on ""a new approach"". Mr Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, said in a letter to the community published in The Garden Island newspaper that they were ending the cases ""to find a better path forward"". ""Upon reflection, I regret that I did not take the time to fully understand the quiet title process and its history before we moved ahead,"" the letter said of the legal move to clear up disputed or undetermined land ownership in Hawaii. ""Now that I understand the issues better, it's clear we made a mistake."" A spokesman for Mr Zuckerberg confirmed the couple sent the letter. The 14 parcels mostly belong to Native Hawaiian families awarded the land during the mid-19th century, when private property was established in Hawaii. Many original owners died without wills. Ownership today is split among hundreds of descendants, many of whom are unaware of their shares. The couple filed court cases last month to identify the owners and ask the court to auction the land. Critics say the process often results in Native Hawaiians losing their land. The parcels in question emerged during land reforms that the Kingdom of Hawaii pursued in the 1800s called the Great Mahele. Until then, no individual owned land — it was collectively cared for and used. The reforms allowed commoners to claim title to land they lived on and farmed, usually about a half-acre. But only a small share of Hawaii's land — some 28,000 acres — ended up in the hands of commoners. Millions of acres went to the king, other royals and the government. Mr Zuckerberg bought his 700-acre oceanfront property in 2014 for $US100 million ($132 million), Forbes reported. Moses Haia, executive director of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation, an agency that frequently represents people on the receiving end of quiet title lawsuits, welcomed the tech billionaire's move. ""We appreciate Mr Zuckerberg's sense of justice and his desire to truly understand the impact that the introduction of private property has had on the indigenous people of Hawaii,"" Mr Haia said. ""We are encouraged by his desire to engage in a process intended to achieve the true intent of the Mahele."" Democratic state Representative Kaniela Ing, who introduced legislation this month requiring people to enter mediation before filing quiet title lawsuits, thanked the Facebook executive. ""You now have an opportunity to set the bar for what being a good neighbour and an ally to indigenous peoples looks like,"" Mr Ing said in a statement.

474,Ley under pressure over New Year's Eve trips to Gold Coast,house-and-home,"  Sussan Ley under pressure over New Year's Eve trips to Gold Coast Labor has continued to call for Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley's resignation amid unanswered questions about more than a dozen taxpayer-funded flights to the Gold Coast, including trips around New Year's Eve in 2013 and 2014. Ms Ley charged taxpayers $655 for her flight to the tourist strip at the end of 2013, and a year later, after another Gold Coast New Year's Eve, she charged for her and her partner's flights back to Sydney. ABC News has analysed three years' worth of the minister's travel reports and found she travelled to the Gold Coast — where she and her partner own two properties — 20 times. Questions were put to Ms Ley's office about 18 trips, worth $53,877. The most expensive flight was a $12,365 charter flight taken in March 2015. The minister purchased an almost-$800,000 apartment on another $3,125 taxpayer-funded trip later that year. Ms Ley has agreed to partly pay back the cost of four trips, as well as two other accommodation claims on the Gold Coast and a flight. She declined an interview, but issued a statement apologising for the ""error of judgement"" and said it did ""not meet the high standards"" set by the Prime Minister. ""While attending an auction was not the reason for my visit to Queensland or the Gold Coast, I completely understand this changed the context of the travel undertaken,"" she said. ""The distinction between public and private business should be as clear as possible when dealing with taxpayers' money."" She said she had asked the Department of Finance to review all of her ministerial travel to the Gold Coast. Her office said in the statement: ""In her portfolio, she is required to undertake extensive meetings with doctors, patients and other organisations that are not media or public events."" Education Minister Simon Birmingham has defended his colleague, saying that ""extensive travel is of course a clear part of her responsibilities"". Federal politicians claimed more than $55 million in expenses over the second half of 2015, documents reveal. Senator Birmingham told the ABC he did not believe that Ms Ley had breached the Ministerial Code of Conduct. ""I appreciate nobody, nobody likes to have discussions about politicians' entitlements, pay, travel,"" he said. ""All of us have a very serious responsibility to make sure that what we do is within the rules. ""Of course we are working with the Government to implement a comprehensive review of the rules that was undertaken last year to make sure that they actually have far better arrangements in place in the future."" But Ms Ley's Opposition counterpart Catherine King has continued to question the flights, saying it would be unusual to have official business over New Year's Eve. ""This minister seems to really like the Gold Coast. For official business, that does seem a very high number of trips,"" she said. Ms King told the ABC that this was a test for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who she called on to enforce ministerial standards. ""Frankly, I don't think she's got any choice in that circumstance but to resign,"" she said. ""She hasn't provided an explanation of how this came about... If she's not willing to resign, I don't think Malcolm Turnbull has any choice but to step her down from the frontbench.""

475,Ley bought $800k unit from LNP donor on taxpayer-funded trip,house-and-home,"  Sussan Ley bought $800k unit from LNP donor on taxpayer-funded trip The almost-$800,000 investment property Health Minister Sussan Ley bought while on a taxpayer-funded trip to the Gold Coast was purchased from a Liberal National Party donor. Ms Ley purchased the property in May 2015 while travelling to Queensland on ministerial business, accompanied by her partner. The full cost of their trip was $3,125 — paid for by taxpayers. A spokesperson for Ms Ley said the purchase of the Surfers Paradise apartment ""was not planned nor anticipated"". Previous owner Martin Corkery confirmed the sale, but said he did not know that Ms Ley was among the potential buyers. Mr Corkery — who donated $50,000 to the Queensland LNP in 2011 — told ABC News he was overseas during the auction and only discovered the Minister had bought the unit once he received the contract. He said he had only met Ms Ley once, while the Coalition was in opposition. The property is described as an investment in Ms Ley's Register of Interests, where she has also declared a mortgage for the property. Federal politicians claimed more than $55 million in expenses over the second half of 2015, documents reveal. In a statement, a spokesperson for Ms Ley said she had travelled to Brisbane to announce health funding before meeting with ""local health stakeholders"" 80 kilometres away on the Gold Coast. ""Minister Ley's partner was invited to accompany her to a function in Sydney on the Friday evening,"" the statement read. ""He then travelled with the Minister to Queensland under family travel arrangements. ""The EMB [Entitlements Management Branch] was consulted at the time to confirm Ms Ley's partner's travel was within the rules."" The spokesperson also stated all travel undertaken ""was in accordance with the rules"". But Labor MP Catherine King has called for Ms Ley to explain further or hand in her resignation. Ms King told ABC News the Minister should also release her diary for the period. ""I think she's got some explaining to do, to explain how purchasing a luxury apartment with her [partner] is in any way, shape or form official business,"" she said. ""Frankly, if she can't, she needs to resign."" Ms King said while it remains unclear if Ms Ley broke any parliamentary rules, the purchase and its claimed nature did not pass the pub test. ""In anyone's world, $700,000-plus is a lot of money,"" she said. ""I don't know too many people who would spend that sort of money, even if they had it, on an impulse.

""If they [Ms Ley and her partner] made a purchase — even though I admit it's a substantial purchase — that is not the reason she went to the Gold Coast,"" he said. ""She went to the Gold Coast for work."" Ms Ley had the fourth highest expenditure during the period of the purchase — from January 1 to June 30, 2015 — including more than $105,000 on charter flights and $11,800 on family travel costs.

477,Hills Hoist hangs on as Aussie backyard icon,house-and-home,"  Hills Hoist ownership changes hands but iconic clothesline hangs on to its place in backyard culture While the company behind the Hills Hoist since 1945 announced this week that it was selling the rights to the iconic rotary clothesline, its firm place in Australian backyard culture will remain. The Hills Hoist was designed by Lance Hill of Adelaide after he returned from serving in World War II. Until then most people had hung their washing on static wooden clothes poles strung together with wire; they had to be regularly re-propped or replaced as the poles deteriorated in the weather. The Hills Hoist, on the other hand, could be raised and lowered and could even spin with the wind. ""What an amazing invention,"" cultural historian Grant Stone told 720 ABC Perth. While others had patented rotary clotheslines before the war, it was Hills' product, thanks in part to the timing, that captured the public's imagination. ""It was everything in the post-war boom that we wanted,"" Mr Stone said. ""To be successful, you needed the big block, you needed a house, and you needed all the accoutrements to run a family."" The Hills Hoist became an essential item in the classic suburban quarter-acre block. ""We had the space and we could do things differently to the rest of the world,"" Mr Stone said. ""Part of that was using the whole quarter acre to live in and play in. ""Who cares if half the backyard is taken up with some structure that we hang the washing on? ""It wasn't the kind of thing we needed to worry about."" In 2006 the National Library designated the Hills Hoist a National Treasure and recorded the immediate popularity of Hill's invention. He charged £10.10s — double the average weekly wage at the time — and was flooded with orders. The clothesline became an integral part of Australian backyards and eventually were used for many things other than hanging clothes out to dry. ""The Hills Hoist was not only an object that was working for the woman at home, but it was also a great play object in the backyard as well,"" Mr Stone said. A number of ABC Radio listeners shared their memories of the diverse uses for the Hills Hoist. ""Ours served as a big cubby house for birthday parties — great for hanging balloons on — and also as a summer tent,"" Jan said. ""We have twins (age 32 this year) and when they were little my brother-in-law attached their car seats to the Hills Hoist, strapped them in and swung them round. They loved it,"" Joan said. Flip shared the story of getting married under the Hills Hoist in her East Fremantle backyard in 1983. ""We painted it a green to match the lawn, put a green canvas on the top, hoisted it up, put hanging baskets under it and had the wedding table underneath the hoist. It was absolutely brilliant."" Norma from Bicton reported that her Hills Hoist, bought in 1955, was still in use after being restrung eight years ago. But despite its iconic status, sales of Hills Hoists have declined as suburban backyards shrink and more householders opt for fold-down clotheslines against a wall. And while the Hills company no longer makes the clotheslines, they will not disappear altogether. The company has sold all of the Hills home living brands to manufacturer AMES Australasia.

478,First home grant boost met with concern from WA property sector,house-and-home,"  Increase to first home buyers grant in WA could negatively impact market: REIWA president A $5,000 increase to WA's first home owners grant for buyers purchasing new properties has been met with ambivalence by potential buyers and concern from the property sector and sustainability experts. The Government, Opposition, and building industry all welcomed the announcement that the first home owners grant would increase from $10,000 to $15,000 for the year of 2017. It was one of two changes made — along with increased income eligibility for its Keystart loan scheme — and together has been predicted to provide more than 3,000 extra jobs within the construction industry, with income then flowing into WA's ""soft"" economy. But president of the Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Hayden Groves said while he understood the Government's need to protect the construction industry, he was worried it could be at a detriment to the property market. ""As an institute we're a little concerned that the gap between established property and new property for first home buyers is getting larger,"" he said. ""$15,000 is a significant amount of money. ""Established property in areas that are traditionally first home buyers territory will no longer be as appealing, or even less appealing as they already are, and it will therefore add to additional supply onto the market, which you can argue we probably don't need in this current market cycle."" Mr Groves said the institute would like to see the same incentive given to first home buyers purchasing existing homes. ""The positive side of it is it does bring more buyers into the market and so you do end up with more activity,"" he said. ""Over time the first home buyer becomes the secondary buyer. ""But certainly the immediate impact could be a downward pressure on the median house price in Perth."" Baby boomer business reporter Andrew Robertson explains why he thinks it is still a good idea for Gen Y to buy a house. Mr Groves also said it could potentially affect the state's already slumped rental market. ""Rental listings are sitting at around 10,500 — at levels not seen in Perth before,"" he said. ""There's very sluggish activity in the rental sector."" He said while activity was picking up — with rental properties now more affordable — more first home buyers entering the market would mean less people renting. ""So it could also impact further on an already under pressure rental sector, and mean further reductions in rental prices,"" he said. ""Which could certainly increase the rental stock on the market and therefore the vacancy rate."" Twenty-five-year-old engineer Emily Kendall from Balcatta said she was looking at buying her first home in the near future. But regardless of the increased sweetener from the Government, she said she would prefer to buy an existing home. ""For the most part where you can build new places these days is really far away from the city,"" she said. ""I work in the city and I don't want to make that really long commute every day."" It would mean she would only be able to access a potential discount on her stamp duty, but for her the incentive on buying land and building was not worth it. ""I'm not so interested in the effort and the time,"" she said. ""The building is going to take another few years and I'm interested in the next year actually purchasing a place."" And it is not just the prospect of building on the fringes which is putting young buyers off. Katelyn Mewburn, 28, from Claremont, said she hoped to buy and renovate an old house in an inner city suburb rather than buying off a plan. ""A lot of my close friends have had really poor experiences with buying off the plan with apartment living,"" she said. ""We have had a lot of apartments going up in the last year and I don't see the quality of build being that great."" Professor of Sustainability at Curtin University Peter Newman said he saw the increase as a political stunt in the lead up to the state election in March next year. ""It's quite a lot of money being put out there but it is just another subsidy for urban sprawl,"" he said. ""The reality is you cannot continue to say it's affordable to live 80 kilometres north of Perth. ""It costs so much to live there because you're travelling all the time."" He said instead there should be more focus on redevelopment closer to the city. ""That doesn't mean high rise apartments right in the city, it means in the middle ring, within 15 to 20 minutes of the city,"" he said. ""There's plenty of opportunities there but we're not getting any Government assistance to make that happen."" Professor Newman said the Government could no longer afford to keep subsidising urban sprawl. ""The new housing that's being developed on the fringes are the ghettos of the future,"" he said. ""Because they are getting poorer and poorer.""

479,"Extra $5,000 for first home buyers in bid to kickstart WA economy",house-and-home,"  First home buyers to get extra $5,000 for WA new builds in bid to kickstart economy The first home owners grant for West Australian buyers purchasing new properties will increase from $10,000 to $15,000 in the new year, the State Government has announced. The money is only available to people buying newly constructed homes, after the Government scrapped the grant for existing properties in 2013. And the $5,000 boost will only apply for one year. Premier Colin Barnett said the increase was aimed giving the state's slowing economy a ""kick along"" while helping people to get on the property ladder. ""We estimate [the increase] will allow perhaps another 650 people to enter into the first home owners market, obviously good for the industry and good for jobs,"" he said. ""The cost of that is estimated at around $45 million."" The number of first home owner grants paid in WA peaked in June 2009 at 2,419, but the figure dropped to 776 grants by April 2016. Small Business Minister Sean L'Estrange said he was confident the extra money was sufficient to entice would-be first home buyers into the market. ""We've noticed over the past two financial years that the number of people taking on a new home has been dropping,"" he said. ""There's going to be a number of people out there, this [increase] will be point where they now go 'we can get the deposit quicker. We can go and make that decision on a home quicker'."" Baby boomer business reporter Andrew Robertson explains why he thinks it is still a good idea for Gen Y to buy a house. The Government has also increased the income eligibility for its Keystart loan scheme from $70,000 to $90,000 for singles, and $95,000 to $115,000 combined income for couples. Mr L'Estrange said the measures would be a real boost to the ""soft"" WA economy amid predictions 1,000 new homes would be built throughout the year and more than 3,000 extra jobs created. ""Because when those tradies ... go out and spend their income in the local cafes and shops it supports other small businesses. So this money flows through the economy,"" he said. The Master Builders Association of WA (MBAWA) and the Housing Industry Association (HIA) welcomed the higher grant. MBAWA executive director Michael McLean said the sector had been struggling over the past 12 months. ""We think the housing industry has bottomed and what it needs now is a stimulus to get it back up and gain some momentum,"" he said. ""We've gone from a record high of about 31,000 dwellings to about 24,500 in this last financial year and that's predicted to fall below 20,000. ""What we're finding is that there's traffic through display homes ... but people are not able to access the finance."" A report by the HIA last month warned the state's building industry was facing a second year of steep falls in the number of new homes being built. It said the number of new homes built in WA fell 19 per cent in the 12 months to June and was expected to fall a further 22 per cent this financial year.

480,Green thumbs help woman after letter lambasts 'deplorable' garden,house-and-home,"  Green thumbs rally to support woman lambasted over 'deplorable' front yard Green-thumbed good samaritans have come to the aid of a Victorian woman who received an anonymous letter, taking aim at her ""deplorable"" front yard. Last week, Ebony Ackroyd received a letter in her mailbox, warning her to ""shape up or ship out"" of her Hamilton neighbourhood over a lack of shrubs. ""Just take a walk up the street and observe every house — there's none in the deplorable, lazy state of yours,"" the letter read. ""If you and your husband can afford fancy haircuts, then you can damn well afford six shrubs."" The abusive missive sparked an outpouring of support on social media for the Ackroyd family, and their ""deplorable"" garden. Some people sent letters of support and even a hamper ahead of Christmas. Now, family, friends and the Hamilton community have taken things a step further, combining money and manpower to overhaul the maligned front yard. ""It's just insane how much support we have received,"" Ms Ackroyd said. ""I never expected it to get this much attention to be honest."" Ms Ackroyd said the garden was still a work in progress, but some bold ideas had been put forward. ""We're keeping the tyres,"" she laughed. ""My uncle has actually offered to make some swans out of them."" Despite the attention the letter received, its author is still unknown. Ms Ackroyd said while she would welcome an apology, above all, she hopes the culprit will think twice before pulling a similar stunt again. ""We had started working on the garden in November, but my son fell ill and we had to go to Ballarat for his appointments,"" she said. ""When we got back, the whole family came down with gastro — and that's when we received the letter. ""So you just never know what someone is going through."" She said it was important not to judge a book by its cover. ""We have had a pretty rough time lately, so that [the letter] was just the icing on the cake,"" she said. ""I hope this makes people think about what they are doing, and how that may affect other people.""

481,'Christmas Grinch' sparks stoush over shrubs,house-and-home,"  Woman warned to 'shape up or ship out' in garden etiquette letter A Victorian woman has been warned to ""shape up or ship out"" of her suburban Hamilton neighbourhood over her ""deplorable"" front garden. In a letter that could have easily been used as a plotline from television show Desperate Housewives, one anonymous resident has taken aim at Ebony Ackroyd for her lack of shrubs. The family received the letter in the mail box on Wednesday and initially thought it was a Christmas card. ""Just take a walk up [the street] and observe every house, there's none in the deplorable, lazy state as yours,"" the letter read. ""Your front yard is the worst, a disgrace to both you and your husband."" The letter said that with ""a little imagination"" Ms Ackroyd and her partner could have a garden more in line with the ""neighbourhood's standards"". ""Look, all you need is six shrubs along the front,"" the letter continued. ""If you and your husband can afford fancy haircuts, then you can damn well afford six shrubs."" The letter also takes aim at Ms Ackroyd's partner for ""never doing any work"" and finishes with the words ""shape up or ship out"". There is no signature. Ms Ackroyd said she would not let the 'Christmas Grinch' get the best of her. ""My mum had the idea of getting six cardboard cut out shrubs and sticking them in the garden,"" she laughed. ""Maybe we will put a 'please stop here Santa' sign out the front with 'please leave me six shrubs' on it."" The family has no idea who might have sent the letter as all their immediate neighbours have been very supportive. Ms Ackroyd said she had received letters, phone calls and even a Christmas hamper from Good Samaritans in the Hamilton community. ""I just broke into tears, everyone has been so lovely,"" she said. ""I was afraid to go out in my garden for a few days, but not anymore."" She said the ordeal had become a running joke among many of the street's residents. ""We're all going to have to get shrubs now,"" she laughed.

482,Housesitting retirees get comfy with other people's homes ... and pets,house-and-home,"  Housesitting retirees get comfy with other people's homes ... and pets South Australian retirees Stan and Carole Thomson are holidaying for free, using housesitting jobs to travel to the places they have always wanted to visit. Since the couple, from South Australia's south-east, signed up with two housesitting sites in 2015, they have been on location for about five months and estimate they have saved substantially on accommodation costs. ""When we came to retire, that was our aim, to become housesitters. I was fascinated that you could do this,"" Ms Thomson said. Now, with only petrol or flight costs and a few little extras, the Thomsons are travelling the country without the burden of hefty hotel bills. So far, the couple have been on eight housesitting jaunts, including at Moruya and Batemans Bay in New South Wales, Daylesford, Bright and Inverloch in Victoria and also Berri in South Australia's Riverland. ""What I do is always look at the destinations — places I've always wanted to go,"" Mr Thomson said, adding that the couple were eagerly looking for their first international posting. ""No money changes hands. We're having the responsibility of looking after pets and gardens and homes, but also being able to explore the region. ""I think they are looking for our motives; the question isn't asked blatantly but people want to know why we want to housesit."" Luckily, all the Thomsons' jobs have been trouble-free, but there are plenty of housesitting horror stories to be found online including one American housesitter busted making an extra buck out of the home he was left in charge of. Both in their 60s, the Thomsons believe their age is definitely an asset in the housesitting world, where life experience and reliability rates more highly than youth. ""Most people are looking for credibility and trustworthiness,"" Mr Thomson said. ""Not much throws us; we can cope with emergency situations or anything that comes up,"" Ms Thomson added. The Thomsons' love of gardening, advertised on their profile, was called into question at one job, a three-week stint at a property at Bright in Victoria. ""We thought we were in seventh heaven, until the owner said, 'one final thing — can you look after my pumpkins?'"" Mr Thomson said. The Thomsons ended up tending to an enormous vegetable garden and even harvesting a vast pumpkin patch, as per the owners request. ""I was a bit daunted by it all, as much as I love gardening. The house looked like it was out of Home and Beautiful,"" Ms Thomson said. ""I must admit, I was a bit paranoid about picking the pumpkins. I'd go out every day and tap them to make sure they were okay."" One of the main reasons people employ a housesitter is to look after their animals, whether it be a goldfish or a grumpy old Labrador. Aside from an antisocial bunny, the Thomsons said they had always been able to ""win over"" their animal charges, and said sometimes it was hard to leave them. ""There was a couple we fell in love with and would really like to have brought home with us,"" Ms Thomson said. In fact, the Thomsons became so enamoured with two dogs, Rocco and Russell, at one job in New South Wales, they refer to them as ""their dogs"". ""The family do get a bit yawny when we bring out the phone with all the dog photos on it,"" Ms Thomson said. At some jobs, the couple have been presented with detailed pet portfolios, which may be amusing reading at first but are essential when it comes to interacting with an unknown animal. ""When you are walking a dog, you need to know if a child approaches, can that child pat it? Are they aggressive to other dogs? You need to be sure you are safe and other people are safe,"" Ms Thomson said. At one home, Mr Thomson said they were told the resident mutt liked to sleep on the owner's bed. Going in to give it a pat one day, they found out the hard way that some dogs do not appreciate newcomers to their territory. ""The dog leapt up and it bared its teeth. I was genuinely scared. It was obviously very protective of the mistress's domain, but that same dog would skulk out later and demand a pat,"" he said. Mr Thomson said the couple would not hesitate to turn down jobs involving animals they did not think they were suited for. ""If they write in the ad: 'Fluffy will insist on sleeping in your bed' and you can't handle it, don't apply for it and kick Fluffy out because trust me, Fluffy will tell on you,"" he said. The Thomsons said they had often been surprised and delighted by the trust bestowed on them by complete strangers. At one job, the homeowner's grandchildren stopped in after school to say 'hi' and the Thomsons were told at several jobs to invite their own family to stay. At one housesit in Berri, which had a very self-sufficient cat to look after, the couple felt free to get out of the house for long walks and explore their temporary location. ""That was daunting at first but we loved it. We really got into the community and met people,"" Ms Thomson said. They said the people they once knew as ""jobs"" have since become firm friends. ""It becomes like a little network. They become your friends, you start sending them Christmas cards and things like that,"" Mr Thomson said. ""And if they feel you've done a good job, they'll sign you straight back up next time. ""I like that. This trust between strangers. It is a beautiful thing.""

483,Prepping your home securely for the Christmas break,house-and-home,"  Preparing your home security to avoid a Christmas holiday break-in Heading away for the Christmas holidays? Here are a few ways to make your home less attractive to burglars. The majority of break-ins occur through a method called shake and break, with loose-fitting window and doors frames providing easy access. ""They give the door a rattle, the window a rattle,"" Handyman Magazine editor Adam Woodhams told 891 ABC Adelaide's Mornings program. ""If it looks like an easy way to get in, they'll get in that way."" Mr Woodhams said windows on the side or rear of a home, hidden from the street, should be fitted with locks. ""They're the easiest way for someone to gain access and then they can open the door from inside."" He said locks would not stop someone from breaking a window but they might deter an opportunistic thief. If you have had windows broken before, Mr Woodhams recommended fitting security-grade laminate to hold the glass in place. ""If you're making it a little bit harder, they're just going to pass on your property and move on to the next one."" Mr Woodhams said many locks and other items that could improve your home's security were quite simple to retrofit. ""You can buy packs of window locks to suit that you can put on any kind of window or sliding door that previously were hard to secure."" He said timers on lights were not a new idea, but newer computerised timers and apps could help keep your home looking lived in. ""Computerised tap timers can be a great way to make your garden look fresh and like someone is looking after it. ""I recently ran across a fantastic one that is actually programmable from your smartphone."" Mr Woodhams said there were also new motion sensor spotlights that contained a HD camera, a speaker and high-intensity LEDs that could be remotely operated. ""It automatically turns the camera on and sends an SMS to your phone and you can then look at who has just walked into the area,"" he said. Mr Woodhams said in this digital age everything from business records to personally memories were now stored on computers, but computers could be lost through theft or fire. ""It is so easy to preserve all of these materials on an external hard drive,"" he said. Run back-ups regularly and before heading off on holidays make sure you store your drive at a separate location. ""If the worst happens, you know that you have all of those files,"" he said.

484,Adelaide's East End to be home to city's tallest tower,house-and-home,"  Adelaide's tallest tower gets approval as part of CBD development The green light has been given for developers to build Adelaide's tallest tower, a 134-metre-high hotel and apartment building on Frome Street in the East End. Part of the Kyren Group's Frome Central project, the 34-storey tower will sit next to a 21-storey student accommodation building between Rundle Street and North Terrace. The tower will come in 2 metres higher than Westpac House, which has been Adelaide's tallest building since 1988. Project manager Steven Kotzias said it was a great opportunity for the city's East End. ""This is a unique opportunity to lead Adelaide's CBD into a new era, and with a tramline extension down North Terrace, the future Old Royal Adelaide Hospital regeneration, we believe it's a much-needed boost for the city,"" he said. ""It's a building and an opportunity to lead Adelaide ... into an era of height and will really be an extension of the city's skyline."" The developers said work would start first on the student building next year, with the taller tower due for completion by 2019. The latter will be made up of a hotel, serviced short-stay apartments and residential apartments. Mr Kotzias was confident the ""premium residential product"" would be in demand. The Development Assessment Commission granted the project approval this week.

485,Gen Y couple think outside the box to enter housing market,house-and-home,"  Gen Y couple take non-traditional route to home ownership Peter and Cassie Thomson had grown weary of opening up the real estate section of their local newspaper each weekend. ""It was overwhelming,"" Mr Thomson, in his mid 20s, admits. ""Buying a house is one of those things you're almost 'supposed' to do,"" Cassie Thomson added. ""Yet there was no way we could do it.  It can be very hard, even if you are frugal."" After months of frustration, the young couple decided to think outside the box. Their solution was to borrow — not money from their parents — but a piece of land on the corner of the family house block. ""We bought a transportable home,"" Cassie said. The home was then ""home delivered"" from a nearby factory. ""I got a call one day from my dad, he said 'your house has arrived',"" Ms Thomson said. It was delivered on the back of two semitrailers. ""He sent me a photo of a truck with half a house on it,"" she said. ""There was plastic over each side, and I remember looking through the plastic thinking 'cool, there's my kitchen rolling down the road'."" The couple said living on the same block of land was not the same as moving back in with the parents. They are just sharing a valuable resource. ""We're close enough to borrow milk,"" Mr Thomson said. ""I grew up in Japan, and we've often talked about the very western concept to separate from your relatives, and live completely separate lives,"" Ms Thomson said. ""It's common in other parts of the world where the whole extended family stay together in a communal living situation. ""It's a different kind of normal."" The council rates have gone up with a second dwelling onsite, but the two couples split the bill. ""It makes it cheaper for everyone,"" Ms Thomson said. ""This gives us the flexibility we need without having to fork out money we didn't have."" The plight of first-time home buyers was highlighted when social commentator Bernard Salt suggested young Australians should be spending less on cafe breakfasts and saving for a home deposit. ""It honestly wouldn't have mattered how many smashed avocados we didn't eat because a bank deposit is so much money, and then you have to afford the repayments,"" Mr Thomson said. ""That's hard with the type of normal jobs us 20-year-olds have. ""So now we can have smashed avo, with bacon!"" Ms Thomson said. The Thomson's home has a number of telltale signs it is non-traditional. The two halves are joined down the middle. ""It's very symmetrical,"" Ms Thomson said. ""There's a beam that goes across the top, and right down the walls as well, so you can see where they've stuck it together.  But I think of it like skirting."" ""But really, it's exactly like a normal house.  It just happens that we can pick it up and move it,"" Peter added. The couple said one of the side-benefits of owning a transportable home was less moving related stress. ""Every time you move it can be stressful,"" Ms Thomson said. ""We have lived in several rental homes, and you have to figure out where all your furniture fits, and what you can keep and reorganise all of your space.  So there's comfort in knowing how we fit into this space. ""All we have to do is find grass."" With their house in hand, and ready to move anywhere, the couple is a little more relaxed when it now comes time to look at the real estate pages again. ""Now all we think about is 'which way will our house be pointing on the land?'"" Cassie said. ""It's different, but cool.""

486,Iconic Australian Houses on display in Canberra amid 'world of renovation',house-and-home,"  Iconic Australian Houses on display in Canberra represent antithesis in 'world of renovation' Some of the nation's most artistically significant homes have gone on show in a new multimedia exhibition at the National Archives of Australia in Canberra. Iconic Australian Houses was originally commissioned as two books by publisher Murdoch Books. But thanks to Sydney Living Museums and the Architecture Foundation of Australia, the collection later became an exhibition, which first went on show at the Museum of Sydney. The exhibition has since travelled to regional centres including Dubbo, Port Macquarie, Newcastle and Wagga Wagga. It includes still photos of residences, 2D and 3D plans, architectural models and video interviews with architects and home owners. Curator Karen McCartney said there was only one apartment, located in Surry Hills, among the collection of mostly stand-alone houses from every jurisdiction except South Australia and the Northern Territory. ""The word iconic has become very overplayed,"" Ms McCartney said. ""Everything is iconic these days, but I did have a very strict criteria for houses to live up to that term."" Ms McCartney said that criteria included the home exterior and interior being intact. ""We live in a world of renovation,"" Ms McCartney said. ""It is hard to find things that haven't been altered and where interiors match the exterior. ""They had to reflect the original intent of the architect."" Designs also must have broken new ground architecturally at the time and be conceptually interesting. ""Many are modest houses, particularly post-war, where architects showed ingenuity and responded to the landscape,"" Ms McCartney said. ""They are not necessarily showy houses."" Properties appearing in the exhibition must also have been designed by significant architects, like Enrico Taglietti who designed Dingle House in the Canberra suburb of Hughes. The Dingle House takes its name from the surname of the home's first owner in the mid 1960s. It is the only ACT residence to feature in the book and exhibition. ""I feel like the grandfather of it,"" Mr Taglietti said. ""The house was designed as a one-off for the owner. The number of bedrooms didn't matter."" Mr Taglietti has designed around 50 Canberra properties, including a library, four schools, four embassies, the Old Sunset Cinema, storage for the Australian War Memorial and one church. Mr Taglietti, now aged 90, continues to design but said he lamented the state of contemporary design in the ACT. ""Canberra now has too many rules and design is being totally driven by profit rather than dreams,"" he said. Mr Taglietti originally left Milan in Italy and arrived in Australia in 1955 to curate an exhibition in Sydney. He was only expecting to visit for six weeks but he ended up making a life in Canberra after falling in love with the location. ""The silence, natural light and the blank slate,"" Mr Taglietti said. ""It was a time when everyone was hoping that Canberra would become the most liveable city in the world. ""There was a much bolder vision for Canberra then."" Mr Taglietti said that bold vision related to Canberra being controlled at the time by the Federal Government, before the territory was established.

487,Federal Court denies Hocking Stuart Richmond extra time to pay up,house-and-home,"  Federal Court judge brings hammer down on Hocking Stuart Richmond over fine payment A Federal Court judge has knocked back an attempt by real estate firm Hocking Stuart Richmond to draw out payment of a $330,000 fine for misleading and deceptive conduct. In October, the company was found guilty of deliberately underquoting on 11 properties it listed for sale in Richmond and Kew from January 2014 to mid-2015 in a case brought by Consumer Affairs Victoria (CAV). Hocking Stuart Richmond (HSR) was also ordered to pay $80,000 in legal costs. CAV sought payment of the fine in four instalments over two years and then granted additional time for HSR to pay the legal costs. But court documents revealed the company argued ""that an order to this effect would render Hocking Stuart Richmond insolvent and would be oppressive"". It wanted four years to pay the fine and costs. But Justice John Middleton refused the company's request. ""This is an excessively long period of time,"" he said in the ruling. ""The potential incapacity of a contravener to pay a pecuniary penalty should not limit the principal objective of general deterrence."" While Justice John Middleton accepted that ""for a company the size of Hocking Stuart Richmond, the penalty imposed by the court of $330,000.00 was a substantial penalty"", he also noted the need to ensure the court sent a message of deterrence. ""In my view, an instalment arrangement over such a long period risks diminishing the general deterrent effect of the imposition of a penalty,"" the judge said. Under the terms of the ruling, the company must also post a prominent public notice on its websites and in real estate publications announcing the outcome of the Federal Court action. ""Price is an essential piece of information about the property being offered for sale for prospective buyers,"" Justice Middleton said in his October ruling. ""Buyers should be able to rely on correct information to make an informed decision."" The documents revealed the director of Hocking Stuart Richmond, Peter Perrignon, has mortgaged his home as a result of the court action. In a statement the company said: ""We look forward to moving on and working hard for our valued clients.""

489,Couple wins right to keep tiny house in backyard of Brisbane property,house-and-home,"  Couple wins right to keep tiny house in backyard of larger Brisbane property A Brisbane couple living in a tiny house on wheels has won the right to keep their home in the backyard of an inner city property. In a landmark decision, the Queensland Building and Development Dispute Resolution Committee ruled tiny homes with wheels should be treated like caravans and thus do not require a building permit. Lara Nobel and Andrew Carter were facing the prospect of having to move following a complaint from a neighbour and a decision by the Brisbane City Council that their tiny home required a building permit to stay on site. ""It's not a fixed structure so you can't get a building approval for it,"" Ms Nobel said. The pint-sized house, measuring a compact 18 square metres of floor space, comes with a self-composting toilet and a demountable deck — all of which can be moved within a few hours as it sits on a registered trailer. The couple built and designed their home, and have been living at their current address for about seven months. A month ago, they were joined by baby daughter, Charlie. Mr Carter said it was a huge relief to know they could stay. ""This is one of the very few ways we can achieve home ownership anywhere near the city in a way that suits us,"" he said. ESC Consulting environmental planner Rikki Pieters, who helped the couple with their appeal, said the decision was a significant win for this type of housing model. ""If you required the tiny house on wheels to have a building permit, basically you would be attaching that dwelling to the land and you would need to go through the planning process similar to if it was a granny flat or a secondary dwelling,"" she said. But there is still a legal hitch — in Queensland it is not always legal to live inside a caravan in a backyard. ""On the Gold Coast they prohibit it, in Moreton Bay Regional Council you can do it but there are a lot of rules that you need to follow,"" Ms Pieters said. On the Sunshine Coast a permit is required for anyone wanting to live in a caravan in a backyard beyond four weeks in any calendar year. While living in backyard caravans is currently legal in Brisbane, that could soon change. Lord Mayor Graham Quirk said the situation would be reviewed as the regulations needed to be uniform on tiny homes. ""I don't think we want to see these splattered all over the city, but nonetheless it provides an opportunity if people are trying to get into a first home ownership situation. It provides them with a stepping stone, so to speak,"" he said. Valerie Bares from ESC Consulting said the tiny housing model potentially had a big future. ""The State Government has released its regional plan and wants to increase density and this is a great option,"" she said.

490,Decorate without plastic for Christmas,house-and-home,"  Plastic-free Christmas decorating leads to sharing and saving memories Christmas is a time for indulgence for many, and also a time of great wastage with throwaway decorations sold in huge numbers each year. The Carter family avoid plastics as much as they can with a zero-waste philosophy to life, and Christmas is no exception. ""Most of our decorations we've had for quite a few years and we add one or two each year,"" Lauren Carter said. ""Usually we make them ourselves or we're given some and they're generally made of wood or something compostable. ""We use a lot of old fabrics and things that we have lying around and make the most of them."" Making Christmas decorations is now a family tradition for the Carters' three children. They start in November by making a paper advent calendar. Inside each day of the calendar is an activity for the family to do that day. ""One of my favourite activities is going out to see the Christmas lights out the front of people's houses ... it's so fun,"" 13-year-old Audrey said. Another activity is finding and putting up the Christmas tree. ""We have a day that we go and collect a Christmas tree, which is usually a weed tree growing outside of a [forestry] plantation,"" Ms Carter said. The tree will be decorated with things the children have made and special ornaments from family members and friends. ""[Making decorations is] a lovely way to mark how the kids have grown,"" Ms Carter said. ""You can see their little handprints in things and remember making them together."" ""It's really nice to have those memories and talk about them each year."" The decorations include pompoms made from leftover fabric, handmade clay shapes and simple craft items like stitched hearts and stuffed dolls. As well as making decorations from reusable or compostable materials, the Carters avoid waste with their present wrapping. ""We use fabric for wrapping rather than paper because we can use them over and over again,"" Ms Carter said. ""We have some basic plain white cloths and then we decorate those with [coloured fabric]."" One of Audrey's favourite decorations has no chance of going to waste. ""I love doing the gingerbread house,"" she said. ""Mum will make the gingerbread house and then we'll get bulk lollies from somewhere and decorate it. ""Then it's usually just left out for people to feast on it as they walk by."" The only thing the Carters have not been able to source yet are plastic-free Christmas lights. ""It's pretty hard to find lights without plastic,"" Ms Carter said. ""You can get some nice copper wire ones that I think Audrey would like, but we haven't had lights for a while.""

491,Off-grid paradise complete with grapes in the bathroom,house-and-home,"  Off-grid paradise in Tasmania comes complete with grapes growing in the bathroom The Judges' house in Saltwater River in south-east Tasmania is not like most others. Aside from the 50 or so skinks living in the bathroom, the 21st century-built home boasts 1830s courthouse doors, timber poles that once stood at the Queens Domain and old windows from the Royal Hobart Hospital. ""Everything has a story in this house,"" Dave Judge told Helen Shield on 936 ABC Hobart. When Dave and his wife Zoe decided to build the house they did not have much money, but they did have a lot of imagination. ""We had hands and ideas so we thought let's put those things together,"" Zoe said. The finished product is a unique home that is off the grid, relying on solar power and passive heating and cooling. But perhaps the most interesting room in the house is the bathroom, which doubles as a greenhouse and conservatory. ""It's just a nice living space,"" Zoe said. ""I think conservatories and sunrooms are almost essential in the Tassie climate; they're such a liveable space year round. ""It makes a lot of sense to have it as part of your house design and to grow plants in it. It was a no-brainer for us."" In the bathroom they grow figs and a few varieties of grapes which help keep the room shaded in summer. They also have cardamom, aloe vera and a range of succulents — and of course a shower, sink and bath tub. The one thing you will not find in the bathroom is a toilet. That is outside. ""It's only Tasmania. It's not completely Arctic here,"" Dave said about cold nights walking to the outhouse. Outside of the bathroom, the Judges have built a garden nursery on their property. They also have honey bees and a few chooks. ""We feel like we've created our home and our paradise,"" Zoe said. ""If we can earn an income from here, that would be great.""

492,Perth's urban sprawl causing transport and jobs woes,house-and-home,"  Perth's urban sprawl causing transport and jobs woes for northern suburbs residents A West Australian council has made a pre-election plea for more jobs and infrastructure to service its rapidly expanding northern suburbs. The City of Wanneroo says its unemployment rate has climbed to 8.5 percent, and three out of five residents faced long commutes because of a lack of local employment and limited public transport. Its campaign came as planners stepped up their push to rein in Perth's urban sprawl, with the city's footprint growing to 120 kilometres long along the coast. The Nicholls family moved to Allara, one of Perth's newest estates on the northern fringe, a few weeks ago and says living well outside the heart of Perth was worth the trouble. Louise Nicholls said it took her about an hour door-to-door to drive to Butler station and then take the train to work at Princess Margaret Hospital in inner Perth. ""Coming from the UK, you get used to that long commute anyway,"" Mrs Nicholls said. ""But it depends what you are prepared to put in and this was really worthwhile. ""Our land is a little bigger, our house is a bit more comfortable, we don't feel as couped up or too close to anybody, we've got a bit more space."" Neighbour, Lisa Casey and her family, who are originally from London, moved to Allara because it was affordable and near the beach. ""It was cheap, the package was brilliant, we got the first home-buyers grant and [the developer] offered us another bonus on top and it included solar power and security and you get all your flowers done out the front,"" she told the ABC. ""I like being out in the bush, near the beach, it's Australia."" The 47-year-old's husband is a fly-in-fly-out chef, but she had struggled to find work and believed there should be more local opportunities. ""There's not enough work in the area,"" Ms Casey said. ""There are a few shops in Butler but for the amount of people living between Butler and say Two Rocks, we need more jobs."" City of Wanneroo mayor Tracey Roberts has called on the State Government and the Opposition to commit to extending the rail line to Yanchep, and the freeway to Romeo Road in Alkimos as a way of stimulating local businesses. ""We're desperately looking for another 100,000 jobs for City of Wanneroo community members so that they can engage with their community and enjoy where they live rather than have the log jam on the freeway, maybe an hour and a half each way,"" she said. ""That takes a huge chunk of time out of people's daily life and then you have children spending more time in the back seats of the car rather than in their gardens and parks."" Authorities said 8,000 new residents have been moving to the area each year. Curtin University Sustainability professor, Peter Newman, supports more public transport but said Perth was sprawling too far. ""We still have a tendency to prefer development on the fringe and say that's it's good because it's cheap,"" Professor Newman said. ""But it's not cheap for the city, it's very expensive. ""We estimate that for every new block on the fringe, it costs more than $100,000 in subsidies that government agencies provide to enable that block to be developed."" Professor Newman has called for a taskforce to be dedicated to assisting councils to redevelop sites for infill precincts in the inner suburbs that are close to services. Labor has pledged to build the rail line to Yanchep by 2021-22. The State Government said it would outline timeframes for all significant transport projects, including the extension of the train line to Yanchep, towards the end of the year. Under the Government's draft ""Perth and Peel@3.5 million"" land use plan , the rail service to Yanchep would happen before the population of Perth reaches 2.7 million.

493,How a young family with a baby live in an 18-square-metre house,house-and-home,"  How a young Brisbane family with a baby live in an 18-square-metre tiny house A movement is emerging towards smaller and more sustainable homes, as the dream of buying a house increasingly becomes out of reach for most young people in Australia. The tiny house movement is well established in the United States, where it grew steadily in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, but is a fledgling idea in Australia. The houses are not much bigger than a caravan, but have been providing a small growing rebellion to Australia's McMansion housing trend. Lara Noble and Andrew Carter built their freestanding tiny house in a friend's backyard in Red Hill, within walking distance of Brisbane's CBD. They rent the land and brought in the tiny house, which they designed themselves. Ms Noble said they could never have afforded to buy a standard house so near the centre of the city, where they needed to be for their work as an architect and carpenter. ""We started over a year ago scheming about the idea of building a tiny house,"" Ms Noble said. 'We've had heaps of support too from the community in legitimising tiny houses, which is really exciting at the moment."" And putting their minimalist living ideals to the ultimate test, they have just added a new addition to their tiny house in the form of Charlie, their four-week-old daughter. ""I think she's loving it. It's hard to know yet, she's too young to speak,"" Ms Noble said. Mr Carter said they hope to show there are alternatives to the lifetime mortgage, and energy-sucking homes in Australia's growing urban sprawl. ""When Charlie's two or three years old that will really test this form of housing for ourselves,"" Mr Carter said. ""We're under no illusion that this will suit the three of us forever. ""But at the moment it's perfect and for a lot of people at a certain point in their lives its perfect. ""We're following in the footsteps of a lot of people especially in the US — they're miles ahead of Australia in tiny houses. ""Tiny dwellings are nothing new. ""It's often portrayed as this new sort of craze but living in small spaces used to the norm and we've lost our way in Australia."" While it may be only 18 square metres inside — about the size of two car parking spaces — Mr Carter said the tiny house was much more than a shed. ""It's confined to two and half metres wide so it can travel on the road without special permits,"" he said. ""The kitchen's running down one side (of the house), on the other side there's a foldout bench to become a dining table or a desk you can bring chairs in for a lounge,"" Mr Carter said. ""Down the end there is as close as we can get to a full bathroom, so the shower is bigger than most of the showers we had in share houses. ""We wanted to have as nice a house as we could afford and our solution on our budget was to make the house very small and still fit it out with nice things."" ""To make it feel wider we've put the deck — a demountable deck which you can assemble like a Meccano set — off to the side. ""The windows are aligned and there's high louvres to get really good cross and stack ventilation in the space … it's really responsive if you want to cool it down quickly."" Even the bed has some space-age appointments to make the most of the limited space. ""There's a remote control and we push a button and the bed will drop down (from the roof),"" Mr Carter said. ""And it squeezes between the paintings on the walls and the pictures and drops down onto the lounge.""

494,Push to make Byron Bay rentals 100 per cent pet-friendly,house-and-home,"  Campaign to make Byron Bay Australia's first 100 per cent pet-friendly rental town Animal activists are campaigning to make Byron Bay Australia's first town offering pet-friendly accommodation for all renters. Figures from the RSPCA show that in July 2016, only about 4 per cent of advertised rentals Australia-wide were pet-friendly. Byron Bay campaign leader Karen Justice said just 1 per cent of available rentals in the tourist hotspot allowed pets. ""I've been on both sides of the fence; I've been a tenant and was treated quite harshly as a result of owning animals,"" she said. ""And I'm also now an investment property owner in a strata complex and I'm not permitted to allow pets in my own property."" It is a problem familiar to Byron Shire resident Alana Price who was recently given 30 days notice to vacate her home of two years because the owner wanted to rent it out to tourists over summer. Ms Price, who owns a Staffordshire bull terrier, was on the verge of moving into a tent before finding a dog-friendly rental outside the Shire. ""We were preparing to live in a tent, but there's only one campsite in this area that is pet-friendly and we enquired there but it's pet-friendly to every dog except Staffordshire bull terriers,"" she said. ""I would sooner live on the street than drop my dog at the pound, she's my little fur baby. ""We would have had to camp in a friend's backyard and then give the dog away to a friend who could've looked after her."" Emeritus Professor Jacquie Rand, executive director and chief scientist with the Australian Pet Welfare Foundation, said her research with the RSPCA showed about 20,000 pets were euthanased across the country each year because their owners could not find suitable rental accommodation. ""People have an idea that it's the behaviour of the pet that leads to surrender, but our research shows overwhelmingly it's personal challenges for the owner,"" Dr Rand said. ""And the number one reason for cats is lack of pet-friendly accommodation and a very prominent one for dogs is also lack of accommodation."" Real Estate Institute of New South Wales deputy president Brett Hunter said the low percentage of pet-friendly rentals could be blamed primarily on concerns about damage to property. ""The protection of the property and the owner hasn't been there for owners to make their property available for pets,"" he said. ""I'm talking specifically about the damage a pet may cause to a property that a family without a pet may not cause. ""How does the agent manage that process — protect the property and protect the next guest from various occupational health and safety considerations?"" Dr Rand said many of the concerns about pets expressed by landlords were unfounded. ""There's some very good evidence from North America that pet owners stay a lot longer than non-pet owners,"" she said. ""They're no more likely to have their bond taken, whereas people with children on average caused $150 more damage for each rental. ""If they had 'pets are welcome' policies, the rental property was vacant for less time, there was less time spent marketing it, and concerns landlords raised about damage were not substantiated by research.""

495,Can you negatively gear an empty house?,house-and-home,"  Negative gearing: What you can and can't claim if your investment property is empty? New property developments are bursting out of the ground across Australia, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales. Australia has more than two million landlords yet despite the boom in new properties up for grabs, thousands are sitting empty. In Sydney alone, some 80,000 properties are vacant. Search our database to see which occupations are claiming the most negative gearing tax deductions. In taxation statistics from the Australian Taxation Office, the amount of net rental loss claims has decreased from the 2011-12 to 2013-14 financial years, while net rental incomes has increased. But according to property tax specialist Shukri Barbara, many foreign investors who have bought properties outright reap more benefits by leaving them empty. ""If you don't have a need for cash, and all you're doing is sinking your funds into an asset, then in the current economic environment in Australia, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, the markets are thriving and the values are thriving because of low interest rates,"" he told 702 ABC Sydney. ""Given the large number of developments, it's not surprising that, especially overseas people, leave them empty. ""If you don't need the cash ... you can leave it empty."" Negative gearing a property is possible when your rental expenses exceed your rental income. Those expenses come from items like loan interest, maintenance costs, strata fees, rates and taxes and insurance. People who negatively gear expect the house value to appreciate; that by taking a loss now, the house will sell for more than what they bought it for. If a home is left empty by choice and there is no rental income coming in, then you are unable to get a tax deduction from the government. If you try and claim rental losses when there is no revenue, Mr Barbara said that was when the Tax Office would put you on their radar. ""[ATO] will start putting in the query to do an audit,"" he said. ""They'll look at whether it's a genuine investment purchase. ""You have to demonstrate an effort that it is being put out for business."" Mr Barbara said if the property stood empty while you had it listed with a real estate agent in the process of looking for a tenant, all the expenses would be allowed for a tax deduction. He cited some of his clients in north Queensland who had been unable to find renters for their older property given a massive new development next door that was able to offer cheaper rent and newer premises. While the rental property remains vacant, the owners are still able to negatively gear that property. ""The concept is that you are in the business to make a profit out of rental,"" Mr Barbara said. If your holiday house is purely there for you to enjoy, then you can't claim it as a tax deduction, Mr Barbara said. However, if you make it available for short-term rentals and have it listed with an agent, then you are allowed to apportion the expenses for those periods. For example, if you stay in your beachside house for two weeks and rent it out to other holidaymakers for the rest of the year then you can claim a tax deduction on those 50 weeks.

496,Avocados 'caught in the crossfire' of home ownership debate,house-and-home," ABC Rural No such thing as bad publicity for avocado industry, amid row over home ownership The avocado industry is enjoying the new attention the fruit is getting, following accusations young Australians are being priced out of the property market because they spend too much money on brunch. ""I have seen young people order smashed avocado with crumbled feta on five-grain toasted bread at $22 a pop and more,"" KPMG partner and columnist Bernard Salt wrote in the Weekend Australian. ""I can afford to eat this for lunch because I am middle-aged and have raised my family. But how can young people afford to eat like this?"" It seems the avocado just can't cop a break at the moment. Earlier this year the fruit was criticised for being too expensive, when prices went up to $4 an avocado. John Tyas from Avocados Australia said the recent attack on avocados was completely unprovoked, but the industry was loving the attention nonetheless. ""I think it's fabulous, obviously avocados have been caught in the crossfire of this debate but we don't mind because it's good publicity,"" he said. Mr Tyas said Salt's comments were indicative of the fact consumers now see avocados as a weekly staple, rather than a luxury item. ""We are seeing people consume them all year round because they tick all the boxes, they're nutritious, delicious and versatile,"" he said. ""There are restaurants and cafes that are cashing in on the great demand for avocados. ""I think you can have your cake and eat it too, or should I say, have your home deposit and eat avocados too. ""Because if you can't afford to eat out, you can buy avocados cheaply at the greengrocer or supermarket and have it however you want."" Mr Tyas said there would be plenty of avocados on the market for the rest of the year, but supply might drop off again at the start of next year. ""It sort of happens in that January, February and March period where supply is lighter but at the moment we have plenty of product flowing through from Australia and New Zealand,"" he said. ""When you get seasonal hiccups, like rain, you need to stop harvesting and you get a slowdown, but there is still plenty of fruit between now and Christmas to come through the system."" During the past 20 years, Australia's avocado production has increased from 18,000 tonnes a year to nearly 68,500 tonnes in 2015. The high prices and demand encouraged farmers to plant more trees. ""There are lots of trees in the ground, but about 25 per cent of the trees in the ground are yet to come into their full production so there is big supply coming,"" Mr Tyas said. ""There are also new trees going in the ground every year, so I think in years to come there won't be any real concerns about a shortage of supply.""

497,"Dinosaurs, pencils and UFOs draw attention to quirky front yards",house-and-home,"  Dinosaurs, pencils and UFOs draw attention to quirky front yards in Bundaberg A house fence that mimics a set of coloured pencils is gaining a lot of attention in Bundaberg, Queensland. Phil and Marlies Oakley recently pulled down their ordinary picket fence to install an original and colourful addition to their front yard. The fence is about 15 metres wide and consists of 108 palings, all painted in the 36 colours of a set of pencils. Mr Oakley said the fence had been inspired by a visit to the Faber Castel pencil factory in Germany, where the couple spotted a small pencil fence. ""We saw this little fence and we thought maybe one day when we go home we'll paint our fence,"" Mr Oakley said. Two years later their fence started to fall apart, largely due to the floodwater that had inundated the home in North Bundaberg in 2013. To make the fence, Mr Oakley organised for fence palings to be cut into the shape of pencils. He then took a box of 36 pencils to his local hardware store to match the colours as closely as possible to sample pots. He spent six months painting the individual pencil palings in his garage each night after work. The pencil fence is not the first elaborate front yard in Bundaberg. Retired fisherman and artist John Olsen's front yard has been a West Bundaberg landmark for many years. A giant sculpture of a tyrannosaurus rex, standing three metres tall and five metres long, hovers over his front lawn. The sculpture, along with another dinosaur and an armoured knight, is made out of recycled metal that has been welded together. ""My lawn I don't mow very often, so I complement the natural growth of grass with metal creatures,"" Mr Olsen said. After making the sculptures and needing somewhere to keep them, Mr Olsen thought people might be interested in seeing them, so he put them in his front yard in the 1990s. ""You just put things in your front yard. I don't use pot plants, I just use metal dinosaurs,"" he said Tucked away in the outer suburbs of Bundaberg is another surprising front yard. Norm Barnett has built six UFO sculptures for his yard, one of which is nearly four metres wide. Mr Barnett said building the UFOs had been quite simple, as he scavenged the material from the Barcaldine tip, where he was living at the time. He said he wanted to make the UFO sculptures for his front yard because he had been lucky to see one. ""It was the size of a football field and you can laugh if you want to, but I know what I saw,"" he said. Mr Barnett said 40 other people had witnessed the UFO sighting with him in the caravan park he owned in St Helen's, Tasmania. ""It was an overcast night, and the clouds came apart and here it was straight above us,"" Mr Barnett said. ""You've got no idea, it really frightened us to see what it was. ""We would have seen it for half a minute or so and then the cloud came back over."" Mr Barnett said many people had not believed his story over the years, and this had been the catalyst for him to build the sculptures six years ago. ""I'm game enough to stand up for what I believe in and I know what I believe in is right,"" he said. Mr Barnett said he had another large dish in the backyard ready to be turned in to a UFO sculpture. The owners of the three gardens said they always received positive feedback about their front yards, with many visitors driving by to view their creations. ""There's any number of people that come by with their cameras,"" Mr Olsen said.

499,Fremantle looks at German model for developer-less apartments,house-and-home,"  Fremantle Council promotes German apartment construction model to bypass developers Fremantle Council wants to introduce a German model of housing development, allowing buyers to bypass developers and create tailor-made apartments. The council is selling off a 1,500-square-metre block close to Fremantle Park and the central shopping district. But rather than simply taking the highest bid for the land, the council has invited groups of prospective buyers who want to collectively build without the involvement of property developers or real estate agents to show their interest. Fremantle councillor Rachel Pemberton told 720 ABC Perth she hoped the city could facilitate a type of development that originated in Berlin called Baugruppen, which literally translates as building groups. ""It's people who get together in groups to build their own homes,"" she said. ""They don't want to live in a dog box, they want to have a place which is really liveable, with good outdoors spaces and quality architectural design. ""Unlike traditional housing cooperatives, the idea with this is that you do actually end up with a separate title at the end of it. ""It becomes a freehold property that you can buy and sell, but it's an innovative way to get it up off the ground and going."" In Berlin, one in 10 new apartments are now built under the Baugruppen model. ""When talking to people who have done this in Germany, what they find is that going through this whole process actually builds really strong community connections,"" Cr Pemberton said. Philip Griffiths, president of the WA chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects, has welcomed the move. He said the model could lead to superior designs with more innovative use of shared space. ""There is enormous flexibility, it's really up to the group. ""On agreement they might agree to pool some of the spaces that they don't use very much, like a laundry, and have a shared laundry overlooking a garden. ""You might have a four-bedroom apartment with two front doors and later on in life you can divide the apartment off to become two apartments and there's an income source in your old age."" Bypassing the profit motivations of property developers could also lead to savings for buyers. A 2015 study by Melbourne's Swinburne University of Technology found apartment buyers could save up to 30 per cent by collectively developing themselves. But whether banks are willing to finance this model, which is untested in Australia, remains to be seen. A 2014 attempt by Melbourne residents and architects to pool their deposits to build hit a snag when none of the four banks they approached were willing to lend. Cr Pemberton said proposals to council would be accepted for several months. ""We realise that getting 10 or 20 people together who are actually willing to put money on the line and sign up will take a little longer,"" she said. ""We have seen it work in other parts of the world so there is no reason it should fail here. ""We have to try and work out how to do it."" Potential Baugruppen collectives have until December 5 to submit their proposal to council.
